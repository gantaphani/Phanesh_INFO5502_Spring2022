introduction 
in this appeal we discuss the differing purposes of the workers compensation law and the respondeat superior doctrine of vicarious employer liability.we hold that the commercial traveler rule of workers compensation law may not be incorporated into the respondeat superior doctrine.
in workers compensation law,a worker is covered,without regard to fault,if the activity which injures the employee arises out of and in the course of the employment.the commercial traveler rule provides that during the period an employee travels on the employer business,the employee is within the course of employment,which includes the activities of obtaining food and shelter.
by contrast,the respondeat superior doctrine makes an employer vicariously liable for an employee torts committed within the scope of employment.if the employee commits the tort while engaged in purely private purposes,however,such private conduct is outside the scope of employment and can not form the basis for an employer respondeat superior liability.
in this case,the injuries to plaintiffs were allegedly caused by an employee of defendant corporation,as the employee pursued the purely private activity of buying food at a restaurant.plaintiffs argue that because that employee was in california pursuant to his employer temporary work assignment,this court should borrow the commercial traveler rule from workers compensation law and apply it to the respondeat superior doctrine to hold the corporation vicariously liable for its employee alleged tort.as we will explain,the differing purposes of workers compensation law and the respondeat superior doctrine do not permit incorporation of the commercial traveler rule into respondeat superior vicarious liability.
procedural history 
in a june,complaint against defendant ali mazloom,plaintiff kristi sunderland alleged a cause of action for negligence and robert sunderland alleged a cause of action for loss of consortium.the complaint arose from an automobile collision in lancaster,california,on june.plaintiffs later amended their complaint to add mazloom employer,lockheed martin aeronautical systems support company lmassc,as a defendant.
the trial court granted lmassc motion for summary judgment and entered judgment for lmassc on december.plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.

between and on june,while mazloom and kristi sunderland waited in the lane at an burger restaurant in lancaster,california,mazloom vehicle collided with the rear of sunderland vehicle.
on the date of the collision,lmassc,a lockheed martin corporation subsidiary,employed mazloom as a field service representative.headquartered in marietta,georgia,lmassc provides technical field support to government and military customers which own and operate aircraft manufactured by lockheed martin corporation.lmassc employs field service representatives,such as mazloom,throughout the world where customers personnel and aircraft are located.between assignments,field service representatives work in marietta,georgia.
mazloom was assigned to provide technical field support to lmassc military customer at edwards air force base.on may,mazloom left marietta,georgia and drove his vehicle to lancaster,california,arriving on may.expecting to work at edwards air force base for several months,mazloom rented a furnished apartment in lancaster and moved in on june.mazloom job required him to perform all work at the base where aircraft were located and where he could work with other lmassc and customer personnel.mazloom and other lmassc personnel had office space on the base,and mazloom was not required to work away from edwards air force base.
on june,lmassc cut short mazloom field assignment to edwards air force base and notified him he would start a field assignment in australia in mid to late july.on his last work day at edwards air force base on june,mazloom worked until,clearing out his office and coordinating with other lmassc personnel.he then drove to his lancaster apartment and spent the afternoon packing and terminating the rental of that apartment.in the evening,mazloom drove to his residence in lancaster to visit and say goodbye.after leaving his residence,mazloom drove to the burger restaurant to buy some food for dinner.in the lane,mazloom vehicle collided with the rear of plaintiff kristi sunderland vehicle,which was ahead of him in line.mazloom and sunderland exchanged information.mazloom then picked up his food,drove to his apartment,and ate his food.mazloom owns his vehicle.lmassc has no ownership interest in his vehicle.
mazloom left lancaster on june,to drive to marietta,georgia.mazloom field assignment at edwards air force base concluded when he arrived in marietta,georgia on july.
while working at edwards air force base,mazloom made his own lodging arrangements.lmassc reimbursed mazloom lodging cost in lancaster and paid mazloom a per diem allowance for food and incidental expenses,because lmassc assumes that field service representatives incur higher costs working and living away from their georgia residences.lmassc permits field representatives to use their own vehicles for travel to field assignments,in part to enable them to have personal transportation while on a field assignment.mazloom drove his vehicle to california,drove it while he lived in lancaster and worked at edwards air force base,and drove it back to marietta,georgia.lmassc paid mazloom a mileage allowance for the trip from marietta to lancaster,and for the return trip from lancaster to marietta,but did not pay mazloom a mileage or transportation allowance for his use of his vehicle while he lived in lancaster and commuted to work at edwards air force base.
the trial court found that the evidence showed that on the evening of june,mazloom was involved only in personal activities and was not acting in the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.therefore lmassc was not vicariously liable for the accident under the respondeat superior doctrine.
plaintiffs claim that the commercial traveler rule of worker compensation should be applied to expand the definition of the scope of the employment required for application of the respondeat superior doctrine.
discussion 
plaintiffs argue that the commercial traveler rule of the workers compensation system should be applied in this case to expand the definition of the scope of the employment under the respondeat superior doctrine.as we articulate,the statutory workers compensation system and the common law tort doctrine of respondeat superior differ significantly.no authority supports application of the commercial traveler rule to create respondeat superior liability we conclude that the commercial traveler rule of workers compensation law does not apply to this appeal.
