in this case we hold that penal code section,subdivision b section b is a specific intent crime.defendant anita beatriz blick appeals the judgment and sentence imposed following her conviction premised on this section blick contends she was denied due process of law by the trial court section b instruction,which allegedly described that count as a strict liability offense not requiring proof of a culpable mental state the trial court erred by failing to instruct sua sponte on mistake of fact as a defense on the section b count.we vacate the judgment and remand.
factual procedural background 
medical history and treatment 
in january,blick fell during her shift as a police dispatcher for the town of atherton.she injured her knee and strained her calf muscles.blick visited stephen conrad,an orthopedic surgeon and her treating physician from,reporting pain in her right knee and episodes in which the knee buckled,causing her to fall.on july,conrad performed arthroscopic surgery in an attempt to stabilize the knee and indicated blick should remain off work because modified duty was unavailable.blick went back to work in november,but left again after only three days.she told conrad she could not do her job because she experienced too much knee pain rising from her chair repeatedly throughout the day.blick continued to report knee pain and buckling episodes,so conrad carried out a second surgery in february to realign the kneecap.on april,blick told conrad she could not begin physical therapy sessions due to transportation problems,so conrad agreed she should continue exercising at home.
blick returned to work around july,under modified conditions and reported no problems when she saw conrad in september.blick next saw conrad on october,and reported two episodes of her knee giving way and continued pain in the right knee.conrad told blick to remain off work,and on november,wrote a report stating blick condition was permanent and stationary,meaning her condition was not improving and not expected to improve.conrad report indicated blick was unable to continue her job as a dispatcher and recommended vocational rehabilitation.
in march,conrad received a letter from cities group,the town of atherton worker compensation benefits provider,stating the town would provide modified working conditions in order to allow a return to work.at blick request,conrad wrote back to the cities group stating she could not return to work even under modified conditions because she was unable to drive or use public transportation.
on april,blick saw baciocco because conrad was on vacation.conrad subsequently learned blick had returned to work on march,but had suffered another fall on april.blick was kept off work and baciocco note indicated blick was presently walking with the aid of crutches on april,blick visited conrad with a letter from her attorney requesting a statement blick was unable to drive or use public transportation.conrad provided the statement because he believed blick when she said she could not drive or use public transportation.according to conrad notes,blick continued to experience knee pain and use crutches in may and june of.
blick returned to work again under modified conditions on july.on july,blick told baciocco prolonged sitting caused pain and swelling in the knee and she did not feel she could return to work.on september,conrad wrote to the cities group stating blick continued to experience considerable discomfort in the knee,a return to work under even modified conditions was contraindicated,and blick was considered totally and permanently disabled.
when conrad saw blick in december,she reported the pain in the knee had become worse and she was still using crutches.in march,she reported she was using crutches when outdoors and a cane indoors.in september,he provided an assessment of blick disability to the cities group.his assessment of total disability was based on blick preclusion from prolonged standing or walking and her necessary use of crutches.
in subsequent visits to conrad in december,and march and june,blick reported she had experienced episodes of her knee giving way as well as persistent knee pain.also she continued to use crutches and maintain her swimming program.during visits to conrad in september,december,march,and may,blick reported the knee remained painful and periodically buckled under her,and that she continued to use crutches.
in august,blick reported a slight improvement,she was swimming twice a day,and had started using a cane rather than two crutches,but the knee still occasionally gave way.in november,blick reported ongoing knee pain,the knee had twice dislocated,she was no longer swimming,and she was walking with use of crutches.in march,blick knee pain persisted,she continued to walk with crutches,and conrad noted she remains permanent and stationary,meaning her ability to function at work had not changed.in june,blick knee remained painful,she continued to use a cane or crutch,but informed conrad she had purchased an uplift device to assist her in rising from a seated position.conrad indicated in his notes her worker compensation case was close to resolution and it may be possible for blick to return to some form of modified duty.as of june,it was conrad understanding blick was using a cane or a crutch all the time she was moving around outdoors and he thought her level of disability was the same as it had been in.
conrad next saw blick on march.blick indicated she had improved but still experienced persistent right knee pain.she was beginning to walk without the continual use of crutches but had experienced one episode of falling.conrad noted blick was becoming less dependent on assistive devices,but was still under the impression blick was using crutches the majority of the time.in march,conrad was also under the impression blick could not drive and noted her husband had driven her to the appointment.
b.the surveillance tapes 
the cities group hired private investigators to secretly videotape blick engaging in various activities.blick was placed under surveillance on december,february,march,and november.the video tapes were received in evidence and viewed by the jury.
the december tape shows blick placing small rocks along a pathway.blick is shown stooping and bending over at the waist,with her knees bent.at times she goes down on one knee.the february video shows blick driving her truck.the march tape shows blick working in her garden for over two hours.blick is shown walking up and down slopes without the use of a cane or crutches while carrying out a variety of tasks.she is seen stooping,digging with the use of her upper body,lifting bags of potting soil,watering,raking and sweeping.she is seen driving off in her truck around noon.later that same day,she is shown in the medical building on her way to see conrad,walking with the use of crutches.blick is shown walking with the assistance of crutches as she leaves the building.
criminal proceedings 
an amended information filed on march,charged blick as follows count a knowingly false or fraudulent material statement or representation for the purpose of obtaining compensation,in violation of insurance code section,subdivision a count theft,in violation of penal code section,subdivision a count or knowingly failing to disclose the occurrence of an event affecting the continued right to receive an insurance benefit,in violation of section,subdivision b.the town of atherton through the cities group claimed total losses of,including the cost of the investigative process and attorney fees.
trial began with opening statements on september,and closing arguments were delivered on october.at trial,blick testified she never lied to conrad,never misstated her condition,exaggerated her pain,or told him she could not do something unless she really believed she could not do it.she also testified she never hid her gardening activities from conrad or any other physician.further,blick testified she only failed to disclose to conrad on march,that she was driving again because the issue never came up and she did not think it important and not because she was trying to hide that from him.blick stated she had no intent to obtain any more benefits than those to which she was entitled,and denied concealing or failing to disclose the occurrence of any event she believed would affect her entitlement to insurance benefits.several witnesses gave corroborating testimony concerning blick knee pain and use of assistive devices,as well as evidence of blick reputation for honesty.conrad,however,testified that after viewing the surveillance tapes he was no longer able to back her on her assertion that she was unable to work.
on october,the jury returned not guilty verdicts on counts one and two,and a verdict of guilty on count three,concealing or failing to disclose an event that affects entitlement to benefits.on january,the trial court sentenced blick to a period of five years supervised probation with various conditions,including days in county jail.blick filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
trial court section b instruction 
section b states in pertinent part it is unlawful to c onceal or knowingly fail to disclose the occurrence of,an event that affects any person initial or continued right or entitlement to any insurance benefit or payment,or the amount of any benefit or payment to which the person is entitled.b.the trial court instructed the jury on this offense as follows the defendant is accused in count three of having violated section b of the penal code.every person who,with the specific intent to do so,conceals or knowingly fails to disclose the occurrence of an event that affects any person initial or continued right or entitlement to any insurance benefit or payment or the amount of any benefit or payment to which the person is entitled is guilty of a violation of section b of the penal code.in order to prove this crime,each of the following elements must be proved a person,with the specific intent to do so,concealed or knowingly failed to disclose the occurrence of an event that affects any person initial or continued right or entitlement to any insurance benefit or payment or the amount of any benefit or payment to which the person is entitled.italics added.
according to blick,the trial court instruction construed section b as a strict liability offense which did not require a specific intent to defraud,or an intent or purpose of affecting any insurance benefit,or knowledge that the event would or could affect benefits.blick asserts section b is not a strict liability offense.therefore,according to blick,the trial court section b instruction violated her right to due process because it failed to tell the jurors they had to find a culpable mental state before they could convict her of the offense.specifically,blick contends the mental state required for a section b offense is the intent to defraud.the trial court failure to include this element in the section b instruction,blick continues,deprived her of a good faith belief defense to the charge,meaning the jury could convict her by finding she intentionally conceal ed or fail ed to disclose something that turned out to affect her worker compensation even if the concealment was done in the innocent belief that what she did not disclose was irrelevant to her worker compensation status.blick also asserts the alleged error was prejudicial.before addressing these contentions in detail,we first review key events during the jury instruction conference and reading of the instructions.
before trial,blick submitted points and authorities in support of her special jury instructions.special jury instruction stated it is a defense to the allegation of intent to defraud that the accused acted in the good faith belief that his or her representations were true.blick argued special instruction applies as written to count as well as count.blick did not argue special instruction applied to count the section b offense.
after both sides had rested at trial,the trial court conferred with counsel to settle jury instructions.the trial court stated the way i have found it successful to do this is to go off the record while i reading through them,and we can go back on the record any time you want to make any arguments no argument was received on caljic concurrence of act and specific intent,which the trial court gave in the modified form requested by both parties.as given,caljic read in the crimes charged in counts one,two and three there must exist a union or joint operation of act or conduct and a certain specific intent in the mind of the perpetrator.unless this specific intent exists the crime to which it relates is not committed.the specific intent required is included in the definitions of the crimes set forth elsewhere in these instructions.caljic intent to was given at the people request,over defense objection,modified as follows an intent to defraud is an intent to deceive another person for the purpose of gaining some material advantage over that person or to induce that person to part with money or to alter the person position to its injury and to accomplish that purpose by some false statement,false representation of fact,wrongful concealment or suppression of truth,or by any other artifice or act designed to deceive.also,the parties discussed blick special instruction as follows 
court okay.i will give that.and for purposes of having it typed downstairs,i will strike the defendant special instruction,take out the brackets of the title.i just make it her representations.is that all right silence,stony silence.i will take that as a yes.requested by the defendant.objection by the people.given as modified.
prosecutor your honor,could i get a clarification on defense special instruction,the defense to the intent to defraud.can i get a clarification as to whether that applies simply to counts one and two,which has sic the wording intent to defraud within them,as opposed to count three,which does not 
defense i think the says it goes to counts one and two.
prosecutor can we add that 
court we might say this is a defense to an allegation of intent to defraud.
defense and the insurance code.
court i sorry 
defense i think count two is the insurance code.
prosecutor count one is the insurance code count two is the grand theft.
defense so it applies to counts one and two.
prosecutor can we say in counts one and two,comma,it is a defense 
court yes,that fine.
subsequently,the following colloquy took place as the trial court was reading the section b instruction to the jury after closing arguments 
court in order to prove this crime,each of the following elements must be proved one.a person concealed or knowingly failed to disclose the occurrence of an event that affects any person initial or continued right or entitlement to any insurance benefit or payment or the amount of any benefit or payment to which the person is entitled.we missing something here.
prosecutor no.
court where is the specific intent 
prosecutor it not specific intent.
court i beg your pardon 
prosecutor it not specific.
court you told,it has to be.we take a short recess jury exits.what the specific intent supposed to be 
prosecutor the act of concealing or knowingly fail to disclose.that the intent.
court wait a minute.how about this though every person who,with the specific intent to do so,conceals or knowingly fails to disclose.
defense yes.that works.
prosecutor that fine.
court you understand why we have to do this because earlier we told them it was going to be defined ultimately we had to have the statement made somewhere.
prosecutor i understand that.
defense so it going to read how,judge 
court okay.every person who,with the specific intent to do so,conceals or knowingly fails.in other words,we just inserting who with the specific intent to do so.okay 
defense yes.
prosecutor yes.
blick contention the trial court section b instruction described a strict liability offense is simply wrong.the trial court clearly understood that specific intent was required and went to great effort to define a mental state for the offense.strict liability offenses,otherwise termed public welfare offenses,are generally regulatory offenses,not common law crimes,are classified as malum prohibitum rather than malum in se,and are punishable despite the absence of criminal intent in any of the accepted senses.witkin epstein,law ed.elements,people rubalcava cal th,d,rubalcava strict liability offenses completely eliminate the requirement of a guilty mind with respect to an element of a crime but in general intent crime guilty mind is shown by defendant knowing and intentional participation in the proscribed act.thus,strict liability offenses include illegal sales of intoxicating liquor,sales of impure or adulterated food or drugs,sales of misbranded articles,violations of traffic regulations,and violations of general police regulations,passed for the safety,health or of the community.witkin epstein,law,supra,elements,at.section b is not such a regulatory offense.additionally,t he prevailing trend in the law is against imposing criminal liability without proof of some mental state where the statute does not evidence the legislature intent to impose strict liability.citations.in re jennings cal th,d,nonetheless concluding at,d,that statute prohibiting sale of alcoholic beverages to minors is a strict liability offense.
here,the record shows there was some confusion about whether the intent required for the section b offense was general or specific.our supreme court has described the difference between general and specific intent crimes as follows when the definition of a crime consists of only the description of a particular act,without reference to intent to do a further act or achieve a future consequence,we ask whether the defendant intended to do the proscribed act.this intention is deemed to be a general criminal intent.when the definition refers to defendant intent to do some further act or achieve some additional consequence,the crime is deemed to be one of specific intent.citation.rubalcava,supra,cal th at,d.in rubalcava,the court held the unlawful carrying of a concealed dirk or dagger under section,subdivision a,does not have a specific intent requirement.id.at,d.in so holding,the court concluded the relevant language of section is unambiguous and establishes that carrying a concealed dirk or dagger does not require an intent to use the concealed instrument as a stabbing weapon.id.at,d,italics added.use of the instrument would have been a further act or additional consequence contemplated by the possessor but not called for under the the court deemed the crime one of general,not specific,intent.ibid.in contrast to the statute at issue in rubalcava,section b does impliedly contemplate a future obtaining of benefits to which the applicant is not it is a specific intent crime.
the trial court justifiably was confused by the prosecution position that the crime was one of general intent,because the prosecution had agreed that caljic specific intent instruction applied to all three counts.while reading the instructions to the jury,the trial court realized the section b instruction did not define the specific intent required to complete the offense.at that point,the prosecutor tried to assert that section b offense was a general intent crime.after the jury was excused,the trial court resolved the issue by instructing that the specific intent required was the specific intent to conceal or knowingly fail to disclose the occurrence of an event affecting the right to insurance benefits.however,the trial court instruction merely adds specific intent language to the proscribed of concealing or knowingly failing to disclose an event affecting insurance benefits thus precluding the criminalization of an inadvertent or accidental or concealment.the court defined a specific intent for the crime,but it was not the correct specific intent 
blick contends the jury should have been instructed the further act or additional consequence required to commit the section b offense is an intent to defraud.the attorney general,on the other hand,asserts the jury was not required to find the intent to defraud because a section b offense is a general intent crime for which no specific intent is required.the parties cite no precedent,nor have we found any,specifically holding what criminal intent is required for a violation of this section.therefore,we must resolve whether section b describes a general or a specific intent crime.
when construing a statute,the language of the statute is generally the most reliable indicator of the legislature intent.people hudson cal th,d.accordingly,we look first to the words of the statute,giving them their ordinary meaning and construing them in context.if the language is unambiguous,we presume the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute controls.citations.ibid.however,if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.citation.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.citation.torres parkhouse tire service,cal th,d.
the attorney general,quoting rubalcava,supra,cal th at,d,asserts that on its face section b describes a general intent crime because it merely requires that the defendant do the prescribed act,but does not have any requirement that the defendant intend to achieve some additional consequence.however,that interpretation of the statute,fails to recognize the aim of the section to criminalize acts that attempt to defraud insurers.it also fails to consider section b in the context of section as a whole.people allen th,d construing phrase as a whole as an integral part of the whole code section and in relation to other statutes on the same subject,so as to harmonize the whole law.
we conclude that to violate subsection b a person,in addition to concealing or knowingly failing to disclose,must intend to obtain benefits to which he or she would not be entitled if they had made the disclosure.in short,the person must intend to commit a fraud.people counts th,d fraud is the inducement of a party to part with property by reason of false pretenses and representations people booth th,d element of specific intent to defraud is more rigorous than the concept of knowingly and includes the latter it means an intent to deceive another person or to induce that person to part with property or to alter that person position to its injury or risk,and to accomplish that purpose by some false statement,false representation of fact,wrongful concealment or suppression of truth,or by any other artifice or act designed to deceive.earlier cases have held that an essential element of the fraud offenses described in section is an intention to defraud.people scofield d.scofield people benson d.benson,overruled on other grounds in people perez cal d.the clear import of section is to criminalize the making of false or fraudulent claims the ultimate objective of which is to obtain benefits to which the offender is not entitled,subd.a knowingly presenting any false or fraudulent claim for the payment of a loss or injury a knowingly presenting multiple claims for the same loss or injury with an intent to defraud a knowingly causing a vehicle accident for the purpose of presenting any false or fraudulent claim a knowingly presenting multiple claims for payment of the same health care benefit with an intent to defraud.furthermore,when section is considered as a whole,we note subdivision c sets forth the penalty for a violation of subsection b subdivision c provides that violation of b is a felony punishable by,or years in state prison,and that the fine for any violation may be up to or double the amount of the fraud whichever is greater.id.italics added in short,fraud is integral to the offense.
furthermore,as this court noted in an earlier case,the law imputes the intent to defraud in penal code.people dieguez th,d a specific intent to defraud may be an implied element in a criminal statute making unla
