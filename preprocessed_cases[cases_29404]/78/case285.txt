plaintiff jeffrey louis appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment on his claims for disclosure of documents by the department of labor department under the privacy act,and the freedom of information act foia,louis contends a system of records from which he sought information about himself was improperly exempted by the department pursuant to subsection k of the privacy act,k,because the department did not comply with the rulemaking procedures of the administrative procedure act apa in exempting the system.louis further contends that the department belated reliance on subsection d of the privacy act,d,which exempts from disclosure any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding,is improper rationalization for the department decision to withhold information because it did not assert this exemption during the administrative proceedings.
we hold that the department failed to follow the apa rulemaking procedures for designating its system of records as exempt,and therefore can not rely on this exemption to withhold documents from louis.however,because an agency withholding of information under the privacy act is reviewed de novo by the district court,we hold that the department may rely on d to withhold documents that were compiled in anticipation of litigation,even though it raised this provision for the first time before the district court.because the department description of the withheld documents demonstrates that each falls within the scope of subsection d,we affirm the judgment of the district court as to louis privacy act claims.
from to,jeffrey louis was employed as a podiatric surgeon with the department of veterans affairs.he claims to have become disabled as a result of his employment,and thus filed for disability workers compensation in.for reasons not completely explained in the record and beyond the scope of the current appeal,that claim is still pending before the office of workers compensation programs owcp within the department of labor 
after a series of agency decisions and appeals,one of which was to this court louis made a series of privacy act requests to the department of labor between august,and october.the department eventually denied access to the records in a letter decision,stating that all of the requested records were exempt from disclosure under the privacy act,indirectly relying on k as grounds for exemption of the system of records in which the documents were located.the agency then released some documents under foia,but continued to assert that a subset of the documents were exempt from disclosure under exemption of foia,which covers privileged and attorney materials.the parties agree that this letter constitutes the agency original partial denial of louis requests.
louis appealed this initial decision to the solicitor of labor.the reviewing officer again determined that all of the information sought by louis was contained in the system of records,a system which had been designated as an exempt system under k.specifically,the reviewing officer explained that the system of records had been properly exempted from disclosure by the agency,citing to the federal register,in which the department purportedly gave notice of the exemption.see notices,april.the officer further explained that because the records sought by louis were located in sol files maintained for the purposes of defending the department of labor in law suits and claims filed against it,they were prepared for a law enforcement purpose,and were therefore exempt from disclosure.the reviewing officer went on to determine that some additional documents should be disclosed under foia,but still withheld certain groups of documents under exemptions internal procedures and privilege and work product of foia.b b.
louis then filed a complaint in district court challenging the agency reliance on the k exemption of the privacy act and exemptions and of foia.when the plaintiff began serving discovery requests on the department,the department moved for a protective order.louis moved to compel the requested discovery,seeking to obtain discovery related to the designation of the database as an exempt system and the department methodology in searching for responsive documents.during the pendency of these motions,the department filed its motion for summary judgment,arguing that the database had been properly exempted from disclosure under the privacy act by promulgation of an agency rule.in the alternative,the department argued for the first time that the requested information was properly withheld pursuant to d.in his for summary judgment,louis submitted a list specifically identifying fifteen documents sought under the privacy act.the district court granted the department motion for a protective order,thereby prohibiting any discovery,and directed the parties to proceed with briefing the for summary judgment.
louis filed a motion for a continuance under federal rule of civil procedure f,seeking much of the same discovery he had moved for in his motion to compel.the district court denied the rule f motion and granted the department motion for summary judgment.the court held both that the system of records in which the requested information was located had been properly exempted from disclosure under the privacy act by administrative rule,and that disclosure of the records was barred under subsection d of the privacy act the court specifically found that the rule promulgated by the department was valid.
because louis brought this suit under the privacy act and the freedom of information act,and,respectively,jurisdiction was proper in the district court pursuant to.we have jurisdiction under over this direct appeal of a final judgment of the district court.our review of the district court grant of summary judgment under the privacy act is de novo.rose united states,cir see also g.we also review de novo determinations regarding the scope of the and publication requirements of the apa.natural res.def.council,evans,cir.
the privacy act of requires each agency that maintains a system of records to provide access to an individual record or to any information pertaining to him by that individual.d.however,the act specifically provides that nothing in this section shall allow an individual access to any information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.id.d.in addition,the act provides a mechanism by which an agency may promulgate rules in accordance with the apa in order to exempt certain system s of records within the agency from disclosure.id.k.relevant to the present appeal,agencies may under most circumstances exempt systems that consist of investigatory material compiled for law enforcement purposes.id.k.
louis argues that the department rule exempting the system of records did not follow the apa procedures and is therefore invalid,and that the dol can not rely on d because the final agency determination did not rely on this section.we address each of these arguments in turn.
exemption by rule pursuant to k 
louis argues that the agency never properly invoked subsection k because it did not appropriately give notice of a proposed rulemaking in accordance with the requirements of the apa,as incorporated at a k.specifically,louis argues that the department did not properly publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in accordance with b,and did not properly solicit public comment in accordance with c.
section b of the apa requires a notice of proposed rulemaking to include 
a statement of the time,place,and nature of public rulemaking proceedings 
reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed and 
either the terms or the substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.
b.in turn,section c requires in pertinent part 
after notice required by this section,the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.after consideration of the relevant matter presented,the agency shall incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.
sufficiency of the department notice 
subsection e of the privacy act requires each agency that maintains a system of records to publish information pertaining to each system,including the system name,the categories of individuals covered by the system,the categories of records contained within the system,routine uses for the records,and policies and practices regarding storage,retrieval and access to records.id.e a i.e does not require or suggest that the agency include in its notice whether a particular system of records is exempt from disclosure.
in april of,the department published an updated notice of all systems of records entitled publication in full of all notices of systems of records including several new systems publication of proposed routine uses.at.that notice,which unequivocally states that it was published in accordance with subsection e of the privacy act,contained the required information for scores of systems of records maintained by the department.id.at.yet nowhere in its introductory section does the notice mention that the agency is proposing to exempt certain systems from disclosure.id.at.instead,in the description of certain individual systems,the department included a statement that the system was exempt from disclosure under the privacy act,citing the statutory provision relied upon and giving a justification for the exemption.for example,with respect to the database at issue in the present appeal,the agency stated 
system exempted from certain provision of the act 
under the specific exemption authority provided by k,this system is exempt from the following provisions of the privacy act d disclosure of information could enable the subject of the record to take action to escape prosecution and could avail the subject greater access to information than that already provided under rules of discovery.in addition,disclosure of information might lead to intimidation of witnesses,informants,or their families,and impair future investigations by making it more difficult to collect similar information.
in general,the notice and comment provisions of the apa require an agency to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking,then allow for comment before publishing a final rule that includes a discussion of the comments received.see tour brokers united states,rejecting procedure of publishing final rule with opportunity for reconsideration.th e requirement is designed to give interested persons,through written submissions and oral presentations,an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.erringer thompson,cir quoting chief prob.officers of cal.shalala,cir.the test for sufficiency of the notice is whether the notice fairly apprise s interested persons of the subjects and issues before the agency.natural res.def.council epa,cir quoting natural res.def.council epa,cir.a n interested member of the public should be able to read the published notice of an application and understand the essential attributes of that application and should not have to guess the agency true intent.state of california ex rel.lockyer ferc,cir noting connection between due process clause and notice provisions.
with these basic principles in mind,we conclude that the notice in this case was insufficient.while it is true that each of the components of section b are technically present in the federal register notice published by the department,the presentation of the information obscures the intent of the agency and allows for broad exemption of records systems through the back door.rather than a notice of proposed rule,the department notice was simply entitled notices,with a subtitle reading,privacy act of publication in full of all notices of systems of records including several new systems publication of proposed routine uses.see.at.everything about the title and introductory paragraphs of the notice indicates that the department is simply complying with subsection e of the privacy act id.nothing in those sections indicates that the agency proposes to exempt systems from access.this omission allows potentially controversial subject of entire systems of records from public disclosure go unnoticed buried deep in a publication generally describing existing systems and their contents.we can not say that an interested member of the public would be able to read the published notice and understand its essential attributes.see state of california ex rel.lockyer,at.indeed,a member of the public would likely read the first few pages of this document and conclude that this was a simple disclosure made by the department pursuant to e,not a proposed rule exempting certain records systems from disclosure.
while we have yet to address the sufficiency of a notice of proposed rulemaking in a factual context substantially similar to that presented in the present case,we note that cases from at least two other circuits are instructive to our analysis and support our view.in mclouth steel products thomas,the circuit stressed the importance of a notice heading and summary in alert ing a reader to the stakes.id.at.in that case,the court held that the epa failure to mention its use of a particular diagnostic model to evaluate potentially hazardous wastes in the summary of the proposed rule rendered its notice inadequate as to its use of that model.see also donovan,holding rule invalid where no notice given of an important change between proposed and final rule some changes to rule were highlighted in the notice of proposed rulemaking,giving impression that only highlighted portions had been selected for change.
similarly,in american iron and steel institute epa,cir,the third circuit declared a rule invalid where the notice of proposed rulemaking failed to indicate that the proposed rule would apply to steelmaking,as opposed to other processes involved in iron and steel manufacturing.id.at.the court specifically determined that such a defect in the notice of proposed rulemaking rendered it ineffective at enabling an interested person to make comments which could assist the agency in formulating the regulations.id.
again,in the present case the department notice only indicates that it is publishing information about hundreds of systems of records,with a few additions and deletions.the introductory sections of the notice speak of compliance with subsection e of the privacy act,and indicate that there have been changes to the universe of systems,but do not refer to subsection k and do not mention exemptions at all.under these circumstances,we conclude that the department notice was insufficient in that it does not fairly apprise interested persons of the subjects and issues before the agency.see natural res.def.council,at.
comment period requirement 
louis next argues that the department failed to comply with the requirements of c of the apa because the notice failed to give a meaningful opportunity to comment on the exemption of records systems.c.this argument flows directly from the improper notice given by the agency.although the notice invited comment on newly published systems and on the proposed routine uses,both universal and specific.at,there was no specific invitation to comment on the exemption of systems from disclosure.the department thus never afforded itself the opportunity to educate itself on the full range of interests the rule affects with respect to the exempted systems.see alcaraz block,cir see also pac.coast european conference united states,cir.in short,the department did not comply with the comment provision of the apa.
in summary,subsection k of the privacy act by its text requires that a rule be promulgated in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of the apa.we hold that mere notice of an agency invocation of subsection k to exempt information from the act disclosure requirements,when published under headings indicating that the purpose of the publication is compliance with a routine reporting requirement of the statute,is insufficient to constitute the kind of notice of proposed rulemaking and invitation to comment required by the apa.exemption from the privacy act fundam
