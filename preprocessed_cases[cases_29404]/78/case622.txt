the issue in this case is whether an employee can have more than one employer for purposes of the workers compensation act and its exclusive remedy provision we conclude that there can be more than one employer,and that the trial court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of wingfoot enterprises tandem staffing tandem,a temporary staffing provider that employed marleny alvarado.because the court of appeals concluded otherwise,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that alvarado take nothing.
tandem is in the business of providing temporary general labor to various industrial companies tandem had an oral agreement to provide temporary workers to web assembly.under the agreement,tandem had sole responsibility for all aspects of hiring,screening,and terminating employees sent to web.tandem was also responsible for paying the employees salaries,unemployment taxes,social security taxes,and for withholding federal income taxes.however,there was no express agreement regarding workers compensation coverage for the temporary employees.there was evidence that web assumed that tandem fees were sufficient to cover the cost of workers compensation insurance.
tandem gave its employees details about their job assignments at web and provided basic safety equipment and training.tandem also had supervisors at web to check employees in,to get them started working promptly,to issue them proper safety equipment,and to monitor their breaks and lunch hours.web supervised the specific tasks performed by the temporary employees,but tandem retained the right to determine which employees would perform a particular task for web,could substitute a different employee to perform a particular task,and could reassign an employee to another task.
tandem hired marleny alvarado and,shortly thereafter,assigned her to do manual assembly work at web manufacturing facility.web,however,assigned alvarado to operate a staking or stamping machine.it was against tandem policy for its workers to operate industrial machinery,a policy of which alvarado was aware.alvarado did not notify tandem about this job assignment or that the job was unsuitable or unsafe,as she was required to do,but there was evidence that tandem supervisor knew alvarado was operating the machine.about two days after alvarado began working at web facility,the tips of three of her fingers were severed while she was operating the machine.
at the time of alvarado injury,tandem maintained workers compensation insurance coverage for alvarado and its other employees.web also had workers compensation insurance coverage for its employees.alvarado applied for and received workers compensation benefits under tandem policy,but she subsequently sued tandem,claiming that it was negligent and grossly negligent in a number of ways,alleging generally that tandem failed to properly train and supervise her,warn her of dangers,and provide her with a safe workplace.alvarado also sued web.
tandem moved for summary judgment under both rule c and i arguing,among other things,that there was no evidence to support alvarado claims or,alternatively,that the texas workers compensation act exclusive remedy provision barred alvarado claims because tandem was alvarado employer or at the time she was injured.the day before trial,the trial court granted both of tandem motions for summary judgment without stating its reasons.the trial court did not sever tandem from the case,but proceeded with a jury trial only on alvarado claims against web.tandem did not participate in the trial.the jury found that alvarado was web borrowed employee at the time she was injured.the charge instructed the jury that o ne who would otherwise be in the general employment of one employer is a borrowed employee of another employer if such other employer or his agents have the right to direct and control the details of the particular work inquired about.because web had workers compensation coverage,the trial court rendered final judgment in its favor based on the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act that same judgment also made the prior summary judgments granted in favor of tandem final,resulting in a judgment against alvarado.
alvarado appealed the summary judgment in favor of tandem,but did not appeal the judgment in favor of web.the court of appeals affirmed the summary judgment on alvarado gross negligence claim,but reversed the judgment on alvarado negligence claim,holding that there is some evidence to support that claim with regard to tandem contention that it is entitled to the protection of the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act,the court of appeals concluded that an injured worker can have only one employer for workers compensation purposes and found there is a fact question as to whether tandem or web was alvarado employer at the time she was injured,precluding summary judgment in tandem favor in so holding,the court of appeals applied a right to control test and found that there is some evidence that both tandem and web had the right to control alvarado work when she was injured because alvarado did not appeal the adverse jury finding that she was web borrowed employee and because tandem was not a party to the trial of that issue,the court of appeals did not address the jury finding.
tandem filed a petition for review in this court,reasserting both the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act and,alternatively,the contention that there is no evidence that it was negligent.alvarado does not seek review of the court of appeals adverse judgment on her gross negligence claim.therefore,the only claim before this court is alvarado negligence claim against tandem.
we granted tandem petition to resolve differing views among the courts of appeals as to whether a general employer that provides workers compensation coverage for an employee is precluded from relying on the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act if the employee was injured while the details of the employee work were under the control and supervision of another entity because we conclude that tandem was entitled to summary judgment based on the exclusive remedy provision,we do not consider tandem no evidence points.
the starting point in our analysis is the texas workers compensation act the general definitions section of the act defines an employer 
employer means,unless otherwise specified,a person who makes a contract of hire,employs one or more employees,and has workers compensation insurance coverage.the term includes a governmental entity that,either individually or collectively 
for purposes of the foregoing definition,an employer has workers compensation insurance coverage if the employer has either obtained an approved insurance policy or secured the payment of compensation through as provided under the act in the sections of the act dealing with coverage election,employer is defined as a person who employs one or more employees.
the exclusive remedy provision of the act says,recovery of workers compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of an employee covered by workers compensation insurance coverage or a legal beneficiary against the employer or an agent or employee of the employer for the death of or a injury sustained by the employee.but if an employer,a person who employs one or more employees,elects not to obtain workers compensation insurance,that employer is subject to negligence claims and may not assert certain defenses,including contributory negligence,assumed risk,or that the injury or death was caused by a fellow employee 
the act also defines employee 
a in this subtitle,employee means each person in the service of another under a contract of hire,whether express or implied,or oral or written.
b the term employee includes 
an employee employed in the usual course and scope of the employer business who is directed by the employer temporarily to perform services outside the usual course and scope of the employer business 
a person,other than an independent contractor or the employee of an independent contractor,who is engaged in construction,remodeling,or repair work for the employer at the premises of the employer and 
a person who is a trainee under the texans work program established under chapter.
c the term employee does not include 
a master of or a seaman on a vessel engaged in interstate or foreign commerce or 
a person whose employment is not in the usual course and scope of the employer business 
the workers compensation act defines course and scope of employment to mean,in pertinent part,
an activity of any kind or character that has to do with and originates in the work,business,trade,or profession of the employer and that is performed by an employee while engaged in or about the furtherance of the affairs or business of the employer.the term includes an activity conducted on the premises of the employer or at other locations 
alvarado concedes that she is tandem employee for some purposes,and the summary judgment evidence conclusively establishes that she is.tandem made all decisions regarding alvarado employment,including whether to hire her,fire her,and determining the client companies for whom she would work.tandem paid alvarado salary,withheld taxes,and provided training and benefits.at the time she was injured,alvarado was working at web facility pursuant to tandem direction,to serve tandem business purposes.while at web,tandem provided some degree of supervision and required alvarado to report any unsafe conditions to tandem and any deviations in job assignment to tandem.
but alvarado contends that when web took control of the details of her work,she ceased to be an employee of tandem for workers compensation purposes.she argues that when one entity borrows another employee,workers compensation law identifies one party as the employer and treats all others as third parties,citing smith otis engineering and archem austin industrial,alvarado therefore contends that there can be only one employer to which the exclusive remedy provision of the act applies.alvarado argues that because there is evidence that web controlled the details of her work,and indeed,a jury found that web was her employer after summary judgment had been rendered in favor of tandem,summary judgment for tandem was improper.
the jury finding that web was alvarado employer is not before us,and that finding is not binding on tandem,who was not a party to the trial we agree,however,that there was summary judgment evidence that web controlled the details of alvarado work at the time of her injury.indeed,tandem concedes as much.we assume,without deciding,that alvarado was web borrowed employee because it had the right to control and did control the details of alvarado work at the time she was injured.the question we must decide is whether,for purposes of workers compensation,a general employer like tandem remains an employer within the meaning of the act and thus whether the exclusive remedy provision can apply to both the general employer and one who has become an employer by controlling the details of a worker work at the time of injury.
as we said in texas workers compensation insurance fund del industrial,we apply the act as written in determining workers compensation issues and it is the act to which we must look as our starting point.tandem,as alvarado general employer,and alvarado fall squarely within the act definitions of employer and employee tandem employed alvarado and provided workers compensation insurance coverage for her she was acting in furtherance of tandem business while she was working at its client company,web.although tandem president testified that he thought alvarado was outside the course and scope of her employment because she was operating an industrial machine at the time of her injury in violation of tandem company policy,that opinion does not undercut the undisputed facts.tandem hired alvarado for the purpose of sending her to its clients to work as a laborer.the fact that she disobeyed directives from tandem about operating machinery while she was on the job did not take her out of the course and scope of her employment with tandem 
neither the definitions of employer and employee under the act nor the exclusive remedy provision expressly forecloses the possibility that there may be more than one employer.the definitions do not provide that a general employer ceases to be the employee employer for workers compensation purposes when another person exercises control over the details of the employee work and the employee is thereby expressly or impliedly in the service of that third person under a contract of hire and in examining the labor code overall scheme for workers compensation and for protecting workers we conclude that the act decided bias in favor of employers electing to provide coverage for their employees supports our conclusion that the act permits more than one employer for workers compensation purposes.
the texas labor code recognizes that an employer may be in the business of providing temporary workers to others.the code defines temporary common worker employer as a person who provides common workers to a user of common workers.the term includes a temporary common worker agent or temporary common worker agency.the code defines common worker 
common worker means an individual who performs labor involving physical tasks that do not require 
a a particular skill 
b training in a particular occupation,craft,or trade or 
c practical knowledge of the principles or processes of an art,science,craft,or trade 
a user of common workers is also defined user of common workers means a person who uses the services of a common worker provided by a temporary common worker employer.there is some regulation of temporary common worker employers under chapter of the code but it is not as extensive as the regulation of a staff leasing service provider under chapter of the code.
the staff leasing services act,by definition,does not cover the providers of temporary workers.the term staff leasing services does not include temporary help or a temporary common worker employer as defined by chapter.the staff leasing services act applies to arrangements in which the employee assignment is intended to be of a or continuing nature,rather than temporary or seasonal in nature,and a majority of the work force at a client company worksite or a specialized group within that work force consists of assigned employees of the license holder.
the staff leasing services act contemplates that one workers compensation policy procured by the staff leasing service company will cover employees leased to a client company,and that both the leasing company and the client may rely on the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act 
tandem does not qualify as a staff leasing service provider under the staff leasing services act because that act was not intended to apply to providers like tandem.however,the substantive provisions of and policies underlying the staff leasing services act are instructive.the labor code expressly addresses in that act staff leasing service companies do not meet the requirement of that act unless employment responsibilities are in fact shared by the license holder and the client company.a contract between a staff leasing service company and a client must provide that the leasing company shares,as provided by subsection b,with the client company the right of direction and control over employees assigned to a client worksites.the referenced subsection b says 
b notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,a client company retains responsibility for 
the direction and control of assigned employees as necessary to conduct the client company business,discharge any applicable fiduciary duty,or comply with any licensure,regulatory,or statutory requirement 
as we explained in del industrial,under the staff leasing services act,a staff leasing company makes the election of whether to provide workers compensation insurance coverage for both itself and the client company for the employees it leases if a leasing company elects coverage,its policy covers both the leasing company and its client company as to the leased employees the premium for workers compensation coverage is determined under the staff leasing services act based on the client company experience rating for the first two years of the client company contract but thereafter,the client company may obtain coverage for the leased employees,and the premium may be based on other factors in the circumstances described in the act if the leasing company elects not to obtain workers compensation coverage,both the leasing company and its client are subject to section of the code with regard to the leased employees.section permits negligence suits and prevents the assertion of certain common law defenses by employers 
the labor code also recognizes that a general contractor may procure workers compensation coverage for subcontractors and subcontractors employees and a motor carrier may provide workers compensation to an owner operator and employees of an owner operator the code provides that a written agreement to provide coverage makes the general contractor the employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor employees only for purposes of the workers compensation laws of this state.similar provisions were contained in prior legislation that legislation was construed to mean that when a premises owner agreed to procure workers compensation coverage for its general contractor and the general contractor subcontractor,a negligence suit by the subcontractor employee against both the general contractor and the subcontractor was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation legislation in effect in 
from an examination of chapter,which expressly contemplates the existence of temporary common worker employers,the staff leasing services act,and the provisions of the code that deal with general contractors,subcontractors,and their employees,we glean at least three things.first,the labor code expressly recognizes the existence of employers who engage in the business of providing temporary workers to others.second,the labor code does not abhor the concept of two employers for workers compensation purposes.third,the staff leasing services act and section covering general contractors and subcontractors,like other workers compensation provisions in the code,encourage employers to obtain workers compensation insurance coverage by providing benefits to the employer,including the exclusive remedy provision,if coverage is obtained.the staff leasing services act goes further and provides disincentives,such as removing common law defenses,if coverage is not obtained.
we recognized the benefits of workers compensation coverage to both employees and employers in hughes wood products,wagner we said there that 
the workers compensation act was adopted to provide prompt remuneration to employees who sustain injuries in the course and scope of their employment the act relieves employees of the burden of proving their employer negligence,and instead provides timely compensation for injuries sustained in exchange for this prompt recovery,the act prohibits an employee from seeking remedies from his employer,as well as his employer agents,servants,and employees,for personal injuries sustained in the course and scope of his employment 
these purposes of the act are carried out by recognizing that the express definitions of employer and employee and the exclusive remedy provision may apply to more than one employer.an employee in alvarado situation will be working for her general employer,the temporary staffing provider,but will also be subjected to laboring in the workplace and under the direction of the general employer client company.some client companies may carry workers compensation insurance while others may not.an employee injured while working under the direct supervision of a client company is conducting the business of both the general employer and that employer client.the employee should be able to pursue workers compensation benefits from either.if either has elected not to provide coverage,but still qualifies as an employer under the act,then that employer should be subject to common law liability without the benefit of the defenses enumerated in section.temporary workers by definition move from one client company to another.they do not know who will be directing their work from day to day.the only constant in their work is that they are employed by their general employer,to whom they look for payment of wages and their work assignments.the purposes underlying the workers compensation act and its definitions of employer and employee indicate that the general employer is,and should be,an employer of a temporary worker even if a client company directs the details of that employee work when the employee is injured.further,an employee should not be placed in the position of trying to determine,perhaps at his or her peril,which of two entities was his or her employer on any given day or at any given moment during a day.
we note that in a number of other jurisdictions,either by statute or case law,both a general employer and one who borrows that employer employee are immune from suit under statutory provisions similar to texas exclusive remedy provision,if one or both maintain workers compensation coverage 
we find nothing in the texas workers compensation act that would preclude applying its definitions to both a general employer that provides temporary workers and that employer client company when the general employer,its client,and the employee fit within the express definitions.to the contrary,the purposes of the act are promoted in giving effect to definitions of employer and employee when they fit both a provider of temporary workers and its client.
we think it prudent to emphasize that we are deciding today only whether there may be two employers for workers compensation purposes when a provider of temporary workers furnishes a worker to a client that controlled the details of the work at the time the worker was injured and there was no agreement between the provider of temporary workers and the client regarding workers compensation coverage.we are aware that there are decisions from texas courts of appeals that have held that when an employer provides workers to client companies and agrees to procure workers compensation coverage for those workers,the client company is considered to be the employer for purposes of the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation law if the staffing provider actually procured such coverage and the employee was under the direct control of the client or was the client borrowed servant in a case applying the law in effect before the staff leasing services act became effective,another court of appeals held that a client company who controlled the details of an employee work when her injury occurred was an employer for purposes of the exclusive remedy bar,even though a leasing company carried the employee on its workers compensation policy under an agreement with its client,and the leasing company was the insured rather than the client in another case applying the law in effect before the staff leasing services act became effective,a court of appeals held that an agreement regarding workers compensation coverage that essentially would have met the requirements of the staff leasing services act,had it been in effect,was enforceable,and that the injured employee suit against both the leasing company and its client was barred and another court of appeals has held that there can be for workers compensation purposes when a temporary employment agency agreed in a written contract with its client to provide workers compensation insurance for the temporary employee,and did in fact pay benefits,but the client controlled the details of the injured employee work the court in that case held that the client was entitled to immunity based on the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act none of the issues presented in the foregoing cases are before us today,and we express no opinion on those issues.
we turn to alvarado argument that the doctrine of right to control should govern this case.
we recognized in del industrial,that t he common law has been dramatically engrafted upon by the l egislature.where the common law is revised by statute,the statute controls.in del,we held that the staff leasing services act could result as a practical matter in a split workforce,meaning that some employees had workers compensation coverage while others did not this did not deter us from applying the act as written,even though there was a long history prohibiting a split workforce 
as discussed above,the workers compensation act has express definitions of employer and employee that should be given effect when applicable,even if that results in an employee having more than one employer for purposes of workers compensation.as we have seen,nothing in the act provides that there must be only one employer for workers compensation purposes.furthermore,nothing in the decisions of this court is at odds with the concept that an employee may have two employers for workers compensation purposes.
we said in del industrial,that g enerally,courts determine whether the subscribing company is the worker employer under the test,citing our decision in thompson travelers indemnity of rhode island but that statement can not be lifted out of context and stretched to mean that there can be only one employer for workers compensation purposes.in thompson,the issue was whether a jockey was an employee of the racetrack or an independent contractor the jockey sought to obtain workers compensation benefits under the racetrack policy,and the compensation carrier contested his status as an employee.we held that he was not an employee,but rather was an independent contractor alvarado was not an independent contractor for tandem,and no one in this case claims that she was.the evidence shows that alvarado was hired by a temporary staffing company with all the indicia of an employee,worked for the staffing company at its client place of business,and was directed in the details of her work by the client.alvarado had two employers for workers compensation purposes.
nor is the concept that there can be two employers for workers compensation purposes foreclosed by the right to control principles that we have articulated in the tort context in analyzing and principles.we have said that a general employee of one employer may become the borrowed servant of another with respect to some activities the principles that define when there will be vicarious liability are designed to assign liability for injury to third parties to the party who was directing the details of the negligent actor conduct when that negligence occurred.determining whether a general employer remains an employer for workers compensation purposes while its employee is acting as the borrowed servant of another is not governed by the same concerns,as we have set forth above.
in exxon perez,we addressed the parameters of the doctrine in the context of the borrowing entity claim that it was entitled to rely on the exclusive remedy provision of the former workers compensation act perez,an employee of hancock,was injured on a jobsite and sued exxon.exxon contended that perez was its borrowed servant,and that since it was a workers compensation insurance subscriber,the exclusive remedy provision immunized it from negligence claims we held that there was a fact question about whether perez was exxon borrowed servant and that the trial court therefore should have submitted an issue to the jury we did not consider in any way whether perez employer,hancock,would be precluded from relying on the exclusive remedy provision if perez were found to be exxon borrowed servant.
at least two courts of appeals have concluded that the right to control test did not deprive an employer of the benefit of the act exclusive remedy provision when an employee was injured while the details of that employee work were under the control of another.the first of these cases,chapa koch refining was decided under the former version of the texas workers compensation act chapa was employed by an employee leasing company,stafftek.stafftek supplied chapa as a worker to h s,who in turn had been retained as an independent contractor by koch.chapa was injured on koch premises.chapa general employer,stafftek,was a subscriber under the workers compensation act,as was h chapa sued stafftek,h s,and koch.the court of appeals first held that chapa was h s borrowed servant but because h s provided coverage to chapa under a workers compensation policy,the court held that the exclusive remedy provision applied and insulated h s from suits for damages for personal injuries.chapa had received benefits,however,under stafftek policy,not h s the court of appeals concluded that the act exclusive remedy provision applied to stafftek as well as h this court reversed the court of appeals,but only with regard to its holdings as to koch liability none of the issues regarding workers compensation or the exclusive remedy provision were before us.
in another case,texas industrial contractors,ammean ammean was employed by texas contractors.texas contractors was hired as an independent contractor by bayer.ammean was injured while working on bayer premises.the court of appeals held that a reasonable jury could conclude that bayer exercised actual control over texas contractor activities that resulted in ammean injury the court nevertheless held that texas contractors was entitled to rely on the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act because texas contractors had a workers compensation policy and ammean had received benefits under it the beaumont court of appeals seems to have based its decision on the fact that the employee had elected to pursue a claim for workers compensation from its employer rather than a suit and was bound by that election that court concluded 
ammean argues the exclusive remedy provision does not prevent him from recovering against texas contractors at common law because bayer was his true employer since it controlled the details of his work and because he did not make an informed election of remedies.where,however,a worker is hired by one company that has contracted to do work for another,that company has a workers compensation policy,and the worker receives benefits under that policy following an award by the texas workers compensation commission,the worker common law claim against that company is barred by the act exclusive remedy provision,even if control over the details of the work is in the hands of the other company with which that company has contracted.
in any event,ammean brought this common law claim after he had sought and obtained,with the assistance of an attorney,workers compensation benefits.no appeal was taken from the award 
two other court of appeals decisions have applied reasoning that is at odds with the reasoning in chapa and ammean.in smith otis engineering,decided under the former workers compensation statutes,smith was in the general employ of stewart well service company smith was injured while he was unloading equipment from a truck owned by otis engineering.otis workers compensation carrier provided benefits to smith,which he accepted,and smith executed a release in favor of otis.smith then sued otis,stewart well service,and another entity.otis filed a motion for summary judgment,contending smith was its borrowed servant as a matter of law and therefore that it was smith employer for purposes of the workers compensation bar of negligence claims the trial court granted otis summary judgment motion,but the court of appeals reversed,holding that whether smith was otis borrowed servant was a fact issue part of the rationale for that holding was the court conclusion that the law require s that one party be named the employer and all others be classified as third parties outside the purview of the workers compensation law.but the case the court cited for that proposition,associated indemnity hartford accident indemnity did not make such a holding,as the concurring opinion in the case before us today pointed out in fact,the decision in hartford expressly said that it was not required to decide whether to reject the theory and apply the test 
the same court that decided smith subsequently decided archem austin industrial,in that case,vallejo was employed by austin industrial,who supplied temporary labor.austin industrial client was archem,and vallejo was injured while working at archem premises.vallejo sued archem and austin,both of whom contended that because they were workers compensation subscribers,vallejo claims were barred by the exclusive remedy provision austin industrial filed a motion for summary judgment,which the trial court granted.citing its decision in smith,the court of appeals reversed,saying that w here one entity borrows another employee,workers compensation law identifies one party as the employer and treats all others as third parties.the court held that there was a fact question of whether austin industrial or archem was vallejo employer at the time he was injured 
the single employer theory from smith and archem was embraced in coronado schoenmann produce that case did not concern a provider of workers to clients,but rather,which of two affiliated companies was the employer the court in that case stated that f or liability purposes,where one entity borrows another employee,workers compensation law identifies one party as the employer and treats all others as third parties.the court ultimately held that there was no evidence that the defendant exercised any control over the details of the plaintiff work at the time of the injury 
the same court that decided smith and archem decided the case before us today.the author of the court of appeals opinion in this case took the unusual but not unprecedented step of concurring to the court opinion justice taft criticized the court of appeals prior decisions in smith and archem as being inconsistent with the purposes of the workers compensation scheme enacted by the legislature justice taft said that if he were writing on a clean slate,he would have reached a different result 
for these reasons,i reluctantly follow the rule we articulated in smith and archem.if i were writing on a clean slate,however,i would decide this case by adopting the holding of texas industrial contractors,ammean,pet.dism by agr.that,
when,however,a worker is hired by one company that has contracted to do work for another,that company has a workers compensation policy,and the worker receives benefits under that policy following an award by the texas workers compensation commission,the worker common law claim against that company is barred by the labor code exclusive remedy provision,even if control over the details of the work is in the hands of the other company with which that company has contracted.
id.at chapa koch refining,christi,rev on other grounds.this result gives effect to the policy behind the workers compensation statute,which deprives the injured employee of a subscriber of many common law rights in return for prompt compensation benefits and medical treatment accordingly,i believe that applying the above holding to this case would yield a fairer result and comport with legislative intent 
we agree with the concurring opinion in the court of appeals in this case that smith and archem were incorrectly decided.because the holding in and that there can be only one employer for workers compensation purposes is at odds with the purposes and policies of the workers compensation act and with this opinion,we disapprove of those decisions.we also disapprove of similar language in coronado schoenmann produce alvarado was tandem employee for workers compensation purposes because she and tandem fell within the respective definitions of employee and employer under the act.the fact that web actually controlled the details of alvarado work at the time she was injured,and thus was also an employer within the meaning of the act,does not preclude the applicability of the act provisions,including the exclusive remedy provision,to both tandem and web.
for the foregoing reasons,the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of tandem.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment that alvarado take nothing.
i agree with the court that the test should be rejected as the test to apply when determining who the employer is in the workers compensation context.unfortunately,though rejecting the test,the court appears to rely on that test to conclude that tandem is a joint employer in this case so,i must disagree with the court reasoning.under the texas workers compensation act,an employer is defined as a person who makes a contract of hire and has workers compensation insurance coverage because tandem hired alvarado and purchased workers compensation insurance covering alvarado,tandem is an employer entitled to receive the benefit of the texas workers compensation act exclusive remedy provision because i agree with the court judgment,i concur.
rather than rely on a shared to determine under the workers compensation statute who the employer is,i would follow the approach outlined by texas industrial contractors,ammean in ammean,richard ammean was hired by texas industrial contractors,but assigned to work at bayer corporation ammean was injured at bayer facility and later filed and received workers compensation benefits from texas industrial contractors carrier ammean maintained that bayer was his employer for workers compensation purposes because bayer controlled his work,thus,texas industrial contractors was not immune from his suit for negligence.not knowing if he was correct in his assessment,ammean also brought a negligence action against bayer.in deciding which entity qualified as ammean employer,the court stated 
when a worker is hired by one company that has contracted to do work for another,that company has a workers compensation policy,and the worker receives benefits under that policy following an award by the texas workers compensation commission,the worker common law claim against that company is barred by the act exclusive remedy provision,even if control over the details of the work is in the hands of the other company with which that company has contracted 
my principal concerns with the court position are.first,it applies the test that leads to unfair determine the employer for workers compensation purposes.and second,under these circumstances,it concludes that alvarado has joint holding that is neither supported nor predicted by relevant legislative enactments.
using the test is unfair because it leaves employees in alvarado circumstance at a loss as to whom they should look for compensation coverage.on the other hand,in these circumstances,though the actual employer procured workers compensation for its employee and the employee actually received benefits from the policy,the employer would not know if it was the employer under the compensation act and thus is entitled to the act exclusivity protection,until a court determines who controls the employee particular activity.for example,in ammean,were the court to have applied the test,then ammean could have sued texas industrial contractors for negligence even though ammean collected workers compensation benefits under a policy paid for by that company.
furthermore,in concluding that alvarado has two employers for workers compensation purposes because they exercise joint control,the court applies the test very broadly.this seems peculiarly inconsistent with the court application of this same test in joseph hospital wolff in which a majority of the court concluded that the status of employer was limited to the entity that was in immediate control of the specific details of the employee work.the test applied in ammean,i think,produces results more in keeping with texas workers compensation scheme.and it is a more accurate test for determining who alvarado employer is for workers compensation purposes.
texas workers compensation scheme was adopted and designed to benefit both the employee and the employer while it is true,as the court states,that nothing in the act provides that there must be only one employer for workers compensation purposes,it is not at all clear to me that the legislature would permit a temporary employee to have two employers under the act or that the relationship would further the purposes of the act 
in relying on joint contro
