this diversity jurisdiction case queries whether the plaintiff,brenda larroquette,a louisiana nurse anesthetist who developed an allergy to latex gloves after using them on the job for years,improperly joined her battery action against her former hospital employer,touro infirmary,with her products liability actions against latex glove manufacturers to defeat federal jurisdiction and removal.the district court decided that the joinder was improper,denied plaintiff remand motion,and dismissed her action against touro.we affirm.joinder of a party is improper if there is no reasonable basis to predict that the plaintiff might be able to recover against that party.louisiana statutes make workers compensation recovery an employee exclusive remedy for a injury caused by the employer conduct,except when suit is based on an intentional tort.under this exception,intent means that the employer either consciously desired the physical result of its act or knew,to a substantial certainty,that the result would follow from its conduct.here,there is no reasonable basis to predict that larroquette might be able to recover against touro for an intentional act of battery.she alleges touro caused her to develop latex allergy by requiring her to work with latex gloves for approximately four years.but she does not contend that touro desired to harm her.nor does she allege facts that support a finding that touro knew to a substantial certainty that the use of latex gloves would harm her.her allegations might support a claim of negligence or recklessness,but they do not support a finding of battery or any other unlawful intentional act.therefore,the plaintiff joinder of her battery action against the touro infirmary was improper,as the district court correctly decided.
facts alleged 
essentially,larroquette battery claim is framed by the following pertinent allegations of facts and tacit admissions of facts in her pleadings 
larroquette used latex gloves in her work as a nurse anesthetist from until without symptoms of latex sensitization 
larroquette used latex gloves as a nurse anesthetist for touro from to without symptoms of latex sensitization 
while working for touro in,she had an anaphylactic reaction requiring emergency hospital treatment,but her doctors did not associate that reaction with latex 
during her employment by touro from to,touro provided and required that its employees use latex gloves,stocking its entire facility with them 
touro knew of medical studies showing that to percent of health care workers are susceptible to latex sensitization,a precursor to a latex allergy 
by october of,touro employees had developed some form of latex allergy 
a national health organization,in addition to two touro staff members,urged touro to take greater precautions to prevent latex allergies 
in,after leaving touro employ in,larroquette suffered a second reaction and was diagnosed with type i latex allergy and 
larroquette complaint does not allege,and in effect tacitly admits,that touro did not have any feasible means of predicting which employees would develop latex sensitization.
ii.procedural history 
in,larroquette filed suit in the civil district court for the parish of orleans,louisiana,against touro infirmary,a louisiana hospital corporation cardinal health,and ansell healthcare products,foreign corporations authorized to do business in louisiana kimberly clark corporation,and johnson johnson medical,foreign corporations not licensed to do business in louisiana and touro insurers,safety national casualty corporation and paul fire and marine insurance company.
after setting forth the allegations and factual contentions described in part i,ante,larroquette complaint asserts,as a legal conclusion without any additional factual support,that because touro required its employees to use latex gloves,touro had substantially certain knowledge that harmful contact and injury would result to larroquette,and touro thereby committed the intentional tort of battery upon her.thus,she asserts that touro and its liability insurers are liable to her for damages.
further,her complaint avers that the defendant latex glove manufacturers made and distributed the latex gloves she used from to that these gloves proximately caused her latex allergy and other damages that the latex gloves were unreasonably dangerous in design and because of inadequate warning and that the latex glove manufacturers are therefore liable to her under the louisiana products liability act.ann.et.
cardinal health,removed the case to the federal court,where it and the other defendants asserted that touro was improperly joined in an effort to defeat diversity jurisdiction.larroquette moved to remand the case to state court,arguing that touro was properly joined,thus foreclosing diversity jurisdiction.the district court accepted the defendants argument,dismissed touro from the case,and denied larroquette motion to remand.
iii.improper joinder 
as we observed in smallwood illinois cent,cir en banc 
the starting point for analyzing claims of improper joinder must be the statutes authorizing removal to federal court of cases filed in state court.the federal removal statute,a,allows for the removal of any civil action brought in a state court of which the district courts of the united states have original jurisdiction.subsection b specifies that suits arising under federal law are removable without regard to the citizenship of the parties all other suits are removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought.to remove a case based on diversity,the diverse defendant must demonstrate that all of the prerequisites of diversity jurisdiction contained in are satisfied.relatedly,a district court is prohibited by statute from exercising jurisdiction over a suit in which any party,by assignment or otherwise,has been improperly or collusively joined to manufacture federal diversity jurisdiction.
smallwood,at footnotes omitted.
synthesizing these statutory provisions,we have recognized two tests for establishing improper joinder actual fraud in the pleading of jurisdictional facts,or inability of the plaintiff to establish a cause of action against the party in state court.id.at internal quotations and citation omitted.we have further explained the second test as an inquiry into whether the defendant has demonstrated that there is no possibility of recovery by the plaintiff against an defendant,which stated differently means that there is no reasonable basis for the district court to predict that the plaintiff might be able to recover against an defendant.id.at internal citation omitted.in the present case,only the second test is pertinent.
in applying the second test,we ordinarily conduct a rule b type analysis,looking initially at the allegations of the complaint to determine whether,under state law,the complaint states a claim against the defendant.id.in a few cases,in which a plaintiff has stated a claim but has misstated or omitted discrete facts,the district court may,in its discretion,pierce the pleadings and conduct a summary inquiry.id.we have no need to pierce the pleadings here.
iv.louisiana law workers compensation battery 
the supreme court of louisiana,in cole state department of public safety and corrections,so d,reaffirmed the following principles under the provisions of louisiana revised statutes,a worker is ordinarily limited to recovering workers compensation benefits rather than tort damages for injuries and section b provides an exception to this exclusivity when a worker is injured as a result of an employer intentional act.this exception allows tort recovery by an who sustains damages as a result of an intentional battery committed by a during the course and scope of employment,the exclusivity provisions of the louisiana workers compensation act do not apply in such a case.id.at internal citations omitted.
the court made clear,however,that in this context intent or intentional continues to mean that the person either consciously desires the physical result of his act,whatever the likelihood of t
