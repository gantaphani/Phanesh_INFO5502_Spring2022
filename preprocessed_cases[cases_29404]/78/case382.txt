in state comp.ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,state comp,our supreme court clarified that when an employer is faced with deciding whether to approve or deny the treatment recommendation of an injured worker physician,it must conduct utilization review pursuant to labor code section.by the same token the employer can not,as an alternative to utilization review,dispute the treatment request under the general dispute resolution framework set forth in section,subdivision a section a.
in this case we are asked to clarify the dispute resolution procedure that comes into play when the employee treating physician specifically recommends spinal surgery but the employer utilization review decision is to deny treatment.as we explain,special procedures and timeframes govern this situation calling for the employer to instigate the spinal surgery second opinion process detailed in section,subdivision b section b however,they were not followed in this case.instead,the workers compensation appeals board wcab or board ruled that under brasher nationwide studio fund brasher,when an employer responds to a treating physician recommendation for spinal surgery by timely denying that request pursuant to its utilization review,the employee must object to the denial and the dispute will then be resolved under section b.because petitioner vickie elliott did not object to the utilization review denial or seek a spinal surgery second opinion report,the board decided her employer was not obligated to provide the requested spinal surgery.
after this matter became fully briefed,the wcab issued its en banc decision in cervantes el aguila food products,cervantes,explicitly denouncing the brasher holding relied on by the wcab in this case.we,too,reject that holding,reverse the decision of the wcab,and remand with directions that the board immediately order to authorize the requested spinal surgery or object to the treating physician spinal surgery recommendation under section b within days of receipt of the order,thereby commencing the spinal surgery second opinion process.
background 
the facts are not in dispute.in june,vickie elliott was employed as a working merchandiser supervisor for the newsgroup.while stocking and moving merchandise,stacked totes of magazines fell on elliott.her primary treating physician referred elliott to robert rovner,a spine surgeon,who recommended spinal surgery on may.the faxed documents were received by gallagher bassett,the newsgroup workers compensation claims administrator,on may.gallagher bassett submitted the request through the utilization review process.by a document dated may,kelly agnew issued an opinion denying the requested lumbar fusion.
at the time of the denial,elliott was not represented by an attorney.no one notified elliott of any requirement to request a spinal surgery second opinion or file an objection to the utilization review denial.nor did the newsgroup submit a request for a second spinal surgery opinion.
rovner appealed the denial and on august,a different doctor issued a second utilization review denial.
elliott retained counsel at the end of august.counsel demanded that respondents immediately authorize the proposed spinal surgery,asserting that the denial was untimely and invalid.further correspondence delved into the requirements governing spinal surgery recommendations.in january counsel filed a declaration of readiness to proceed to an expedited hearing.
the workers compensation judge found that the utilization review denial was timely respondents did not seek a spinal surgery second opinion after the utilization review denial as required by sections b and,subdivision g a section g a respondents did not notify elliott of any requirement to file a written objection to the utilization review denial within days of that denial and more than days passed since the original request for spinal surgery.accordingly,the workers compensation judge ordered respondents to authorize the requested spinal surgery forthwith.
respondents petitioned for reconsideration,arguing that they properly denied elliott request for spinal surgery following the utilization review,in keeping with state comp.and the procedures set forth in the significant panel in brasher.under respondents view,an employer is entitled to rely and rest upon its utilization review denial of the request for spinal surgery.therefore,the onus is on the employee to commence the process for procuring a second spinal surgery opinion under section b.elliott countered that under state,the procedures set forth in brasher are no longer valid.further,sections and mandate that it is the employer who must request a second opinion following denial pursuant to the utilization review.the wcab agreed with respondents,granted reconsideration and rescinded the workers compensation judge order directing respondents to authorize the spinal surgery.this petition for writ of review followed.
ii.discussion 
introduction state comp.decision 
reacting to escalating workers compensation costs,the legislature passed senate bill,effective january.reg.sess.this legislation enacted omnibus reform of the workers compensation scheme.pertinent here are the statutory utilization review process set forth in section and specific procedures for resolving disputes about spinal surgery requests,featured in section b.the following year,senate bill,passed as urgency legislation,continued the reforms.among many other things,this bill changed the general dispute resolution process set forth in section a.
examining legislative intent spurring these reforms,the state comp.court explained that the new utilization review structure created by the legislature balances the twin interests of speed and accuracy.while the system emphasizes quick resolution of treatment requests,it allows employers to pursue additional time if more information is needed to make a decision and,significantly,medical review is required before a utilization review doctor can modify,delay or deny a treatment request.state,supra,cal th at,citing section,subds.e,g.
specifically,section requires every employer to establish a complying utilization review process governed by written policies and procedures ensuring that decisions about proposed medical treatment services are consistent with specific,approved treatment standards,guidelines and schedules,subds.b,c.further,the statute mandates that only licensed physicians who are competent to evaluate the particular clinical issues involved can modify,delay or deny requests for treatment,subd.e.as well,treatment decisions must be made expeditiously,not to exceed five working days from the date of receipt of information reasonably necessary to make the decision,but in any event no later than days from the date of the treatment request,subd.g.however,if the employer does not have all the information reasonably necessary and requested,or requires expert consultation,or has asked for an additional examination that is reasonable and consistent with sound medical practice,the employer must immediately notify the physician and employee and specify an anticipated date of receipt.upon such receipt,the employer shall approve,modify or deny the authorization,subd.g.
where the request is not approved in full,disputes are resolved in accord with section.g a.however,if a request to perform spinal surgery is denied,disputes are resolved in accord with section b.g a.
the state comp.court concluded,in light of the comprehensive nature of section and the goals of controlling costs while ensuring workers access to prompt,quality,standardized care,that the legislature intended for employers to use the statutory utilization review process to review and resolve any and all requests for treatment state,supra,cal th at,italics added.thus,an employer may not elect to bypass utilization review and instead invoke the section a provisions to dispute an employee treatment request.state,supra,at.this is so because the section a dispute procedure is not available to employers to object to a treating physician medical determination concerning medical issues subject to section.a.on the other hand,the same statute a
