employees who are injured in the course of employment are typically barred by the exclusive remedy doctrine from suing their employer for the injury and are limited to workers compensation,subd.a,section references are to the labor code unless otherwise indicated.the employees may,however,bring a civil suit against any person other than their employer who proximately caused the injury.
here,the employees pursued relief in both forums they filed individual workers compensation cases and together brought a civil suit against a third party.the employees attorneys retained a psychologist as an expert.he wanted to be paid in advance.instead,the attorneys agreed to pay him from the recovery in the civil suit.the psychologist evaluated the employees.he filed his bills in the workers compensation cases.the employers carriers made payments on some of the bills.
the civil suit settled.the psychologist expected to receive the unpaid balance on his bills,but the attorneys refused to pay,asserting that the exclusive remedy doctrine barred payment out of the settlement.the psychologist then withdrew his remaining bills from the workers compensation cases and filed this action against the attorneys,seeking payment for his services.a jury found in his favor.we reverse,concluding that,because the psychologist work was compensable through the workers compensation system,he had no right to payment in the civil suit.
background 
the following facts are taken primarily from the evidence presented at trial,viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party.see estate of leslie cal d.
in,several individuals filed suit against bechtel group,alleging that while working as employees of other companies,they had sustained injuries at elk hills naval petroleum reserve elk hills due to bechtel toxic contamination of the site fanska bechtel group super.city and county,bechtel suit.some of the employees wives joined in the bechtel suit,alleging claims for loss of consortium.the employees and wives collectively bechtel plaintiffs were represented by gregory picco and eileen mcgruder,with the firm of picco presley,as well as joseph iacopino and michael goch collectively attorneys or civil suit attorneys.
the employees also filed workers compensation cases.in those proceedings,the employees were represented by margaret presley,also with picco presley.because the wives claims for loss of consortium were not compensable through workers compensation,they sought relief only in the civil suit.
the bechtel plaintiffs retained cranford scott,as a medical expert.for the workers compensation cases,scott performed a physical examination and medical tests on the employees.he provided written reports to presley,outlining each employee work history and assessing whether the employee had any diseases that might be associated with working at elk hills.in his practice,scott would sometimes recommend that an employee see a specialist to obtain additional support for a workers compensation claim.
some of the elk hills employees suffered from memory impairment,cognitive dysfunction,numbness,or dizziness,leading scott to conclude that a neurological evaluation was appropriate.in that regard,he had lunch with richard perrillo,a neuropsychologist,and mentioned that the elk hills employees might benefit from his involvement.later,scott recommended that attorney mcgruder have perrillo examine the employees.when scott was asked at trial,so every person that you referred over to perrillo office was strictly for workers compensation cases,he answered,that is correct.
scott also participated in preparing summaries of his workers compensation reports for submission in the civil suit.the summaries,commonly called physician statements,were drafted in large part by the civil suit attorneys,but scott would review and sign them.
from the outset,scott understood he would be paid through the workers compensation system,not the civil suit,for the services he provided to the employees.in scott words,w hen you see workers comp.patients,you only get paid once you submit a bill to workers comp you are not supposed to get paid by the civil suit if you get paid by workers comp.
scott knew that the payment arrangement for the wives would be different because they had no workers compensation cases.he evaluated them on a personal injury basis.to get paid with respect to the wives,scott had each one sign a civil lien,which,as of,provided in part to attorney i hereby authorize and direct you,my attorney to pay directly to said doctor such sums as may be due and owing him for medical service rendered me both by reason of this accident and by reason of any other bills that are due his office and to withhold such sums from any settlement,judgment or verdict which may be paid to you,my attorney,or myself as a result of the injuries for which i have been treated or injuries in connection therewith.
i fully understand that i am directly and fully responsible to said doctor for all medical bills submitted by him for service rendered and that this agreement is made solely for said doctor additional protection and in consideration of his awaiting payment.i further understand that such payment is not contingent on any settlement,judgment,or verdict by which i may eventually recover said fee.each lien was signed by the wife and attorney mcgruder.
in the spring of,mcgruder called the director of perrillo office,keith whiteman.she explained that her firm was working on a case involving a number of patients,mostly men,who had been exposed to chemicals in the process of cleaning oil wells.some of their wives had been harmed through secondary exposure,primarily through contact with the men clothing.mcgruder said there might be a workers compensation component to the litigation.she wanted perrillo to serve as an expert.whiteman replied that perrillo did not take workers compensation cases but would be happy to prepare the paperwork so the patients could use it in both the civil suit and the workers compensation cases.whiteman knew that it would be difficult to get paid up front and that perrillo would have to take a civil lien.he said he would talk to perrillo about taking the case.
whiteman relayed this information to perrillo,who then spoke directly with mcgruder.they discussed the civil suit and the workers compensation cases.perrillo said he would do a neuropsychological profile on the men and a psychological profile on the women.the profile for the men would cost approximately to,and for the women,around.perrillo wanted to know if he could be paid in advance.mcgruder said she would have to check on it.perrillo said if that were not possible,he would take a workers compensation lien or,more precisely,a notice and request for allowance of lien and a civil lien.perrillo commented that taking both liens protects my office.he recommended that an epidemiological study be done in the civil suit to show causation.the study was never undertaken.
mcgruder asked perrillo to write a report on each person he examined.she mentioned that some of the reports would have a workers compensation aspect.perrillo said he was not interested in doing workers comp.mcgruder said he would be paid out of the civil suit settlement and that he would have a civil lien on the case.
the civil suit attorneys decided as a group to retain perrillo and that he would have a civil lien and a workers compensation lien.he would not be paid in advance.from perrillo perspective,he was hired for the civil case.as he stated there was absolutely no question about it.they were going to pay me out of the settlement they knew that i was a civil expert.perrillo did not expect to get paid out of workers compensation.when asked at trial why he needed a workers compensation lien,he answered,i wanted to make sure that i was protected all the way around.and mcgruder told him to obtain workers compensation liens.
perrillo decided to do what was necessary to protect the patients in the workers compensation system,namely,draft a report that would comply with workers compensation requirements so it could be used in both the civil suit and the workers compensation cases.as perrillo explained at trial,we only do it and incur the expense to protect the patient.he did not feel he could leave the patient hanging dry given that the patient can collect in both forums.
perrillo did not go unchallenged in this regard.mcgruder testified that perrillo was retained solely for the workers compensation cases,he was not supposed to evaluate any of the wives,and he was to have a lien only in the workers compensation cases.mcgruder said she told perrillo he could not have a civil lien.
beginning in may,perrillo examined approximately male employees and wives.before they were examined,each of the bechtel plaintiffs signed a civil lien entitled,notice of doctor lien,which stated in part attorney i hereby authorize and direct you,my attorney,to pay directly to said doctor such sums as may be due and owing richard perrillo,for services rendered me by reason of this and by reason of any other bills that are due his office and to withhold such sums from any settlement,judgment or verdict as may be necessary to adequately protect said doctor.and i hereby further give a lien on my case to said doctor against any and all proceeds of any settlement,judgment,or verdict which may be paid to you,my attorney,or myself as the result for the injuries for which i have been treated or injuries in connection therewith.
i further understand that i will be held responsible for all collection costs,arbitrations,legal fees used to recover said doctor bills 
i fully understand that i am directly responsible to said doctor for all medical bills submitted by the office of perrillo for services rendered me and that this agreement is made solely for the said doctor additional protection and in consideration of his awaiting payment.and i further understand that such payment is not contingent on any settlement,judgment or verdict by which i may eventually recover said fee.
perrillo did not discuss the language of the lien provisions with the civil suit attorneys.although the liens contained a signature line for one of the attorneys,perrillo never sent the liens to the attorneys for signature.nor did any of the attorneys sign the liens.the attorney signature line was prefaced as follows acknowledgment of attorney the undersigned being attorney of record for the above patient does hereby agree to observe all the terms of the above and agrees to withhold such sums from any settlement,judgment or verdict as may be necessary to adequately protect richard perrillo,there was no signature line for perrillo,and he did not sign the liens either.
in addition to the civil liens,the employees signed a notice and request for allowance of lien an official workers compensation that the amount of perrillo bill be deducted from their respective workers compensation recoveries.for convenience,we refer to those requests as workers compensation liens.
to prepare the medical reports in accordance with workers compensation requirements,perrillo retained a workers compensation assistant,kathryn greve,whom he paid on an hourly basis.all of the reports on the employees used the same format.each one was addressed to scott.the opening paragraph began to whom it may concern this report qualifies for a ml circumstances designation because it is a comprehensive evaluation involving extraordinary circumstances performed by me.under workers compensation regulations,reports are coded through,depending on the complexity of the evaluation.see,tit.by using an ml code,perrillo indicated that his reports were the most complex within the meaning of the regulations and that he should be paid the highest possible fee.see ibid.at the end of each report,perrillo stated he had complied with labor code section,a workers compensation statute that prohibits a physician from referring a person to a health care provider with whom the physician has a financial interest.he also signed the report under penalty of perjury,using the standard paragraph required in workers compensation reports.see,subd.j.
for each of the bechtel plaintiffs,greve prepared an itemized bill that indicated the medical tests conducted,the length of the examination,the time spent preparing the report,and the cost of each item.the last paragraph of the bill stated in accordance with the case of federal mogul wcab whitworth,and cna insurance wcab valdez,we will expect full reimbursement of our usual and customary charges,as billed the bills complied with workers compensation formalities.see,tit.
finally,as to the employees,perrillo completed a workers compensation form entitled,doctor first report of occupational injury or illness,which identified the employer,the workers compensation carrier carrier,the accident or exposure,the employee subjective complaints,and the diagnosis.the doctor first reports were sent to the appropriate carriers.
in,after perrillo completed his written work,he entered the amount of the bill on each workers compensation lien,and sent the completed liens,medical reports,and itemized bills to the carriers and the workers compensation appeals board wcab.he filed a lien in each of the workers compensation cases.in response,he received offers of payment from some of the carriers and accepted payments on behalf of three employees johnson,rodgers,and yingst perrillo reports were not submitted in the civil suit.
in,the civil suit attorneys and presley,the workers compensation attorney,tried to reach a global settlement of the civil suit and the workers compensation cases.the civil suit attorneys deliberately did not inform opposing counsel that perrillo had evaluated the bechtel plaintiffs,but bechtel learned about his involvement through the workers compensation proceedings.bechtel subpoenaed perrillo records through the civil suit.presley asked perrillo to send a copy of the records to her so she could review them before the production.the records were copied and delivered around march.after reviewing them,presley called perrillo office to say she was missing some of the civil liens,and they were sent to her.
on may,a settlement conference began.very few of the carriers attended.bechtel made an offer.it was rejected.the conference ended without a settlement.
presley immediately started reviewing perrillo reports,scott reports,and other medical records to develop disability ratings for the employees,hoping to pressure the carriers into accepting a compromise.on may,presley incorporated this work into letters to the carriers,explaining why they should settle.
on one occasion,presley commented that perrillo work had also been helpful in attempting to settle the civil suit because his reports were driving home the civil matters.in early,presley informed perrillo office that we got million on the table.around the same time,the bechtel plaintiffs made a global settlement demand of million.by may,however,their demand had dropped to million.on or about august,the bechtel plaintiffs accepted bechtel offer to settle the civil suit alone for million.by that time,eight of the bechtel plaintiffs had been involuntarily dismissed from the case for failure to comply with a court order another refused to participate in the settlement.bechtel did not offer any settlement money for the wives.the workers compensation cases remained active.
presley contacted perrillo to see if he would give up his civil liens in light of the low settlement amount.she said he could seek payment for the employees through workers compensation.later,the civil suit attorneys offered to guarantee perrillo percent of his bills for the employees if he were awarded less than that percentage through workers compensation or if the workers compensation proceedings were not resolved in one year.the attorneys also offered to pay him out of the settlement for his work on behalf of the wives and one employee,phillip cranfill,who did not have a workers compensation case.perrillo rejected this proposal in its entirety and insisted on receiving payment out of the settlement for all of the bechtel plaintiffs.this dispute was not resolved.perrillo did not accept any money from the settlement.the is still being held in trust for him.
the civil suit attorneys took their share of the settlement funds first off the top and then distributed the remaining proceeds.scott was paid for his work on behalf of the wives and for the preparation of the physician statements in the civil suit.the employees received various amounts.the wives did not receive anything.
the workers compensation cases went forward on an individual basis.for example,perrillo had filed a workers compensation lien seeking in the case of shane irvine.by letter dated may,the carrier contested that amount,claiming the bill was too high.the carrier offered to settle the lien.perrillo rejected the offer and chose to submit the dispute to the wcab.presley and greve perrillo workers compensation assistant appeared at a hearing before a workers compensation judge wcj and convinced the carrier to offer percent of the bill.greve called perrillo,who agreed to accept that amount.greve and presley then appeared before the wcj to obtain an order resolving the lien.
afterward,perrillo spoke with the civil suit attorneys about collecting the balance on the irvine lien.perrillo was told that the wcab had exclusive jurisdiction over the matter,and he could not recover any additional amount on the lien from any source.based on that conversation,perrillo withdrew all of his other workers compensation liens and did not accept any more payments through the system.
on september,perrillo filed this action against picco presley,gregory picco,joseph iacopino,and margaret presley.eileen mcgruder was not sued.michael goch was sued but settled for in the fall of.we now include presley and exclude mcgruder and goch in using attorneys and civil suit attorneys.the original complaint alleged that the civil suit attorneys had refused to pay perrillo for his services in the bechtel suit,contrary to the terms of the civil liens.
the complaint was amended on two occasions.the second amended complaint,filed on august,alleged causes of action,including conversion,breach of fiduciary duty,and intentional interference with contractual relations.it alleged,as before,that the civil suit attorneys had not paid perrillo bills in accordance with the civil liens.as relief,perrillo sought damages in the amount of the liens,prejudgment interest,general and punitive damages,and an award of attorney fees.he sought relief based on the services he had provided to the bechtel plaintiffs,which did not include shane irvine.
during proceedings,the civil suit attorneys twice moved for summary adjudication based on the exclusive remedy doctrine,arguing that perrillo could not recover anything from them as to the employees.the trial court denied the motions,finding triable issues of fact.the exclusive remedy issue was also raised,but not resolved,by way of trial briefs and in limine motions.for purposes of our discussion,employees excludes cranfill,who did not file a workers compensation case.
before the present case was tried,of the approximately workers compensation cases had ended in settlements favoring the employees and orders by a wcj that the carriers resolve all physician liens,including perrillo.with the exception of perrillo,the other doctors in the workers compensation cases accepted the resulting lien payments.
in june,on the eve of trial,perrillo sought leave to amend the operative complaint to add a cause of action for breach of contract,alleging that the civil suit attorneys had agreed to pay him out of the settlement in the civil suit and had breached that promise.at the close of perrillo case,the trial court granted the motion to amend.
the attorneys moved for nonsuit on the basis of workers compensation exclusivity.the trial court denied the motion,stating i think the real issue in this case is whether or not perrillo was hired for the civil case or not if he was,then i think the jurors have to determine what work he did on the civil case,and determine if he entitled to compensation.if they find he was not hired for the civil case,if they find the lien is not valid,the only recourse is through the workers compensation avenue.
after both sides rested,the jury was instructed.on july,the jury returned a special verdict,finding the civil suit attorneys liable for breach of contract,conversion,intentional interference with contractual relations,intentional breach of fiduciary duty,and negligent breach of fiduciary duty.the jury found that the civil suit attorneys had entered into a valid contract with perrillo to pay for his services out of the civil settlement.it awarded him in past economic exact amount he had requested for the unpaid bills plus in photocopy expenses incurred in responding to bechtel subpoena in the civil suit.
the trial court reduced the verdict by goch settlement payment.on january,judgment was entered for,plus prejudgment interest of,calculated at percent,for a total of.on motion,the trial court awarded perrillo in attorney fees against the civil suit attorneys pursuant to the fee provision in the civil liens.an order to that effect was entered on april.
the civil suit attorneys appealed from the judgment and the order awarding attorney fees.perrillo filed a regarding the award of prejudgment interest and attorney fees.
discussion 
the civil suit attorneys argue that perrillo services for the employees are compensable only through the workers compensation system,notwithstanding any contracts or civil liens,because he submitted his reports,itemized bills,and workers compensation liens to the carriers and the wcab he accepted payments from the carriers as to some employees he resolved a disputed bill in connection with a hearing before a wcj and he refused to accept additional payments ordered by a wcj who presided over the settlement of most of the workers compensation cases.for the reasons that follow,we agree that the exclusive remedy doctrine applies.as a consequence,the judgment must be reduced by the amount the jury awarded perrillo for the bills covering the employees.
further,the civil suit attorneys are still holding in trust to cover the services perrillo rendered to the bechtel plaintiffs who did not have workers compensation cases,namely,the wives and cranfill.the jury awarded perrillo the full amount of the bills for those individuals too.but some of the wives were involuntarily dismissed from the civil suit before it settled because they failed to comply with a court order.the judgment must be further reduced to reflect those dismissals.
finally,we find no basis for awarding attorney fees against the civil suit attorneys.the trial court relied on the attorney fees provision in the civil liens,which were executed by the bechtel plaintiffs.the signature line for the attorneys was never signed.we can not say that the civil suit attorneys agreed to the attorney fees provision,either expressly,impliedly or by word or deed.the award of attorney fees was in error.
we agree with perrillo,however,that the trial court did not err by permitting the amendment of the operative complaint to add a breach of contract claim.nor was the new claim barred by the parol evidence rule or the statute of limitations.and substantial evidence supported the jury determination that the civil suit attorneys breached an oral contract to pay perrillo out of the settlement.
we remand the case to the trial court so that,consistent with our opinion,it may redetermine the amount of the judgment in the first instance.

based on the foregoing authorities,we conclude that perrillo services for the employees are compensable solely within the workers compensation system.notwithstanding perrillo testimony that he was not interested in doing workers,his services ultimately fell into that category.his medical reports,itemized bills,workers compensation liens,and doctor first report s of occupational injury or illness were prepared in compliance with workers compensation requirements or on workers compensation forms.those documents were sent to the carriers,the wcab,or both.perrillo accepted payments from some of the carriers and resolved one of his disputed liens in connection with a hearing before a wcj.that he declined to accept additional lien payments from the carriers when the workers compensation cases subsequently settled is of no avail to him.
the present action seeks compensation within the meaning of the act,namely,a physician recovery for providing services,subd.a.the wcab has exclusive jurisdiction over such proceedings,subd.a.in addition,the payment of expenses arises out of or is incidental to the employees recovery of compensation.the wcab is the only forum empowered to adjudicate the right to such payment.ibid.
as one court explained in a civil suit brought by a group of physicians seeking payment from injured employees for medical treatment the plaintiffs have undertaken to treat industrially injured patients,to submit reports and billing statements to the employers insurance carrier,and to accept payment from that carrier at least as a credit against the employee personal account.these facts demonstrate the attachment of the wcab jurisdiction we see no distinction in substance between the physician rendition of treatment and medical reports and the rendition of legal services by the claimants attorney.each is a necessary service rendered toward the realization of fundamental objectives of the workers compensation act.the legislature has decreed that no agreement for either legal or medical services in excess of a reasonable amount as determined by the board is valid.bell samaritan medical clinic,d,citations omitted,italics added.
it follows that whatever the nature of perrillo contract or lien with the civil suit attorneys or the bechtel plaintiffs,the exclusive remedy provisions render it void and unenforceable.see,subd.a wcab has exclusive jurisdiction over proceedings for recovery of compensation,s
