lockheed martin and lockheed martin aeronautical systems support lockheed took this interlocutory appeal,certified by the district court pursuant to b,seeking reversal of the district court partial summary judgment in favor of erica tanks.the district court held that,under the discrete facts and circumstances of this case,the exclusive remedy provision of the mississippi workers compensation act mwca or the act which generally precludes an employee from recovering from his employer on a state law tort cause of action,does not preclude tanks from pursuing against lockheed her state tort cause of action based on the workplace death of her father,thomas willis willis or decedent.the district court nevertheless certified,for interlocutory appeal,the question whether the mwca provides the exclusive remedy for tanks state law claims.our grant of lockheed appeal on the single issue thus certified limits our review to that question.
as an initial matter,we disagree with the district court view that the question it certified to us is an open one under these circumstances,and thus decline to certify it further to the supreme court of mississippi.deciding this question as we believe the supreme court of mississippi has and would,we conclude that,under the current state of the applicable mississippi jurisprudence,willis was a result of the willful act of a while both men were on the compensable under the mwca.this in turn makes compensation under the mwca tanks exclusive remedy against lockheed.we therefore reverse the ruling of the district court tanks state law tort claims,render a partial summary judgment for lockheed,dismissing tanks state law claims,and remand this case for proceedings on the federal claims advanced in her third amended complaint.
facts and proceedings 
this case arises from a horrific tragedy that occurred in july,at lockheed plant in lauderdale county,mississippi.at the time,the decedent was an assemblyman who had been employed by lockheed for more than years a,douglas paul williams,was also an assemblyman in that plant and had been employed by lockheed for years.willis,who was black,and williams,who was white,regularly worked in close proximity to each other.both perished at lockheed plant from gunshot wounds inflicted by williams in the course of a shooting spree during which williams killed or wounded several of his before turning one of his guns on himself.in addition to the decedent,a number of other lockheed black,some shot by williams during the course of his rampage some of the other victims died from their gunshot wounds others survived.like the decedent and williams,all the other victims were lockheed employees who were at the plant and at work at the time that they were shot.
in her original tort complaint filed in district court,and again in her third amended complaint,tanks related numerous factual allegations detailing williams longstanding and bigotry against his.her complaints are entirely devoid,however,of allegations of any demonstrated racial animus or overt acts against,either or non,anywhere outside the lockheed plant site.stated differently,tanks allegations of williams hatred,prejudice,and bigotry towards blacks exclusively address his and his workplace.for example,she alleged that williams harbored racial hatred towards his that he was known to be violent towards his that lockheed was aware of williams animus towards his and lockheed management at the plant that williams came to work and parked in the employee parking lot with loaded firearms in his truck that he informed lockheed of his hatred towards his,warning that,if his being required to work with blacks were not alleviated,violent consequences could occur that he had made threatening remarks to that he and a fellow white had attempted to intimidate their that williams instigated racial taunts and abuse towards his and on and on.in essence,all of tanks allegations that implicate williams overt racism and animus are made exclusively in the context of the workplace and his,black and white.these allegations are obviously intended to support tanks state tort claims and,eventually,federal discrimination claims against lockheed,grounded in,inter alia,negligence,gross negligence,willful and wanton inaction in the face of longstanding knowledge of williams condition and the threat to the safety of on the job.
after limited discovery,lockheed moved for partial summary judgment on the pleadings and several uncontested facts submitted by it,including its compliance with its mwca duty to insure its liability for workers compensation benefits.lockheed argued that williams injury is compensable under the mwca,and,consequently,that lockheed is entitled to immunity from tanks other state tort law claims on the basis of the act exclusive remedy provision.the district court nevertheless agreed with tanks that willis death was not compensable under the act and denied summary judgment.lockheed moved for reconsideration or,in the alternative,certification of the question for interlocutory appeal.the district court denied reconsideration but certified the action for interlocutory appeal.in granting the motion for interlocutory appeal,the district court identified as a material legal question under b the compensability of willis fatal injury under the mwca,characterizing the state of the law as unsettled,and noting the centrality of the question to the claims and this court authority to certify such a question to the supreme court of mississippi.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
the district court certified its decision for interlocutory appeal,and we granted lockheed motion for leave to appeal the district court denial of its motion for summary judgment pursuant to our authority under b.although we ordinarily review a district court summary judgment ruling de novo our appellate jurisdiction under b extends only to controlling questions of law,thus,we review only the issue of law certified for appeal we therefore determine de novo whether the district court properly interpreted the mwca,using the same method of interpretation as would the mississippi supreme court 
interpreting the mwca 
the district court denied lockheed motion for summary judgment,concluding that,even though mississippi case law interpreting the mwca is unclear,the decedent injuries were not compensable under the act.therefore,reasoned the court,the mwca exclusive remedy provision did not bar tanks from pursuing other state law remedies.we agree with the district court thorough discussion of mississippi case law including its determination that an earlier line of decisions,beginning with mutual implement hardware insurance pittman in,appears to conflict with a later line,commencing with miller mcrae in.we shall not retrace the district court careful analysis except to reiterate briefly the rules that undergird our decision.
elements of proof compensability for assault under the mwca 
under the mwca and the mississippi jurisprudence that has evolved over the past six decades,if the injury here,death is compensable under the act,compensation under the mwca is the exclusive state law tort remedy available to the employee or his successors courts determine whether a plaintiff is entitled to compensation under the mwca or whether his other tort claims are barred by the mwca exclusivity provision,by inquiring only whether the injury is compensable under the act.the sole issue before us,then,is whether willis injury,his death from the intentional shooting at the hands of a while both were at work,is compensable under the act.
under of the mwca,an employer is liable to pay compensation for the disability or death of an employee from injury arising out of and in the course of his employment,without regard to the fault as to the cause of the injury in the definitional section of the act,subsection b defines injury to mean 
accidental death arising out of and in the course of employment without regard to fault which results from an untoward event if contributed to or aggravated or accelerated by the employment in a significant manner untoward event includes events causing unexpected results.an untoward event or events shall not be presumed to have arisen out of and in the course of employment,except in the case of an employee found dead in the course of employment.
the final narrowing of the focus of this definition is found in the ensuing sentence in b this definition includes an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment while so employed and working on the job 
despite this explicit language defining injury to include willful acts by a third party,the mississippi supreme court pittman line of cases,beginning shortly after enactment of the mwca in,implicitly relied on a presumption that willful assaults by were accidental in pittman,the court held such attacks to be risks incident to employment of many persons and therefore compensable under the mwca in pittman and later cases,the mississippi court focused on whether an assault arose out of and in the course of employment rather than focusing on the intent of the assailant 
in,however,a shift in the focus of the inquiry,and in the court view of what is accidental,began.in miller,the mississippi supreme court decided that a claim for damages resulting from false imprisonment arose not from an accident but from a willful act,making it necessary to determine whether such an intentional act was encompassed within b definition of compensable injury,whether it was an injury caused by the willful act of a third person directed against an employee because of his employment while so employed and working on the job a third person,the court concluded,includes a who is not acting in the course and scope of his employment and in furtherance of the employer business 
here,in summarizing the miller line of cases,the district court explained when intentional assaults by third parties or acting outside the course and scope of their employment are compensable under the mwca 
i f in committing an assault,the was acting outside the course and scope of his employment,his status is viewed as analogous to that of a stranger to the employment relationship,and his act falls within the coverage of the act,and subject to the exclusivity bar,only if directed against an employee because of his employment while so employed and working on the job.on the other hand,if in committing an assault,the was acting in the course and scope of his employment and in furtherance of his employer business,then the injury caused thereby is not compensable under the act,and consequently the exclusivity bar does not apply.
there is no question that three of the five miller elements are satisfied in this case williams actions were intentional and directed at willis while willis was so employed and working on the job.as for the first of the two remaining miller elements,the district court williams must be considered a third party because he acted outside the course and scope of his employment.but as for the second remaining miller element,the district court under,despite the fact that williams acted outside the course and scope of his employment,judgment of dismissal could not be granted to lockheed on the basis of the mwca exclusivity bar.the court expressed reason was its inability to discern allegations or evidence suggesting that williams actions were directed against his victims because of their employment.in contrast,we perceive a plethora of both.we shall,therefore,address in more depth these final two elements,whether williams acted in the course and scope of his employment and whether willis was injured because of his employment.
acting outside the course and scope of employment third party status under the mwca 
we agree with the district court that williams actions were outside of the course and scope of his employment and must therefore be characterized as the acts of a third person the mississippi supreme court defines actions taken in the course and scope of employment with respect to respondeat superior tort liability as acts committed in the course of and as a means to accomplishing the purposes of the employment and therefore in furtherance of the master business or tortious acts incidental to the authorized conduct.an employee unauthorized acts may yet be within the course and scope of employment if they are of the same general nature as the conduct authorized or incidental to that conduct.an intentional violent assault on a is quite obviously neither committed as a means of accomplishing the purposes of the employment nor of the same general nature as authorized conduct none can seriously question that,for purposes of the mwca,williams shooting spree was the act of a third person outside the course and scope of his employment.
injury because of employment 
injuries or death caused by the malicious and intentional acts of a third party are compensable if they are inflicted because of the employee employment.it is the district court statement that nothing suggests that willis was injured because of his employment with which we disagree.williams underlying motivation was rooted in his racial hatred,but it is clear beyond cavil that his willful act directed at his while all were on the job was based on because of their employment.
the words because of,like the other words of causation with the act,such as arising out of,express the necessity of a nexus between the injury and employment.this nexus requires a showing of minimal causation only a rational connection between employment and injury is necessary whether the connection between the injury and the employment is close enough to demonstrate that a claimant was assaulted because of his employment is a factual question still,if the facts surrounding the cause of an injury are undisputed,we will treat the issue as a legal one 
the mississippi supreme court has determined that the required nexus between an employee injury and his job is not established when an intentional tort is the result of a personal vendetta and could have been committed anywhere as easily as at the place of employment otherwise,the court has reasoned,employees would be compensated for injuries or death caused by the employee personal indiscretions and having nothing to do with the employer these hazards can not reasonably be viewed as risks associated with employment neither can their compensation serve the legitimate state interest in protecting employees from workplace injury 
when even a tenuous relationship between an employee job and an intentional injury inflicted by a third party exists,however,the court has held that the mwca applies.a traveling salesman,assaulted by a motorist whom the salesman stopped to help while on his sales route,was held to have been injured because of his employment in concluding that the employee was injured because of his employment,the court cited the facts that no personal vendetta motivated the employee injury the employee violated no instructions concerning the manner in which he carried out his work the roadside stop did not cause the employee to deviate spacially or temporally from his delivery route and the salesman conduct,helping stranded motorists,was an acknowledged incident of being on the road 
we have interpreted mississippi jurisprudence on whether an employee is injured because of his employment in a similarly broad manner.we determined,shortly after the mississippi supreme court decision in big rebuilders,that coverage under the mwca may be established by considering the following factors the injury occurred within the time frame of employment the employee was within the spatial area required by employment at the time of injury and there existed a causal connection between the activity causing injury and the interests of the employer.in holding that a convenience store clerk rape by a third party was compensable under the act,we emphasized that the third factor requires a showing only that the obligations or conditions of employment create a zone of special danger out of which the injury arose,not a causal relation between the nature of the injury and the employment 
with respect to the connection between willis injury and his employment,the district court stated that there was nothing to
