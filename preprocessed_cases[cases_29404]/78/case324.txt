to recover for injuries resulting from his kidnapping,azhar ali khan and his wife,asma azhar khan,sued parsons global services limited pgsl and its affiliates and agents together,parsons for negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress.the district court granted summary judgment to parsons,ruling that the khans tort claims were barred by khan contractual agreement with pgsl to accept workers compensation insurance as the exclusive remedy for injuries arising out of and in the course of his employment.on appeal,the khans contend that the district court abused its discretion by granting summary judgment without permitting discovery requested under.f.they maintain that abuse of discretion is manifest where a motion for summary judgment is filed at the outset of a case prior to any discovery,key facts are in the defendant exclusive possession,and the plaintiffs submit detailed affidavits describing the discovery they seek.whether this is so depends principally on whether,as the khans also contend,the district court erred as a matter of law in interpreting the workers compensation act wca,ann.et,as it was incorporated in khan employment contract.because parsons considers khan to have been a traveling employee at the time of his kidnapping and because it regards his injuries to have accrued due to the employment relationship,parsons maintains that workers compensation is khan sole avenue of relief.because the traveling employee exception under the wca,as interpreted by the district of columbia court of appeals,is a narrow exception to the exclusion of coverage for injuries suffered while away from an employer premises,we reverse and remand the case for further proceedings.
in march,azhar ali khan,a british citizen,signed an employment contract the assignment agreement or agreement with pgsl,which has its principal place of business in the district of columbia.khan agreed to work as an accountant in manila,the philippines,for a term of two years.at that time,khan,khan,and their children were living in kuala lumpur,malaysia,where khan worked for parsons.the agreement noted that khan and the children would live with khan in manila,and provided for a housing allowance as well as health benefits.the agreement contained a clause requiring khan to accept workers compensation as full and exclusive compensation for any compensable bodily injury,occupational disease,or death resulting therefrom,arising out of and in the course of employee employment hereunder,emphasis added,and a clause requiring him to arbitrate in geneva,switzerland,under the laws of the state of california,any claims aris ing out of or in connection with his employment.khan departed for manila on tuesday,may,obtained lodging at a hotel,and had intended to look for an apartment on sunday,may.
on saturday evening,may,a day when pgsl manila offices were closed,khan dined alone,paying cash for his meal in a local restaurant.as he returned to his hotel,he was abducted by three men.the kidnappers held khan for approximately three weeks,during which time they chained him to the floor,attempted to hang him,and tortured him in other ways.during this period,the complaint alleges,parsons officials promised khan that parsons would pay the ransom demanded by the kidnappers they also,however,took the position that paying the ransom would undercut parsons interests by providing an incentive to kidnap parsons employees in the future.on may,the kidnappers cut off a portion of khan ear and sent the videotape of the event to parsons.the next day,khan was released after parsons paid the ransom.
and khan sued parsons,alleging that pgsl,various affiliated corporate entities pgsl parent company,parsons,and other parsons subsidiaries,and several agents of the parsons entities were negligent and liable for the intentional infliction of emotional distress.the alleged torts were improperly conducting negotiations with the kidnappers delaying payment of the demanded ransom refusing to provide khan with information about the kidnapping,including the amount of the ransom demand telling her lies and inconsistent,illogical,negligent explanations for the actions taken and forcing her to communicate with the kidnappers and to give them false promises that payment of the ransom was forthcoming.according to the complaint,if khan had been aware of the kidnappers demands,she would have been able to obtain the money to free khan,which could have prevented his torture and mutilation.khan also alleged that parsons coerced him into employment negotiations after his ordeal,required him to resume work only a few weeks after his release,threatened to stop paying his housing allowance,medical expenses,and other allowances,and threatened to transfer him to karachi,pakistan,despite the fact that khan would not feel safe there.
the complaint was filed in superior court on may.on july,parsons removed the case to the federal district court pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards,implemented in et,which provides federal jurisdiction in matters involving an arbitration agreement arising out of a commercial relationship where one party to the agreement is not a united states citizen.the notice of removal included the assignment agreement as an attachment.a week later,parsons filed a motion to dismiss,or alternatively for summary judgment or to compel arbitration,arguing that khan was effectively still in travel status at the time of his kidnapping.the khans filed an opposition,seeking denial outright because,in part,the horrifying injury and acts of deliberate torture neither arose from,nor occurred in the course of,khan work for pgsl,and alternatively seeking the motion denial pending plaintiffs opportunity to take discovery under rule f.pls.mem.opp.they attached to their opposition declarations describing the discovery sought pursuant to rule f as well as a statement describing material facts in dispute pursuant to h and.the district court granted summary judgment to parsons and denied the khans motion for reconsideration.the khans appeal.our review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo,universal city studios lllp peters,accepting the factual allegations in the complaint as true,information handling services,defense automated printing services.our review of the decision to grant summary judgment instead of permitting discovery under rule f is reviewed for abuse of discretion.paquin fed.mortgage ass n.
the assignment agreement,which settles on workers compensation as the full and exclusive compensation for any compensable bodily injury,occupational disease,or death resulting therefrom,arising out of and in the course of employee employment hereunder,copies the standard phrasing of many workers compensation statutes.see arthur larson lex larson,larson workers compensation hereinafter larson.as the case comes to us,the parties agree that the wca,which defines compensable injury in the same terms,controls the interpretation of the assignment agreement.in order to determine whether the district court abused its discretion by granting summary judgment before allowing the khans to pursue requested discovery as contemplated by rule f,the court must first determine whether the district court interpretation of the contractual bar reflected a proper construction of the wca.although it would not be unusual for this court to certify a genuinely uncertain question of district of columbia law to the district of columbia court of appeals,see sturdza united arab emirates,a,we conclude that the court of appeals has already provided the guidance necessary to resolve this point of law.
the wca provides that workers compensation is an employee exclusive remedy against the employer for injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment.the district of columbia has adopted the going and coming rule.as explained by the district of columbia court of appeals in kolson department of employment services,t he general rule is that the occurrence of employee injuries sustained off the work premise,while enroute to or from work,do not fall within the category of injuries in the course of
