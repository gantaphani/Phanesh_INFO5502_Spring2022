valeria spencer spencer,the,appeals from a judgment based upon an underlying superior court verdict for the defendant,stores east,in a slip and fall personal injury case.spencer claims that the superior court erred in three separate respects.we find that spencer claims lack merit and affirm.
on january,a snowfall blanketed the area where a store was located.four days later,on january,spencer entered the parking lot to go to her place of work,which was located inside of the building.
as a result of the melting snow,a stream of water had developed in the parking lot.spencer claimed that she slipped on ice that had formed under the stream of water.michelle carter,a assistant manager,responded to spencer request for assistance.after investigating,carter prepared an incident report and took photographs of the area where spencer fell.there was also a rooftop videotape of the incident,which preserved.
after her fall,spencer went to the hospital where she was told to follow up with her primary care physician.by the time of her trial,spencer medical expenses had totaled,and her lost wages were claimed to have totaled.
spencer filed an action against,seeking damages for her injuries sustained as a result of her slip and fall at parking lot.spencer claimed that the parking lot had not been properly maintained,and that she was injured as a result of negligent maintenance of the parking lot.spencer also filed a workers compensation claim against her employer,which was not but was located inside the building.at the time of trial,spencer had received workers compensation benefits totaling,for which the workers compensation carrier had a lien.
there were two pretrial conferences.during the first conference,spencer sought the admission into evidence of the workers compensation benefits she had received.in response to objection,spencer conceded that she could prove the compensability of her special damages through medical testimony,without having to refer in any way to the workers compensation lien.the trial judge concluded that the workers compensation lien should be admitted,nonetheless.at the second conference,there was further discussion about the admissibility of the workers compensation lien.the trial court reaffirmed its ruling that the jury should be informed of spencer workers compensation benefits 
at the trial,spencer called julius pereira pereira as an expert witness on the issue of negligence in removing snow from the parking lot.the superior court held a daubert hearing before trial on the admissibility of pereira proposed testimony.after hearing pereira proposed testimony and reviewing his expert report,the trial judge ruled that pereira was not qualified to testify as an expert under the delaware rules of evidence 
at trial,the superior court judge instructed the jury on landowner liability,as follows 
a landowner has a duty to provide a business invitee with safe ingress and egress to its property.ingress means the entrance or way onto the premises.egress means the exit or way off the premises.ordinarily,a landowner does not have a duty to warn an invitee of a danger located off the premises.but if the actual location of the hazard is immediately adjacent to the place of ingress or egress from the premises,the landowner has a duty to warn of the danger or protect against the danger in order to provide its invitees with a safe way onto and off the premises.if the danger,however,is so apparent that a business invitee can reasonably be expected to notice it and protect against it,the condition itself constitutes adequate warning and the landowner has no further duty to warn or protect the invitee 
the trial judge also gave the following jury instruction regarding calculation of damages 
you have heard testimony about worker compensation benefits that spencer has received.you should not consider the fact that some of the medical expenses and lost wages she claims in this lawsuit have been paid through workers compensation because spencer has a legal obligation to repay those compensations from any money that you might award in this case.on the other hand,if she does not recover in this case,there is no obligation for her to reimburse.in this case workers compensation has paid a total of in benefits to the plaintiff 
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury returned a verdict for on the issue of liability.spencer filed this appeal.three questions are presented,namely,whether the superior court erred by instructing the jury improperly as to spencer knowledge of the hazardous condition informing the jury of spencer receipt of workers compensation and precluding testimony from spencer expert witness.we address these issues in that order.
i.the knowledge of dangerous condition jury instruction claim 
spencer first contends that the final italicized sentence of the jury instruction regarding her knowledge of the dangerous condition in the parking lot see,supra was erroneous,because it would effectively absolve a landowner of any duty to its business invitees.relying on koutoufaris dick spencer claims that the instruction is incorrect because it conflicts with delaware comparative negligence statute.
a jury instruction challenged on appeal is subject to de novo review specifically,we review a jury instruction challenged on appeal to determine whether the instruction correctly stated the law and enabled the jury to perform its duty.
koutoufaris does not support spencer position.that case involved a claim that landowners were liable for the rape and abduction of their employee,a waitress.this court concluded that assumption of risk was not a defense to a claim by the employee,who had knowingly walked into a dangerous parking area after she had completed her work.in koutoufaris,this court divided assumption of risk into two categories primary assumption of risk referring to cases where the plaintiff expressly relieves the defendant from all legal duty and secondary implied assumption of risk a plaintiff deliberate and unreasonable choice to encounter a risk created by another breach of duty in koutoufaris,we concluded that adoption of a comparative negligence standard manifests a legislative intention to retreat from a system of inflexible and unforgiving rules in favor of evaluation of the plaintiff conduct on a basis.that is,in delaware the doctrine of secondary implied assumption of risk was subsumed within a comparative fault analysis.therefore,the plaintiff was not barred from recovery for knowingly walking into the dangerous parking lot.
in koutoufaris we noted,however,that where the assumption of risk is of the primary type,a,shifting of the risk of harm,a plaintiff conduct might well constitute a complete bar to recovery,as a matter of law,even in a comparative negligence jurisdiction.this court further observed that although delaware has adopted a modified comparative negligence standard,a ssumption of the risk,to a level greater than a defendant primary negligence,may constitute proximate cause sufficient to bar recovery.but ordinarily,s econdary assumption of risk is a basis for apportionment of fault under the comparative negligence scheme.
in this case,spencer did not expressly relieve or any other party to the law suit of all legal duty.that is,there was no primary assumption of risk.the issue is whether spencer secondarily assumed the risk.spencer had worked at the location for several years,and was familiar with the parking lot.on the day of her accident,she chose not to walk on the sidewalk and instead walked through a stream of water that had developed as a result of the melting snow.thus,spencer assumed the risk of proceeding through the water,which constituted a secondary assumption of risk category.because secondary assumption of risk is generally a question of fact to be determined by the jury its degree remains a jury question.
in delaware,j ury instructions may not be viewed in isolated portions,but must be read in their entirety to determine whether they accurately state the substance of the law.here,the challenged jury instruction was not inconsistent with our system of comparative negligence although the instruction allowed f
