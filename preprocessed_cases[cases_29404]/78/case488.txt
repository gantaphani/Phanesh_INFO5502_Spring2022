introduction 
petitioner,james green,claimed work injuries sustained during to as a police officer for respondent city of compton city.based on reports by agreed medical examiners,city provided workers compensation and later stipulated to benefits.green also sought multiple increases of compensation for unreasonable delay under former labor code section in november of,respondent workers compensation appeals board wcab awarded a single increase in compensation.
green petitioned for writ of review.he contends there was unreasonable delay of compensation following both the agreed medical examiner reports and city stipulation to benefits,thus requiring multiple increases in compensation.city answered that any delay was part of continuous conduct,and,thus,the wcab correctly awarded a single increase of compensation.
we requested briefing on the application of senate bill,which became effective april,and new section green responded that former section applies because it remained operative until june,was not repealed until january,and new section applies prospectively to subsequent unreasonable delay under section city contends that former section is inoperative,and new section applies to all injuries in pending cases under subdivision h.the parties also dispute whether new section eliminates multiple increases in compensation.
we conclude that former section became inoperative and unenforceable on june,and new section became applicable to all injures in then pending cases,including green.although section of provides that the legislation applies prospectively to pending cases,new section,subdivision h section h is an exception to general rule of prospective application.we further conclude that compensation based on an agreed medical examiner opinion and a stipulation to benefits may result in multiple increases in compensation under new section if compensation after both events is unreasonably delayed.finally,we conclude green has waived his claim for earlier vocational benefits.accordingly,the wcab decision is affirmed in part and annulled in part,and the matter is remanded for the wcab to determine whether there were unreasonable delays and whether multiple increases of compensation should be awarded under the new statute.
factual and procedural background 
green claimed orthopedic,psychiatric and internal work injuries from to may,and additional orthopedic injuries on february,and january.he filed applications with the wcab and indicated that vocational rehabilitation was an issue.
city denied benefits,and green and city submitted the medical issues to stephen weiss,and robert faguet,as agreed medical examiners.in a report dated december,weiss indicated the claimed orthopedic injuries were industrial.weiss recommended work restrictions,medical treatment and vocational rehabilitation.in a report dated july,faguet concluded green sustained psychiatric injury at work.faguet also agreed with a december,report of treating physician,alfred bloch,that green had been temporarily disabled and was permanent and stationary fauget recommended work restrictions and vocational rehabilitation,as had bloch.following the medical reports of weiss and fauget,city paid compensation.
green petitions for increased compensation 
green petitioned for increased compensation based on unreasonable delay under former section,and the parties proceeded to a mandatory settlement conference and trial.on march,green and city entered into stipulations with request for award stipulation,which was approved as an award by the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj.the parties stipulated to the claimed injuries,percent permanent disability with indemnity payable at week beginning december,and medical care.
city continued to pay compensation.green alleged additional unreasonable delay of compensation,which city denied.the parties proceeded to trial,and the matter was submitted on the record without testimony.
the wcj awarded temporary disability indemnity from may,to december,permanent disability indemnity from december,to december,and vocational rehabilitation benefits payable at the temporary disability rate from december,and continuing the wcj also awarded a percent increase in compensation under former section against temporary and permanent disability indemnity,medical treatment and vocational rehabilitation benefits.in its opinion,the wcj explained that city failed to provide benefits as required by the opinions of the agreed medical examiners and stipulation.
green petitions for reconsideration 
green petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.he argued that the reports of the agreed medical examiners and the stipulation were separate legally significant events under christian workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,christian,thus requiring separate increases in compensation under former section green also claimed that he was entitled to vocational rehabilitation benefits beginning december,one year earlier than the wcj found,which is the date his condition became permanent and stationary.
in the report to the wcab on reconsideration,the wcj explained that unreasonable delay in paying compensation,whether pursuant to the agreed medical examiners or stipulation,is a single continuous act under christian.in addition,none of the reporting physicians prior to the agreed medical examiners indicated green required vocational rehabilitation.
on november,the wcab adopted the wcj report and decision,and denied green reconsideration.
green petitions for writ of review 
green petitioned for writ of review and contends that compensation indicated by agreed medical examiners which is unreasonably delayed is a basis for increased compensation under berry workmen.bd.d.berry,and is a legally significant event,separate from the stipulation,under christian.since liability was established by the reports of weiss and fauget,and then again by the stipulation,the wcab should have awarded multiple increases in compensation.green also contends that since he was ultimately determined to be entitled to vocational rehabilitation,the wcab requirement of earlier prima facie evidence of vocational rehabilitation is contrary to pereira workers comp.appeals bd.d.pereira 
the court requested additional briefing 
on april,after the petition and answer had been filed,was enacted.this court requested additional briefing regarding the following questions 
do the labor code amendments under senate bill affect the issues raised in the petition for writ of review,vocational rehabilitation benefits beginning december,and additional penalties under labor code section if so,please address how the issues are affected by the new law.
did petitioner waive his arguments supporting entitlement to vocational rehabilitation benefits beginning december,by not raising the arguments before the workers compensation appeals board 
we first address the appropriate standard of appellate review and then general principles of statutory construction that govern our analysis.we then discuss whether new section applies to this case,whether it prohibits multiple increases in compensation previously available under christian,and,finally,whether green is entitled to additional vocational rehabilitation benefits.
discussion 
standards of review 
this case requires us to interpret and apply applicable statutory provisions and new legislation.courts of review interpret governing statutes de novo,even though the wcab construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous factual findings supported by substantial evidence are affirmed however,reviewing courts are not bound to accept factual findings that are erroneous,unreasonable,illogical,improbable,or inequitable when viewed in light of the entire record and the statutory scheme 
ii.principles of statutory construction 
generally,in interpreting legislation,we first look to the plain or ordinary meaning of the language used to determine the legislature intent,unless the language is uncertain every word and clause is given effect so that no part or provision is useless,deprived of meaning,or contradictory if more than one interpretation is reasonable,the language is interpreted consistent with the purpose of the statute and the statutory framework as a whole,using rules of construction or legislative history in determining legislative intent 
when new legislation repeals statutory rights,the rights normally end with repeal unless vested pursuant to contract or common law in workers compensation,where rights are purely statutory and not based on common law repeal ends the right absent a savings clause rights end during litigation if statutory repeal occurs before final judgment by definition there is no final judgment if an appeal is pending there is no injustice if statutory rights end before final judgment because parties act and litigate in contemplation of possible repeal 
when new legislation amends or adds statutory rights,the legislation is applied prospectively unless it is clear from statutory language or extrinsic sources that the legislature intended retroactive application if the legislature intent is unclear,prospective application is mandated a statute is said to apply retroactively when legal consequences of past regulated conduct are affected a newly enacted statute that affects only procedure and not substantive rights is said to be prospective when it is applied to procedures that subsequently arise in litigation 
iii.although new section changes substantive rights,it applies retroactively to the present case 
new section effects a substantive change in compensation 
if new section is only a procedural change,application may be properly characterized as prospective under pebworth since a final determination of green pending claims has yet to be made.under that analysis,we would then not need to determine whether the legislature intended to give retroactive application to a substantive statute.amicus cwci contends that new section is merely a procedural change in calculation of increased compensation,while green and amicus caaa argue that substantive rights are affected.
we agree with green and caaa that new section significantly affects substantive rights and liabilities.strictly procedural statutes affect principally the processes by which a case is litigated in a judicial or administrative forum in some instances they implicate enumerated remedies although a new way of calculating compensation superficially suggests a procedural or remedial change,our supreme court has rejected such a facile analysis.it has instead held changing the measure or method of computing compensation changes substantive rights in aetna casualty,the amendment in question increased the compensation in effect at the time of injury.the supreme court held that the amendment was substantive in nature.the amendment increased the amount of compensation above what was payable at the date of the injury,and to that extent it enlarged the employee existing rights and the employer corresponding obligations.the amendment is therefore clearly substantive in character.aetna casualty,supra,cal d at.
the statutory scheme before us is far more comprehensive in affecting substantive rights than a change in calculation.new section also caps increased compensation at,limits increased compensation to the actual amounts unreasonably delayed and by subtracting payments under section and eliminates increased compensation if a penalty is paid within days or timely treatment has been authorized and the dispute only concerns medical billing since these provisions of new section substantially reduce or in some instances eliminate the right to increased compensation,we conclude that the provisions are fundamentally substantive in nature therefore,we must determine whether applying these provisions to the present case would be a retroactive application,and,if so,whether that is what the legislature intended 
b.the legislature intended new section to apply retroactively 
new section h states the legislature intent.
new section h provides that the section shall apply to all injuries,without regard to whether the injury occurs before,on,or after the operative date of june.city and cwci argue that this language could not more plainly state the legislature mandate that the section is to apply to all injuries,and that includes green,which occurred before the statute operative date green and caaa counter that the language refers only to all injuries where the unreasonable delay in compensation occurs after june,the operative date of the statute.the argument continues that it matters not whether the injury occurred before or after the new law,the key date is when the unreasonable delay occurred.here,the delay occurred before the new law became operative thus,new section does not apply.such a construction,the argument concludes,honors the general language in section of that the amendment is to be applied prospectively,and is also consistent with the presumption against retroactive application of new legislation 
in rejecting this argument we need look no further than to the statute itself.makes clear that retroactive application is what the legislature intended.section states in part that t he amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act was enacted long after the injuries in question.if this is all we had,we very well might conclude uniform prospective application was the rule.however,the use of prospectively in section in senate bill is not dispositive when other language is considered.the term is almost immediately followed by the phrase unless otherwise specified.new section h is precisely a provision that otherwise specifies,and thus is an exception to the prospective application of the new law.subdivision h states explicitly that the new section applies to all injuries,not just to some injuries or those injuries where other events occur after the operative date of new section.the argument posited by green and caaa that new section applies only where unreasonable delay or refusal occurs after june,has no foundation in the statute,and neither legislative history nor other authority supports such a construction.
the delay in the operative status of new section and the repeal of former section does not undermine retroactive application of the new statute.
green and caaa argue further that the legislature decision to continue in effect and not repeal former section,while simultaneously enacting but delaying operation of new section,also evinces an intent to apply the new section prospectively.was enacted on april.by its terms,new section did not become operative until june.former section initially remained operative and only became inoperative on june,it was formally repealed effective january.green and caaa suggest that the concurrent existence of former and new sections in the labor code means that the new section only applies to cases where unreasonable delay of compensation occurred after june.since the unreasonable delay in this case occurred in,former section applies.
we reject this argument for several reasons.foremost,former section is now repealed.neither green nor caaa explains how a repealed statute can apply to the present dispute which is not final additionally,there are simpler explanations for the overlap of former and new sections,reasons that do not undermine the legislative intent of retroactive application.
first,we agree with city that the legislature intended inoperative to mean unenforceable pursuant to kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th,d,kopp unconstitutional statute is inoperative or unenforceable but not void as if repealed or abolished.in the event that new section were determined to be unconstitutional,or otherwise unenforceable,former section could be reinstated without the delay occasioned by the introduction of new legislation second,delaying implementation of new section allowed injured workers and employers to conclude some matters under former section.finally,cwci correctly points out that by delaying the inoperative status of former section and the operative status of new section,the legislature provided an additional period to avoid the statute of limitations created by new section,subdivision g consistent with rosefield packing,supra,cal d,
there are no policy considerations that preclude retroactive application.
caaa further claims that application of new section to prior injuries with unreasonable delays encourages further delay,and more litigation and appeals,all of which undermine the goals of.this argument,again without support in the legislative history or other authority,is simply speculation.what evidence there is suggests the contrary.as cwci correctly notes,the policy actually expressed by the legislature shows its concern with immediately changing the workers compensation system.section of provides this act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,health,or safety within the meaning of article iv of the constitution and shall go into immediate effect.the facts constituting the necessity are in order to provide relief to the state from the effects of the current workers compensation crisis at the earliest possible time,it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.
the mandate under new section h that the section apply to all injuries effects the legislature intent to solve the crisis as quickly as possible by bringing as many cases as possible under the umbrella of the new law.
applying new section retroactively does not reopen,rescind,alter or amend any existing order,decision,or award under section.
section of provides the amendment,addition,or repeal of any provision of law shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award.green and caaa argue that applying new section in this case reopens,rescinds,alters,or amends an existing order,decision,or award,and that under section there is no good cause to do so the argument misstates the import of section.
generally,statutory rights applicable to existing disputes do not survive the repeal or amendment of the statute in question,except in those cases in which appeals have been exhausted and there is a final judgment we conclude that section restates the final judgment rule and makes it applicable in this context 
the term reopening has a special meaning in this setting and typically refers to reopening an order,decision or award for new and further disability under section similarly,the phrase rescind,alter,or amend in section refers to the good cause needed under the wcab continuing jurisdiction to rescind,alter,or amend any order,decision,or award under sections and generally,sections,and apply to orders,decisions or awards that are beyond the reconsideration period under section et or where appeals have been exhausted and a decision is final or no longer pending 
these statutes have no application here.green appealed the wcab decision,the appellate process has not been exhausted,and there is no final judgment.as there is nothing to reopen,rescind,alter,or amend,section prohibition against such action is inapplicable.
iv.the agreed medical examiner opinions and stipulation may each result in liability under new section,and may each qualify as separate,legally significant events under christian 
under former section,increased compensation could be awarded for unreasonable delay in providing benefits that are indicated by the employer own physician.berry,supra,d at.multiple increases in compensation also may be awarded for unreasonable delay in providing owed benefits where there are other legally significant events such as a stipulation of liability.christian,supra,cal th at,d.
green argues that unreasonable delay in compensation occurred after both the agreed medical examiner opinions and the stipulation these two delays are separate,legally significant events under christian and multiple increases in compensation are awardable even under new section.city contends that any unreasonable delay was part of continuous,not separate,conduct under christian,and therefore only a single increase in compensation is permitted.the issue is also moot,city argues,because new section,subdivision a section a eliminates multiple increases of compensation under christian.
a.the agreed medical examiner opinions 
we agree with green that the opinions of weiss and fauget as agreed medical examiners may result in liability for increased compensation under new section.green and city deferred the medical issues to weiss and fauget,whose opinions that compensation is owed became in effect the opinions of each party physician under berry city in fact provided benefits based on the opinions of weiss and fauget,and workers compensation law favors agreed medical examiners in resolving medical disputes fairly and expeditiously thus,strong policy supports the agreed medical examiners opinions as a potential triggering event.new section a allows increased compensation for unreasonable delay prior to issuance of a formal award,and we see nothing in the new law that changes the result in berry.thus,the wcab should determine whether the compensation indicated by the opinions of weiss and fauget was unreasonably delayed under new section.
b.the stipulation 
green and city agreed that compensation also would be provided according to the stipulation.city does not contend that unreasonably delayed compensation under an approved stipulation can not form the basis of an increase in compensation.the stipulation was approved by the wcj,and new section a provides increased compensation where there is unreasonable delay pursuant to an award.the wcab should likewise determine on remand whether the compensation owed pursuant to the stipulation was unreasonably delayed under new section.
new section a does not eliminate multiple increases in compensation 
city contends that new section a prohibits multiple increases of compensation under christian.we do not read the statutory modifications so broadly.as we have noted,new section a makes certain changes in the manner in which increases in compensation are calculated first,the increase is not computed on the entire specie of benefit awarded but on the compensation that was delayed.second,the percentage of the award is increased from percent to a maximum of percent,but the increase is capped at.nothing on the face of the statute precludes multiple increases in compensation when the same benefit is unreasonably delayed more than once.
in christian,the supreme court reversed the court of appeal,which had concluded that multiple increases in compensation were required under the facts of that case.the supreme court did not,however,rule that multiple increases were never warranted rather it held that where a preaward delay has occurred,only one increase in compensation is permitted unless there had been an additional legally significant event.christian,supra,cal th at,d.multiple increases are appropriate,the supreme court wrote,only when the refusal of,or delay in payment of benefits necessarily involved separate and distinct unreasonable acts by the insurance carrier.those multiple penalties involved separate classes of benefits,individual claims for payment or reimbursement of medical or travel expenses,or a repeated refusal or delay in payment of a benefit after the same conduct had already been found by the board to be unreasonable and a prior penalty imposed,or some analogous,legally significant event such as a stipulation of liability by the carrier had intervened between the first act for which a penalty was imposed and the second.id.at,d.
the court observed that the increases can be imposed on both preaward and postaward events as former section expressly authorized both types of increases.significantly,new section a mirrors its repealed counterpart in this respect as each applies to delays in compensation either prior to or subsequent to the issuance of an award.
we find the continued use of the language from former section persuasive.the legislature enacted wholesale changes in the worker compensation system when it passed.we must assume that it was aware of the significant supreme court cases,christian,supra,cal th,d,gallamore workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,in the field we see no indication that the legislature intended an elimination of multiple increases in compensation for conduct occurring either before or after an award,or both,as long as the events are separate and distinct under christian.based on the record before us,the agreed medical examiners opinions and the stipulation were legally distinct events,and support the issuance of multiple increases in compensation provided that the wcab concludes that compensation under each was unreasonably delayed 
v.earlier vocational rehabilitation benefits were waived 
green contends that earlier vocational rehabilitation benefits are not waived.he asserts the wcab addressed the dates on which benefits generally were owed he argued below that vocational benefits were due by implication from the stipulation and it is unreasonable to require a party to raise every legal argument when the law in an area is so well established.
legal arguments omitted from the petition for reconsideration before the wcab and raised for the first time on review are waived under section and heath workmen.bd.d.in his petition for reconsideration,green offered only general arguments based on the evidence and the stipulation in support of his claim to earlier vocational rehabilitation benefits.he failed to assert the legal theories he now offers he is entitled to those benefits under pereira,supra,d.and belmontez workers comp.appeals board th,d belmontez.the legal principles discussed in these two cases were raised for the first time in green opening and reply briefs,respectively green cites no authority that raising an issue generally preserves claimed errors that could conceivably fall within the broadest statement of the issue.such an approach was rejected in heath and auto stores because the wcab would be unable to correct error or provide meaningful review for appellate courts omitting arguments before the wcab which are raised for the first time for review actually invites error and delays final resolution of the case accordingly,green has waived his claim of earlier vocational benefits.
disposition 
the vocational rehabilitation benefits awarded by the wcab are final.the wcab award of increased compensation for temporary and permanent disability indemnity and medical benefits is annulled.the matter is remanded for application of and new section,and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
in,former labor code section provided in relevant part when payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused,either prior to or subsequent to the issuance of an award,the full amount of the order,decision,or award shall be increased by percent.multiple increases shall not be awarded for repeated delays in making a series of payments due for the same type or specie of benefit unless there has been a legally significant event between the delay and the subsequent delay in payments of the same type or specie of benefits.all further code references are to the labor code.
section,subsection a of restates former section.section,subsection b of adds former section shall become inoperative on june,and,as of january,is repealed,unless a later enacted statute,that becomes inoperative on or before january,deletes or extends the dates on which it becomes inoperative and is repealed.section of,which is hereafter referred to as new section,provides in relevant part section is added to the labor code,to read a when payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused,either prior to or subsequent to the issuance of an award,the amount of the payment unreasonably delayed or refused shall be increased up to percent or up to ten thousand dollars,whichever is less.in any proceeding under this section,the appeals board shall use its discretion to accomplish a fair balance and substantial justice between the parties.h this section shall apply to all injuries,without regard to whether the injury occurs before,on,or after the operative date of this section.i this section shall become operative on june.thus,under former section,increases in compensation were based on unreasonable delay in any part of the specie of benefit awarded and computed at the rate of percent of the specie of benefit awarded.the new section provides that increases are based on the actual amount of the unreasonably delayed compensation,and are computed at the rate of up to percent of that compensation,with a maximum of.
section of states the amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision or award of the workers compensation appeals board.
a permanent and stationary status is achieved when the employee has reached maximal medical improvement or his or her condition is well stabilized and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment,tit.
former section,subdivision a,provided in part if the employer fails to commence vocational rehabilitation service in a timely manner as required by section,or otherwise causes any delay in the provision of vocational rehabilitation services,the full maintenance allowance shall be paid in its entirety by the employer,including the amount payable under paragraph of subdivision d of section for the period of the delay.as amended by stats,ch.
in christian,a single erroneous decision not to pay benefits,followed by subsequent demands for payment,resulted in a single increase in compensation under former section.although ruling a single increase applied in that case,our supreme court stated multiple increases may be available when there are separate,legally significant unreasonable delays.christian,supra,cal th at,d.
pereira held that vocational rehabilitation is owed from the date requested,if the employee is ultimately found entitled to the benefit,even before prima facie evidence of need.
we have also received amicus briefs by the california applicants attorneys association caaa,an association of attorneys representing injured workers,filed on behalf of green and by the california workers compensation institute cwci,whose members include insurers and employers,and by the city of los angeles,filed on behalf of city.
