named plaintiffs and appellants irwin albillo and luis montoya are class representatives of the appellant class of independent contractor truck owners and,who contracted to transport freight for defendants and respondents intermodal container services,intermodal container services,doing business as harbor rail transport,interstate consolidation,and interstate consolidation,doing business as cartage service appellants appeal from the trial court statement of decision and judgment holding,inter alia,that respondents were not transacting insurance and,therefore,were not subject to insurance code regulation that respondents did not act in a fiduciary capacity that respondents did not violate the labor code by charging appellants to secure workers compensation coverage and that appellants were not entitled to an award of attorney fees.respondents from the trial court restitution award stemming from the holding that they violated business and professions code section by failing to make certain disclosures required by the federal leasing regulations.
we reverse the trial court finding that respondents are authorized to charge appellants to obtain workers compensation coverage.we conclude that appellants and respondents election under labor code section to come under the provisions of the workers compensation law necessarily subjects them to labor code section,which bars respondents from requiring appellants to cover any portion of the cost of compensation.in all other respects,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
respondents are related transportation entities.the two primary companies are intermodal container service,and interstate consolidation service,a division of intermodal does business as harbor rail transport a division of interstate does business as cartage service.together,these entities are involved in local and interstate intermodal freight transportation,which involves the use of two or more modes of transportation for the continuous movement of freight from origin shipper to destination receiver.intermodal motor carriers,or trucks,are a critical link in the intermodal chain,as they are the only effective means of moving trailers or containers from marine and rail terminals.
respondents do not own any trucks.rather,they transport freight by leasing trucks from truck owners and contracting to have those leased trucks operated by the owner or the owner drivers.appellants are a class of all truck and drivers who drove trucks owned by those,who contracted with respondents to provide transportation services at any time from july,to the present.named plaintiffs irwin albillo and luis montoya are representative of the appellant class.
the primary agreement between appellants and respondents is entitled a lease and subhaul agreement with independent contractor lease agreement.it provides that the contractor,or appellant class member,owns a truck suitable for the transportation of freight,that the respondent carrier is legally authorized to engage in interstate freight transportation,and that both parties desire to enter into an agreement to transport freight.the lease agreement describes the relationship of the parties as between motor carriers,both of whom are engaged in for hire motor carriage.pursuant to the lease agreement,appellants agree to transport freight on respondents behalf in exchange for respondents agreement to compensate them according to a specified or negotiated rate.in addition,the lease agreement specifies that,in order to do business with respondents,appellants are required to purchase and maintain certain types of insurance at their own expense.
in,respondents instituted their own insurance program,which enabled appellants to secure the required coverage by electing to have respondents select,acquire and administer the insurance as part of their fleet or group policy.as a result of this program,respondents modified the lease agreement to indicate that appellants have the option of obtaining such insurance under respondents fleet or group policies.respondents also supplemented the lease agreement with a separate agreement and elections by contractor re insurance coverage and use election agreement,which required appellants to elect either to provide a certificate evidencing the required coverage,or to authorize respondents to obtain the required coverage and to deduct the cost by a settlement offset from appellants compensation.
for those who elect to have respondents obtain the requisite insurance coverage,a schedule of insurance deductions insurance schedule sets forth the type,cost,and deductions regarding the parties agreements as to the acquisition of,and payment for,insurance coverage in connection with the parties lease and subhaul agreement.according to the insurance schedule,respondents charge appellants a weekly administrative fee of percent of their revenue,per week per truck for liability insurance,and per on percent of an appellant weekly gross settlement revenue for workers compensation insurance.the insurance schedule authorizes respondents to deduct these amounts from appellants settlement statements.it also informs appellants that t he amounts charged by respondents to provide the requested insurance coverages or services to appellants may exceed the estimated or final pro rata cost to respondents of providing,or making available,such to appellants.
as a practical matter,since all with whom respondents have contracted have elected to obtain their insurance coverage,including workers compensation coverage,through respondents.between july,and june,the premium payments received from appellants in accordance with the insurance schedule exceeded the premiums respondents paid to secure the insurance by.according to respondents,they were able to realize such savings by securing reasonably priced coverage due to their safety program and fleet size.that money was not accounted for as profit,but was used to fund the administration of the insurance program,the safety program and other related expenses.
beginning in,respondents were also able to achieve some insurance premium savings by eliminating the prior deductible on their million liability policy and,instead,providing a retention of per accident.with this change,respondents intended to continue to make appellants individually responsible for no more than the prior deductible.by reason of the retention,respondents would be responsible for any amount between and.
neither the election agreement nor the insurance schedule informed appellants of any deductible amount or.further,respondents did not provide appellants with certificates of insurance indicating the premium cost and deductible amount.at all times,however,respondents verbally represented to appellants that a deductible applied.
appellants irwin albillo and luis montoya filed the operative first amended complaint on april,on behalf of themselves and similarly situated individuals.previously,the named appellants had filed individual actions against respondents,one in superior court and one before the workers compensation appeals board wcab.by stipulation dated april,the parties agreed to consolidate the actions,which resulted in the filing of the first amended complaint and the dismissal of the prior actions.pursuant to that same stipulation,the parties agreed to certify the matter as a class action and to try the matter before three retired judges to be appointed pro tempore jointly by the superior court and the wcab.
the first amended complaint set forth eight causes of action,including single causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,conversion,money had and received,and four causes of action for violation of business and professions code section.appellants sought damages,declaratory and injunctive relief,and attorney fees.respondents answered on april.
appellants claims were premised on four basic contentions.first,appellants alleged that respondents erroneously classified them as independent contractors instead of employees,resulting in the improper deduction of workers compensation insurance premiums and the denial of other employee benefits.second,appellants claimed that respondents offering insurance to them constituted the illegal transaction of insurance without a license.third,appellants alleged that respondents failed to comply with the disclosure requirements contained in the federal leasing regulations.finally,appellants averred that respondents failure to make adequate disclosures in their insurance program amounted to common law fraud.
trial before a panel commenced on august,and the matter was submitted on september.the trial court issued a proposed statement of decision in january.thereafter,the parties submitted their objections to the proposed statement of decision,as well as further briefing and evidence.
the trial court filed its statement of decision in september.after summarizing the evidence,the trial court ruled in favor of respondents on several claims,finding respondents were not transacting insurance in violation of the insurance code that appellants assumed the status of independent contractors and not employees that the parties election under labor code section to be governed by the workers compensation provisions did not make appellants employees for any other purpose that respondents did not violate the business and professions code by profiting from their provision of insurance to appellants and that appellants failed to satisfy the elements of fraud or deceit.the trial court further found,however,that respondents engaged in an unlawful activity in violation of business and professions code section by failing to comply with the federal leasing regulations disclosure requirements concerning insurance coverage information.specifically,respondents failed to inform appellants in the lease agreement that they would provide a copy of each insurance policy nor did they provide the actual policies respondents further failed to provide appellants with certificates of which must contain detailed insurance information that was never made available to appellants in any form.the trial court granted injunctive relief and restitution to appellants,but declined to award appellants attorney fees.
in january,the trial court entered a final judgment in conformity with the statement of decision.appellants timely filed a notice of appeal,and thereafter,respondents timely filed a notice of.
discussion 
appellants appeal.
respondents unlawfully charge appellants to secure workers compensation insurance.
appellants next contend that respondents improperly required appellants to pay for their own workers compensation coverage.the lease agreement requires appellants to maintain workers compensation insurance coverage for themselves and their employees who render services under the lease agreement.as part of the election agreement,appellants have the option of obtaining workers compensation insurance from respondents to cover themselves and their employees.relevant here,the election agreement provides by entering into this agreement the parties wish only to avail themselves of the provisions of section of the california labor code which permit insurance coverage of independent contractors,and do not intend to alter their independent contractor relationship or create an relationship if appellants elect to obtain workers compensation insurance through respondents,they must agree to pay respondents the entire monthly cost of such insurance coverage by respondents by making appropriate deductions from the settlements of the appellants.the parties stipulated that respondents collected from appellants for the purpose of securing workers compensation insurance.
in their third cause of action,appellants alleged that respondents violated business and professions code section,in part because t he actions of defendants in exacting,deducting and receiving funds from class members to cover the cost of workers compensation insurance are in express violation of state law,including california labor code section.in its statement of decision,the trial court rejected this claim,ruling that labor code section permits persons who are not otherwise qualified as employees to elect to come within the provisions of the workers compensation act act for the purpose of collecting benefits,but that the election does not make appellants employee for all purposes,and there is no need to do so to effectuate the clear purpose of the law.
we disagree.while it is correct that an election under labor code section does not make a person an employee for all purposes,it does expressly subject him or her to the compensation provisions of division of the act.labor code section is one of those provisions,pearl workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,division commences with labor code section.accordingly,we hold that by deducting amounts from appellants compensation to secure workers compensation coverage,respondents violated labor code section.the matter must be remanded to the trial court for a determination as to whether this violation constituted an unlawful,unfair or fraudulent business practice within the meaning of business and professions code section,and,if applicable,for a determination of the appropriate remedy.
a.the workers compensation scheme.
in the early,the combination of industrialization and tort law developments which denied workers recovery for many industrial injuries resulted in a public call for reform.mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.the legislature responded,first enacting a voluntary and later a compulsory workers compensation system,which provided that employers liability for employees injuries were no longer governed by common law tort doctrines instead,employees would be compensated for such injuries without regard to negligence.id.at.
currently,the act,et is a comprehensive statutory scheme that governs the compensation provided to california employees for injuries occurring during the course and scope of their employment.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d,vacanti.the vacanti court explained the rationale supporting this statutory scheme the underlying premise behind this statutorily created system of workers compensation is the compensation bargain.citation.pursuant to this presumed bargain,the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.citation.id.at,d.
the compensation bargain involves benefits and burdens to both the employer and employee a policy of reciprocal concessions underlies the general rule of exclusivity of remedy in exchange for relatively swift and certain compensation for injury,the employee relinquishes the opportunity to recover the greater award which might be had from a jury.the employee is relieved of the burden of litigating claims for damages,while the employer can anticipate and pass on to consumers the lower cost of employee injuries which results from a statutorily prescribed measure of damages.citation.appl lee swett livestock d,italics omitted.
with the purpose of the act in mind,we now turn to the specific statutory provisions at issue to determine whether an employer who elects to have its independent contractors subject to the remedies afforded by the act under labor code section must also be subject to the prohibitions contained in labor code section.neither appellants nor respondents have cited any case addressing this issue,and our independent research indicates that this is an issue of first impression.
b.the plain language of the labor code demonstrates that respondents are precluded from requiring appellants to pay for their own workers compensation insurance.
this issue is purely one of statutory construction and,thus,presents a question of law which this court reviews de novo,city of long beach california citizens for neighborhood empowerment th,haas meisner th,d.
our role in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.to determine that intent,a court first looks to the statutory words themselves,giving to the language its usual and ordinary import.the court construes statutory words in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose.statutory sections relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.holmes jones th,d accord,lungren deukmejian cal d,california mfrs.public utilities com.cal d,young gannon th,d.furthermore,we consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part,giving significance to every word,phrase,sentence,and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.curle superior court cal th,d.at all times,o ur foremost task remains ascertainment of the legislative intent,including consideration of the entire scheme of law of which it is a part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.city of long beach california citizens for neighborhood empowerment,supra,th at.
in addition to general rules of statutory construction,our review is also governed by statute.state farm fire casualty workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,described the unique rule of construction that applies to the workers compensation statutes in interpreting the workers compensation statutes we do not start with whole cloth.we are directed by section to liberally construe the workers compensation statutes with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.see also mcgee street productions workers comp.appeals bd.th,d section provides that statutes contained in divisions and of the labor code shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.
we turn first to the language of labor code section.that provision permits employers and persons not otherwise entitled to workers compensation benefits to appellants and respondents did come under the compensation provisions of this division.by this division,labor code section refers to division of the labor code,commencing with labor code section.see pearl workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,d,vacanti,supra,cal th at,d.divisions and of the labor code contain the statutes regulating workers compensation.furtado schriefer d.blew horner d.
labor code section is likewise located in division.it prohibits an employer from receiving any employee contribution or taking any deduction from employee earnings to cover the cost of compensation,subd.a.stated simply,this provision requires the employer to bear the entire cost of securing compensation,jones kaiser industries cal d,according to section,the entire cost of workers compensation benefits is borne by the employer rymer hagler d.the legislature clearly intended the burden of securing compensation for the employee to be on the employer security fund esis,d.section makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to require his employees to pay their own workers compensation withholding in re marriage of corriveau d.labor code section prohibits financing workers compensation benefits from employee contributions summers newman cal th,d,requiring employee to pay third party litigation a cost of compensation from his or her share of settlement proceeds would be inconsistent with the intent of section.
applying both rules of statutory construction,which require us to harmonize related statutory provisions,and labor code section,which compels us to liberally construe the workers compensation statutes so as to extend benefits to workers,we conclude that an employer who makes an election under labor code section to be governed by the workers compensation provisions thereby becomes subject to the provisions of labor code section.this conclusion is dictated by the plain language of the labor code.parties who elect to come under the compensation provisions of this division necessarily elect to come under labor code section,which is a part of division.a contrary conclusion would be inconsistent with the statutory scheme,as well as with the statutory principle of liberal construction.
respondents arguments do not persuade us to reach a different conclusion.they contend that parties who make an election under labor code section are subject only to the compensation provisions of division,which does not include labor code section.they rely on labor code section,which defines compensation as every benefit or payment conferred by division upon an injured employee they assert that precluding appellants from contributing to the cost of compensation is not a benefit.but we fail to see how this is anything other than a benefit.it is undisputed that appellants paid to respondents to secure workers compensation insurance.without question,it would have been a benefit to appellants to have had respondents,instead,pay this sum.
also relying on the definition of compensation provided in labor code section,respondents reason that an election under labor code section subjects the parties only to the compensation provisions applicable to injured employees.this reasoning,too,is flawed.according to respondents analysis,whether or not the parties labor code election subjected them to certain provisions would depend wholly on the health status of the employee.applied here,respondents therefore would be precluded from requiring an injured appellant to contribute to the cost of obtaining compensation,but would be free to exact contribution from a non injured appellant.this result is untenable.as explained in holmes jones,supra,th at page,d where construction of a statute is necessary,interpretation should produce a reasonable result.where uncertainty exists,the court must consider the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citations.if a statute gives rise to two alternative interpretations,the court should follow the one leading to the more reasonable result.citation.it would be patently unreasonable to construe the term compensation provisions as used in labor code section to apply only when one is injured.
finally,respondents rely on state compensation ins.fund brown th,d,to assert that labor code section does not apply to independent contractors because they are responsible for securing their own workers compensation insurance.though brown involved a situation where independent contractor truckers contracted with a company to transport intermodal freight,any similarity between that case and the instant one ends there.the brown court held that a workers compensation insurer could not recover premiums allegedly owed by a trucking company operator,because the truckers were,as a matter of law,independent contractors ineligible for workers compensation benefits.brown,supra,at,d.here,in sharp contrast,respondents and independent voluntarily elected to come under the workers compensation provisions.the evidence is undisputed that appellants are eligible to receive workers compensation benefits and,in fact,have received such benefits.brown is thus irrelevant.rather,the issue is whether the parties election to come under the workers compensation scheme subjects respondents to the provisions of labor code section.we believe that it does.
legislative history confirms that the requirement that employers pay to secure workers compensation benefits is a compensation provision.
where,as here,legislative intent is expressed by the plain language of a statute,resort to extrinsic aids is unnecessary.but,we may consider legislative history where it buttresses our interpretation of the plain meaning of a statute.citation.jenkins county of los angeles th,d,citing briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d.we thus turn to the legislative history of labor code sections and because it is consistent with the plain meaning of those provisions.it demonstrates that labor code section is one of the compensation provisions by which employers must abide if they elect to come under the compensation provisions of division pursuant to labor code section.
