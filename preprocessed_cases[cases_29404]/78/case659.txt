we have for review a decision of a district court of appeal on the following question,which the court certified to be of great public importance 
may an employee receiving workers compensation benefits litigate entitlement to additional benefits then,having obtained an award of the additional workers compensation benefits,bring suit in circuit court for the personal injuries sustained on the job that were the basis for the award 
martin,jones,so d,dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.we rephrase the certified question to address the factors presented more specifically as follows 
is an employee who is entitled to and has received workers compensation benefits for a workplace injury but has not pursued the compensation case to a conclusion on the merits estopped from later filing a separate civil action against the employer in circuit court for tort damages resulting from the same workplace injury if the employer conduct that caused the workplace injury rises to the level of intentional conduct substantially certain to result in injury for which the exclusive remedy doctrine is not available 
for the reasons that follow,we answer the rephrased question in the negative.
facts and procedural history 
the facts of the underlying action were detailed in the district court opinion below.the essential facts are not in dispute.on may,while working for martin electronics,jones suffered burns over of his body surface when an explosion occurred in a building on martin electronics premises.see martin,so d at.jones did not regain consciousness until july.see id.he endured surgeries and all of his fingers and both thumbs were amputated.see id.from the beginning,martin electronics and its workers compensation carrier voluntarily provided workers compensation benefits.see id.a dispute between the parties arose concerning only the hourly rate for attendant care that jones furnished.see id.jones filed a petition to alter this attendant care benefit with the office of the judges of compensation claims in february of.see id.prior to a contested hearing on the petition,the parties completed a preprinted standard form stipulation by answering questions with regard to the incident.see id.on this form,jones circled yes in response to the statement accident or occupational disease accepted as compensable.see id.on january,the judge of compensation claims entered an order granting the petition,approving and adopting as a finding of fact the parties stipulation to the effect that jones sustained a compensable injury and awarding additional monies for jones attendant services.see id.with a modification not pertinent to the instant matter,the first district affirmed the modification of additional attendant care benefits.see martin elecs.jones,so d dca.
while receiving these compensation benefits,curtis and annie jones the joneses filed the complaint in circuit court in the present case on january,seeking damages in tort.as amended on march,the complaint alleged in pertinent part 
at the time of his injuries,curtis jones was an employee of martin and was in the course and scope of his employment with martin.
while martin did not have an actual intent to injure curtis jones,the injuries to curtis jones were the result of intentional conduct on the part of martin that was substantially certain to result in injury or death.
martin,so d at.martin electronics moved for summary judgment on the basis that jones had elected the workers compensation system as his remedy for the injuries alleged in this civil lawsuit,and,therefore,as a matter of law was precluded from recovering damages from martin electronics in a civil action.see id.at.the circuit court denied martin electronics motion for summary judgment,ruling that jones was entitled to receive workers compensation benefits and also pursue the tort action against martin electronics under the allegations presented.see id.at.the trial court reasoned that martin electronics was not entitled to workers compensation immunity if the facts alleged in the complaint were established.see id.
martin electronics sought review in the first district of the trial court order which determined that it was not entitled to immunity.see id.martin electronics asserted on appeal that jones had elected the workers compensation remedy by actively pursuing the workers compensation claim to a conclusion on the merits,and,therefore,the joneses were judicially estopped from pursuing the intentional tort claim.see id.at.
in its opinion,the first district held that jones had elected his remedy under the workers compensation statutory scheme,reasoning that 
filing a petition for additional attendant care benefits,litigating before the judge of compensation claims on the theory that a covered industrial accident occurred,and obtaining an order predicated on the finding that jones sustained an injury by accident implie d a conscious intent to choose compensation benefits over a tort action.
id.quoting velez oxford dev,so d,dca.ultimately,the district court reversed the trial court order denying martin electronics motion for summary judgment and remanded the case for entry of a summary final judgment in favor of martin electronics.see martin,so d at.the district court also certified the question currently before this court as one of great public importance.see id.at.
review of the first district decision is sought here,which we have granted.see jones martin,so d table.
workers compensation immunity 
florida workers compensation system was designed,intended,and contemplated for workplace injuries that have occurred in the course and scope of employment.the workers compensation system seeks to balance competing interests and provide tradeoffs between employees and employers.specifically,the workers compensation system provides employees limited medical and wage loss benefits,without regard to fault,for losses resulting from workplace injuries in exchange for the employee relinquishing his or her right to seek certain common law remedies from the employer for those injuries under certain circumstances.
on the date jones was injured,section of the florida statutes,provided,the liability of an employer prescribed in s ection shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee.stat.this provision provides the employer immunity from liability for an employer negligence that has caused the employee workplace injury.see aguilera inservices,so d.notwithstanding the tradeoffs provided,we have established and continue to hold that an employer immunity under the workers compensation system does not extend to workplace injuries caused by conduct of the employer so egregious that it is tantamount to an intentional tort.see id.at the workers compensation system limits liability only for negligent workplace conduct which produces workplace injury,but does not extend to immunize intentional tortious conduct.citing turner pcr,so d,w e reaffirm our prior decisions recognizing,as have our district courts and many jurisdictions around the country,that workers compensation law does not protect an employer from liability for an intentional tort against an employee.however,an employee is not precluded from filing an action against his or her employer for intentional conduct substantially certain to result in injury simply because some workers compensation benefits have been paid.see wishart laidlaw tree,so d,dca velez oxford dev,so d,dca.precluding a worker from pursuing a remedy for a workplace injury caused by an employer intentional tortious conduct would conflict with the intent and spirit of florida workers compensation system and would not operate to further its goals if the mere payment of some compensation benefits under the factual circumstances here operated to eliminate such a right.
martin electronics asserts that the joneses are estopped from advancing this action because jones elected his exclusive remedy under the workers compensation statutory scheme by filing for and receiving a change in only the attendant care benefits being paid by martin electronics workers compensation insurance carrier.see martin,so d at.for the re
