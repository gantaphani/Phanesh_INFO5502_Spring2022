jason robidoux sued james corporation james construction james construction and michael muholland,collectively defendants for personal injuries robidoux suffered while working at a construction site.the district court allowed the defendants motion for summary judgment,finding that the rhode island workers compensation act rhode island act applied to the action and barred the claims.because we conclude that the massachusetts workers compensation act massachusetts act applies to this suit and does not bar robidoux claims,we reverse and remand.
facts background 
most of the facts relevant to this appeal are undisputed.in may,james construction,a general contractor incorporated and based in pennsylvania,was working on a project at the newport naval station in rhode island.in search of temporary laborers,james construction contacted a temporary employment agency,northeast temps,labor systems labor systems,which is a massachusetts corporation with its principal place of business in massachusetts.it does also maintain an office in rhode island.in response to james construction request,labor systems dispatched robidoux,a massachusetts resident and labor systems employee,from its fall river,massachusetts office to the rhode island job site.while working at the newport naval station,robidoux was supervised by muholland,a james construction employee who was neither a massachusetts resident nor a rhode island resident.during robidoux work on the project,he discussed his massachusetts residency with muholland.at the conclusion of robidoux assignment,muholland signed a work order that displayed labor systems two massachusetts locations and their corresponding area code telephone numbers.
almost six months later,on november,james construction again contacted labor systems,at one of the area code telephone numbers,to specifically request robidoux services for a different project at the newport naval station.the next day,robidoux picked up a work order and his personal protective equipment at labor systems fall river office before traveling on to rhode island.
robidoux second stint working at the newport naval station lasted approximately six weeks.during the course of this work,robidoux received his paychecks,with rhode island tax withholdings,from labor systems.for robidoux services,james construction remitted payments to an ohio address provided by labor systems.pursuant to a contract between james construction and labor systems,james construction assumed responsibility for supervising robidoux while he was at the construction site.muholland,who was serving as the project superintendent,provided this supervision.additionally,the contract required labor systems to provide workers compensation insurance for the employees it provided to james construction.at the time labor systems and james construction agreed to the contract,labor system already had workers compensation insurance policies from liberty mutual insurance company liberty mutual for massachusetts and from beacon mutual insurance company beacon mutual for rhode island.james construction also required labor systems to provide a certificate of its rhode island workers compensation insurance 
on january,while working with muholland at the newport naval station site,robidoux was seriously injured when a pound compactor fell on him.that same day,without robidoux knowledge,labor systems filed a report of injury so that robidoux could collect rhode island workers compensation benefits.consequently,robidoux began receiving a week from beacon mutual.these payments lasted for almost seventeen weeks and totaled.
on february,robidoux filed a claim for massachusetts workers compensation benefits with liberty mutual.an administrative judge in the massachusetts department of industrial accidents concluded that robidoux was entitled to these benefits,and ordered liberty mutual to take credit for the monies paid by beacon mutual and assume responsibility for future benefits.
on january,robidoux filed a diversity action in the district of massachusetts alleging that the injuries he suffered at the construction site were caused by the defendants negligence.on july,the district court allowed the defendants motion for summary judgment.robidoux muholland,d d.employing massachusetts choice of law principles,the district court determined that rhode island as opposed to massachusetts has a substantially more significant relationship to this litigation and,therefore,this court must apply rhode island law.id.at.the court went on to conclude that,except in circumstances not present in the case at hand,the rhode island act grants special employers,such as james construction,immunity from private action by injured employees.id.similarly,the court concluded that the rhode island act prohibits a plaintiff from suing such as muholland.id.at.robidoux subsequently appealed.
ii.discussion 
summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.cort√©s rivera dep t of corr.and rehab.of the commonwealth of,cir.this court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.id.choice of law determinations are questions of law,which we also review de novo.see crellin,equipmentlease,cir.both parties agree that massachusetts choice of law principles govern this case.
a.a conflict exists between the relevant massachusetts and rhode island law 
t he usual first step in applying conflict of law principles is to ascertain whether there is a conflict among the laws of the various states involved.cohen mcdonnell douglas.
the rhode island act provides that,except in circumstances not alleged in this appeal,t he right to compensation and the remedy for an injury granted by the rhode island act,shall be in lieu of all rights and remedies as to that injury now existing against an employer,or its employees.laws.the defendants assert,as the district court concluded,that this employer immunity extends to special employers that is,person s who contract for services with a general employer for the use of an employee,id.ii and their employees.see sorenson colibri corp.accordingly,the defendants contend,the rhode island act bars robidoux claims against james construction,the special employer,and its employee,muholland.on appeal,robidoux does not dispute this interpretation of rhode island law,and we therefore assume that the rhode island act,if applicable,would bar this action.
the question therefore becomes whether the massachusetts act would similarly bar robidoux claims against the defendants we conclude that it would not.
generally,the massachusetts act bars employees from recovering against their employers for injuries received on the job.barrett rodgers,citing.laws ch,an injured employee retains the right,however,to bring suit against third parties who may be liable for injuries compensable under the massachusetts act.id.citing.laws ch.more specifically,nothing in section fifteen,or in section eighteen or shall be construed to bar an action at law against any person other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter and said insured person employees.laws ch,emphasis added searcy paul,t he statutory language was taken by text and periodical writers as broadly abolishing the common employment doctrine and permitting third party actions by an injured employee against all but his immediate insured employer.
in short,for an employer to be immunized pursuant to the massachusetts act a direct employment relationship must exist between the injured party and the person claiming immunity,and the employer must be an insured person liable for the payment of compensation.roberts delta air lines,cir quoting fleming shaheen.
turning to the second prong of this test,an insured person is an employer who has provided by insurance for the payment to his employees by an insurer of the compensation provided for by this chapter,or is a or is a member of workers compensation group.laws ch.further,massachusetts law requires that,absent an agreement to the contrary,in circumstances involving a special employer and a general employer,the liability for the payment of compensation for the injury shall be borne by the general employer or its insurer.id.emphasis added.
james construction is not an insured person liable for the payment of workers compensation.to the contrary,pursuant to the express terms of their agreement,labor systems assumed responsibility for providing robidoux workers compensation insurance.although james construction may have paid a rate that effectively reimbursed labor systems for that insurance,james construction does not point to any authority suggesting that such an arrangement equates to provid ing workers compensation insurance and being liable for payment of workers compensation.numberg gte,finding that special employer was not an insured person liable for payment of workers compensation,even though it reimbursed general employer for the cost of workers compensation benefits,because there was no agreement that special employer would provide those benefits.consequently,robidoux claims against james construction are not barred by the massachusetts act 
nor would the massachusetts act immunize muholland,as a,from this action.the defendants do not point to any case law suggesting that immunity exists beyond that which is derived from an employer immunity.see.laws ch,nothing in this section,or in section eighteen or shall be construed to bar an action against any person other than the insured person employing such employee and liable for payment of the compensation provided by this chapter and said insured person employees.emphasis added fredette simpson,citing section as creating the massachusetts act immunity.because james construction does not meet the massachusetts act prerequisites for immunity,neither does muholland.
under massachusetts choice of law principles,the massachusetts act governs the defendants immunity 
historically,in tort cases,massachusetts applied the substantive law of the state where the alleged wrong occurred.cosme whitin mach.works.in the last few decades,however,massachusetts has moved to a functional approach for addressing choice of law issues.joseph glannon gabriel teninbaum,conflict of laws in massachusetts part i current choice of law theory,see,new england.gourdeau constr,cosme,at.
this functional approach responds to the interests of the parties,the states involved,and the interstate system as a whole.bushkin,raytheon.in employing this approach,the massachusetts supreme judicial court sjc ha s not elected by name any particular doctrine.rather,it consider s issues by assessing various considerations,including those provided in the restatement second of conflict of laws,and those suggested by various commentators.cosme,at quotation marks and other internal citation omitted see also jasty wright med,cir.
the second restatement provides that,in personal injury cases,the local law of the state where the injury occurred determines the rights and liabilities of the parties,unless,with respect to the particular issue,some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in to the occurrence and the parties.restatement second conflict of laws hereinafter restatement.section of the restatement cites the following factors as relevant to choice of law decisions 
a the needs of the interstate and international systems,
b the relevant policies of the forum,
c the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,
d the protection of justified expectations,e the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,
f certainty,predictability and uniformity of result,and 
g ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.
id.the second restatement further explains that,in balancing the section factors,courts should consider various contacts,including a the place where the injury occurred,b the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,c the domicil,residence,nationality,place of incorporation and place of business of the parties,and d the place where the relationship,if any,between the parties is centered.id.
we also note that the law of a single jurisdiction is not necessarily to be applied to all issues in a particular case rather,we should weigh the relevant considerations according to their relative importance to the particular issue involved.lou otis elevator.citing choate,hall stewart sca,restatement,cmt.d,review denied.
turning to the case at hand,we conclude that the massachusetts act immunity provisions apply to robidoux claims because massachusetts,as compared to rhode island,has a more significant relationship to the parties and the occurrence under the considerations provided in.cosme,at.
first and most importantly,massachusetts interests in this case substantially exceed those of rhode island.robidoux is a massachusetts resident who,after obtaining the approval of a massachusetts administrative judge,received benefits from a massachusetts workers compensation policy for an injury he suffered while employed by a massachusetts company.even where the injury occurs out of state,massachusetts retains a significant interest in the extent to which a resident is compensated for a workplace injury.see,id.at see also.laws ch,expressly authorizing paying benefits for injuries sustained outside the state pevoski pevoski,mass holding,in a wife suit against her husband stemming from a new york car accident,that massachusetts law governed spousal immunity issue in part because the economic and social impact of this litigation will fall on massachusetts domiciliaries and a massachusetts insurer.
in addition to its interest in the amount of robidoux compensation,massachusetts also has a stake in who pays that compensation.specifically,the massachusetts act limits immunity to insured person s employing such employee and liable for payment of workers compensation in part because permitting recovery from other parties may decrease the cost of workers compensation insurance by allowing insurers to recoup benefits in some cases accordingly,massachusetts has an interest in injured employees or insurers being able to recover from parties like james construction and muholland whenever a massachusetts workers compensation policy assumes responsibility for the payment of benefits.
in contrast,rhode island has little interest in how robidoux is compensated or whether these island defendants are protected by immunity.dasha adelman,noting that,although plaintiff was injured in maine,maine interest is significantly diminished because the maine defendants were no longer parties to the case.the defendants argue that the rhode island act immunity provision is in part intended to decrease the cost of doing business in rhode island,and therefore rhode island has an interest in immunizing contractors for any injury that occurs in the state.see also restatement,cmt.b t o deny immunity would frustrate the efforts of that state to restrict the cost of industrial accidents and to afford a fair basis for predicting what these costs will be.as defense counsel conceded at oral argument,however,there is nothing in the record establishing that interstate contractors,like james construction,see a decrease in liability insurance premiums when they take on projects in rhode island as opposed to some other state with less generous immunity rules.
to be sure,rhode island has an interest in regulating conduct within its borders,and it therefore has an interest in applying its own rules to events that occur in rhode island.see lou,at restatement,cmt.d.the specific question in this case,however,is not whether massachusetts or rhode island standards of negligence apply.rather,the issue here pertains to the application of workers compensation immunity rules.consequently,rhode island interests are diminished,and our choice of law analysis therefore place s a greater emphasis on the state in which the parties are domiciled.see lou,at n see also restatement,cmt.d s ubject only to rare exceptions,the local law of the state where conduct and injury occurred will be applied to determine whether the actor satisfied minimum s
