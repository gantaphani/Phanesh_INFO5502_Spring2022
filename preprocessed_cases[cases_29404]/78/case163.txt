in this diversity action,dana henderson appeals a grant of summary judgment to her employer,ardco,ardco.henderson alleges that ardco violated.and michie,which forbid retaliatory discharge for filing a claim for workman compensation and employment discrimination against a qualified individual with a disability.below,henderson also alleged gender discrimination,but has now abandoned this claim on appeal.henderson sought in past and future income and punitive damages,along with other monetary relief.for the reasons that follow,we reverse the district court judgment regarding henderson disability claim.
ardco runs a manufacturing facility in elkton,kentucky,henderson home,where it manufactures doors,particularly for commercial refrigerators.henderson began working there in,and for several years worked on the assembly lines making doors and doorframes.henderson eventually obtained a welding position,for which she was paid an hourly wage of in.on july,henderson injured her back and was forced to leave ardco to recuperate.on,she returned with a doctor note that included restrictions on her physical capacities henderson was not to stoop or bend,and she was not to lift more than pounds or pounds frequently.henderson was not allowed to return to work,and was told by plant manager ed baumann that you know what company policy is you have to be percent to work here.ardco healed rule appears to have been and consistently applied,at least with regard to lifting restrictions,and is assumed to exist for purposes of summary judgment.
in july,henderson wrote to ardco asking for any work consistent with her restrictions,and was told that ardco had no light duty work which you can perform with your medical restrictions.she claims there were jobs available she was not told about,but she never attempted to apply for any specific jobs at ardco.henderson did seek employment elsewhere,briefly working at the american heritage factory and for a longer period at the local grocery,where she was employed as a cashier.in may,following the filing of the present action in august,henderson restrictions were altered to allow her to bend at the waist when needed although her lifting restrictions remained.in june,henderson was rehired by ardco,where she works today,although not as a welder.
originally,henderson pleadings asserted that when baumann denied her reemployment,she in fact was disabled having a permanent partial disability.compl.her current position appears to be that in she was ready,willing and able to return to work as a welder.pl.resp.to def.mot.summ.she nowhere asserts that she sought an accommodation in her job as welder or otherwise,beyond her july letter seeking employment consistent with her medical restrictions.
in resisting ardco motion for summary judgment,henderson asserted and reasserts on appeal that the requirements of the jobs filled by ardco after july were consistent with her medical restrictions,as was her original job.a document obtained from ardco describing the essential job functions for each position at the plant offers limited support for henderson contention.certain positions,such as cut molding job or vinyl punch press job require ability to bend milling jobs require both the ability to bend and ability to stoop.however,several other jobs in ardco machine shop,such as materials handling job or job are listed as having neither of these requirements.lifting requirements are also specified in the essential job functions.for henderson original welding job,the listed lifting requirement is the capacity to lift forty to sixty pounds intermittently can be shared whether or not this is within henderson restrictions is ambiguous and disputed by the parties the other jobs in the machine shop,including those without restrictions,have listed weight requirements of no greater strain than forty pounds occasionally,apparently consistent with henderson restrictions.some jobs have requirements as low as eight pounds intermittently cutting door widths job or one to fifteen pounds intermittently frame cutting job.
henderson claims that despite her ability to work,ardco perceived her as having a disability and that its healed rule is per se discriminatory under.protecting a qualified individual with a disability.henderson also applied for workman compensation following her accident.she believes this application motivated,at least in part,ardco failure to her until june,which is the basis of her claim for retaliatory discharge under.
the district court was troubled by the healed rule labeling it insensitive and repugnant and ardco apparent unwillingness to assess employees individually for their capacity to perform work in the plant.however,it found henderson injury was not so great as to substantially impair her in any major life activities.the court also found that no genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether ardco misperceived henderson condition as more severe than it was.as a consequence,it held henderson was not and is not a person with a disability,and granted summary judgment to ardco on this claim as well as on henderson other claims.henderson timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
on appeal,we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,using the same rule c standard as the district court.hansard barrett,cir.the moving party has the initial burden of proving that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.street bradford,cir.where the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party,there is no genuine issue for trial.matsushita electric industrial,zenith radio,d.
disability discrimination 
we interpret kentucky protections for the disabled consonant with the federal americans with disabilities act.brohm jh properties,cir monette electronic data,cir interpreting michigan statute.in order to establish a prima facie case of discrimination under the ada,a plaintiff must show that he or she is disabled within the meaning of the ada that he or she is otherwise qualified to perform the requirements of the job,with or without reasonable accommodation and that he or she has suffered an adverse employment decision because of the disability.see monette,at.
henderson has produced sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on the second and third elements of this test.the relevant job descriptions and testimony by indicate that henderson may have been qualified for her position in welding as well as for other jobs at ardco.the record also supports the proposition that henderson employment was terminated because of her injured state,and that she was not rehired for the same reasons.these actions would constitute adverse employment decisions based on a henderson condition is considered a disability.all parties acknowledge it is this question,the first element of the test,that is the crux of the case.
a person is disabled for the purposes of the ada if she 
a has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of her major life activities 
b has a record of such an impairment or 
c is regarded as having such an impairment.
as noted,on appeal and at oral argument henderson has abandoned the alternative claim that her restrictions were such that she was actually disabled,instead relying solely on the regarded as part of the ada under c.an individual can be regarded as having a disability if a covered entity mistakenly believes that a person has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities,or a covered entity mistakenly believes that an actual,nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities.sutton united airlines,d ross campbell soup company,cir quoting sutton.henderson proceeds on the second theory,that ardco mistakenly believed her restrictions substantially limited the major life activity of working.in a regarded as case,it is necessary that a covered entity entertain misperceptions about the must believe that one has a substantially limiting impairment when,in fact,the impairment is not so limiting.these misperceptions often resul t from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of individual ability.sutton,at.quoting a see also plant morton int l,cir stating that a regarded as claim occurs when an employee has an impairment that is not substantially limiting but is treated as substantially limiting.
the major life activities involved here include lifting and working.see i specifically listing working and presenting a list that arguably could include lifting see also thompson holy family,cir discussing lifting as a major life activity and restrictions necessary to show a substantial impairment in this activity.working,composed as it is of many activities,has been noted as a particularly problematic category for courts,requiring further elucidation.sutton,at.see also mckay toyota motor,cir.
where possible,it is preferable to identify another more specific impairment before considering ability to work.sutton,at.in this case,the more specific impairments perceived by the defendant are in henderson abilities to lift,bend,and stoop.baumann acknowledged during deposition,for instance,that a ll i did is looked at those weight restrictions.however,ardco healed rule purports to concern the ability to work,linking other physical impairments to this ability,and requiring us to focus on whether ardco perception of henderson was such that they misperceived or treated her physical restrictions as substantially limiting her ability to work when in fact they were not substantially limiting.see plant,at.
sutton makes clear that in order to satisfy a,an individual must be precluded from a substantial class of jobs.at.see also murphy united parcel,d stating that to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working,one must be regarded as precluded from more than a particular job j i providing that t he inability to perform a single,particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major activity of working.a class of jobs is defined as t he job from which the individual has been disqualified because of an impairment,and the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training,knowledge,skills or abilities,within that geographical area,from which the individual is also disqualified because of the impairment.j ii b.
the defendant is correct that the case of hutchinson united parcel,tracks this one in several respects,but a closer analysis of hutchinson suggests a distinction.in that case,a plaintiff with lifting restrictions alleged discrimination by means of ups similar healed rule,claiming she had been regarded as disabled.as did the district judge here,the hutchinson court considered the rule outrageous but found the employee was insufficiently impaired to qualify as disabled,and that her employer did not perceive her as disabled.id.at.the crucial distinguishing feature of this case comes on this latter point,however.the district court found the plaintiff had shown only that ups believed her incapable of the narrow task of lifting between and lbs.id.at.
in this case,however,plant manager baumann stated,there is not a job in the plant that her restrictions would not bump into.there are two ways to interpret baumann statement.one way,more favorable to the defendant,is that the written job descriptions are incomplete and that the reality of the shop floor is that workers using the frame saw and doing other jobs will actually have to bend or stoop or lift weights of greater than pounds regularly or pounds frequently,or at least that physical requirements are significantly understated by their written descriptions however,a second reading of baumann view is that he considers someone with physical restrictions unable to make it doing factory work,even if it is within the technical requirements of the worker restrictions,that he considers it too risky or problematic to employ workers with whom he has to be cautious not to push much beyond the essential functions of their job.this latter interpretation broadens the scope of the perceived disability and if proven,could constitute disability discrimination.
even if henderson shows that ardco perceived her as unable to do a larger class of jobs,she must show that this larger class is sufficiently substantial to satisfy the rule in sutton.our recent case law on what qualifies as substantial appears to support henderson claim.interpreting sutton,the majority of a panel of this court has held that the inability to perform the manual tasks associated with assembly line work may qualify as a disability under the ada.see williams toyota motor,kentucky,cir,cert.granted,reversing grant of summary judgment for.williams had claimed that her tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome,causing her limited mobility and pain in using her neck,shoulders and arms,limited her in the major life activity of doing manual tasks as well as the major life activities of lifting and working.we stated that her ability to do household manual tasks does not determine whether her impairment substantially limits her ability to perform the range of manual tasks associated with an assembly line job.id.at.
understanding the holding in williams is complicated because the court judgment that williams was physically disabled relied on how her impairments seriously reduce d her ability to perform the manual tasks that are.id.at.this appears to combine assessment of williams impairment in manual tasks and her impairment in working,and inquiries into the existence of the requisite level of impairment should,as a general matter,be conducted in a separate and distinct fashion for each major life activity on which the plaintiff relies,especially in light of the need,when a plaintiff claims an impairment in the major life activity of working,for particular evidence on such matters as local economic conditions and the plaintiff educational background.see id.at boggs,dissenting noting that williams had not demonstrated a substantial impairment in working,and rejecting the use of a subclass of skills not subject to the limitations on working claims.
however,whatever one might say about the analytical structure underlying our rule,the law of this circuit is that someone like williams is disabled.if ardco perceived henderson to be approximately as impaired as williams,then henderson states a valid regarded as claim.ardco healed rule,may,for purposes of summary judgment,be interpreted as treating henderson as incapable of work in a manufacturing operation.so construed,it appears to designate a level of impairment within the same range we have found as disabling in williams.
we have also held that an individual may be disabled by a lifting restriction of pounds,by being substantially impaired in the major life activity of working,if that restriction prevented him from performing medium to heavy lifting and other forms of manual labor,and those jobs constituted the majority of the jobs for which that plaintiff is suited based on his age,education,and experience.burns enters,cir finding plaintiff qualified as disabled under the ada by an impairment that reduced by at least of the jobs previously available to him.similarly,henderson appears to have raised a genuine issue of material fact that ardco perceived her as unable to perform anything but light duty work,and that it perceived that medium to heavy manual labor constituted a majority of the jobs available to her based on her age,education and experience.
the interpretive guidance provided on substantial limitation of working also supports the view that this case is inappropriate for summary disposition.as an illustration,the eeoc indicates that an individual who has a back condition that prevents the individual from performing any heavy labor job would be substantially limited in the major life activity of working because the individual impairment eliminates her ability to perform a class of jobs.this would be so even if the individual were able to perform jobs in another class,the class of jobs,app.at quoted in burns,at depaoli abbott laboratories,cir quoting same language.hence,with regard to the issue of perception,baumann acknowledgment that right now she working at the,so obviously she can do some things does not sho
