background 
because plaintiff does not challenge the district court recitation of the facts,we summarize these from the district court order granting summary judgment,vol.i at.plaintiff was initially employed by defendant in starting as a programmer analyst.in march of,she moved to the human resource management information services group as a human resource systems.id.at.in december of,she began to feel pain and discomfort in her hands she filed her workers compensation claim in april of.id.at.that june she discussed with her manager,wilson,the fact that her hands were bothering her.id.at.plaintiff request for a different keyboard was granted,but she neither received it nor followed up in obtaining it.id.in july,plaintiff earlier request to reduce her hours was granted,and she began a job on july.id.throughout her previous employment with defendant it appears she had worked full time.on july,plaintiff underwent her first medical evaluation,at which time the workers compensation claim physician,watts,reported that the condition with her hands was likely related to repetitive keyboard activities at work.id.watts permitted plaintiff to continue working,but she did not return to work.in early august she obtained a note from watts which took her off work until further notice.id.at.
in october of,plaintiff was released to work with the following restrictions no use of keyboard.verbal training of new employees.id.at.she returned on a restricted basis about the first of november.on november,watts continued the restriction of not using the keyboard,but on december,he released her for one hour of keyboarding per day,knowing she was working a day.id.
about december,wilson sent plaintiff a letter telling her not to report to work pending defendant receipt of further medical information about her and her prognosis.id.at.on january,watts furnished a report expressing doubt plaintiff would be able to return to full,unrestricted duty as a human resource system.he did think,however,that she might eventually be able to perform heavy keyboard usage half the time she was working.id.at.
wilson then contacted plaintiff asking her to identify potential accommodations that might permit her continued employment.id.in march,the human resources manager sent plaintiff a letter confirming that she had been asked to suggest accommodations but had not provided any.id.the letter further advised plaintiff that she was being placed on leave under the family and medical leave act fmla and that she could return to her normal duties if her medical condition so warranted,or,alternatively she could seek another position within the organization.the letter signed off with the admonition that if,after the leave period under fmla,plaintiff was unable to return to her normal duties and had not found another position,she would be terminated.id.at.
on march,watts furnished another report in which he noted that plaintiff did not at that time intend to seek employment but might be interested in returning to work without keyboarding restrictions to see if she could manage.watts thought it would not hurt to try that for several weeks and offered to release her if she contacted his office.plaintiff did not request a release.id.at.
defendant terminated plaintiff on june.in the july letter confirming her discharge,defendant stated 
your employment ended as of june,because you did not return to your normal job duties and you were not placed on another position consistent with your physical condition and job skills.

issue presented 
the issue presented both to the district court and on appeal to this court is whether an employer is shielded from liability under for terminating an employee who at the time of discharge is unable physically to perform her assigned duties if at the time of termination that employee is absent from work while on ttd as described in.
district court ruling 
the district court analysis contains a general discussion of the elements needed to prove a prima facie case of retaliatory discharge,which are employment,injury,medical treatment putting the employer on notice that treatment has been rendered for a injury,and consequent termination.see buckner motors,see,vol.i at.noting that only the fourth element was at issue,the court held that the mere fact that plaintiff termination occurred after she had filed a workers compensation claim was not dispositive.in order to show consequent termination,a plaintiff must produce evidence that gives rise to a legal inference her firing was significantly motivated by retaliation for filing the claim.taylor cache creek nursing,citing wallace halliburton.
neither oklahoma cases nor this court cases addressing alleged retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim,are directly relevant to the question at hand,however,because they involve.see,cache creek,at blackwell shelter mut.ins,cir.plaintiff in this case is not alleging retaliatory discharge for exercising a right under.a but rather discharge in violation of.
the district court also relied on its own earlier decision,affirmed by this court in taylor,cir,finding that p laintiff,while remaining on temporary total disability,advised defendant he would never be able to return to his route driving job,a fact subsequently confirmed by his doctor.accordingly,the court concluded that plaintiff had not established that he was terminated solely based on his absence from work here the district court held that plaintiff had been given ample opportunity to heal,vol.i at,and that continuation of ttd does not,in fact,provide an absolute right to continued employment.id.at.thus,the court concluded that even though plaintiff was receiving ttd at her termination,the facts of this case fall within an exception to the absolute prohibition seemingly afforded by the provisions of.id.
review principles 
it is the duty of the federal appellate courts,as well as the trial court to ascertain and apply the state law where it controls decision.riley brown root,cir quoting huddleston dwyer.this court must therefore ascertain and apply oklahoma law with the objective that the result obtained in federal court should be the result that would be reached in an oklahoma court.wood eli lilly,cir.in so doing,we must apply the most recent statement of state law by the state highest court.id.at.we review the district court interpretation of state law de novo.see blanke alexander,cir.
it is also incumbent for a panel of this court to follow an earlier panel interpretation of state law,absent a supervening declaration to the contrary by that state courts or an intervening change in the state law.stauth union fire ins,cir citing koch koch,cir,cert.denied,d.the crux of this case requires this panel to analyze the guiding precedent in this circuit and determine whether the oklahoma supreme court has issued a supervening declaration to the contrary.
circuit precedent 
in wiles michelin north america,cir,the first precedential case to address the interplay between the provisions of.b and the plaintiff,a michelin employee,was injured in a accident and commenced workers compensation proceedings he was then placed on ttd.id.at.michelin medical leave policy provided that the maximum duration for either medical absence or light duty assignment was months.if the employee was unable to return to his former assignment or unable to bid on another,he would be terminated.id.wiles was terminated months after his injury,while still receiving ttd compensation.id.at.
wiles sued michelin,claiming.b prohibits employers from discharging employees who are on temporary total disability solely because of absence from work.id.at.michelin countered that wiles had not been fired because of his absence,but because medical evidence showed wiles had permanent injuries preventing him from performing his assigned duties.id.michelin further argued that the addition of.b to the statute did not affect an employer ability to discharge an employee for the reason set forth in.c.michelin moved for summary judgment,claiming the undisputed evidence showed wiles injuries prevented him from doing his assigned duties at the time of his termination,and that michelin was therefore shielded from liability by.id.
wiles both disputed michelin evidence and moved for partial summary judgment on the liability issue,arguing that,as a matter of law,an employer who discharges an employee during a period of total temporary disability can not defend against a claim of wrongful discharge on the ground that the discharge was based on the employee inability to perform his assigned job duties,because every employee on ttd is unable to perform his job duties.to allow an employer to use to legitimize discharging an employee on ttd would render meaningless the prohibition set forth in.b.id.wiles further argued that the only logical way to harmonize.b and c would be to hold that an employer is not required to rehire or retain any employee who is unable to perform his assigned job duties once temporary total disability has ended,but may not rely on as a defense to discharging an employee on ttd.id.at emphasis added.
the district court denied the parties summary judgment motions,except to the extent that wiles may be terminated if he has been determined to be unable to ever perform his job duties even though he is on temporary total disability at the time of his termination.id.ultimately the jury found for michelin.id.at.
on appeal,this court recognized the pierce holding that the act did not expressly provide employees with an excused absence from work during their healing period,and that the employer did not violate the act when it discharged the employee due to his absence because the employee absence from work was not itself a protected activity.id.at further quotation omitted.wiles assumed the legislative amendment was a response to the pierce decision,but did not view the amendment as a repudiation of pierce.id.this court concluded,as had the district court,that the amendment simply added another activity that is protected against employer retaliation to the list of protected activities contained in,rejecting wiles argument that does not apply to an employee under ttd.id.at.addressing the interplay of.b and c,this court stated 
pursuant to of oklahoma workers compensation act,an employer may not discharge an employee during a period of temporary total disability solely because of the employee absence from work.an employer may,however,discharge an employee during a period of temporary total disability because the employee can not perform his assigned job duties.
this court did,however,disagree with the district court conclusion that the protection of applies only to employees who are permanently unable to do their assigned duties.id.at.seeing no indication that the amendment was intended to radically change,this court concluded that an employer need not establish an employee is permanently unable to perform his assigned duties in order to legitimately discharge the employee in accordance with.c.id.footnote omitted.
this court subsequently followed wiles in taylor 
the record indicates that defendants terminated plaintiff because he was physically unable to perform his job.plaintiff,while remaining on temporary total disability,advised defendants he would never be able to return to his route driving job,and plaintiff doctor subsequently confirmed this.accordingly,plaintiff did not establish that defendants terminated him solely on the basis of absence from work in violation of the oklahoma workers compensation act.
in this case,plaintiff was unable to perform her assigned duties at the time of her termination,as in wiles.it is less clear whether she would ever be able to return to work,and there is no indication,as there was in taylor,that she had advised defendant she would never be able to return to her particular job.nonetheless,absent any contravening state authority,under wiles,summary judgment for defendant would have been precedentially proper.
recent oklahoma authority 
shortly before the district court entered its summary judgment order,the oklahoma supreme court decided upton state ex rel.department of corrections,the first oklahoma case to consider the effect of the termination of an employee on ttd under.b.in upton,the worker was a state employee who had suffered an injury and was awarded temporary total disability.id.at.the employee also received leave without pay from may of through september of under the provisions of the oklahoma personnel act.stat.tit,to.he was terminated while still receiving ttd for being absent from the job for more than one year under the personnel act provision granting an employee on leave without pay the right to return to his or her original position,within one year,subject to rules promulgated by the office of personnel management 
the employee pursued administrative and judicial remedies challenging his termination.the oklahoma court of civil appeals upheld the trial court determination that.b prohibited upton termination solely for absenteeism in excess of one year since he was receiving ttd.id.at.the oklahoma supreme court granted certiorari to consider the interplay of.b and d,which the court noted were in apparent conflict.id.the court recognized that when the personnel act termination provisions were adopted,neither enacted legislation nor oklahoma extant jurisprudence condemned an employer discharge of an employee who was receiving ttd,so long as the discharge was not retaliatory.upton,at citing pierce,at.the court noted,however,that the legislative amendment to had altered established legal precedent and denied an employer the right to dismiss an employee while is receiving ttd.id the upton court further recognized that d oubtless,the amendment of evinced legislative intent that a claimant was to be accorded protection from discharge based solely upon absenteeism while receiving,during the heal
