the family of brandon clark was awarded workers compensation death benefits after clark died from the combination of drugs prescribed following a fall at work.the court of appeal overturned the award,reasoning there was insufficient evidence that the drugs prescribed for the work injury contributed to the death.we reverse the court of appeal judgment.
background 
in september,the year old clark fell eight to feet while working as a carpenter for south coast framing,hereafter the employer.he suffered neck and back injuries as well as a concussion.clark workers compensation doctor prescribed various drugs to treat these injuries,including elavil an antidepressant,neurontin a neuronal pain reliever,and vicodin a pain reliever.in january,clark personal doctor additionally prescribed xanax an medicine and ambien a sleep aid.
on the morning of july,clark wife was unable to rouse him and he was pronounced dead at the scene.at the time of his death,clark had elavil,neurontin,xanax,and ambien in his blood.vicodin was detected in his urine the autopsy surgeon concluded the death was accidental and is best attributed to the combined toxic effects of the four sedating drugs detected in his blood with associated early pneumonia.the first two medications were prescribed by the workers compensation physician.there was no dispute that clark died as a result of the combined effects of some of the drugs he took.the dispute centered around which drugs played a role,how big that role was,and why the drugs were prescribed.
clark wife,jovelyn,and their three minor children hereafter the family sought death benefits,arguing medications prescribed for clark industrial injury caused his death.jovelyn stated at her deposition that clark personal doctor had prescribed ambien because clark was having trouble sleeping.before the accident,clark had sometimes taken tylenol pm to help him sleep.clark physician prescribed xanax for an anxiety attack suffered just before an unrelated surgical procedure.clark also received epidural shots from his workers compensation doctor to alleviate continuing neck and back pain.shortly after the second epidural injection,clark complained to his wife and brother that he would experience blackout episodes.clark continued to suffer from pain,which had gotten progressively worse and was not relieved by the injections.
daniel bressler concluded clark died of an accidental drug overdose.his supplemental report stated that t he specific combination of medicines he was on,which included xanax,ambien,flexeril,neurontin,elavil,and vicodin,all separately and in combination had the capacity to induce respiratory depression,and even respiratory arrest.bressler also found that clark reports to his wife and brother of altered states of consciousness were probably warning episodes of untoward synergistic respiratory depression central nervous system depression prior to the date of death.
the parties agreed upon thomas bruff as a qualified medical examiner.bruff reported that neurontin did not have a role in this particular case and elavil was prescribed in such low dose,and blood levels show that the medication was likely taken as prescribed.bruff concluded however,ambien and xanax prescribed by clark personal physician were found in excess of what would be normally considered peripheral blood concentrations.both these medications work in a similar fashion and would be considered at least additive in their effects.it is my opinion that it is just this additive effect of ambien and xanax that caused sedation significant enough to result in the events leading to clark death.thus,bruff report concluded that clark overdose was caused solely by medications prescribed by his personal doctor and not his workers compensation physician.
bruff subsequent deposition testimony retreated somewhat from his report.bruff maintained that neurontin played no role in clark death.however,he testified that elavil may have had a small role at the levels found.although he believed ambien and xanax had more weight,he could not absolutely slam the door and say elavil had no effect.clark elavil level was elevated for his prescription level but insufficient to be fatal as the sole or predominant cause of death.when asked if elavil,in combination with ambien and xanax,could have contributed to clark death,bruff answered,it possible and that elavil could be an incremental contributor,although the xanax and ambien being in the same class and at a much higher dose kind of carried the day.bruff reiterated that elavil was way down there as a cause of death and it would be really speculative to place a percentage on it.when asked if elavil might have been what just put it over the edge to cause clark death,bruff agreed it was possible but t he exact amount is way down there and we literally are dancing about the minimum level of causation bruff acknowledged elavil was additive and part of the causation pie,but he could not assign a number reflecting the percentage of causation attributable to it,suggesting it would be closing your eyes and throwing a dart at a dartboard kind of stuff or just pulling numbers out of the sky.when asked again to assign a number,bruff responded w e looking at one percent causation and we dangling right down there,but it would be medically improper to sit here and say that i can pull a percentage out.he acknowledged,it not zero,but it certainly not twenty percent either,where it a no brainer.bruff noted vicodin was detected in clark urine,but not blood.asked if vicodin could have contributed to the death,bruff stated it potentially a cause,but it so miniscule,it like you have a big twelve inch pie and a couple little crumbs off the crust are due to the vicodin.you would even notice it if you served up the pie,having two little flakes gone.
there was conflicting evidence as to why clark physician prescribed ambien.his wife testified he had taken tylenol pm before the accident to help him sleep,but after the fall the tylenol pm was not working.the physician noted,however,that clark was not in pain when he had trouble sleeping.
the workers compensation judge wcj awarded death benefits to the family,finding clark death resulted due to the medications he was taking for his industrial admitted injury the wcj explained,it is clear that the elavil prescribed by the doctors for the industrial injury as well as the vicodin acted as concurring causes such that,even without the liberal construction of labor code,the death of brandon clark was a result of the original industrial injury the wcj further found that the applicant was suffering from continued or chronic pain from his industrial neck,back and head injury and that he was having difficulty sleeping because of that pain,and that the doctors prescribed him both the ambien and the xanax for the inability to sleep.
the employer petitioned the workers compensation appeals board board for reconsideration,arguing no substantial evidence supported the wcj causation finding.the wcj issued a report recommending the petition be denied.the board adopted the wcj report and denied reconsideration.the court of appeal granted the employer petition for writ of review and reversed.we granted the family petition for review.
ii.discussion 
labor code section,subdivision a provides that workers compensation liability shall,without regard to negligence,exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment and for the death of any employee if the injury proximately causes death.the requirement of labor code section is twofold.on the one hand,the injury must occur in the course of the employment.this concept ordinarily refers to the time,place,and circumstances under which the injury occurs.citation.on the other hand,the statute requires that an injury arise out of the employment it has long been settled that for an injury to arise out of the employment it must occur by reason of a condition or incident of the employment citation.that is,the employment and the injury must be linked in some causal fashion.latourette workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,fn.omitted latourette,quoting maher workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,maher.the applicant for workers compensation benefits has the burden of establishing the reasonable probability of industrial causation.latourette,at,d,quoting mcallister workmen.bd.cal d,mcallister.if the injury causes death,the worker dependents are entitled to a death benefit,subd.b.as discussed post,workers compensation liability may also encompass a subsequent nonindustrial injury or death attributable to the initial industrial accident.
the question here is the required nature and strength of the causal link between the industrial injury and death.tort law and the workers compensation system are significantly different.one result of the difference is the role and application of causation principles.a lthough labor code section refers to proximate cause,its definition in workers compensation cases is not identical to that found in the common law of torts.citation.in fact,the proximate cause requirement of labor code section has been interpreted as merely elaborating on the general requirement that the injury arise out of the employment.citation.the danger from which the employee injury results must be one to which he was exposed in his employment.citation.all that is required is that the employment be one of the contributing causes without which the injury would not have occurred.citation.latourette,supra,cal th at,fn,d,quoting maher,supra,cal d at,fn.
legal causation in tort law has traditionally required two elements cause in fact and proximate cause.an act is a cause in fact if it is a necessary antecedent of an event.ppg industries,transamerica ins.cal th,d.this has traditionally been expressed as the but for test,if the injury would have happened anyway,whether the defendant was negligent or not,then his or her negligence was not a cause in fact.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.torts,see viner sweet cal th,d.california has definitively adopted the substantial factor test of the restatement second of torts for determinations.citation.under that standard,a cause in fact is something that is a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.rutherford owens illinois,cal th,d.t he substantial factor test subsumes the but for test.mitchell gonzales cal d,d,see viner,at,d.the substantial factor standard is a relatively broad one,requiring only that the contribution of the individual cause be more than negligible or theoretical.citation.thus,a force which plays only an infinitesimal or theoretical part in bringing about injury,damage,or loss is not a substantial factor citation,but a very minor force that does cause harm is a substantial factor citation.this rule honors the principle of comparative fault.bockrath aldrich chemical cal th,d,witkin,summary of cal.law,supra,torts.
on the other hand,the workers compensation system is not based upon fault.it seeks to ensure that the cost of industrial injuries will be part of the cost of goods rather than a burden on society,to guarantee prompt,limited compensation for an employee work injuries,regardless of fault,as an inevitable cost of production,to spur increased industrial safety,and in return,to insulate the employer from tort liability for his employees injuries.borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d,see cal,art.xiv,chevron,workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.accordingly,t he statutory proximate cause language of section has been held to be less restrictive than that used in tort law,because of the statutory policy set forth in the labor code favoring awards of employee benefits.in general,for the purposes of the causation requirement in workers compensation,it is sufficient if the connection between work and the injury be a contributing cause of the injury nash workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see latourette,supra,cal th at,fn,d,maher,supra,cal d at,fn,see also.
the court of appeal reversed the wcj factual finding of proximate cause here,concluding no substantial evidence supported the finding.the court reasoned that bruff deposition testimony,even if considered a change of opinion from his earlier report,was largely based on surmise,speculation,conjecture and guess,noting that he could not place a percentage figure approximating the level of causation attributable to the industrially prescribed medications.the court of appeal reasoned here,bruff admitted that it is difficult to make a reasonable medical analysis regarding elavil precise contribution to brandon death.he also stated that making that kind of determination really gets to be speculative.liberally construing bruff testimony and report in its totality,we conclude the evidence did not establish industrial causation.rather,the evidence demonstrates that if elavil played a role at all,it was not significant such that it constituted a material factor contributing to brandon death.italics added.
the court of appeal thus concluded that,although elavil played a role in clark death,it was insufficient to prove proximate causation because it was not sufficiently significant or a material factor.this analysis fails to honor the difference between tort law principles and the application of the workers compensation scheme.tort liability only attaches if the defendant negligence was a significant or substantial factor in causing injury.in the workers compensation system,the industrial injury need only be a contributing cause to the disability.
in states that permit it,tort law mitigates liability by recognizing comparative fault.a defendant liability may be reduced by the degree to which a plaintiff own negligence contributed to the injury.under workers compensation,generally,liability is mitigated by apportioning monetary compensation to the degree that an industrial injury contributed to the disability.however,as we discuss later,apportionment is not applied in death claims.
we have recognized the contributing cause standard since the very beginning of the workers compensation scheme.in kimbol industrial acc.commission cal,we adopted the definition of arising out of employment given by the supreme judicial court of massachusetts the injury arises out of the employment when there is apparent to the rational mind,upon consideration of all the circumstances,a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.under this test,if the injury can be seen to have followed as a natural incident of the work and to have been contemplated by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the employment,then it arises out of the employment.but it excludes an injury which can not fairly be traced to the employment as a contributing proximate cause and which comes from a hazard to which the workman would be equally exposed apart from the employment.id.at,italics added,quoting in re mcnicol.
contributing proximate cause within the meaning of kimbol has been applied more broadly in the workers compensation context than in tort law.death attributable to both industrial and nonindustrial causes may support a death claim,and industrial causation has been shown in an array of scenarios where a work injury contributes to a subsequent nonindustrial injury.an employee is entitled to compensation if a new or aggravated injury results from medical or surgical treatment for an industrial injury.fitzpatrick fidelity casualty cal d,georgia casualty indus.acc.com,death from anesthetic see maher,supra,cal d at,adverse drug reaction when treatment was required for employment ballard workmen.bd.cal d,ballard drug addiction to prescribed pain medication.causation may also be shown if an industrial injury contributes to a later nonindustrial accident or injury.see lundberg workmen.bd.cal d,industrial back injury contributed to later ruptured disc ferreira workmen comp.appeals bd.d.ferreira hernia suffered at work contributed to later hernia suffered at home state comp.ins.fund.acc.com.d.state comp.ins.fund carpenter industrial eye injury contributed to later nonindustrial accident while using a saw at home.indeed,even a worker suicide may be compensable if an industrial injury contributed to it.see chu workers comp.appeals bd.th,d burnight industrial acc.com.d.
a corollary of the principles of workers compensation is that an employer takes the employee as he finds him at the time of the employment.ballard,supra,cal d at,maher,supra,cal d at,eastman industrial acc.com.cal,eastman.thus,an employee may not be denied compensation merely because his physical condition was such that he sustained a disability which a person of stronger constitution or in better health would not have suffered.duthie workers comp.appeals bd.d.see maher,at.
further,the acceleration,aggravation or lighting up of a preexisting disease is an injury in the occupation causing the same.tanenbaum industrial acc.com.cal d,see brodie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,ballard,supra,cal d at,eastman,supra,cal.at,see also industrial indem.exch.acc.com.d,miner died from dust exposure at his last workplace,even though similarly exposed at previous worksites.on this point,mcallister,supra,cal d,and ballard,supra,cal d,are instructive.mcallister affirmed the award of a death benefit to the wife of a firefighter who died of lung cancer.substantial evidence established the firefighter had inhaled toxic smoke throughout his years of service,causing his cancer.mcallister rejected the argument that the claim should have been denied because the firefighter also smoked about a pack of cigarettes a day for some years.mcallister,at.mcallister noted that the more smoke decedent inhaled from whatever source the greater the danger of his contracting lung cancer.his smoking increased that danger,just as did his employment.given the present state of medical knowledge,we can not say whether it was the employment or the cigarettes which actually caused the disease we can only recognize that both contributed substantially to the likelihood of his contracting lung cancer.as we noted,however,in employers.ins.industrial acc.com.cal d,the decedent employment need only be a contributing cause of his injury.and in bethlehem steel industrial acc.com.cal d,we pointed out a particular instance of this principle when we stated that it was enough that the employee risk of contracting the disease by virtue of the employment must be materially greater than that of the general public.thus in bethlehem we allowed an award to an employee who contracted a contagious eye disease,since he had shown that the disease was more common at his place of employment than among the public.although decedent smoking may have been inadvisable,respondents offer no reason to believe that the likelihood of contracting lung cancer from the smoking was so great that the danger could not have been materially increased by exposure to the smoke produced by burning buildings.id.at.
in ballard,a secretary suffered a back injury at work and was prescribed pain medication.having a low tolerance for pain of any kind,she took more than her prescribed dosages and became addicted.ballard,supra,cal d at.further,she sought out illegal drugs and became addicted to those as well.the referee denied her workers compensation claim,concluding that t he most likely cause of her addiction is the obvious neurotic personality problems and the injury simply serves to provide a rationalization for her recourse to drugs.id.at.ballard reversed,reasoning that the referee findings did not serve to warrant denial of recovery if the addiction resulted in part from the prescribed drugs.the employer takes the employee as he finds him at the time of employment.similarly,the finding that her problems would have culminated in addiction even in the absence of this trauma and the treatment rendered thereafter do es not furnish a basis for denial for all recovery because even in cases where disability would follow from the normal progress of the preexisting disease,apportionment is proper where the industrial injury has contributed to the disability.there is no finding that the prescribed drugs did not,along with the personality problems and the illegally obtained drugs,contribute to any part of the disability,and the findings do not support the denial of recovery.id.at,italics added.ballard concluded the decisive question is not whether her actions in illegally obtaining drugs were a causative factor or contributed to her disability the question is not whether it was appropriate for the doctors to prescribe drugs for her or whether they were to blame under the authorities discussed above,the question is whether the prescribed drugs were a causative factor in her present disability.malitz nowhere states that her present condition was caused solely by her personality disorder and the unlawfully obtained drugs or that her present condition would have occurred absent the industrial injury and the prescribed drugs.id.at,see lamb workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,reversing the board reversal of death benefit where work stress caused hypertension leading to death from heart disease.mark industrial acc.com.d,upheld a death benefit award where a worker died of heart occlusion.the opinion observed assuming,if necessary,that decedent was afflicted with a weak and somewhat devitalized heart,that in itself is not determinative of the question here.if deceased was afflicted with such a condition and thereafter subjected himself to violent exertion and extraordinary strain in the course of his employment which caused his death sooner than he otherwise might have suffered,his dependents are entitled to compensation.id.at,italics added.
whether an industrial injury proximately causes a later injury or death within the meaning of section is a question of fact.see head drilling industrial acc.com.cal,smith workers comp.appeals bd.d.judicial review of the board decision on factual matters is limited to determining whether the decision,based on the entire record,is supported by substantial evidence.guerra workers comp.appeals bd.d.state comp.ins.fund,supra,d at.in this context,judicial review has been expressly limited by statute to whether the award was not supported by substantial evidence and the factual findings support the award,subds.d,e.indeed,section expressly provides that n othing in this section shall permit the court to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.
the wcj findings of fact,and the board adoption of them,are final and conclusive and not subject to appellate review if supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record.citations.substantial evidence must be reasonable in nature,credible,and of solid value such that a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a conclusion.citation.in examining the entire record,this court may not simply isolate evidence which supports or disapproves the board conclusions and ignore other relevant facts which rebut or explain the supporting evidence county of kern workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see braewood convalescent hospital workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.
substantial evidence supported the wcj finding that elavil and vicodin,prescribed for clark industrial injury,contributed to his death.while the level of elavil could not have been independently fatal,bruff testified that it had a contributory effect.as noted,bruff testified elavil may have had a small role at the levels found,could be an incremental contributor,and was additive.although he could not assign an exact percentage of contribution,bruff affirmed i t not zero he further agreed with plaintiffs counsel statement that w e ca rule out that the elavil might have been what just put it over the edge to cause this poor man death at thirty six years old.even if it was possible that clark might have died from an overdose of xanax and ambien alone,there also existed a reasonable probability that the elavil made clark death more likely.similarly with respect to vicodin,bressler stated in his report that the specific combination of medicines clark had ingested,including vicodin,all separately and in combination had the capacity to induce respiratory depression,and even respiratory arrest.bressler further reasoned that clark reports of blacking out showed these drugs caused untoward synergistic respiratory depression central nervous syst
