introduction 
plaintiff mary jefferson appeals judgment entered in favor of defendants california department of youth authority cya and larry berg defendants following the trial court ruling granting defendants motion for summary judgment.the court granted summary judgment on the ground plaintiff sex discrimination claim was barred by a workers compensation compromise and release of all claims release.
the fundamental issue here is whether the release bars plaintiff discrimination claim.plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because the release does not expressly waive her discrimination claim.plaintiff alternatively argues that a triable issue of fact exists because the release is ambiguous as to whether the release encompassed the discrimination claim or was limited solely to the release of workers compensation claims.
we reject plaintiff contentions and conclude the trial court did not abuse its discretion in granting summary judgment.the general release states that plaintiff waived all claims and plaintiff failed to provide any evidence to the contrary.even though the release consisted of a workers compensation preprinted form release,this fact alone does not raise a triable issue of fact as to whether plaintiff intended to waive civil as well as workers compensation claims since the release is a general release which expressly waives all claims related to the underlying injury and there is no language excluding discrimination claims.we affirm the judgment below.
facts and procedural background 
the undisputed facts established that,from september to february,plaintiff was employed by the cya to work at heman stark youth training school as a teacher assistant in the high school classroom of larry berg.plaintiff claims that,while plaintiff was working in berg classroom,berg and his students regularly used derogatory language when referring to females,such as bitch,whore,and slut.plaintiff was offended by such language and complained to berg and his supervisors.nevertheless,the sexually offensive conduct continued.
as a result of plaintiff complaints,on february,she was told not to return to berg classroom.two days later her doctor recommended that she not return to work due to stress.meanwhile she received a memorandum dated february,advising her that she had been reassigned to another classroom which was next door to berg classroom.plaintiff never returned to work after receiving the memorandum.
plaintiff filed a workers compensation claim dated march,describing her injury as adjustment disorder with anxious mood,psychological factors affecting physical condition of hypertension and allergies.she indicated in her workers compensation employee report of injury that her injuries were caused by sexual harassment sexually degrading words used to describe females,by larry berg and wards students.hostile work environment no classroom policies to control the behavior of the wards in the classroom.the environment was unsafe without policies,offensive,hostile and intimidating.
in october,plaintiff filed a california fair employment and housing act feha sex discrimination claim with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh against defendants.plaintiff alleged that she was subjected to sex harassment the harassment was verbal in nature which created an offensive and hostile working atmosphere.the dfeh issued letters on october.
on july,plaintiff settled her workers compensation claim against cya and signed a workers compensation compromise and release.plaintiff testified during her deposition that she read the entire release before signing it and was represented by counsel at the time.
the release states that plaintiff releases and forever discharges said employer cya from all claims and causes of action,whether now known or ascertained,or which may hereafter arise or develop as a result of said injury,
incorporated in the preprinted form release is a typed attachment adding the following terms to the release the applicant desires to avoid the hazards of litigation and the defendants wish to buy their peace the settlement is to compensate for all aspects of all injuries included herein.a pplicant agrees that this release will apply to all unknown and unanticipated injuries and damages resulting from such accident,and all rights under sections of the civil code of california are hereby expressly waived.a pplicant agrees that this release extends to and covers employees of the defendants 
pursuant to the terms of the workers compensation settlement,plaintiff resigned from her employment with the cya on june.plaintiff testified that she believed that the state would not agree to the settlement unless she did so.on august,the workers compensation appeals board approved the release.
plaintiff filed the instant civil lawsuit against defendants on august,allegedly to remedy defendants employment practices and policies of harassment and discrimination based upon sex.defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to the sole remaining cause of action,the second cause of action for feha sex discrimination.all other causes of action had previously been dismissed either by the court or voluntarily by plaintiff.
the trial court granted defendants summary judgment motion on the ground the release executed by jefferson bars her complaint as a matter of law.the release referred to matters that were clearly outside the scope of worker compensation.having accepted the benefit of the payment of,the plaintiff can not avoid the express terms of the release.the court entered judgment in defendants favor,and plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal.
summary judgment standard of review 
plaintiff contends the trial court erred in granting defendants motion for summary judgment.summary judgment is properly granted to a defendant if it shows either that one or more essential elements of the plaintiff cause of action can not be separately established or that there is an affirmative defense which bars recovery,and the plaintiff fails to set forth specific facts showing a triable issue of material fact as to that cause of action or defense.an appellate court independently reviews the questions of law presented and whether the papers raise triable issues of fact.
discussion 
plaintiff asserts the trial court erred in concluding,as a matter of law,that plaintiff feha cause of action was barred by the workers compensation compromise and release.
generally,a written release extinguishes any obligation covered by the release terms,provided it has not been obtained by fraud,deception,misrepresentation,duress,or undue influence.when a person capable of reading and understanding such a release signs it,he or she is bound by its provisions and estopped from claiming they are contrary to his or her intentions or understanding but assent to a release agreement is necessary in order for it to be binding.hence,if it can be established that the plaintiff did not in reality assent to it,due to fraud or duress,she is not estopped from claiming the release is not binding for want of assent 
in the instant case,plaintiff asserts that she never intended to abandon her feha discrimination claim.but absent fraud,deception,misrepresentation,duress,or undue influence,this assertion does not raise a triable issue as to intent if she signed the release on the mere unspoken belief that the release did not encompass such claims,despite express language in the release to the contrary,she may not now rely on her unspoken intention not to waive these claims in order to escape the effect of the release.our objective in construing the language of the release is to determine and effectuate the intention of the parties it is the outward expression of the agreement,rather than a party unexpressed intention,which the court will enforce.
plaintiff further argues that her feha claim is not barred by the release because the release did not expressly release liability for the feha violations it only pertained to workers compensation claims.
standard contract principles apply here in the instant case,during the summary judgment motion hearing,the parties conceded that
