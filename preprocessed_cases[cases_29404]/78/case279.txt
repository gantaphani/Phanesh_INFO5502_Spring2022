plaintiff kevin scheuring appeals an adverse grant of summary judgment.scheuring claims that he is a seaman entitled to consideration under the jones act,app.a.in the alternative,he argues that he is entitled to sue the vessel owner in tort under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,et.the district court determined that he was not a seaman because the nature of his employment was not substantially connected to a vessel,the william f,and therefore,he could not sue under the jones act.moreover,the court determined that the alleged negligence in the positioning of a ramp did not implicate the duty owed by traylor brothers as vessel owner,and therefore,scheuring could not sue under b.we reverse and remand as to both claims.
factual and procedural background 
in august,kevin scheuring was hired by the defendant traylor brothers,as a crane operator on the william f.the william f is a long,derrick barge used in construction projects.for the relevant period,the william f was owned and operated by traylor brothers.a crane,which the plaintiff operated,was affixed to the barge.
at the time of the plaintiff injury,the william f was being used in the long branch cruise terminal lbct construction project within the long beach harbor.the lbct project involved building a docking facility for carnival cruise lines.traylor brothers was a subcontractor on the project in charge of building a passenger wharf,two flanking mooring dolphins and a trestle running back to the shore.the william f was dispatched to the lbct project from june through november.
scheuring was hired as a crane operator in august to work for the duration of the lbct project.he was a member of the operating engineers union.his work background primarily consisted of operating and maintaining heavy equipment.he was trained as a crane operator,received wages as a crane operator and did not consider himself a specialist in marine work.his primary job while employed with traylor brothers on the william f was to operate the crane to loft pile,hold the leads that captured the pile and start the hammer that drives the pile.at times,scheuring helped to move the william f by fleeting,or heaving back and forth on her anchor lines,for purposes of repositioning the barge for the next set of piles to be driven.scheuring occasionally handled lines,weighed and dropped anchors,stood lookout,monitored the marine band radio and spliced wire and rope.
the plaintiff alleges that the barge was subject to the tides and tossed by sea swells,wind waves,vessel wakes and tidal currents.the barge did not operate on its own power,but rather by means of winches which slackened or tightened anchor lines,thereby allowing minor maneuvering and repositioning.the william f fleeted,or heaved back and forth on her anchor lines,on a daily basis.the barge was secured to the shore by multiple permanent lines.on occasion,these cables would break.the barge was also unmoored and towed by a tugboat to a new anchorage on at least three occasions while the plaintiff was aboard.
to board the barge,the crew had to walk down a ramp leading from the water edge to an offshore float.once on the float,the crew would take a skiff to the barge.the ramp could not be affixed to the float,and,on average,a few times a week it would fall into the water.on the morning of september,the plaintiff arrived at work and found the end of the ramp in the water.while attempting to lift the ramp out of the water with the help of others,he slipped and injured his back.scheuring alleges that traylor brothers had known for at least two months about this problem with the ramp.
scheuring filed this lawsuit against traylor brothers claiming that he is entitled to recover for his personal injuries as a seaman under the jones act,app.in the alternative,scheuring sues for negligence under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,b the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted that motion on august.the plaintiff moved for reconsideration on september,which the district court denied on october.scheuring appealed.

discussion 
the present case involves alternative maritime tort claims.first,the plaintiff is suing the defendant,as his employer,as a seaman under the jones act,app.a.in the alternative,he is suing the defendant,as the vessel owner,as a harbor worker under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,b.we will examine each claim in turn.
a.the jones act claim 
the jones act provides in pertinent part 
any seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may,at his election,maintain an action for damages at law,with the right of trial by jury,and in such action all statutes of the united states modifying or extending the commonlaw right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply 
app.a.the defendant contends that the plaintiff is not a seaman and therefore is not entitled to recovery under the jones act.the determination of who is a seaman is a mixed question of fact and law.chandris,latsis,d.the interpretation of statutory terms is within the purview of the court,but i f reasonable persons,applying the proper legal standard,could differ as to whether the employee was a member of a crew,it is a question for the jury.id.quoting mcdermott int l,wilander,d.
although the jones act was originally enacted in,the question of who is a seaman continues to perplex the courts.in the,the supreme court considered this question in a number of cases.in chandris,the court articulated a test which drew on its holdings in earlier cases 
t he essential requirements for seaman status are twofold.first,as we emphasized in wilander,an employee duties must contribut e to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.
second,a seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation or to an identifiable group of such vessels that is substantial in terms of both duration and its nature.
chandris,at.citations omitted.the defendant does not dispute that scheuring employment contributed to the function of the william f,thus meeting the first requirement of the test.nor does the defendant question the substantial duration component of the second requirement.the key issue in this branch of the case is whether the nature of scheuring duties involved a substantial connection to the william 
as the supreme court explained in chandris,the first part of the requirement is very broad,covering a ll who work at sea in the service of a ship.id.quoting wilander,at.the second requirement,on the other hand,narrows the pool of potential seaman in order 
to give full effect to the remedial scheme created by congress and to separate the maritime employees who are entitled to jones act protection from those workers who have only a transitory or sporadic connection to a vessel in navigation,and therefore whose employment does not regularly expose them to the perils of the sea.
id.the court explained that this test is fundamentally status based.id.at.maritime workers do not become seamen because they happen to be working on board a vessel when they are injured,and seamen do not lose jones act protection when the course of their service to a vessel takes them ashore.id.the court also equated the question of who is a seaman to the determination of who is a member of a crew.id.at.decided two years later,harbor tug barge papai,d provides additional guidance on the substantial connection prong of the test articulated in chandris.
for the substantial connection requirement to serve its purpose,the inquiry into the nature of the employee connection to the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee duties take him to sea.this will give substance to the inquiry both as to the duration and nature of the employee connection to the vessel and be helpful in distinguishing from employees.
papai,at.the crux of the second prong of the seaman test involves distinguishing from employees by examining the employee activities and duties.
we have previously grappled with the nature component of the second prong of the chandris test.two cases,one which affirmed a grant of summary judgment,cabral healy tibbits builders,cir,and one which reversed,delange dutra constr,cir per curiam,are of particular relevance to the present case,although neither is entirely on point.
in cabral,we affirmed the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendant,holding that the plaintiff,a crane operator aboard a construction barge,was a worker with only a transitory or sporadic connection with the barge.we determined that papai and chandris stand for the notion that the court should focus on whether the employee duties are primarily activities in determining whether the nature of the connection to the vessel is substantial.cabral,at.the court concluded that the plaintiff was a worker because 
cabral was hired to work on barge as a crane operator and not as a crew member.cabral presents no evidence showing that he was ever aboard barge when it was anywhere but the ford island ferry project furthermore,cabral presents no evidence showing that he would continue to work aboard barge after the ford island ferry project was completed.
id.importantly,there is no mention of barge moving during cabral time aboard it.
the plaintiff urges this court to follow delange.in a per curiam opinion,the court there held that the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact as to his status as a seaman and remanded the case for further proceedings.id.at.the plaintiff was hired as a carpenter on a piledriving crew engaged in the construction of a navigation aid.id.at.the plaintiff rode to the construction site on a barge that was used as a work platform.id.at.while attempting to anchor the barge to the construction site,the plaintiff severely injured his hand.id.at.in reversing the district court grant of summary judgment,we distinguished the plaintiff in that case from the plaintiff in cabral by examining the specific activities or duties of the two plaintiffs.unlike the crane operator in cabral,the plaintiff in delange claimed that 
a big part of his job was to serve as a lookout,cargo stower,line handler,and occasional pilot when the barge was being of which are clearly seaman only devoted of his time to carpentry.he also stated that more than of his time was spent onboard the barge where most of the work involved crewman and deckhand duties.
id.at.although delange was hired as a carpenter,his duties were more appropriately characterized as duties.
as the district court noted here,scheuring employment as a crane operator is in many ways similar to the plaintiff employment in cabral.scheuring traylor,no.cv,slip op.at.however,there are important distinctions between the two cases,which warrant reversal of the district court grant of summary judgment.the condition of the william f was sufficiently different from that of the barge in cabral to distinguish the plaintiff status in cabral from the present case.the plaintiff in cabral did not make any showing of exposure to or other characteristic seamen risks.here,scheuring alleges that the boat was subject to sea swells,wind waves,vessel wakes and tidal currents.he further alleges that the barge fleeted on her anchor lines on a daily basis.and,most importantly,on at least three occasions,the plaintiff was aboard the barge as it was unmoored and moved by a tugboat.the plaintiff contends that during those movements,he performed duties that could be characterized as duties,such as handling lines,weighing and dropping anchors,standing lookout,monitoring the marine band radio and splicing wire and rope.these claims show the existence of a factual dispute whether the plaintiff employment was or.see sw.marine,gizoni,d holding that genuine issues of material fact existed as to the plaintiff seaman status where the plaintiff rode on floating platforms as they were towed into place,occasionally served as a lookout and gave maneuvering signals to the tugboat operator and received lines passed to the platforms by the ships crews to secure the platforms.the district court incorrectly described the william f as stationary.but its movements,although perhaps relatively minor and infrequent,are sufficient to distinguish the present case from cabral and warrant reversal.see also delange,at noting that the barge moved only four times during the relevant period of time.
the plaintiff urges this court to rely solely on the plaintiff account of surges,tides and swells to classify him as a seaman.we reject this approach as it would render the second the employee have a substantial connection to the vessel both in terms of duration and.by analyzing only the vessel movements,the activities and duties of the employee would become result which conflicts with supreme court and ninth circuit precedent.see papai,at.chandris,at.cabral,at.therefore,we examine the vessel movements in light of the plaintiff duties in order to assess whether the plaintiff has presented evidence that would allow a jury to find a substantial connection to the vessel both in terms of duration and nature.see papai,at.stating that courts should concentrate on whether the employee duties take him to sea.
the evidence supporting the plaintiff jones act claim may be somewhat limited.nonetheless,the movements of the vessel,albeit relatively minor,and the duties of the plaintiff,although ancillary to his core responsibility as a crane operator,raise genuine issues of material fact which warrant jury consideration.accordingly,we reverse the district court grant of summary judgment for the defendant.
longshore and harbor workers compensation act claim 
the plaintiff alleges an alternative claim for relief.if he fails to establish that he is a seaman under the jones act,then,he argues,he is a harbor worker entitled to relief under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,et.pursuant to a,an employee may not recover in tort for the negligence of his employer rather,he is entitled to statutory payments.however,b allows an employee to recover for the negligence of a vessel owner in the event of injury to a person covered under this chapter caused by the negligence of a vessel,then such person,or anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages by reason thereof,may bring an action against such vessel b.
here,the defendant is both the employer and the vessel owner,thus a case such as this is commonly referred to as a suit.when the vessel owner and the employer are the same entity,an employee may recover for negligence if the negligence was that of the employer acting in its capacity as a vessel owner,not as an employer.jones laughlin steel pfeifer,d the question here is whether traylor brothers alleged negligence with respect to the system of entry was as vessel owner or as employer.we conclude that there is a genuine issue of material facts as to whether the duty owed to scheuring belonged to traylor brothers as the vessel owner.
the supreme court has indicated that congress left to the courts the task of defining the vessel owner duty of care.see howlett birkdale shipping,d scindia steam navigation de los santos,d.in scindia,the court first considered the duties a vessel owner owed to an injured longshore worker,which in a subsequent case were divided into three categories 
the first,which courts have come to call the turnover duty,relates to the condition of the ship upon the commencement of stevedoring operations.the second duty,applicable once stevedoring operations have begun,provides that a shipowner must exercise reasonable care to prevent injuries to longshoremen in areas that remain under the active control of the vessel.the third duty,called the duty to inter
