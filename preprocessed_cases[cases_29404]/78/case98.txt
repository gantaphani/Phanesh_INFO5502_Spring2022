on james martin application for black lung benefits,filed in,the benefits review board ordered the payment of benefits and found armco,to be the responsible coal mine operator,even though martin was employed by two other coal mine operators after his layoff by armco in.in its petition for review,armco contends that under,babcock mining company,martin most recent employer,qualified as the responsible operator and that because the director of the federal office of workers compensation programs director failed to join babcock mining as a party,martin benefits should be paid by the black lung disability trust fund,not by armco.armco also raises issues for the first time on appeal,challenging the award of benefits to martin.for the reasons that follow,we deny armco petition for review and affirm the decision and order of the board.
james martin,of beckley,west virginia,filed a claim for black lung benefits with the united states department of labor office of workers compensation programs on january.he had not worked for over two years because of a back injury but before december,when he quit working,martin had worked underground in coal mines as an electrician for years.the last three employers for whom he worked in coal mines were 
the department of labor forwarded notice of martin claim to chafe mining and to armco as potential responsible employers.it did not forward notice to babcock mining because it concluded that babcock mining could not be a responsible operator since martin worked for that company for less than one year.see.because of disputes over the determination of the responsible operator,the procedural course within the department of labor was protracted.
the district director of the department of labor initially denied martin application for benefits on june.he later denied martin offer to include additional evidence as untimely.but upon martin request,he forwarded martin claim to the office of administrative law judges for a hearing.
before the administrative law judge alj,armco filed a motion to dismiss the claim against it on the basis that it was not the responsible operator or,in the alternative,to remand to the district director for a determination of who the proper responsible operator was.in its motion,armco stated that t he miner lists only six months of employment with babcock mining thus,presumably,babcock mining,is not the responsible operator as defined by.armco therefore asserted that the next most recent employer,chafe mining,was the responsible operator.the director agreed with armco assessment of responsibility,but opposed dismissal.instead,he favored a remand to the district director for further evidentiary development.accordingly,the alj remanded the claim for a determination of the putative responsible operator.
on remand,the district director concluded that the most recent responsible operator was chafe mining.chafe mining,however,was not a viable company because it had filed for bankruptcy and was no longer an active corporation.the former principal of chafe mining its president,secretary,and treasurer,charles lieberman,would be responsible individually,but lieberman submitted information showing that he lacked the financial capacity to assume liability for martin claim.accordingly,the district director concluded,in a decision and order of july,that lieberman was liable for the claim and,s hould it be determined that charles lieberman does not have the wherewithal to assume liability or he is otherwise found not liable in this matter,armco,will be liable as the secondary operator in this claim.the matter was then referred back to the alj for a hearing.
following a hearing on both the merits of martin claim and the responsible operator issue,the alj issued his decision and order on august,concluding that martin was entitled to benefits.considering the evidence,the alj concluded that true doubt existed as to whether or not the three demonstrated the existence of pneumoconiosis,and,pursuant to the law then applicable,he resolved that doubt in favor of martin.the alj also considered medical evidence and decided that the reasoned medical opinions presented in the case established the existence of pneumoconiosis.with respect to the responsible operator,the alj concluded that babcock mining was the most recent employer to have employed martin for a cumulative period of one year.even though martin had worked at babcock mining for only six months,he worked for more than working days during that period,and,according to the alj,he therefore satisfied the requirement of b.because the director had not joined babcock mining as a potential responsible operator,the alj transferred liability to the black lung disability trust fund trust fund.the alj also determined that chafe mining and its former president,lieberman,were not capable of assuming liability for the payment of benefits if it were later determined that benefits should not be paid by the trust fund.
the director appealed this decision,and on appeal,the benefits review board affirmed the award of benefits to martin.it agreed with the alj decision not to join babcock as a responsible operator because the director had failed to name babcock mining in the initial stages of the claim.but it observed that the alj never addressed armco potential liability as a responsible operator.accordingly,the board vacated the alj finding that the trust fund was liable for martin benefits and remanded the claim to the alj for further consideration of the responsible operator issue.
on remand,the alj again found the trust fund liable for martin black lung benefits.it reasoned that babcock mining was the most recent responsible operator,as defined by applicable regulations,and because babcock mining was not joined,the trust fund would be liable.the director again appealed this determination to the board.
once again,the board vacated the alj assignment of liability to the trust fund and remanded the case for further consideration by the alj.in its opinion,the board specifically disagreed with the alj conclusion that a miner who establishes that he worked for at least days must be credited with one year of coal mine employment.
on remand,this time before a different alj,armco was found to be the responsible operator and was ordered to pay benefits to martin.in reaching its conclusion,the alj agreed with the board that babcock mining could not be named the responsible operator because babcock mining did not employ martin for at least one calendar year.the alj also agreed that both chafe mining and its president,lieberman,were financially incapable of assuming liability for the claim.the alj therefore concluded that armco,as the next most recent operator who satisfied all of the criteria of a responsible operator,was liable.the alj reversed the finding that the trust fund was liable for payment of martin benefits and ordered armco to pay the benefits.armco appealed this decision to the board,challenging only the alj designation of armco as the responsible operator.
on appeal before the board for the third time,the board issued a decision and order dated january,affirming the alj determination that armco is the responsible operator.from that decision and order,armco petitioned this court for review.
armco principal argument on appeal is that it is not the coal mine operator statutorily responsible for paying martin black lung benefits.while it agrees that the operator responsible is the one with which the miner had the most recent periods of cumulative employment of not less than year,a,it argues that babcock mining is the operator that meets that description under the provisions of b.it maintains that subsection b provides that the employment requirement is satisfied by demonstrating that the employee worked for a period of at least working days.id.because martin worked for babcock mining from june,to december,a period of at least working days,it asserts that babcock mining,not armco,is the most recent employer with whom martin worked not less than one year and therefore is responsible for paying martin black lung benefits.because babcock mining was not properly joined in this action,
