the primary issue we decide in this case is that the workers compensation appeals board overstepped its authority by implementing new procedures relative to proceedings involving the uninsured employers fund.
introduction 
daniel milbauer was injured on october,while performing his duties as a messenger and courier.since the employer was illegally uninsured for workers compensation,milbauer,through counsel,claimed benefits from petitioner john rea,acting director of the department of industrial relations,as administrator of the uninsured employers fund on or about may,the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj issued a decision that erez boostan,an individual and doing business as american runner attorney service,is the illegally uninsured employer,and awarded benefits.the fund petitioned the respondent,workers compensation appeals board wcab,for reconsideration and alleged that american runner attorney service,is the correct illegally uninsured employer,and there is no jurisdiction or liability under section,subdivision d 
in an in bank decision the wcab concluded that substantial evidence supports the illegally uninsured employer identity found by the wcj,and affirmed the award.the wcab further found that the fund failed for over eight years to furnish benefits under section,subdivision b or information regarding the proper employer as required by section,subdivision d the wcab announced and adopted procedures that,in the future,the fund may be ordered to appear at priority conferences under section and to assist with discovery of the proper employer.the wcab explained that the illegally uninsured employer disputed identity could be determined by litigation between the employee and the fund,which would then allow for service of the application and special notice of lawsuit and the fund formal joinder.the wcab also warned the fund and its counsel that sanctions under section could be awarded for similar dilatory conduct.
the fund petitioned the wcab for reconsideration a second time,and challenged the new procedures adopted and announced by milbauer i on various grounds.the wcab in bank dismissed the petition because the new procedures did not involve a final appealable order,or a substantial right or liability was not decided in addition,the wcab contends that the new procedures applied to future cases and the fund is not aggrieved within the meaning of sections and 
the fund petitions for writ of review and argues that the new procedures in milbauer i are final orders since wcab in bank decisions are binding on wcj and wcab panels the fund further argues it is aggrieved because wcj are applying the new procedures statewide.the fund also contends that the wcab impermissibly legislated changes to jurisdictional requirements under section,subdivision d and section,subdivision f which interfere with the ability of the director of industrial relations to regulate workers compensation insurance and seek reimbursement from uninsured employers.moreover,the fund claims milbauer i violates the rulemaking requirements of the administrative procedure act apa tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,tidewater marine and section finally,the fund argues that milbauer i authorizes sanctions under section contrary to section and dubois 
the wcab answers that the new procedures under milbauer i do not involve substantive rights or final appealable orders,and there is no authority that in bank decisions should be treated differently.if milbauer i is considered a final decision,the wcab argues further,then the fund petition for writ of review is untimely alternatively,the procedures are prospective and the fund is not newly aggrieved as required by sections and.although the wcab now concedes the fund may not be ordered to priority conferences under section,the wcab claims other procedural conferences are not prohibited.more importantly,the wcab contends,the fund has a duty to provide benefits and employer information under section,the record shows the fund failed to do so,and the new procedures,although reasonable,can be challenged in future cases.in addition,the apa expressly allows a precedent decision as an exception to rulemaking requirements and there are numerous in bank decisions that have announced general procedural rules as authorized under the labor code.finally,penalties under section were not imposed,and are different than the penalties addressed by section and dubois.
we conclude that the new procedures decided by milbauer i involve substantial rights and liabilities,and the decision is a final appealable order.the wcab in bank decided new procedures that change the jurisdictional and liability requirements under sections and.in addition,because there was no prior notice of the new procedures until milbauer i issued,the fund is newly aggrieved and the second petition for reconsideration is proper.thus,the petition for writ of review from milbauer ii is timely.moreover,deciding different issues without giving the fund the opportunity to be heard or present evidence violated due process.
although there may be substantial evidence to support the wcab finding in milbauer i,that the fund failed to comply with section,subdivision d,we conclude that the new procedures violate sections,and the apa.the fund may not be joined in any proceedings unless a legal person or entity has been identified as the illegally uninsured employer in the application and special notice of lawsuit,and said employer has been served with the application and special notice of lawsuit in the manner provided for service of a summons in the code of civil procedure.the code of civil procedure includes procedures for service and default or default judgment,even when the true identity of the defendant is unknown.in regards to the apa and section,the procedures announced in milbauer i are new,general,and interpret and specifically implement section,and are more like regulations than precedent which contain general legal or policy determinations that are likely to recur.because we conclude that the new procedures violate the labor code and apa,we need not decide whether the wcab determined that section extends to the fund.accordingly,the new procedures decided in milbauer i and the decision in milbauer ii are annulled,and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
as previously stated,daniel milbauer sustained various injuries in a traffic accident on october,while performing his duties as a messenger and courier.in august of,milbauer,through counsel,served erez boostan as an individual and substantial shareholder of american runner attorney service courier with the application and special notice of lawsuit.on or about january,michael schiffman,performed an agreed medical evaluation on behalf of milbauer and the fund,and recommended further treatment,including right knee surgery.
at a mandatory settlement conference on october,counsel for the fund completed an order joining american runner messenger service,a corporation,formerly known as american runner attorney service and courier network.the order also named erez boostan,as substantial shareholder beneficial owner of said corporation.the order was signed by the wcj.milbauer amended the application and special notice of lawsuit accordingly,and then served the documents on erez boostan,the person authorized to accept service.the fund was ordered joined by the wcj on april,and counsel for the fund agreed to serve the order.
on january,milbauer obtained an order from the bankruptcy court allowing him to proceed in the workers compensation case against american runner messenger service.the debtor and fund also appeared.
on or about july,schiffman found milbauer condition to be permanent and stationary following surgery and treatment,and recommended work restrictions and future medical care.
on february,milbauer and the fund proceeded to trial on various issues.milbauer testified regarding the industrial injury,treatment and disability.milbauer also stated that he worked for american runner,which might have been american courier.in addition,he had pay stubs and a badge at home,and the badge may indicate a different name for the employer.
the wcj found that there was no jurisdiction over american runner messenger service.in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained that employer identification was not raised as an issue for trial,but paycheck stubs,which were received after trial and submitted into evidence,indicated american runner attorney service was the correct illegally uninsured employer.in addition,milbauer testified that he was unsure of the employer correct identity,and his badge,which was not submitted into evidence,apparently had a different name.
milbauer timely petitioned the wcab for reconsideration,and argued that the fund stipulated to employment,and even provided benefits including surgery.the wcab denied reconsideration.
milbauer subsequently petitioned the wcj for an order authorizing service by publication on erez boostan doing business as american runner attorney service.exhibits were attached to the petition,including an investigative report that there was no fictitious business filing for american runner attorney service,and a corporate certification by the secretary of state that american runner attorney service,was incorporated on april,and suspended on january.the wcj ordered publication,and service by publication was completed on or about march.
milbauer and the fund again proceeded to trial,and the fund raised various issues including the illegally uninsured employer identity.the matter was submitted on the record on february.
on may,the wcj served a supplemental findings and award that milbauer was injured while working for erez boostan,an individual and doing business as american runner attorney service.the wcj awarded temporary disability indemnity,percent permanent disability indemnity and future medical care.in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained that the decision was based on milbauer credible testimony,the paycheck stubs,the exhibits attached to the petition for service by publication and the medical evidence.
on june,the fund petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.the fund claimed american runner attorney service,is the correct illegally uninsured employer,as indicated by the paycheck stubs,fictitious business report and corporate certification by the secretary of state submitted by milbauer.the fund contended that since the correct illegally uninsured employer was never served,there is no jurisdiction to award benefits under section.
in the report on reconsideration,the wcj pointed out that the fund petition is untimely in regards to the merits,the wcj responded that the fund provided no evidence of the alleged identity of the illegally uninsured employer.
although the wcab panel found the fund petition for reconsideration untimely,the panel granted reconsideration on its own motion under section,subdivision b because of the important legal issues presented,and in order to achieve uniformity of decisions in the future,the majority of the wcab elected to decide milbauer i in bank 
in milbauer i,the wcab found the paycheck stubs to be substantial evidence which supported the wcj finding that american runner attorney service is the illegally uninsured employer.the wcab also concluded the fund argument,that similarly named american runner attorney service,existed at the time of injury,is not evidence of employment.the wcab affirmed the supplemental findings and award.
the wcab explicated further that the record also revealed the fund did little or nothing to assist in properly identifying the illegally uninsured employer for over eight years of litigation,despite the duty to do so under section,subdivision d and yant snyder dickenson,wl yant instead,the fund challenged the wcj identification of the illegally uninsured employer in an untimely petition for reconsideration.in contrast,milbauer through counsel diligently served documents and amendments,investigated the employer and moved the bankruptcy court for relief from automatic stay.moreover,the fund failed to provide benefits contrary to section,subdivision b,yant,dubois,and aubry workers comp.appeals bd.th,d aubry claim form and not application for adjudication of claim required to be served on illegally uninsured employer for injury.
in order to alleviate such conduct by the fund and promote early and active participation in properly identifying the illegally uninsured employer,the wcab in bank in milbauer i decided to adopt and announce certain procedures.after an application is filed and the represented injured worker makes a good faith effort to correctly identify the illegally uninsured employer,including contacting the fund,the fund may be ordered to provisionally appear at a priority conference under section,subdivision c and california code of regulations,title,section if the illegally uninsured employer identity is disputed,a discovery plan is provided by the injured worker and the fund,which is monitored by the wcj at periodic status conferences for six months.if the issue remains unresolved,the wcj can decide the illegally uninsured employer identity on the record or after trial.once any appeals are exhausted,the application and special notice of lawsuit can be served on the illegally uninsured employer and the fund may be formally joined.
finally,the wcab found the fund behavior so dilatory and inconsistent with its statutory obligations,that imposition of sanctions and attorney fees against the fund and its counsel under section were seriously considered however,the wcab decided to only warn the fund of possible future sanctions and attorney fees since the new procedures were being announced in milbauer 
the fund petitioned the wcab for reconsideration a second time.the fund indicated it is not challenging substantial evidence exists that erez boostan,doing business as american runner attorney service,is the illegally uninsured employer.however,the fund contended it is newly aggrieved by the new procedures announced by milbauer i,since these issues were not raised for reconsideration and there was no notice or opportunity to be heard.had there been notice and the opportunity to be heard,the fund would have submitted the exhibits attached to the petition,which the fund requested augment the record.the exhibits establish the fund efforts in providing employer information and benefits,and include written authorization for right knee surgery and temporary disability indemnity pursuant to schiffman recommendations,requests for employer information from various governmental agencies and a brief filed in the bankruptcy court supporting milbauer motion for relief from stay.thus,the wcab in milbauer i mischaracterized the fund conduct and wrongly assumed the new procedures were warranted.
the fund also contended that the new procedures are void under the apa and tidewater marine,because the procedures are general,and implement and interpret section.thus,publication and public comment is required.moreover,the wcab creation of provisional joinder conflicts with the legislature jurisdictional requirements expressed in sections and,and the employer due process rights according to arias workers comp.appeals bd.d.uninsured employer called as witness has due process right to notice of being potential defendant and to present evidence and witnesses.the new procedures in milbauer i also require fund personnel and resources that are needed to obtain compliance with workers compensation insurance or reimbursement for benefits paid.finally,the wcab should not have prejudged on its own motion that the fund may be subject to sanctions and attorney fees under section,considering the true facts,section and dubois.
in milbauer ii,the wcab in bank dismissed the fund petition for reconsideration.the wcab concluded that the new procedures involve procedural and not substantive rights or liabilities,which does not involve a final order that is subject to appeal.in addition,the fund was not newly aggrieved as required for reconsideration under sections and,since the identity of the illegally uninsured employer is not disputed and the new procedures apply only to future cases.the wcab also denied the fund request to augment the evidentiary record.
the fund petitions for writ of review and contends that milbauer i is a final order since the wcab intended uniformity and stare decisis while deciding important legal issues such as jurisdiction in bank.the fund also argues that it is aggrieved under section by milbauer i because the new procedures require immediate litigation statewide,despite the lack of jurisdiction and staffing,and under the threat of sanctions.the fund is particularly aggrieved by milbauer i without prior notice of the new procedures and the opportunity to present exhibits which show the fund statutory compliance.
the fund further contends that the wcab in milbauer i impermissibly legislated provisional joinder of the fund at priority conferences,which conflicts with the express jurisdictional requirements of sections and,and the employer due process rights under katzin workers comp.appeals bd.th,d katzin illegally uninsured employer has due process right to notice of medical evidence and proceedings.without actual jurisdiction,the director of industrial relations is impeded in regulating illegally uninsured employers and the fund limited resources have to be reallocated.moreover,the wcab in milbauer i admitted the new procedures apply generally and are intended to implement section,which meets the test of tidewater marine and thus the apa applies.under the applicable provisions of the apa and section,the wcab is required to publish proposed regulations and conduct public hearings.finally,the wcab has already decided that the fund is subject to sanctions under section,which must be reversed considering no jurisdiction or opportunity to be heard,section,and dubois.
the wcab answers that the fund petition for writ of review should be dismissed.since the fund petition for reconsideration of milbauer i is limited to the new procedures,substantial rights or liabilities,or a final appealable order as required under safeway stores and maranian,are not involved.milbauer ii is also purely procedural.even if milbauer i is considered a final appealable decision,the wcab argues further,the petition for writ of review was not timely filed within days under section.moreover,the new procedures pertain to future cases which can be appealed,and thus the fund is not newly aggrieved by milbauer i as required for reconsideration under sections and.no authority is cited by the fund for treating in bank decisions differently.
in regards to the merits,the wcab contends that it has judicial powers under labor code sections and which includes controlling court proceedings to enable the orderly administration of justice.consequently,numerous in bank decisions such as yant have adopted and announced practice and procedure.such precedential decisions are exceptions to the rulemaking requirements of labor code section under section and the apa under government code section,subdivision b.
the wcab also argues that the fund allegation of improper joinder and hardship is without merit.milbauer i does not replace formal joinder of the fund or liability following proper service of the illegally uninsured employer.milbauer i provides for provisional joinder of the fund,in order to facilitate benefits and employer information as required under section,subdivision d and yant.however,the record establishes that the fund failed these duties for over eight years while milbauer served documents and amended documents,investigated the employer and obtained relief from bankruptcy stay.even if the fund nonadmitted exhibits are considered,the wcab asserts further,the fund conduct described by milbauer i is a familiar pattern which is also indicated by yant.
the wcab explains further that the fund has routine access to various data bases,and its early participation will help all parties,especially unrepresented employees.milbauer i also provides safeguards,such as requiring the employee good faith effort to identify the employer,including contacting the fund.the wcj then has discretion regarding the next step which the fund may appeal.in regards to the threat of sanctions under section,the wcab claims that only a warning was given in dicta,and section and dubois address penalties under section,which are different than sanctions.
the fund replies that prior to proper joinder under section and yant,providing employer information is voluntary and can not be ordered by the wcab.in addition,the procedures announced by milbauer i are new and general and not precedent,even if characterized as precedent by an in bank decision.in contrast,yant applied existing statutes to the parties and did not create future rules.moreover,the wcab powers are judicial and not legislative,and are limited by the labor code and government code.extensive litigation statewide will be required if the new procedures are allowed to stand.finally,the fund denies the conduct described by milbauer i is a pattern,which shows bias by the wcab.the fund actually provided early employer information,although it was mistaken.
discussion 
standard of reviewa.factual findings 
a decision based on factual findings which are supported by substantial evidence should be affirmed by the reviewing court.levesque workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,levesque western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d western growers.however,an appellate court is not bound to accept factual findings that are unreasonable,illogical,improbable,or inequitable when viewed in light of the entire record and the overall statutory scheme.western growers,supra,at,d bracken workers comp.appeals bd.d.
interpreting and applying statutes 
interpreting or applying statutes to the facts is decided de novo by the appellate court,even though the wcab construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d boehm associates williams workers comp.appeals bd.th,d williams.when interpreting or applying statutes to the facts,the legislature intent should be determined and given effect.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,moyer.the intent of the legislature is generally determined from the plain or ordinary meaning of the statutory language,unless the language or intent is uncertain.dubois,supra,at,d,moyer,supra,at.interpreting or applying statutes to the facts should be consistent with the purpose of the statute and the statutory scheme as a whole.dubois,supra,at,d,moyer,supra,at.
ii.milbauer i is a final appealable decision 
the fund contends that milbauer i is a final appealable decision because the wcab decided the new procedures in bank to achieve uniformity and stare decisis regarding important legal issues such as jurisdiction.the wcab alleges that milbauer i decided only procedural matters,which does not involve substantive rights or liabilities,or a final appealable decision under safeway stores and maranian.
final appealable decisions include threshold issues that are basic to establishing liability for workers compensation benefits,whether or not all issues are resolved or there is an ultimate decision on the right to benefits.safeway stores,supra,d at.maranian,supra,th at,d.jurisdiction is a threshold issue which is basic to establishing the fund substantive rights and liabilities versus the employee and employer.the wcab decided in milbauer i that there can be provisional jurisdiction over the fund and adjudication of the identity of the illegally uninsured employer,before compliance with the jurisdictional and liability requirements under section,subdivision d and section,subdivision f.
milbauer i is also final within the meaning of sections and.the wcab in bank decided that existing law authorizes the new procedures,which are effective immediately.in contrast,the wcab in milbauer i merely warned that sanctions and attorney fees under section could be considered for similar future conduct by the fund.
iii.the fund is newly aggrieved 
the fund argues that it is newly aggrieved by milbauer i because immediate litigation over jurisdiction,sanctions and staffing is required statewide,and the in bank decision is being followed by wcj.the wcab maintains that the fund is not aggrieved within the meaning of sections and,since the new procedures are prospective and can be fully challenged in future cases.
we conclude that the fund is newly aggrieved by milbauer i within the meaning of sections and.the new procedures directly affect the fund substantive rights and liabilities,are effective immediately and can not be meaningfully challenged in future cases having been decided by the wcab in bank since the basis for the new procedures were not raised by the parties and the new procedures were decided by milbauer i for the first time without notice,the fund second petition for reconsideration is not repetitive and properly requests reconsideration of a matter which has been theretofore considered on only one occasion.goodrich industrial acc.com.cal d,goodrich commission has jurisdiction to grant rehearing after granting petition to reopen based on new evidence,even though prior decision is affirmed.
the petition for writ of review is timely 
if reconsideration is granted and a party is newly aggrieved by the resulting decision within the meaning of sections and,the party may either petition for reconsideration or writ of review.goodrich,supra,cal d at,dalsheim industrial acc.com.cal.in this case,the fund was newly aggrieved by the modified decision in milbauer i,and properly petitioned the wcab for reconsideration a second time.although the wcab dismissed the second petition for reconsideration in milbauer ii,the question is whether the wcab had jurisdiction to address the merits.goodrich,supra,at,wcab may not deprive itself of jurisdiction by denying reconsideration on that basis,after granting petition to reopen and considering new evidence and reaching same decision.since we conclude that the wcab had jurisdiction under sections and in milbauer ii,the fund properly and timely petitioned for writ of review under section.
iv.due process was violated 
the wcab in milbauer i violated due process.due process requires notice and a meaningful opportunity to present evidence in regards to the issues.katzin,supra,th at,d fidelity cas.of new york workers comp.appeals bd.d.fremont indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.d.the fund was not provided notice that its conduct under section,subdivisions b and d was in issue until milbauer i was decided.in addition,a decision based on different legal theories or issues than presented by the parties,without affording a meaningful opportunity to be heard or present evidence,violates due process.gangwish workers comp.appeals bd.th,d rucker workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
in petitioning for reconsideration the second time,the fund included exhibits and requested augmentation of the record in attempting to show compliance with section,subdivisions b and d.the wcab denied the request,and maintains the exhibits are not part of the record.the wcab argues that the fund had more than enough opportunity to submit the proposed exhibits as evidence.while the fund had plenty of opportunity to submit evidence of the illegally uninsured employer correct identity,the fund conduct in identifying the employer and providing benefits had not been in issue until milbauer i was decided.
v.the new procedures violate sections and 
the fund contends that the wcab in milbauer i impermissibly legislated provisional joinder at priority conferences contrary to the express jurisdictional requirements of sections and.without proper jurisdiction,the fund argues it is inhibited or precluded from fulfilling its statutory obligations under section et.the wcab responds that the new procedures are authorized under section,subdivision d,yant,and the wcab general court powers.moreover,formal joinder under section,subdivision d is not replaced but follows application of the new procedures.
the wcab jurisdiction over the fund and the fund liability for compensation is specifically addressed in section,subdivision d.the plain language of the statute states that the fund can not be joined in any proceedings and is not liable for compensation,unless the employer alleged to be illegally uninsured has made a general appearance or has been served with the application and special notice of lawsuit.thus,the fund may not be joined in any wcab proceeding,provisional or otherwise,unless the statutory prerequisites are met.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,moyer,supra,cal d at.filing an application followed by a good faith effort to identify the illegally uninsured employer are not the statutory requirements.moreover,section,subdivision d is part of section,subdivision d,and there is nothing in the statutory language indicating the fund duty to furnish employer information creates an exception to jurisdiction under the statutory scheme.dubois,supra,at,d,moyer,supra,at.
while the wcab is empowered to enact rules or procedures under the proper circumstances,it may not change legislation that is within the plenary power of the legislature under article xiv,section of the california constitution.boehm associates,supra,th at,d.the wcab also may not exceed its authority by creating exceptions to statutory requirements,even for a legitimate purpose.williams,supra,th,d reversal of wcab ruling that paying benefits for two years in good faith before denying claim excused employer failure to investigate and deny claim within period as required by.therefore,the new procedures announced by the wcab in milbauer i violate section,subdivision d.
similarly,section,subdivision f expressly states that section,which authorizes priority conferences,does not apply unless the proof of service as specified in section,subdivision d has been filed.section,subdivision d requires service of the application and special notice of lawsuit on the employer alleged to be illegally uninsured in the manner provided for service of summons in the code of civil procedure.while the wcab concedes in its answer that priority conferences may not be ordered until proper joinder under section,subdivision d,the wcab contends that other conferences such as status conferences under california code of regulations,title,section are not precluded.however,milbauer i specifies priority conferences under section.moreover,the lack of jurisdiction under section,subdivision d precludes any wcab proceeding,which includes status conferences.thus,the new procedures announced by the wcab in milbauer i violate section.
vi.the new procedures violate the apa and section 
the fund alleges that the new procedures announced in milbauer i apply generally and are intended to interpret and implement section,which meets the test of tidewater marine and requires publication and public hearing under the apa and section.the wcab answers that milbauer i is a precedent decision,which is an exception to the rulemaking requirements of the apa and section under government code section,subdivision b and labor code section.the fund replies that the wcab may not avoid statutory rulemaking requirements by characterizing new procedures as precedent in an in bank decision.
a.the statutory scheme 
the legislature expressly stated that the apa is enacted to clarify and reduce the amount of administrative regulations,which saves time and money and promotes business and social goals.the apa provides procedures for state agencies to adopt regulations.tidewater marine,supra,cal th at,d.the procedures include public notice of the proposed regulation,an opportunity for comment by interested parties,and review by the office of administrative law.ibid.
under government code section the apa is expressly applicable to the wcab,although the statute provides certain provisions are excluded.for example,article,commencing with government code section,which pertains to public notice and comment,is not applicable to the wcab however,public notice and hearings in regards to wcab rulemaking is addressed by labor code sections and this interrelationship between the apa and the labor code is similar to the statutory scheme which involved the industrial welfare commission as addressed by tidewater marine,except that section expressly exempted the industrial welfare commission from the apa in order to avoid redundancy and confusion.tidewater marine,supra,cal th at,d.
government code section,subdivision b is not excluded by government code section and is applicable to the wcab,but the statute provides another exception to the rulemaking requirements of the apa.government code section et or the apa does not apply where a state agency designates as a precedent decision a decision or part of a decision that contains a significant legal or policy determination of general application that is likely to recur,subd.b.
in contrast,government code section,which defines regulation,is part of article and included in the provisions of the apa that apply to the wcab.government code section provides regulation means every rule,regulation,order,or standard of general application or the amendment,supplement,or revision of any rule,regulation,order,or standard adopted by any state agency to implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by it,or to govern its procedure.
the issue then is whether the new procedures in milbauer i are part of a precedent decision and excluded from the apa under government code section,subdivision b,or are regulations and subject to the apa under government code section.we conclude that the new procedures are primarily regulations within the meaning of government code section,and thus are subject to the applicable provisions of the apa.
b.the new procedures are regulations under the apa 
while the new procedures conceivably could be characterized as a significant legal or policy determination of general application that is likely to recur,the wcab in milbauer i stated throughout the decision that the new procedures were being adopted and announced to implement the wcab interpretation of section,subdivisions b and d and yant in future cases.in addition,sections and are made more specific by the detailed procedures.for example,the new procedures address how and when the fund shall furnish information regarding the identity of the illegally uninsured employer under section,subdivision d.thus,the definition of regulation under government code section is more applicable to the new procedures adopted and announced by milbauer i than the definition of precedent decision under government code section,subdivision b.
although tidewater marine issued before the operative date of government code section,the decision is still instructive.the supreme court in tidewater marine applied a similar test to determine whether the apa applied,based on essentially the same definition of regulation under former government code section,subdivision b.the supreme court first considered whether the rule applied generally,and second,whether the rule is intended to implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by the agency,or govern the agency procedure.tidewater marine,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court also addressed whether a precedent decision was involved,since interpretations that arise in the course of adjudication are not regulations ibid.
the new procedures in milbauer i are much more extensive than general legal conclusions or policies produced after interpretation of applicable statutes or law in the context of a specific case.milbauer i adopted and announced a whole body of entirely new procedures,after the wcab in bank concluded that the fund breached its duties under section,subdivisions b and d.
yant is a very different in bank decision.in yant,the wcab summarized the applicable law for service on parties,which included section and concluded that jurisdiction under section et could be perfected by proper identification of the illegally uninsured employer and service on said employer in the manner required by the code of civil procedure for a default or default judgment.yant also pointed out that code of civil procedure section see fn,post allows for adjudication against a fictitious party or doe,and referred to an accepted workers compensation publication for examples of how to name potential defendants.while yant also acknowledged that challenging the illegally uninsured employer identity for the first time on reconsideration is inconsistent with the fund role as intended by the legislature,the wcab in bank did not enact comprehensive new procedures but requested as a general policy early assistance from the fund counsel as an officer of the court.
c.the new procedures are regulations under sections and 
as we have pointed out,the wcab stated in milbauer i that new procedures are being adopted and announced by the decision.adopting rules of procedures by the wcab under the statutory scheme is normally addressed by the apa and section.section,subdivision a states in relevant part t he appeals board may by an order signed by four members adopt reasonable and proper rules of practice and procedure.section,subdivision b adds that,no rule or regulation of the appeals board pursuant to this section shall be adopted,amended,or rescinded without public hearings.public hearings are also addressed by section.since none of the exceptions to the requirements of public hearings in section have been argued by the wcab,and do not appear to apply,the new procedures adopted and announced by milbauer i violate sections and.
section does not apply.
the wcab is apparently arguing that section excuses compliance with the rulemaking provisions of sections and.no authority is provided for this interpretation.instead,section is generally cited for the proposition that in conducting hearings and investigations,the wcab is normally not bound by the evidence code or technical rules of pleading or procedure under the common law or the code of civil procedure.see national convenience stores workers comp.appeals bd.d.
vii.the statutory scheme provides the solution 
the wcab argues that the new procedures adopted and announced in milbauer i are justified to alleviate dilatory conduct by the fund in identifying illegally uninsured employers and providing compensation.the wcab asserts further that the fund conduct in this case is a pattern as indicated by past experience and yant.the fund insists that employer information and benefits were provided in this case,and any shortcomings are not part of a pattern.
there is substantial evidence in the record to justify the wcab conclusion in this case and concern.levesque,supra,cal d at,western growers,supra,th at,d.in completing an order of joinder,counsel for the fund provided an incorrect identity of the illegally uninsured employer.the wcj and milbauer relied on the misinformation.during eight years of litigation,the fund failed to sufficiently challenge the illegally uninsured employer correct identity,until attempting to do so in the untimely petition for reconsideration based on evidence presented by milbauer.on the other hand,schiffman reports and milbauer petition for reconsideration indicate the fund provided benefits such as surgery,and the bankruptcy documents contained in the record show the fund appeared and milbauer was permitted to proceed.
regardless of whether the fund conduct in this case is an aberration or typical,the statutory scheme and yant already provide the legal means by which injured workers in milbauer situation can gain proper and early jurisdiction over the illegally uninsured employer and the fund.
jurisdiction under the statutory scheme 
jurisdiction over the illegally uninsured employer and the fund is attained if the employer makes a general appearance or is served with the properly completed application and special notice of lawsuit in the manner provided for service of summons in the code of civil procedure,subd.d aubry,supra,th at,d.
the application and special notice of lawsuit are preprinted forms with designated space to identify the parties.code civ.the illegally uninsured employer should be identified in the application,subd.a code civ,yant,supra.the applicant is also required to identify a legal person or entity as the employer named in the special notice of lawsuit,subd.d.the requirements for proper identification of legal persons or entities can be found in code of civil procedure section et,rutter california practice guide,civil procedure before trial,chapter,sections,yant,and california workers compensation practice cont.ed.bar,ed,chapter,sections.
when the applicant is genuinely ignorant of the identity of the illegally uninsured employer,the legal person or entity identified in the application and special notice of lawsuit may include a fictitiously named or doe party sufficient for entry of a default or default judgment.code civ,yant,supra.the completed forms should indicate to the person served that the person is being served as a fictitiously named or doe defendant.code civ.the special notice of lawsuit provides a specific section for the information.
