plaintiff and appellant shon shafer shafer appeals from that portion of a judgment denying his petition for writ of mandate that requested certain relief for an alleged violation of the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act,et the act by respondents los angeles county sheriff department and leroy baca,in his capacity as sheriff of the county of los angeles collectively,the sheriff department.shafer contends that respondents failed to comply with the act by not advising him he was under investigation during a workers compensation deposition and by using improperly obtained information from another interrogation.the sheriff department terminated shafer for false statements made during the deposition and a later interrogation.by his petition,shafer sought,inter alia,to prohibit the sheriff department from using the deposition and later statements at the hearing on his appeal of his discharge before the los angeles city civil service commission the commission.the trial court required the exclusion of one statement but not others.the commission upheld the termination,and that decision is the subject of another action.
we hold that the case is not moot,for any determination here may be used in the mandamus proceeding concerning the commission decision.we uphold the trial court decision not to suppress certain statements made by shafer as within the trial court discretion to fashion an appropriate remedy under the act.we also determine that a county counsel in a workers compensation proceeding was not acting in concert with shafer commanding officer so as to be bound by the act.we therefore affirm the trial court decision.
factual and procedural background 
the sheriff department employed shafer as a deputy sheriff from june through november.from until he was assigned to the men central jail.in,while working at the jail,shafer injured his foot hopping off a bunk.he filed a workers compensation claim.ultimately he underwent surgery and was placed on injured on duty iod status pursuant to labor code section.
during shafer absence,a deputy sheriff sergeant nutt regularly contacted him to inquire as to his condition.shafer reportedly stated that he could not work because of the condition of his foot and the medication he was taking.shafer workers compensation claim ultimately led to a proceeding before the workers compensation appeals board.
sergeant nutt stated that a confidential informant,who was shafer acquaintance,reported that shafer stated that he,shafer,was a typical county employee milking the system and that shafer had made statements about the money that he was earning and how he was spending it and that he was going to stay off work as long as he could and try to earn his way on to the pga tour,things things to that effect which caused me sergeant nutt to have great concern.
on may,a sheriff department memorandum reflected a request for an investigation of shafer based on the informant statement that shafer had played golf several times.starting about may,the sheriff department began surveillance of shafer.shafer was observed engaging in physical activity without the appearance of discomfort.he was videotaped mowing the lawn and walking without any visible evidence of pain.
on june,sergeant nutt telephoned shafer and asked him if he was able to engage in physical activities,such as mowing the lawn.sergeant nutt stated that shafer responded he needed to take pain medication and that he could work light duty,but he really wanted to come back to work he said that much of the time he needed to be on crutches.in response to a question from sergeant nutt as to whether he had been able to mow the lawn,shafer said he had recently tried to mow his lawn for the first time and that it took him two and a half hours to do the backyard.up until that time,which he indicated was in the month of june,he said the only way his lawn was mowed was if his father had come over and do it for him.based on the videotape,sergeant nutt believed shafer was being untruthful.
as part of shafer workers compensation proceeding,which appeared to be before the workers compensation appeals board,on october,senior associate county counsel leah davis took shafer deposition,at which his counsel was present and at which shafer was under oath.as reported in the sheriff department interview summary,davis stated that prior to the deposition she had information from the sheriff department that shafer had made comments to a neighbor about playing golf,and thus she wanted to determine if shafer was engaging in athletic activity while on disability and allegedly not able to work.davis also reportedly stated that a dditionally,the deposition was to provide shafer an opportunity to deny the information and prove the golfing allegation was untrue.
at that deposition of shafer,the following colloquy took place 
do you play any sports or engage in any athletic activities 
prior to my injury,i did.
okay.before august of,what sorts of sports athletic activities did you engage in 
running,biking,snow skiing,surfing,water skiing,golf,tennis.
q.the gamut,huh was there anything you did do 
no.bungee jumping.
q.so you have done any running since august of 
biking,i was doing periodically up until i had the surgery in january.
snow skiing 
i have snow skied since the injury.
i was periodically golfing up until january when i had the surgery.
q.so not since the surgery 
davis asked shafer to sign the deposition transcript,but according to her,shafer attorney said they could not locate the original transcript and that it was the first time ever he the attorney had not been able to produce an original transcript.she said,and i pointed out to him that it was the first time that i had ever asked for it,in advance of trial.so it was kind of an impasse.
on september,a sheriff department investigator from the internal affairs department sergeant colton interviewed shafer,with shafer counsel present.shafer acknowledges that at that time sergeant colton advised him he was under investigation.sergeant colton questioned shafer about his deposition testimony and corrections to the transcript.
shafer stated he had made corrections to the deposition,which corrections were apparently misplaced.he said he submitted a second set of corrections from his memory to replace the lost set.after that statement and during the interrogation,shafer attorney stated shafer had made the second set of corrections based on notes he had written while originally reviewing the deposition transcript.thus,notwithstanding shafer earlier statement,shafer attorney stated that shafer obviously could not have filled out a second set of corrections from memory.the notes of the interrogation provided as follows 
dammeier shafer attorney deputy shafer is feeling a little bit badgered and intimidated in here and questions are coming out pretty fast,and he here to be up front.he did not fill out this sheet from memory.that very obviously impossible,but he did have the deposition either.he used some other stuff and you can ask him about that if you want.
colton well that like a that like a bombshell,so i tell you what,let me let me just say shon,you,obviously,know the gravity of the situation correct 
shafer yes.
on october,the sheriff department notified shafer that it intended to discharge him from his position of deputy sheriff.four charges were included in the notice of discharge,with three of them resulting from the june,october,and september,statements 
that in violation of manual of policy and procedures section,false statements,on or about october,you knowingly made false statements,after affirming under penalty of perjury during your workerman sic compensation hearing to answer questions truthfully,when you stated you had not played golf from january,through october,while off duty on injured on duty status.
that in violation of manual of policy and procedures section,false statements,between march,and november,and specifically on june,you made false statements to lieutenant nutt who at the time was the operations sergeant at temple station,regarding your inability to work due to drowsiness caused by pain medication and the fact you needed crutches to move around.
that in violation of manual of policy and procedures section,obedience to laws,regulations and orders,occupational responsibility,you repeatedly left your place of residence between january,and november,while on injured on duty status and assigned to your residence on an a schedule monday through friday,without obtaining a waiver from this policy from your unit commander or operations lieutenant.
that in violation of manual of policy and procedures sections,false statements,failure to make statements making false statements during departmental internal investigations,obstructing an investigation,on or about september,you knowingly made false statements during an interview with iab investigators when you stated you had completed a deposition correction from memory and then after conferring with your attorney,changed your statement by saying you had used notes to make the corrections.
on november,the sheriff department discharged shafer from his position of deputy sheriff based upon the four charges.the termination letter also gave shafer notice that he could file an appeal of his termination with the commission.shafer filed such an appeal.because the administrative discharge hearing before the commission occurred after the june,trial on shafer mandate petition that is the subject of this appeal,the administrative record from that hearing before the commission was not part of the record in the proceeding that is before us.the sheriff department,however,filed a request for judicial notice of that administrative record,which request we granted.
on march,prior to the commission administrative hearing on shafer discharge,shafer filed a petition for writ of mandate in the present action seeking,inter alia,to prevent the admission of his statements at the commission hearing.shafer contended that he was subjected to several interrogations in violation of the act,including his workers compensation deposition,because the sheriff department did not warn him that he was under investigation prior to an interrogation and deposition.shafer alleged that all of his statements,even after warnings were given,were the derivative fruit of the sheriff department purported failure to warn him that he was under investigation for workers compensation fraud,and that therefore all of his statements should be suppressed.
on june,the trial court granted shafer petition as to statements made by shafer to nutt,except as offered for impeachment and otherwise in accordance with government code section f.the trial court denied the petition as to other statements,ruling that deposition testimony,however,is admissible.first,petitioner himself initiated the workers compensation proceedings.second,the deposition was under the control of the county counsel,not the los angeles county sheriffs sic department.the trial court did not preclude any other ground for shafer termination.
shafer discharge hearing before the commission occurred on july and.at the discharge hearing,because of the trial court ruling,the sheriff department proceeded on the charges set forth in paragraphs,and of the discharge letter.the hearing officer sustained shafer discharge on two of these three remaining,paragraphs and,for false statements shafer made in the deposition and in the internal affairs department interview.the commission refused to stay the decision until after this appeal.on september,the commission decision was declared to be final.
the trial court in this case entered the final judgment on october,after shafer administrative hearing before the commission.that judgment provided that a llegedly false statements made by petitioner shon shafer to sergeant richard nutt between march,and november,and specifically on june,are not admissible in the commission proceeding except for impeachment purposes.on november,shafer appealed the trial court judgment.

the sheriff department contends that the appeal is moot because the commission has already acted,and its decision is final and can not be modified.the sheriff department had asserted that shafer did not file a timely petition for an administrative mandamus writ pursuant to code of civil procedure section.shafer requests that we judicially notice pleadings in shafer los angeles county sheriff,no.commenced on december,showing that shafer did in fact file such a petition.we granted that request 
in mounger gates d.mounger the court stated that section was specifically designed to allow an officer to pursue a remedy immediately in the courts for violation of the act during the investigation and not be required to wait for judicial review after administrative consideration of those violations.the court in mounger held that section authorized mounger to pursue simultaneously his judicial relief under section and his administrative appeal from any discipline imposed.mounger,supra,d at.see zazueta county of san benito th,d participation in arbitration waived rights under section,but distinguishing mounger.
