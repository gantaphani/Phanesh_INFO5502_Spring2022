introduction 
northrop grumman corporation northrop and the insurance company of the state of pennsylvania seek review of the findings and award and the order denying reconsideration in a case brought by robert graves before the workers compensation appeals board the board.we issued a writ of review.upon review,based on the entire record,we conclude the workers compensation judge graves sustained compensable industrial injury because of an investigation conducted in bad faith by northrop into racial discrimination not supported to by substantial evidence.labor code,subdivision h.we remand the matter to the board for further consideration consistent with this opinion.
ii.the facts 
background 
the current writ proceeding arises out of allegations graves engaged in racial discrimination during training of northrop employees and an ensuing investigation.graves,a caucasian man,was employed off and on as a tooling inspector for northrop between and march.in,graves was training employees at a northrop facility.the employees were learning to take aircraft measurements with certain equipment.graves and pat mccrary evaluated the trainees for accuracy in accordance with company guidelines.graves duty was to ensure that a trainee measurements were properly aligned and recorded within acceptable tolerances.graves would then certify that the trainee measurements were accurately reported.northrop required that accurate records be kept regarding the training.
leon johnson,an man,became graves supervisor in late.graves testified he had no problems on the job before march.however,in april,graves was investigated following accusations he had discriminated against an employee,harold lowe.it was further alleged graves gave preferential treatment to a caucasian employee,mike nooner.
b.the investigation report 
several of the documents that were in evidence used company and technical jargon to describe the events giving rise to lowe racial discrimination complaint and the ensuing investigation.we will avoid the use of such jargon except when quoting from northrop documents.in an undated investigation report,employee relations representative tom cushard recounted that annette schroeder had accused graves of treating lowe,an man,more harshly than other employees.schroeder,a northrop employee,made the racial discrimination allegation in a march,written statement.schroeder also said graves spoke to lowe in a demeaning manner.a northrop report related schroeder said she had commented to lowe that he did have to take that from anyone.lowe told her,yes he did because he needed graves to approve his work and he did want any trouble from him.
two supervisors,benny heredia and joe wise,were notified of schroeder written allegation and spoke to lowe.lowe confirmed that he felt he was being treated more severely than his coworkers and believed it was racially motivated.heredia and wise then contacted cushard in employee relations for assistance.lowe was then interviewed by an employee relations representative.a northrop report related lowe stated,h e felt graves had been treating him differently than the other trainees and that he believed it must be because of his race as he could not determine any other reason.lowe raised the following concerns graves was giving favors to some trainees while making lowe take measurements more accurately than others in contrast to other trainees,lowe was given no room for error graves would approve measurements made by other trainees without checking the work graves delayed responding to lowe requests to approve measurements this resulted in lowe having fewer approved measurements and the delay increased the probability that lowe equipment would be jarred,affecting the accuracy of his measurements.when the trainees achieved a particular level of accuracy in their measurements,they would receive a special job classification and a cent per hour salary bonus.
cushard then advised johnson,graves supervisor,of the allegations of racially motivated disparate treatment of lowe during the training and measurement approval process.cushard and johnson agreed to undertake a joint relations investigation.johnson obtained and compared all of the trainees certification sheets.analysis of the certification sheets and computer data showed graves approved measurements by two employees,leon robinson and nooner nooner measurements had been copied from robinson data lowe was the only trainee with a particular negative notation and graves had disapproved of an inordinate number of lowe measurements.
as part of the racial discrimination investigation,interviews were also conducted with other trainees.these interviews revealed graves allowed trainees to check each others work.when the trainees checked each others measurements,graves would give his approval without verifying the accuracy of the work.nooner was interviewed.nooner admitting losing his certification list.nooner recreated the certification list with graves agreement to approve it.nooner believed graves was particularly hard on lowe.one trainee,don austin,confirmed that he had checked other trainees work.austin confirmed that graves had then approved the trainees work without personally checking its correctness.
lowe,one of the two persons who initiated the racial discrimination complaint about graves,was interviewed.a northrop employee relations report stated,graves was unavailable during a long period of time on the weekends and lowe believed that graves would go to his car in the parking lot and sleep for an hour or two.a review of graves badge scan showed graves failed to scan out on all but one occasion when he worked a weekend day.on the occasion he did scan out,there was a discrepancy of hours and minutes from the time he scanned out to the time he badged back in on february.
cushard,the employee relations representative,then met with graves regarding the foregoing allegations.graves admitted certifying as accurate nooner recreated certification sheet austin and robinson were permitted to inspect the work of other trainees and graves approved those measurements without personally inspecting the work.graves denied sleeping in his car on weekends although he could not account for the time on february.he also said he was unaware of the requirement that he scan out on weekends.graves denied treating lowe differently than other trainees.finally,graves denied not promptly responding to lowe telephone calls.
cushard reviewed the results of the investigation with others.it was determined that graves would be disciplined as follows robert graves was issued a final warning notice and given a day disciplinary suspension for gross negligence in the performance of his duties as well as for causing discord within the workplace by treating employees in a different manner and with different requirements.graves was found to have used his quality assurance stamp in a manner inconsistent with stamp policy and procedures by stamping work that he did not inspect and assisting in the of a document that was inaccurate and would be to the employee benefit.additionally,he failed to uphold the special trust placed on a quality assurance inspector to ensure work is performed accurately and documented correctly.the concern about failing to scan out was mentioned as well.the investigation report closed with the following comment regarding the racial discrimination allegation pauline eisenberg was consulted throughout the investigation and findings due to the allegation of racial discrimination.it was determined and agreed that it could not be determined that lowe disparate treatment was the result of his race,but that the disparate treatment was apparent and that the company should take the appropriate action which would be the same,regardless of whether it was due to race,or some other basis.
c.the final warning notice 
a final warning notice was issued to graves on april.it stated in part this final warning notice is being issued because of the grossly negligent manner in which you performed your duties as a quality inspector.specifically,you stamped off work that you did not inspect and stamped off a reconstructed work document that was inaccurate.additionally,you failed to perform your inspection duties in a consistent manner,causing discord,by being overly critical of one technician work and failing to give the same allowances to him that you gave to others.this type of performance is unacceptable and in violation of northrop standards of conduct.another area of concern discovered in the investigation was your failure to scan your badge through the outbound readers when you left the site on the weekend days that you work.the notice outlined a corrective action plan that graves was required to satisfactorily complete or face further disciplinary action.
d.graves testimony 
graves testified he did not have any problems on the job until april,when he was accused of racial discrimination.he had been evaluated on an annual basis,and always rated outstanding.the workers compensation judge evidence summary states,b efore march graves received some marks,but he was never marked down until the end of by johnson.following the personnel action,johnson did not want to talk to graves.as noted previously,johnson was graves supervisor.the workers compensation judge evidence summary states graves was called in by johnson in april regarding the employee relations problem.afterwards,he did not have any meetings with johnson.johnson in fact avoided him.if he needed instructions,he would call him,but they were short communications.the workers compensation judge evidence summary relates,he would be told by coworkers that johnson would not see him that day because he had his hands full.in addition,the evidence summary notes,johnson would not give him information regarding procedures moreover,in december,johnson lowered graves performance evaluation ratings in the areas of quality and quantity of work,dependability,and cooperation.johnson also called graves to meetings that involved irrelevant issues.graves should have but did not receive a plaque for his attendance in.at another point graves testified,t he guards at the plant would be staring at photos of me and my coworker.
e.cushard testimony 
cushard testified graves was charged with allowing a inspector to inspect and then approve work as if graves had inspected himself,but he would do this with lowe working with another employee to falsify measurements concerning another trainee and finding more problems with lowe work than with the other trainees.further,cushard testified graves did admit that he approved documents for an inspection he had not actually conducted and did acknowledge a violation of the company practice and procedures.cushard recommended disciplinary action in the form of a final warning notice and a suspension be taken this was because graves conduct was considered a major violation.the only alternative would have been to terminate graves.according to cushard,graves disparate treatment of employees and the appearance of not following and procedures also factored in to the discipline recommendation.but the disciplinary action was based only on the falsification of documents and the finding that graves had treated lowe in a disparate manner.cushard testified he was unable to state whether the disparate treatment was based on race or ethnicity.
cushard denied ever threatening graves with termination or the loss of his benefits.cushard denied ever accusing graves of being a racist.while conducting the investigation,cushard did not perceive any animosity on the part of johnson toward graves.cushard had no awareness of graves being harassed by johnson.graves never discussed having any problem with johnson.the workers compensation judge evidence summary states in relation to cushard testimony,he did tell graves he felt it was a major violation that he committed and he faced either a final warning notice and suspension or a termination.according to the summary of testimony,cushard further testified he did review certification sheets concerning lowe,and his work was not done properly.he would state therefore if the work was not done properly,graves did act correctly in not signing off o n lowe work.
cushard testified the racial discrimination charge was never substantiated.cushard investigated the allegation,but found no evidence of racial discrimination by graves.graves received a suspension,however,because his offenses were major as defined in the employee handbook.graves then filed a grievance.the suspension was subsequently reversed by cushard and graves manager.
cushard said it was true that in and the facility where graves was conducting the training was being downsized.cushard explained northrop layoff policy as follows f irst,there is a determination of the classification to be reduced and the numbers to be reduced.second,the human resources department applies the seniority process.each employee is given the opportunity to bump to the same or lower classification or a previously held position.it is not done by the age of the individual.
f.johnson testimony 
as noted previously,johnson was graves supervisor.johnson approached graves about the racial discrimination allegation.graves became angry and upset.johnson further testified that prior to march,graves was a very good worker.prior to june,johnson had rated graves outstanding on his performance evaluations.he subsequently lowered graves rating in certain respects.but the performance evaluation was grieved and readjusted.
following the disciplinary action,johnson noticed changes in graves behavior.johnson described graves reaction to the discipline imposed as follows he became antisocial and distant from the other employees and johnson.he was also hard to approach and communicate with.graves was never told his job was in jeopardy.in fact,graves job was not in jeopardy.johnson denied that he was trying to avoid graves.johnson did not have any animosity toward graves.johnson denied harassing graves.
johnson testified to a change in overtime policy following,but unrelated to,graves suspension.the change came about after johnson learned graves was working overtime on weekends.this was occurring even though graves department did not need overtime staffing.johnson instructed graves and his,mccrary,that henceforth overtime had to be cleared with management.
john beck psychiatric treatment reports 
beck,a psychiatrist,prepared two psychiatric treatment reports.the first was dated november.beck diagnosed graves as suffering from a major depressive disorder in partial remission.beck found there was a direct relationship between work exposure and disability,stating a bsent the harassment and the age discrimination from which the applicant suffered there would have been no psychiatric work function impairment and a ge discrimination is a clear violation o f labor laws as is allowance of a hostile work environment where harassment may be practiced.beck concluded a ctual events of employment were responsible for of the total causation from all sources contributing to the current psychiatric injury and disability.in his february,report,beck reiterated the conclusions stated in his november,report.beck further noted graves condition had remained the same since november.at the same time,however,beck rated graves psychiatric work function impairment higher overall.
stanley goodman psychiatric evaluation report 
graves was evaluated by goodman,a psychiatrist.goodman concluded that graves was falsely charged as a racist,but was eventually absolved of these insinuations the patient has significant psychosocial stressors that is,the cumulative traumatic incidents which he perceived at work.goodman also found,t he industrial stressors of job harassment and age discrimination did produce an psychiatric injury.in addition,goodman concluded that percent of the disability was apportioned to industrial causation.goodman summarized the facts as related by graves as follows graves was falsely charged as a racist,was eventually absolved of these insinuations,but continued to be harassed and suffered age discrimination until he was eventually asked to retire there was a hostile work environment created by his manager,leon johnson,and the employee relations representative who interrogated him,tom cushard.
in conversations with goodman,graves described the crucial meeting with cushard as follows employee relations scrutinized this case very closely.graves was questioned and yelled at by an employee relations representative named tom cushard.the patient reports that cushard called him a racist and said he would get him fired.the patient says he felt like he had been talking to hitler.goodman wrote graves feels it was not coincidence that his birthday took place at around the same time as this investigation.he ha d also overheard management saying things in meetings,such as is there any other way we can get rid of the graves noted he had not had any problems at work no meetings with employee relations received commendations for his work and attendance through the years and things changed only as he neared retirement age.
goodman further reported although the racial discrimination charge was never substantiated,graves feels that many black employees are suspicious of him,which permeates the work environment.the patient says he felt as though everyone wanted him to quit.he considered doing so,but could not for medical and financial reasons also,graves is near retirement age,so it would not make sense to walk away early.graves claims that johnson has been dissecting his work ever since the incident in.however,if graves needed to speak with johnson,he would never be available for conversation.fortunately,johnson does not know much about tooling,so he was not able to pursue any further charges against graves.johnson did make the job unbearable,though,by cutting overtime,making threats,just before he retired,graves describes an incident in which he confronted johnson about the overtime issue and subsequently experienced severe shortness of breath,much like an asthma attack graves retired on april.he says he was forced to retire on this date by employee relations.if he had not been so stressed out over the prior year,the patient may not have retired yet.graves continues to suffer the symptomatology 
david appleton psychiatric evaluation 
appleton,a psychologist,evaluated graves on northrop behalf.appelton concluded graves developed a depressive disorder as a result of a personnel action at work,specifically his suspension and written reprimand for the misuse of his inspector stamp.there were also allegations that graves was involved in racial discrimination.as long as the personnel action in question was carried out in a lawful,good faith,and manner and while the patient alleges age discrimination with respect to this,he admits he misused his stamp,then the depressive disorder would not represent a compensable psychological injury under current workers compensation law.
j.the workers compensation judge findings and award 
the workers compensation judge found graves had sustained a psychiatric injury arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment.the workers compensation judge relied on graves testimony and the medical reports of goodman,dated june,and beck,dated november,and february.the workers compensation judge further found the injury caused permanent disability of percent equivalent to weeks payable at per week for a total sum of further medical treatment was required and graves injury resulted from a false accusation of racial prejudice by the employer,and harassment by johnson after the charge of racial prejudice could not be proven.original italics.the workers compensation judge concluded no lawful good faith personnel action constituted a substantial cause of graves injury.
k.the reconsideration order 
northrop and its insurer sought reconsideration.the workers compensation judge recommended that the reconsideration petition be denied.the workers compensation judge noted graves was a very credible witness graves had no problems on the job until he was accused of racial discrimination against an employee that charge was never substantiated t he allegation of racial discrimination against graves was not made in good faith it was never proven since there was a lack of evidence to support it graves was never disciplined as a result of the racial discrimination charge the only disciplinary action taken against graves was for falsification of company documents following the charge,johnson,an,would not talk to graves anymore,and then downgraded his performance evaluation graves psychiatric injury was caused by the baseless charge of racial discrimination and the investigation that followed it was not the result of a good faith personnel action it was the result of a completely unsubstantiated charge of racial discrimination graves was years old at the time,and there is evidence that he was being forced to retire,possibly because of his age the investigation was not in good faith and it singled graves out in order to have him leave the company.original italics.the workers compensation judge noted that beck had diagnosed depression as a result of graves perception of harassment and age discrimination.appleton,who examined graves for northrop,also made a depression diagnosis but concluded it was the result of a lawful,good faith,and personnel action.the board adopted the workers compensation judge report and denied reconsideration.
