a labor union and several of its individual members the union seek declaratory and injunctive relief against the massachusetts commission against discrimination mcad to prevent the mcad from adjudicating a charge of discrimination by a supervisor against the union that arose out of a labor dispute.the sole basis for the union federal complaint is its contention that the mcad proceeding is preempted by federal labor law under san diego building trades council garmon,d,and related doctrines.the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
for purposes of this appeal,we accept as true the factual allegations in the union complaint and draw all reasonable inferences from those allegations in its favor.taber partners i,cir.where the federal complaint is silent,additional details are drawn from the allegations in the verified complaint filed with the mcad.
the incidents underlying this case occurred in april,when commonwealth gas company comgas was embroiled in a bitter labor dispute.local union of the united steelworkers of america,local,was negotiating a successor collective bargaining agreement on behalf of its members,who are a bargaining unit of production and clerical employees.
on april,when the previous collective bargaining contract expired,comgas ordered a lockout of all employees who were members of local.local responded with a concerted picketing campaign against the company.in addition to picketing at comgas facilities,local sent some of its members to set up picket lines at areas where crews composed of comgas supervisors and contractors were performing work ordinarily done by local members.the purpose of these worksite picket lines was to convince the supervisors and contractors not to perform work and services for comgas that were considered to be bargaining unit work.
one of the comgas supervisors assigned to perform this work was peter mcgrath.mcgrath,who is gay,was ordinarily employed as a manager for commercial and industrial sales at the company southboro,massachusetts headquarters.shortly after the lockout began,comgas instructed mcgrath to assist a distribution crew in worcester,massachusetts.the distribution crew was charged with investigating and repairing underground gas leaks in the worcester area,work normally done by local members.
when mcgrath crew started this work,local members followed the crew and picketed its worksites.the picket lines were rowdy and vulgar.the union complaint candidly describes the pickets behavior the locked out employees would comment on how fat the scabs were,their lack of intelligence,what kinds of families they must have come from,their lack of sexual prowess,and their sexual orientation.all of this,according to the union,was calculated to persuade the distribution crew,including mcgrath,not to perform work during the lockout.
on may,mcgrath filed an action in massachusetts superior court against the local members who had shouted sexually derogatory comments at him,asserting both massachusetts common law and statutory claims.according to the union,comgas funded mcgrath state lawsuit and even provided an attorney to represent him.approximately one month later,mcgrath filed a verified complaint against the same local members in the mcad alleging discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.unusually,the literal terms of the massachusetts employment discrimination statute appear to extend to discrimination by union employees against a supervisor in this context the lockout ended on september,when comgas and local agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement.the pickets went back to work and mcgrath was subjected to no further abuse or harassment.nothing had yet happened in mcgrath state court litigation,and mcgrath voluntarily dismissed that complaint.the voluntary dismissal,it seems,was part of a general settlement between comgas and local in which each side agreed to encourage its members to dismiss pending judicial complaints based on the dispute.
mcgrath did not,however,withdraw his mcad complaint.on the contrary,mcgrath filed a new verified complaint with the mcad in november,this time including local itself and one more individual member thomas nugent as additional respondents.the complaint alleged that local members had subjected mcgrath to a continuing pattern of speech and behavior which is intimidating,threatening and harassing,and which constitutes discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation.it further alleged that local leadership was aware of the pickets unlawful behavior and failed to take any action to prevent it.according to the union,comgas funded mcgrath mcad complaint despite the end of the lockout and continued to fund the litigation through.
mcgrath two mcad complaints describe in detail the verbal abuses to which he was subjected.most were simply crude remarks on his sexual orientation however,several comments involved what mcgrath says are false and potentially damaging example,hey,watch out,he got aids,he has probably given half you guys aids by now,and look how small these guys are.you look like little boys.you and pete mcgrath should get together because he likes little boys.in addition,several of the comments involved physical threats.some of these were only vaguely threatening,and may or may not have been intended as threats of violence,do you want some up that hole,sweetie or i might like a piece of that ass myself.
two incidents described in the mcad complaints,however,involved apparently dangerous and threatening conduct.on april,several local members allegedly chased mcgrath in their vehicles for several miles.when they finally caught him,they banged on the side of mcgrath vehicle,pushed the mirror into the window,and shouted threats that included we will put you in a box and i will pull your mustache off,you faggot.on another occasion,an unidentified local member poured a liquid onto mcgrath back,causing a burning sensation.
the union and its members say they filed a motion to dismiss the mcad complaint on preemption grounds shortly after the complaints were filed.in any event,over two years later,on july,an investigating commissioner of the mcad issued a probable cause finding against the union and ordered that the case proceed to a public hearing.the commissioner certified three questions to the full commission for determination,including is the complaint by the national labor relations act as interpreted in san diego building trades council garmon,d 
the full commission answered the certified questions on december,holding that mcad jurisdiction to adjudicate mcgrath complaint was not preempted by garmon.the commission acknowledged that,under garmon,states have no authority to regulate conduct that is arguably protected under or arguably prohibited under of the national labor relations act nlra.garmon,at.nevertheless,the commission held that mcgrath allegations of harassment and threats of violence implicated the commonwealth compelling state interest in the maintenance of domestic peace,an interest that the garmon court recognized as a legitimate basis for state regulation.id.at.further,the commission held that it was not barred from considering the union less threatening verbal abuses of mcgrath because,the commission concluded,the nlra does not protect racial,ethnic,or homophobic slurs.it also found that mcgrath could not have complained about the conduct to the nlrb lastly,the commission concluded that mcgrath complaint stated a claim against local itself because it provided a sufficient basis to conclude that the organization knew of its members harassment of mcgrath and,in effect,ratified their conduct.at present,the mcad order has no preclusive effect 
more than a year later,on february,having litigated the preemption question in the mcad and lost,the union filed this action in federal district court.the complaint named as defendants the mcad,three mcad commissioners,and peter mcgrath.the union sought a declaratory judgment that the mcad proceeding was preempted both under garmon and under lodge,international association of machinists wisconsin employment relations commission,d hereinafter machinists,and an injunction prohibiting the commission from taking further action on mcgrath complaint.it also asserted a right to injunctive relief for preemption under.in response,mcgrath moved to dismiss the case on younger abstention grounds.younger harris,d.the commonwealth of massachusetts,on behalf of the mcad and its commissioners,likewise moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or,in the alternative,for abstention under younger.
on august,the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the union complaint.it reasoned that the union preemption claims are inherently defensive and thus that,under the complaint rule,the case did not arise under the laws of the united states.nevertheless,the court went on in dicta to offer the union reassurance on the merits of its garmon preemption argument,opining at length on the relationship between federal labor law and state tort law and expressing confiden ce that the mcad would take account of that relationship in adjudicating mcgrath complaint.the court did not address the question of younger abstention.
the union filed this appeal on september,approximately two weeks after the period for filing an appeal had expired.see fed.a.on the union motion,the district court granted an extension of time to file.mcgrath but not the commonwealth the district court decision to grant the extension.
timeliness of appeal 
before addressing the district court jurisdiction,we must tend to our own.the timely filing of a notice of appeal is mandatory and jurisdictional.browder,dep t of,d.nevertheless,the district court may extend the deadline in limited circumstances upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.fed.a a ii bennett city of holyoke,cir.
in this case,the period expired on september.on september,fourteen days later,the union filed its notice of appeal and attached a motion for an extension of time.mcgrath opposed the motion the other defendants did not.the district court granted it without comment.mcgrath now the court order allowing the plaintiffs to file late.we review a district court decision to grant an extension of time under rule a for abuse of discretion.bennett,at.
the grant of the extension was within the discretionary power of the district court and was not abusive.according to the union rule a motion and the attached affidavit,the attorney who was responsible for preparing the notice of appeal was preoccupied by the need to care for his infant son,who was severely ill.though counsel drafted the notice of appeal before the period expired,he failed to file it.the attorney represented that he did not become aware of this error until september,ten days after the original deadline.mcgrath says that these circumstances do not amount to excusable neglect because the plaintiffs were represented by multiple attorneys throughout the case and so the incapacity of one attorney should not have prevented a timely filing.there is some force to that argument,and the district court would not have abused its discretion if it had denied the union rule a motion on that basis.but the court opted to grant the motion instead,and given the relative brevity of the delay,the attorney plausible and uncontested explanation for it,the absence of any discernible prejudice,and the fact that the massachusetts defendants did not oppose the motion,we conclude that the trial judge did not abuse her discretion by doing so.see id.at deferring to the district court decision to grant an extension under rule a united states carson,cir similar redfield cont l cas,cir similar see also wright,miller,cooper,federal practice procedure ed.whether to grant an extension rests largely in the discretion of the district court.if it finds excusable neglect or good cause and grants an extension,the court of appeals should not this determination and in this way defeat the appeal.
jurisdiction 
we turn to the question whether the union complaint triggered the jurisdiction of the district court.our review is de novo.stewart tupperware,cir.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the action arises under federal law for purposes of and thus that the district court did have jurisdiction over the case.
preemption claims 
although styled as a complaint for declaratory judgment,the union complaint in fact seeks both declaratory and injunctive relief and,in count ii,asserts a claim directly under.for our purposes,the label of declaratory or injunctive relief does not much matter.though the declaratory judgment device reverses the formal positions of the parties,it does not alter the rules of federal jurisdiction.skelly oil phillips petroleum.accordingly,the rule in declaratory judgment actions is that if,but for the availability of the declaratory judgment procedure,the federal claim would arise only as a defense to a state created action,jurisdiction is lacking.franchise tax bd.constr.laborers vacation,d quoting wright,miller,kane,federal practice procedure ed see also penobscot nation,cir playboy,pub.serv.comm n,cir.so we must determine whether the union could assert its preemption claims in a direct action against one or more of the defendants,whether the claims could arise in a posture in a action.
the district court dismissed the union complaint because it believed,erroneously,that the union preemption claims are inherently defensive.it is true that o rdinarily federal is raised as a defense to the allegations in a plaintiff complaint.caterpillar,williams,d emphasis added.in such cases,the preemption defense,even if valid,does not convert the action into one that arises under federal law for purposes of.by unimpeachable authority,a suit does not arise under an act of congress or the constitution of the united states because prohibited thereby.gully first bank.see beneficial bank anderson,d caterpillar,at.franchise tax,at.
in many ways,this is simply an application of the complaint rule.under that rule,with rare exceptions,a suit arises under the constitution and laws of the united states only when the plaintiff statement of his own cause of action shows that it is based upon those laws or that constitution.beneficial bank,at.quoting louisville nashville mottley.penobscot nation,at.where a defendant raises preemption as a defense to a cause of action,t he most one can say is that a question of federal law is lurking in the background,just as farther in the background there lurks a question of constitutional law,the question of state power in our federal form of government.gully,at.for this reason,a defendant may not remove a state lawsuit to federal court by asserting a preemption defense,even if both parties admit that the defense is the only question truly at issue in the case.franchise tax,at.this principle is subject to a few exceptions not applicable here,notably the doctrine of complete preemption.see generally beneficial bank,at.
a claim that a state regulation is preempted by a federal statute,however,need not always arise as a defense when injunctive relief is sought against state officials.see franchise tax,at.a plaintiff may assert federal preemption as an affirmative cause of action to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.in that context,a claim of ultimately defensive in the sense that it seeks to prevent harms threatened by state constitute a federal question under.the supreme court expressly approved of such claims in a footnote in shaw delta air lines,d 
it is beyond dispute that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits to enjoin state officials from interfering with federal rights.see ex parte young.a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.
id.at.see also franchise tax,at.since shaw,the supreme court has decided a variety of cases that fit within this jurisdictional principle.see sloss,constitutional remedies for statutory violations,iowa,collecting cases.
here,the district court relied not on shaw but on public service commission wycoff.the two cases are admittedly difficult to reconcile.in wycoff,the supreme court held that a declaratory judgment action against a state utility commission did not involve a justiciable controversy.id.at.though it declined to reach the question of statutory jurisdiction,the court added the following dictum 
where the complaint in an action for declaratory judgment seeks in essence to assert a defense to an impending or threatened state court action,it is the character of the threatened action,and not the defense,which will determine whether there is jurisdiction in the district court.
id.at.emphasis added.this circuit has adhered to the wycoff dictum in the past.see nashoba communications.town of danvers,cir colonial penn group,colonial deposit,cir greenfield montague transp.area donovan,cir.we have also recognized the tension between wycoff and the shaw footnote.see playboy,at noting that the supreme court in shaw recognized jurisdiction over claims apparently precluded by wycoff w ithout explaining exactly why.
this history does not matter.a recent supreme court case eliminates any doubt about the vitality of the shaw footnote.in verizon maryland public service commission,d,a telephone company sued a state public utility commission in federal court.id.at.the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the commission,alleging that an order that the commission had issued against the company was preempted by federal law.id.the court of appeals held that the company complaint did not present a federal question under.id.citing shaw,the supreme court reversed 
we have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under to entertain such a suit.verizon seeks relief from the commission order on the ground that such regulation is by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,and its claim thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.
id.at.quoting shaw,at.
in light of verizon,the district court in this case plainly had jurisdiction over the union complaint.like the plaintiff in verizon,the union has sued a state administrative agency for declaratory and injunctive relief,alleging that the agency has acted in a manner inconsistent with federal law.this is not merely the assertion of a federal issue that,but for the declaratory judgment device,would arise only as a defense to a cause of action.verizon and shaw make clear that in suits against state officials for declaratory and injunctive relief,a plaintiff may invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts by asserting a claim of preemption,even absent an explicit statutory cause of action 
there is a further reason why the district court erred in dismissing the action.the union complaint contains two separate counts count i asserts a direct cause of action for preemption,and count ii asserts a cause of action for preemption under.the district court decision did not address the count.
almost by definition,a claim under arises under federal law and will support jurisdiction so long as it does not clearly appear to be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction.bell hood.see penobscot nation,at.of course,does not itself confer substantive federal rights it simply provides a remedy for their deprivation.see chapman houston welfare rights,d.so the union claim will support jurisdiction in this case if it colorably asserts that the mcad deprived the union of a specific right,privilege,or immunit y secured by the constitution and laws.
we conclude that it does.the supreme court held in golden state transit city of los angeles golden state transit ii,d,that the supremacy clause is not itself a source of rights enforceable under.see id.at.still,a plaintiff wishing to assert a claim of preemption may nevertheless invoke if the allegedly preempting federal statute does create such a right.see id.at.playboy,at.that test is readily satisfied here.the union alleges that the mcad adjudication of mcgrath complaint is preempted not only under garmon but also under the machinists doctrine,which recognizes that the nlra specifically confers on employers and employees a right to be free from governmental regulation of the peaceful methods of putting economic pressure on one another.machinists,at.such a claim is not frivolous on the facts of this case,given that the mcad has asserted jurisdiction to regulate the conduct of union members picketing during a labor dispute.and in golden state ii,the supreme court held that the machinists doctrine embodies a substantive right under the nlra that congress intended to be enforceable under.see at.see also livadas bradshaw,d.
accordingly,because the union claim is not immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction,bell,at,it is sufficient to confer jurisdiction under 
having determined that the district court erred in dismissing the union complaint for lack of jurisdiction,we must turn next to the question whether,under the doctrine of younger,the district court should decline to exercise jurisdiction in deference to the ongoing mcad proceedings.because the district court found that it lacked jurisdiction,it did not reach the issue of younger abstention,though it did address the substantive question of preemption 
two different categories of exceptions to younger are potentially involved here.the first is the exception for state court proceedings brought in bad faith.see huffman pursue,d.the second concerns the exceptions to younger that arise out of the preemption doctrine and the strong national interest in the uniformity of labor laws.see new orleans public service,city of new orleans,d nopsi.as to the latter,the younger analysis is in the end a question of who should decide whether there is some form of preemption by the federal labor laws the state courts on review of any mcad order,subject to review by certiorari in the supreme judicial court,or the federal courts,which also have jurisdiction over the matter.we say some form of preemption because two types of preemption may be implicated by the mcad proceedings.first,there is the more typical issue of whether federal substantive labor law conflicts with massachusetts law concerning the legality of the union conduct.see,golden state transit city of los angeles golden state i,d.second,there is the fundamentally different question of garmon forum preemption,which concerns whether both state and federal tribunals including the mcad must defer to the exclusive competence of the nlrb.garmon,at.there is no supreme court case directly on point as to the intersection between younger and garmon.the most analogous case from this circuit,chaulk.comm against discrimination,cir,found younger abstention to be inappropriate in a similar,but not identical,situation.id.at.potentially,though,there are significant differences between chaulk services and this case that may or may not require a different result here.
as all of this suggests,resolution of the younger abstention question is extremely complicated.it turns on the interplay of several different doctrines,including younger itself,the exception to younger for facially conclusive preemption that is left open in nopsi,and the doctrine of forum preemption established in garmon.it also may well depend on the answer to several questions that have not been briefed by any of the parties and on information not available to us.
for these reasons,we remand the case for further proceedings on the question of younger abstention rather than decide the issue on a blank slate.in the interests of providing guidance to the parties and the district court,we frame the basic issues.at first blush,this case might seem an easy one for younger abstention.under the framework announced by the supreme court in middlesex county ethics committee garden state bar association,d,younger abstention is ordinarily required if there is an ongoing state judicial proceeding involving the federal plaintiff that implicates important state interests and provides an adequate opportunity for the federal plaintiff to asser
