introduction 
phillip gangwish,injured while a for the city of los angeles fire department city,petitions this court for increased compensation under labor code section for late payment of permanent disability pd benefits,and under section for nonpayment under section the workers compensation appeals board wcab denied the increased compensation on grounds not raised before its decision issued,which gangwish claims violated due process and is contrary to the record.
the city answers that increased compensation under section does not apply to the late payment of pd because,as the statute requires,there were no indemnity payments of temporary disability td.the city further contends it had genuine legal doubt of liability and that increased compensation under section is also inapplicable.
we find that section is applicable to late payments of pd that follow the first pd payment,even when td is not paid.we also find that due process was violated,and the basis for the wcab decision was error.however,prior to this court interpretation of section,reasonable legal doubt of liability existed and additional increased compensation under section is not warranted.
accordingly,the wcab decision is annulled in part,and the matter is remanded.
factual and procedural background 
phillip gangwish admittedly injured both shoulders and knees,his back and skin,and sustained loss of hearing bilaterally with tinnitus,while a firefighter and inspector for the city from april,through march.in addition,gangwish injured his right knee on february,the left shoulder on july,the right calf on march,the back and right shoulder on july,and the back on august.
beginning in the,gangwish was provided medical care for hearing loss by the city.this included consultation with an audiologist,testing and hearing aids.
on march,the city had gangwish evaluated for hearing loss by eugene freed,freed diagnosed high tone hearing nerve loss and intermittent minimal tinnitus.freed also found gangwish had measured hearing loss,which was due to permanent residuals of his work around loud noise over the years.the claims administrator for the city,ana garcia,received freed report in march of,but no benefits were paid.
on or about october,gangwish retained counsel.by letter the next day,gangwish filed and served a claim form an application for adjudication of claim and other jurisdictional and procedural documents.the documents were october,by the wcab.
in a separate letter dated october,gangwish demanded payment of pd as indicated by freed report,plus percent pursuant to section,subdivision d 
garcia responded by letter of october,that the date of injury for the hearing loss is may,and section,subdivision d only applied to injuries on or after january.garcia also indicated gangwish would be by freed to address the issue of continuous trauma 
gangwish responded by letter of october,that freed stated the hearing loss occurred over the years,or due to a cumulative trauma.gangwish again demanded payment of pd and a section increase,and added that if not paid,he would pursue multiple penalties under section 
on october,the city issued a pd payment of based on the march,report of freed.the payment included accrued pd,but not a section increase.
freed reevaluated gangwish for the city on november.in a permanent and stationary report to garcia,freed responded that according to gangwish there had been no specific hearing injury on or about may,only treatment.as indicated in the previous report,the hearing loss began in the mid and worsened over the years due to noise from sirens,air horns,traffic and heavy equipment.
on january,the city issued another pd payment for,apparently covering the period of november,through january.
gangwish later filed a petition for imposition of penalties against permanent disability.gangwish alleged the city was obligated to begin payment of pd within days of freed march,report,and the failure to do so for the reason given by garcia required a percent penalty under section.in addition,when payment of pd was finally made months later,the city did not include the percent increase under section,subdivision d,which was unreasonable and justifies a second percent penalty under section.
the parties proceeded to trial on the issues of pd and multiple penalties.gangwish testified of his overall disability,and that his hearing loss and treatment continued since the.
garcia also testified.she stated there was no payment of pd from march of until october,because she overlooked the hearing loss readings reported by freed.when payment was made,garcia had received the hearing loss application for adjudication of claim,but did not include a percent increase under section because a injury was involved.
on garcia conceded awareness of a continuous trauma hearing loss with reading of freed report in march of.garcia also admitted not providing gangwish a claim form,and that she knew of section when the pd payment was made.in addition,no td was paid for the hearing loss,and under section,subdivision b pd is to be paid within days of succession of td.
the workers compensation judge wcj determined that gangwish was permanently totally disabled.in regards to penalty,the wcj awarded a single percent increase under section because the city failed to timely advance pd despite competent medical evidence.the city has not challenged this finding.
gangwish filed for reconsideration with the wcab.gangwish agreed with the wcj that the city unreasonably failed to pay pd for months after receiving freed report,and penalty was justified.however,gangwish alleged that section also applied,and that the city failure to pay the increase should have resulted in another section penalty.
in the report on reconsideration the wcj responded that section does not apply where there were no periodic payments of td or pd,as indicated by section,subdivision b since section was inapplicable,there was no unreasonable refusal or delay in paying the percent increase.
the wcab denied reconsideration.however,the wcab rejected the wcj reasons.instead,the wcab concluded that section is not triggered because,under section,subdivision d,no increase shall apply to any payment due prior to or within days after the date the claim form was submitted to the employer under section.emphasis added.
the wcab reasoned that in order for the percent increase to apply,the claim form had to be filed before the pd payment on october.since gangwish did not offer the hearing loss claim form into evidence,this showing was not made.therefore,no additional section penalty was owed.
gangwish filed for review with this court.gangwish points out that the hearing loss claim form was submitted to the city on october,and was contained in the wcab file.in addition,gangwish argues that the city breached its obligation to provide the claim form under section,subdivision a,when informed of injury and disability by freed report,and should be estopped from relying on the requirement.since section did apply and the percent increase was owed,a section should also be assessed.
gangwish further contends the wcab reasoning regarding the claim form was never raised prior to its decision,which denied due process under rucker workers comp.appeals bd.th,d given the opportunity,gangwish would have argued that the city breached its duty to provide the claim form and should be estopped,and the claim form was served days in advance of the pd payment as documented by the wcab own file.
the city answers that the only evidence concerning the claim form was that garcia did not provide it,which did not exclude the possibility someone else did.in regards to service of the claim form,the october,letter from gangwish did not include a proof of service.
the city also argues that according to section,subdivision b,payment of pd does not arise unless within days of the last payment of td.since td was not paid,pd was not owed,nor was the percent increase for late payment of pd under section,subdivision d.in addition,there was no unreasonable refusal or delay under section,since there was genuine doubt from a legal standpoint as to liability under section.
