in a workers compensation proceeding for death benefits,a panel qualified medical evaluator,requested a copy of certain records in an ex parte telephone conversation with defense counsel.the claimant objected to the ex parte communication and petitioned,inter alia,for a new panel qualified medical evaluator under section,subdivision f,which prohibits ex parte communications between a party and a panel qualified medical evaluator and,in the event of a violation,allows the other party to seek a new panel qualified medical evaluator from another panel.the workers compensation appeals board wcab denied the petition,reasoning that the ex parte communication was not prohibited by the statute because the communication was initiated by the panel qualified medical evaluator,not a party,and involved administrative,not substantive matters or the merits of the claim.
the claimant petitioned for writ of review,contending that section,subdivision f explicitly precludes any ex parte communication between a panel qualified medical evaluator and a party and that the wcab may not add exceptions not contained in the statute.claimant also asserted that the failure to enforce the prohibition against the ex parte communications denied him due process of law and was not based on substantial evidence.
we hold that section expressly prohibits ex parte communications with a panel qualified medical evaluator,with no exception based on the initiator of the communication or for administrative matters.nevertheless,because a certain degree of informality in workers compensation procedures has been recognized,not every conceivable ex parte communication permits a party to obtain a new evaluation from another panel qualified medical evaluator.we remand the matter to the wcab to reconsider the matter in view of our interpretation of the applicable statute.
factual and procedural background 
respondent andromeda entertainment,respondent conducted business under the name galaxy ballroom.maria parades was a waitress for galaxy ballroom.she died from intracerebellar hemorrhage and hypertension on september.carlos alvarez alvarez or petitioner,her widower and guardian at litem of their two minor children,filed a claim for workers compensation death benefits,alleging that parades death was caused by her work.the workers compensation insurer,state compensation insurance fund fund,denied the claim.
donald miller,was selected as a panel qualified medical evaluator pursuant to section miller issued a medical report dated september.
on december,miller testified in his deposition that medical records indicated that parades suffered from stress,severe headaches,and possible initial cerebral bleeding approximately three months before her death,and that one of parades sisters had said that a possible source of parades stress was the alleged sexual abuse by alvarez of his daughter that had resulted in a restraining order against alvarez.miller,however,could not specify the medical record or cite the page that contained the sister statement.miller also testified that he may have obtained from an investigative report or background report information that one of parades sisters had never heard parades complain of harassment at work,but apparently miller medical report did not identify any investigative or background report as one of the documents he received or upon which he relied.miller said that the report may be put away with all these records there on the side,and that he would have to go through that whole stack.miller could not identify his source of information in the review of medical records section of his report,which summarized pages of records sent to him by the defense attorney or insurance company.miller said he would be willing to review and clarify the records he had received or relied upon as required by section,subdivision d,including eight pages described only as miscellaneous records.
on december,miller telephoned the defense attorney for the fund who had attended miller deposition.miller stated that the records could not be located and requested another copy.
in a letter dated the same day,defense counsel wrote counsel for alvarez that,at the conclusion of miller deposition,the parties and miller had agreed that miller would more specifically describe the pages of records he reviewed,as he believed he still had them.defense counsel then said,i just received a brief telephone call from miller who stated that the records have not been found and presumably were shredded by his staff after his review.defense counsel suggested that the records would have to be resent if the parties desired more specificity,and that the adjuster should be contacted directly.
in a letter dated december,counsel for alvarez responded that defense counsel had clearly violated the labor code by having an ex parte conversation with the panel qme.alvarez subsequently filed a petition objecting to the ex parte communication between miller and defense counsel.alvarez requested that miller report be stricken that a new panel qualified medical evaluator be selected and that penalties and sanctions be imposed,including costs and attorneys fees under sections and 
at trial,defense counsel testified that miller called on her direct line and advised that his office could not locate some records previously sent.defense counsel testified further that telephone calls from doctors are not customary,and it took a couple of beats to identify the caller.defense counsel practice is to terminate an inappropriate call as soon as possible.when defense counsel realized who was calling,she terminated the call as soon as possible.she testified that the call lasted less than one minute.defense counsel informed miller that counsel for alvarez would be contacted to see how getting another copy of records to the doctor should be handled.defense counsel advised miller that he should not be calling directly.according to defense counsel,miller only requested medical documents that miller office could not locate,and there was no discussion about the merits of the case or anything else.immediately after the call,defense counsel sent a letter to opposing counsel referring to the conversation and stating that as a result,if opposing counsel desired more specificity,the documents would have to be resent to miller and that opposing counsel should contact the adjuster.
the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj issued findings and order that there was no improper ex parte communication between defense counsel and the panel qualified medical evaluator in violation of section.the wcj also denied alvarez petition to strike miller report and request for penalties and sanctions.in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained that the findings and order were based on the credible and unrebutted testimony of defense counsel.
alvarez petitioned the wcab for reconsideration,contending that miller ex parte conversation with defense counsel regarding the records violated the express provisions of section.alvarez contended further that the wcj exceeded his authority by adding exceptions to the plain language of section,which prohibits all ex parte communications with the panel qualified medical evaluator,unless by the employee or employee dependent if the employee is deceased,in connection with an examination.alvarez noted that the new qualified medical evaluator regulations also prohibit all ex parte communications and that a single violation may result in a penalty,tit,subd.b,subd.b,subd.b.
in the report on reconsideration or alternatively for removal of the matter to the wcab,the wcj stated that if every ex parte communication with a panel qualified medical evaluator violated section,administrative matters such as scheduling appointments,confirming appearances or receipt of records would require conference calls or correspondences between parties,which requirement would be contrary to meeting statutory deadlines and providing benefits to employees expeditiously.the wcj explained that ex parte communications are not prohibited or improper when they involve only administrative or procedural matters and not the merits of the case or when either side gains an advantage.

interpretation and application of statutory language 
section,subdivision e provides in pertinent part,all communications with an agreed medical evaluator or a qualified medical evaluator selected from a panel before a medical evaluation shall be in writing and shall be served on the opposing party.any subsequent communication with the medical evaluator shall be in writing and shall be served on the opposing party.section,subdivision f begins by stating,ex parte communication with an agreed medical evaluator or qualified medical evaluator selected from a panel is prohibited.that section adds that if there is such a communication the aggrieved party may seek a new evaluation from another evaluator.
the statutory language clearly evidences the intent of the legislature to prohibit unauthorized ex parte communication,whether written or oral,between a party and an agreed or panel qualified medical evaluator.the regulations pertaining to qualified medical evaluators,although effective february,the event in issue the prohibition of ex parte communications with a panel qualified medical evaluator as set forth in section and provide that even a single violation can result in discipline 
section does not provide that some classes of ex parte communications are permissible,as suggested by the wcj and wcab.although section sets forth detailed procedures by which parties are to disclose information and records to the medical evaluator and provides remedies for violations of those procedures,the statute does not distinguish between ex parte communications on the basis of whether the communication was initiated by a party or by the medical evaluator.to hold that the statute does not proscribe ex parte communications initiated by the medical evaluator would suggest that a party is excused from the proscriptions of section and may discuss the merits of the case with the medical evaluator based solely on the fortuity that the medical evaluator initiated the conversation.
although section,subdivision f says,if a party communicates with the agreed medical evaluator or the qualified medical evaluator in violation of subdivision e,the aggrieved party has a remedy,that provision does not specify that the prohibited communication must,as the wcab said,be initiated by the party.the provisions prohibit ex parte communications without any suggestion that those initiated by the medical evaluator are exempt.to allow unfettered ex parte discussions if initiated by the medical evaluator would undermine the statute.
in addition,section does not state that ex parte communications are permissible if the subject matter is administrative or procedural rather than substantive or on the merits,or otherwise gives a party an advantage.the only statutory exception to the proscription against ex parte communications is set forth in section,subdivision h which concerns communication by the employee or the deceased employee dependent in the course of or in connection with the examination.
neither the wcj nor the wcab may graft exceptions to clear statutory prohibition language to accomplish a presumed legislative purpose or intent that does not appear on the face of the statute or from the legislative history.see burden snowden cal th,california teachers governing board of rialto unified school dist.cal th,california teachers san diego community college dist.cal d.there is nothing in the legislative history of which we are aware that supports the interpretation by the wcj or wcab.
when the legislature has intended to provide an exception to the prohibitions on ex parte communications,it has expressly so stated.for example,as noted,section,subdivision h states,subdivisions e and f shall not apply to written communications by the employee or,if the employee is deceased,the employee dependent,in the course of the examination or at the request of the evaluator in connection with the examination.the legislature also has set forth exceptions to prohibitions on ex parte communications in other statutes.under the administrative procedures act,et,the legislature provided that ex parte communications otherwise precluded are permissible,inter alia,if the communication concerns a matter of procedure or practice,including a request for a continuance,that is not in controversy,subd.b see department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th.business and professions code section,subdivisions a,b and c,prohibits ex parte communications with the gambling control commission upon the merits of an application.public resources code section allows ex parte communications with a coastal commission member only if disclosure is made within a specified period.see also,water code,pub,pub,subds.a,c,subd.c.the california rules of professional conduct prohibit lawyers from having ex parte communications with a judge upon the merits of a contested matter.rules conduct,rule b.the california code of judicial ethics provides that a judge shall not initiate,permit,or consider an ex parte application communications except d a judge may initiate ex parte communications,where circumstances require,for scheduling,administrative purposes,or emergencies that do not deal with substantive matters so long as certain conditions are met.jud.ethics,canon d.the california ethics standards for neutral arbitrators in contractual arbitration,promulgated pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a provides in standard,subdivision a that an arbitrator must not initiate,permit,or consider any ex parte communications,except that b a n arbitrator may communicate with a party in the absence of other parties about administrative matters,such as setting the time and place of hearings or making other arrangements for the conduct of the proceedings,as long as the arbitrator reasonably believes that the communication will not result in a procedural or tactical advantage for any party.none of these express exceptions is contained in section.
moreover,california code of regulations,title,section prohibits ex parte communications with a regular physician section or qualified medical evaluator when the employee is unrepresented section with respect to the merits of the case unless ordered to do so by the workers compensation appeals board.this regulation,or a variation of it,has been in effect for a number of years with this background,the legislature in section prohibited ex parte communications without limiting the prohibition to communications on the merits.that further suggests that the legislature did not intend such a limitation in connection with section.
with regard to ex parte communications with a judge or arbitrator,the judge or arbitrator,based on his or her training and experience,would be expected to be able to draw a distinction between purely procedural and scheduling matters on the one hand and matters affecting the merits on the other hand.so it is understandable why the legislature carved out the exceptions to ex parte communications in that context.but medical evaluators do not have the same background and experience that judges and arbitrators have to draw such distinctions.in a field that is dependent on expert medical opinions,the impartiality and appearance of impartiality of the panel qualified medical evaluator is critical.thus,there are justifications for a strict rule prohibiting all ex parte communications in this context.
under the rule proposed by the wcj and wcab,the mere act of inquiring into who initiated the communication or whether the subject of an ex parte communication was substantive or procedural or administrative undermines the appearance of impartiality and the legitimacy of the medical evaluation process.it is to avoid such difficulties that section prohibits ex parte communications and mandates that all communications between counsel and the medical evaluator shall be in writing and shall be served on the opposing party when sent to the medical evaluator,subd.e,italics added.
the wcj relied upon mathew zaheri new motor vehicle bd.th,in which the court affirmed a trial court decision denying a writ of mandamus to set aside a new motor vehicle board decision because of an ex parte communication between the franchisor counsel and the administrative law judges.counsel for the franchisor had told the administrative law judge that he feared for his safety.the trial court determined that the communication did not violate the terms of the administrative procedures act then in effect and applicable to the vehicle code.the court said the ex parte communication was a breach of legal ethics,but did not constitute a statutory violation,and was not a miscarriage of justice.here,in contrast,we deal with a purported violation of an express statutory provision and not just an ethical lapse.
generally,as here,a violation of an unqualified prohibition on ex parte communications requires no showing of prejudice to invoke the appropriate remedy.see rondon alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.th,see department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals,supra,cal th at.when ex parte communications are not unqualifiedly prohibited,prejudice may need to be shown to invoke a remedy.see mathew zaheri new motor vehicle,supra,th.the difficulty in determining the actual content of the communication and its effects may render a prejudice analysis ineffectual.contrary to respondents argument,whether a party is an aggrieved party under section has nothing to do with prejudice.it is concerned with whether the party has standing and is a proper party to seek review.see,county of alameda carleson cal d,hensley hensley d,san francisco unified school dist.state of california d.
nevertheless,an ex parte communication may be so insignificant and inconsequential that any resulting repercussion would be unreasonable.we should not interpret or apply statutory language in a manner that will lead to absurd results.in re michele cal th,the language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the legislature did not intend people loeun cal th,people ventura refining cal,general terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to an absurd consequence people superior court blanquel th.surely a mere ex parte greeting prior to proceedings or ex parte comment about the weather or traffic would not invoke the remedy under section.this being so,neither should a communication unrelated to the case or so peripheral to the operative proceedings as to be insignificant.a certain amount of informality is anticipated in workers compensation act proceedings.the wcj and wcab may make inquiry in the manner which is best calculated to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties and carry out justly the spirit and provisions of this division no informality in any proceeding or in the manner of taking testimony shall invalidate any order,decision,award,or rule made and filed as specified in this division see northwestern industrial acc.com.cal,the workmen compensation act and the constitution both expressly require the commission to proceed without formality county of sacramento workers comp.appeals bd.th,in the workers compensation system,p rocedural informality that would make the civil practitioner shudder is normal.but even a flexible system must have structure.
here,miller called defense counsel requesting copies of records.defense counsel said that she told miller he should not be contacting her directly,that she would contact counsel for alvarez about the communication,and that she terminated the call as soon as one minute.this communication might be so inconsequential so as not to be covered by section.on the other hand,the connection between the call by miller and his earlier testimony,any suggestion that miller and defense counsel agreed on how to proceed,and miller willingness to initiate an ex parte communication with defense counsel may suggest that the remedy set forth in section,subdivision f is required.
the wcab should reevaluate its conclusion based on the principles we have discussed and not based on any distinction between administrative and substantive nature of the communication or on who initiated the communication.
in view of our conclusion,we do not reach the due process or substantial evidence issues.
