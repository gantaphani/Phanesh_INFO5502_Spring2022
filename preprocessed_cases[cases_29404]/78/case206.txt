as kevin carter discovered in this case,it rarely pays to lie.in applying for a position with tennant company,carter completed a health history questionnaire that inquired about his prior injuries and medical care.carter failed to report a back injury from an earlier job,an omission that tennant discovered when carter filed for workers compensation benefits after the injury while working for tennant.shortly thereafter,tennant dismissed carter.carter sued,alleging both that tennant had discharged him in retaliation for making his workers compensation claims and that tennant health history questionnaire violated illinois right to privacy in the workplace act privacy act,ilcs et.the district court granted summary judgment for tennant with respect to both of carter claims.we affirm.
from august until april,carter served as a custodian for gurnee school district.on november,carter injured his back while at work and filed a workers compensation claim.carter workers compensation benefits paid for frequent chiropractic treatments for his injury.in april,carter resigned from his position with gurnee to accept a position with tennant.as part of the application process for the tennant position,carter was required to complete and sign a health history questionnaire.the questionnaire first asked carter to identify and explain any health conditions that he had suffered.carter answered misalignment of vertebrae corrected by chiropractic adjustment.carter then answered in the affirmative the following three questions have you ever had any occupational injuries,accidents or illnesses did you lose time from work for a injury or illness list,date occurred and company worked for at the time and did you see a medical doctor for any in answering the second question,carter wrote only hair caught on motor shaft,resulting in swelling of scalp and face.in response to the third question,he answered,saw doctor for above incident.at the conclusion of the questionnaire,carter signed below the following statement i hereby certify that i have answered the above questions to the best of my knowledge and that the answers are complete and true.any misrepresentation or omission may be justification for refusal of employment,or if employed,termination of employment.as carter acknowledges on appeal,he did not tell tennant about his gurnee injury or medical care and benefits when he completed the questionnaire.
tennant hired carter on april.carter continued to receive workers compensation benefits for his gurnee injury until september,when he failed to attend a mandatory medical examination.two weeks later,on september,carter informed his tennant supervisor that he had injured his back while working at a customer site.he immediately sought treatment from his regular chiropractor,jeffrey watkin.the next day,watkin submitted a workers compensation attending physician supplement report to tennant,in which he described the injury as lower back pain reaggravated at work and listed the date of the injury as november,the date on which carter injured his back while at gurnee.on november,tennant workers compensation carrier informed the company that it was denying carter workers compensation claim because he had filed a prior claim with gurnee for his back injury and was receiving treatment for this injury.carter continued to work for tennant following his injury and the denial of his workers compensation claim,during which time he received positive evaluations,as well as a retroactive merit salary increase.
some time after november,tennant disability council met to consider carter case.according to tennant,t he purposes of the disability council were to analyze the types of workplace injuries which occurred,in an effort to reduce the occurrence of workplace injuries by developing training to develop plans for injured employees to assist employees in resuming their regular duties and to formulate specific action plans for individual employees.the testimony of the tennant employees who sat on the disability council is inconsistent as to whether the council had final authority to terminate an employee,but there seems to be some consensus that the council made the decision to discharge carter.on november,carter supervisors informed him that he was being terminated effective december.
on january,carter filed a complaint with the illinois department of labor alleging that tennant health history questionnaire violated section of the privacy act.after a hearing,the administrative law judge issued a notice stating please take notice that the department of labor has concluded its administration and enforcement of the privacy act in the above captioned case.the department will take no further action in this matter.therefore,pursuant to ilcs c,the complainant has leave to pursue other civil remedies.on february,carter filed this action in the circuit court of cook county.carter first raised a retaliatory discharge claim,alleging that tennant terminated plaintiff as a direct consequence of learning of his exercise of his rights as guaranteed under the illinois workers compensation act before he became an employee.in addition,he charged that tennant had violated the privacy act by wilfully and knowingly terminat ing plaintiff employment based upon its allegations that plaintiff failure to provide it with answers to prohibited inquiries constituted falsification of his health history.tennant removed the case to the northern district of illinois based on federal diversity jurisdiction.on june,the district court granted summary judgment for tennant on both counts of carter complaint.this appeal followed.
we first consider carter claim that tennant illegally discharged him in retaliation for his filing a workers compensation claim for his back injury.the district court granted tennant motion for summary judgment on this claim,a decision that we review de novo.mcdonald vill.of winnetka,cir.under illinois law,a valid claim for retaliatory discharge requires a showing that an employee has been discharged in retaliation for the employee activities and that the discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy.bourbon kmart,cir citing hartlein.power.in the workers compensation context,a plaintiff must show that he was the defendant employee before his injury that he exercised a right granted by the workers compensation act and that he was discharged from his employment with a causal connection to his filing a workers compensation claim.hiatt rockwell int l,cir citing kritzen flender,d.the element of causation is not met if the employer has a valid basis,which is not pretextual,for discharging the employee.hartlein,at.an employee discharge for filing a workers compensation claim against her current employer or her prior employer is equally offensive to the public policy of this state as stated in the workers compensation act.darnell impact.
there is some uncertainty,however,with respect to the applicability of this framework when a retaliatory discharge case wander s into federal court by virtue of diversity jurisdiction.bourbon,at posner,concurring see mcewen delta air lines,cir.the alternative would be the method presented in mcdonnell douglas green,d.the latter is appropriate if it merely establishes procedures for federal courts to use in adjudicating cases the approach is required if it is substantive.
this is of potential importance because the supreme court of illinois expressly rejected the application of mcdonnell douglas to illinois cases in clemons mech.devices.bourbon,at posner,concurring.the illinois court was concerned that use of the mcdonnell douglas framework would,in essence,expand the tort of retaliatory discharge by reducing plaintiff burden of proving the elements of the tort.clemons,at.application of mcdonnell douglas,it thought,would relieve plaintiffs of their burden to prove as an element of their prima facie case under illinois law a causal link between their workers compensation claims and their discharge.id.
despite the substantive tone of the illinois court comments,this court has previously stated that illinois retaliatory discharge cases brought in federal court may be analyzed using the method presented in mcdonnell douglas,rather than the approach outlined by the illinois courts.id.at citing hiatt,at.the supreme court has repeatedly emphasized that the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of persuasion throughout the process.see,reeves sanderson plumbing products,d texas of cmty.affairs burdine,d.as we noted in mcewen,supra,this implies that mcdonnell douglas merely structures a procedure.and that procedure is by now very.to establish a prima facie case using this method,the plaintiff must show that he was in a protected class,that he was performing his job satisfactorily,that he was nevertheless the subject of a materially adverse employment action,and that others outside the class were treated more favorably.id.if a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case,the employer must then articulate a legitimate,reason for his termination.the burden then shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer proffered reason is nothing more than a pretext for unlawful discrimination.id.
although s omeday we have to decide what the prima facie case of retaliation is in the seventh circuit,bourbon,at posner,concurring,this is not the moment of truth.first,as in bourbon,the question whether the illinois standard or the mcdonnell douglas standard should control was ignored by the parties,hence waived on appeal.id.at.second,under either standard,carter loses if tennant can provide a valid,reason for its decision to terminate carter.we agree with the district court that tennant has provided such a reason.tennant has consistently argued that it discharged carter not because he filed a workers compensation claim,but because he falsified his answers on the health questionnaire when he failed to report his gurnee back injury despite being asked whether he had suffered any occupational injuries.tennant decision to terminate carter on this basis is consistent with the questionnaire warning that a ny misrepresentation or omission may be justification for refusal of employment,or if employed,termination of employment,as well as tennant employee manual,which cautions that p roviding false or misleading information in personnel records,time cards,information about injuries,or other company records or documents may lead to suspension and disciplinary action,up to including termination.
while carter concedes that he failed to report his gurnee injury on the questionnaire,he nonetheless argues that his discharge was impermissible because tennant proffered explanation for his termination was pretextual.he has three arguments in support of this position.first,he suggests that the timing of tennant discovery of carter workers compensation claims and its decision to fire him shows that his discharge was retaliatory.carter points to three relevant dates on or about september,he filed his tennant workers compensation claim on november,tennant learned of his back injury and his gurnee workers compensation claim for the first time and sometime between november and november,the disability council decided to terminate him.carter has waived this argument,however,because he presented it for the first time in his reply brief.see aps sports collectibles,sports time,cir.moreover,nothing in this sequence of events helps us to distinguish between a discharge for filing workers compensation claims and a discharge for a dishonest omission on the questionnaire.
next,carter argues that the deposition of ryan rebman,chair of tennant disability council,provides direct evidence that carter was terminated because of his workers compensation claims.when asked why tennant discharged carter,rebman stated m y understanding is his termination is because of filing a work comp claim.rebman then went on to explain in my judgment,he did talk about his being treated for work comp injury while employed at tennant company.rebman comments are subject to several interpretations,given that tennant learned of carter preexisting back injury and his gurnee workers compensation claim at the same time.it is therefore just as likely that rebman meant that tennant terminated carter because he failed to report his prior injury,rather than his prior workers compensation claim.thus,rebman statement does not establish that tennant explanation for its decision to discharge carter was pretextual.finally,carter argues that tennant admitted that it terminated him because of his workers compensation claims when it stated in a filing to the district court rebman testimony,whether corrected or not,refers only to carter claim against gurnee.but this is disingenuous the very next sentence in that filing says,thus,rebman testimony suggests only that rebman believed carter termination resulted in part from issues arising from his undisclosed,injury.read together,these statements support tennant proffered explanation for its decision to fire carter.
carter next argues that,even if tennant explanation is,tennant should not be allowed to avoid liability on his retaliatory discharge claim because its questionnaire illegally required him to disclose whether he had received workers compensation.but the illinois supreme court decision in darnell shows that the two laws the privacy act and the workers compensation law do not work together in that way.in darnell,the court had to decide whether impact industries impermissibly terminated darnell for lying on her employment application.the application required darnell to state whether she had a serious illness or injury in the past years and whether she had ever received compensation for injuries,at.she answered both questions in the negative.id.after impact industries learned that she had filed a workers compensation claim for injuries sustained at her previous job,it terminated her,and she filed a retaliatory discharge claim.id.the majority held that the circuit court erred in directing a verdict for impact industries because there was some evidence suggesting that it had fired her because she had received workers compensation.id.at.in his concurrence,which joined the opinion and concurred in the result,and thereby provided the deciding vote in favor of the majority position,justice simon emphasized that the opinion does not suggest,however,much less hold,that the defendant could not have discharged the plaintiff for dishonesty if it demonstrated,as it contends was the case,that she had lied on her application.id.at simon,concurring.following this reasoning,we hold that carter can not prevail on his retaliatory discharge claim simply because he was required to answer questions that may be invalid under illinois law.carter did not decline to answer tennant questions,as he might have done if he had thought they were impermissible.he answered them dishonestly,and this provides a valid,reason for tennant decision to discharge him.we therefore affirm the district court grant of summary judgment to tennant on carter retaliatory discharge claim.
we now turn to carter privacy act claim.initially,we address our jurisdiction over this claim.as we noted earlier,carter began this litigation in state court,and tennant removed it to federal court in reliance on the diversity jurisdiction.see.the two parties are citizens of different states carter is an illinois citizen and tennant is incorporated in minnesota and has its principal place of business there.the amount in controversy was also satisfied at the outset of the suit,taking both of carter claims against tennant into account.see fed.civ.a.for his retaliatory discharge claim,he sought compensatory damages for the loss of his job and associated pain,suffering,and emotional distress,and punitive damages of at least for his privacy act claim,he asked for unspecified actual damages including pain,suffering,and emotional distress,because the violation of the act was wilful and knowing,and further relief in the court discretion.although the jurisdictional amount was easily met by aggregating both claims,as the law permits,see snyder harris,d,once the retaliatory discharge claim disappeared a claim arguably worth less than was all that remained.
there is a conflict in the circuits on the way to handle this situation.th
