john andersen sustained industrial injuries while working for respondent city of santa barbara city.andersen filed a workers compensation claim contending that city discriminated against him by forcing him to use vacation time rather than sick leave to obtain medical care for those injuries.he also argued that the workers compensation appeals board board improperly applied the apportionment provisions of senate bill reg.sess.sb retroactively,and no substantial evidence supports the opinion of the agreed medical examiner ame regarding apportionment.on april,board concluded that city did not violate the provisions of section,and therefore,andersen is not entitled to restoration of the vacation time he used for such medical appointments.
andersen petitioned this court for a writ of review.we summarily denied this petition and andersen sought review in our supreme court.his petition to the supreme court raised only the issue of whether city violated section.the supreme court granted the petition,and transferred the matter back to this court with directions to vacate our summary denial and issue a writ of review to be heard on calendar.we have done so.
we now conclude that city violated section by requiring andersen to use his earned vacation time rather than sick leave to attend medical appointments to care for his industrial injuries.we also conclude that board properly applied sb,and substantial evidence supports the apportionment opinion of the ame.
while andersen was employed as a finance supervisor for city,he developed pain in his elbows,wrists and hands.he filed a claim for workers compensation.morrison mcdavid,an orthopedic surgeon,served as the ame.after conducting a medical examination and reviewing the other medical records in the case,mcdavid opined that andersen suffered from degenerative disks,ulnar neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome while working for city.mcdavid concluded that roughly percent of these permanent injuries were due to cumulative trauma at work,and percent of the injuries were caused by factors.later,mcdavid revised the percentage of disability for his cervical disabilities upwards to percent.
andersen returned to modified work on may,but needed to obtain medical care for these injuries.pursuant to ordinance and policy,city required him to use his earned vacation time rather than sick leave to attend the medical appointments he needed to care for these industrial injuries.workers with injuries could use their sick leave for such matters.santa barbara,memorandum of understanding mou.
in applying for workers compensation benefits,andersen alleged that city discriminated against him,within the meaning of section,by forcing him to use vacation time rather than sick leave,as injured employees were allowed to do.board found that city did not illegally discriminate against him.because local law did not require city to allow the use of sick leave for such medical appointments,the workers compensation judge wcj and board concluded that andersen was not entitled to have his vacation time restored for the hours he used to care for his industrial injuries.
initially,the wcj and board determined there was no basis for further apportionment.in an amended ruling upon reconsideration,board adjusted the permanent disability pd rating from to percent.in providing for pd,board used the new rating schedule which was developed pursuant to sb.andersen petitioned this court for a writ of review.
