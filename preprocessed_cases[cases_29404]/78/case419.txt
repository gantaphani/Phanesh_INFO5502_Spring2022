daniel vera petitioned for review of a decision by the workers compensation appeals board wcab denying his petition for reconsideration of a decision awarding him permanent disability benefits in the amount of.the wcab decision was premised on the application of the schedule for rating permanent disabilities that went into effect on january,tit,which vera argues does not apply to his case.
we granted review,and we now conclude that the wcab properly denied the petition for reconsideration because the schedule for rating permanent disabilities that went into effect on january,applies to vera case.accordingly,we affirm the decision of the wcab.
factual and procedural background 
on march,while employed as a laborer by sapper construction,vera sustained injury to his neck,back and right shoulder.
at the time of the injury,sapper construction workers compensation insurance carrier was state compensation insurance fund scif.scif paid temporary disability benefits to vera from march,to february,and permanent disability benefits from february,to september,but disputed the amount of permanent disability benefits that were payable and sought a credit for any amount that it had overpaid.
on april,while vera was being treated for his injuries,but before he reached the status of permanent and stationary,the legislature passed a comprehensive reform of the workers compensation laws.stats,ch.among other things,the legislature required a change in the schedule by which permanent disability is rated under the amended law,by january,the administrative director of the division of workers compensation was to revise the schedule for rating permanent disabilities,using,among other things,the descriptions and measurements of physical impairments and the corresponding percentages of impairments published in the american medical association ama guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment edition the ama guides,subds.b,e.the schedule was revised and became effective on january,the new schedule,tit.
in many cases,the revision to the schedule for rating permanent disabilities impacts the amount that a worker will be compensated for a permanent disability.in this case,the parties stipulated that the old rating schedule is more favorable to vera than the new rating schedule,with the new schedule resulting in a permanent disability rating of percent,and the old schedule resulting in a permanent disability rating of percent 
in its reform of the workers compensation laws,the legislature included a provision describing which injured workers would be covered by the new schedule,subd.d.section,subdivision d states that the new schedule shall apply to all claims,except certain claims that arose before january.
the schedule shall promote consistency,uniformity,and objectivity.the schedule and any amendment thereto or revision thereof shall apply prospectively and shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule,amendment or revision,as the fact may be.for compensable claims arising before january,the schedule as revised shall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities when there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker,subd.d,italics added.
in an apparent attempt to have vera permanent disability rated under the more favorable old schedule,just seven days after the legislature enacted the revisions to the workers compensation laws vera treating physician issued a supplemental primary treating physician report,dated april,indicating that vera had a permanent disability the april report.the april report stated 
vera condition is not permanent and stationary at this time,and pursuant to labor code section,subdivision d it is my opinion that vera does currently have the existence of permanent disability.based on this patient condition and the treatment that he has undergone,on a preliminary basis it is this examiner opinion that his permanent partial disability would be consistent with lumbar spine no heavy lifting,repetitive bending and stooping.right shoulder no heavy lifting,no repetitive over shoulder work activity and no of heavy weighted objects.at the time that i examine vera for permanent and stationary status,i will subsequently render a primary treating physician permanent and stationary report in the near future.italics added.
the administrative proceedings focused on whether the new schedule or the old schedule governed vera claim for permanent disability.
the workers compensation administrative law judge ruled that the old schedule applied,finding that the injury caused permanent disability of percent.
scif petitioned for reconsideration.a divided wcab panel determined that the new schedule applied.the panel majority ruled that the april report is not substantial evidence as to the existence of permanent disability in light of the report itself,subsequent reports,and subsequent treatment,and,therefore,is insufficient to bring this case under the old schedule.it pointed out that the april report stated that the conclusion was on a preliminary basis and that vera does currently have the existence of permanent disability.italics added.it also noted that in a june report,the treating physician stated that vera remains ttd,temporarily totally disabled,and that vera underwent surgery for his shoulder in august.it stated that a disability can not be both permanent and temporary at the same time,and that a medical opinion that is internally inconsistent is not substantial evidence,and therefore,can not be relied upon to support a decision.the panel majority concluded,h aving permanent disability on a preliminary basis,is not the same as the existence of permanent disability,under section,subdivision d 
one panel member dissented.the dissent conceded that the april report did not constitute substantial evidence of a permanent disability,but stated,i do not believe that section,subdivision d requires substantial evidence,and that it simply requires a report from a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability.the dissent noted that although vera received surgery on his shoulder in august,vera received no treatment for his back after april,except chiropractic care,and that an mri of his back on april,included abnormal findings.the dissent concluded that the report of april,together with the abnormal mri of april,is enough to indicate the existence of permanent disability.
vera filed a petition for reconsideration of the wcab decision.he argued,among other things,that another exception enumerated in section,subdivision d,the exception stating that the new schedule applies when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker.vera argued that his employer was required subsequently to provide the notice required by section,and thus the old schedule applies.
upon entertaining vera petition for reconsideration,the same divided wcab panel confirmed its earlier decision.it stated that vera did not establish that one of the exceptions set forth in the third sentence of section,subdivision d is applicable.the dissenting panel member adopted the reasons set forth in the earlier dissent.
vera filed a petition for writ of review in this court,arguing that the old schedule governs his claim for permanent disability benefits,and that the wcab therefore erred in denying his petition for reconsideration.we issued a writ of review so that we could consider the issues raised by vera petition.
discussion 
as relevant here,section,subdivision d states that the new schedule will apply to claims arising before january,when there has been no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker.vera contends that both of these exceptions apply,and that based on either of them the old schedule should govern his claim.
the resolution of this case requires us to interpret section,subdivision d and apply it to the undisputed facts of this case.we apply a de novo standard of review when interpreting a statute,but we also apply the principle that the wcab statutory construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.green workers comp.appeals bd.th,d green.
generally,in interpreting legislation,we first look to the plain or ordinary meaning of the language used to determine the legislature intent,unless the language is uncertain.every word and clause is given effect so that no part or provision is useless,deprived of meaning,or contradictory.green,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.phelps stostad cal th,d.
january,is the relevant cutoff date for the exceptions set forth in section,subdivision d 
as an initial matter,we address an issue concerning section,subdivision d that is not explicitly discussed by the parties but that is an important threshold issue of statutory interpretation.
here,according to the terms of section,subdivision d,to determine whether the old schedule applies we must look for evidence of either a treating physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability or the fact that vera employer was required to give the notice required by section however,section,subdivision d does not provide a specific date by which these facts must have been in existence to trigger the application of the old schedule.
the parties both assume that january,is the relevant cutoff date.under the parties reading of the statute,the treating physician report or the fact that the employer was required to give the notice required by section must exist before january,for the old schedule to apply.
we concur with this interpretation.although the statute does not expressly set a january,cutoff date for the issuance of the treating physician report or the report or for the existence of the requirement that the employer give the notice required by section,a cutoff date of january,should logically be implied.january,is the date on which the new schedule became effective,tit.the statute is thus reasonably read to mean that the new schedule can be applied to claims as of its effective date of january,unless,as of the effective date of the schedule,one of the three circumstances described in the third sentence of section,subdivision d exist.
another possible reading of the statute is that the old schedule applies in each case in which a report,a treating physician report indicating permanent disability,or a notice under section was issued at any point in the administrative proceedings,even after january.however,if this were the case,almost every permanent disability case would fall under the old schedule because at some point almost every case in which a claimant seeks permanent disability benefits involves either the preparation of a treating physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability,or a report or the giving of a section notice.such an interpretation of the statute would make the exceptions set forth in the third sentence of section,subdivision d so broad that they would cease to function as exceptions,and would render meaningless the legislature statement that the new schedule will apply unless certain exceptions apply.
we thus infer a cutoff date of january,for the existence of the three circumstances described in the third sentence of section,subdivision d.
b.the new schedule applies because the disability was not yet permanent and stationary at the time of the treating physician report 
we next consider the meaning of the statute statement that the new schedule applies when there has been no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,subd.d.vera contends that to trigger this provision there need be in existence only some kind of a report from a treating physician stating that the claimant has a permanent disability,even if the claimant disability has not yet reached permanent and stationary status scif,on the other hand,argues that to trigger this provision,the treating physician report must indicate that the claimant disability has reached permanent and stationary status.
as we will explain,we conclude that the treating physician report must indicate that the claimant has a ratable disability that has reached permanent and stationary status,and that in enacting section,subdivision d,the legislature was using the term permanent disability as another way of referring to the status of having a ratable disability that is permanent and stationary.
to understand the intent of the legislature,it will be useful to review the role that treating physicians reports play in the process of deciding a claim for permanent disability benefits.
according to the applicable administrative regulations,a treating physician must make several reports to the claims administrator throughout the course of treating an injured employee.the treating physician first report must be made within five working days following the initial examination of the employee,tit,subd.e.next,when certain changes occur to either the employee condition or the employee treatment plan during the course of treatment,or when the claims administrator reasonably seeks information,the treating physician must send a report to the claims administrator within days,tit,subd.f.in addition,a treating physician must send a progress report no later days from the last report,and within days of an examination,tit,subd.f.
finally,as relevant here,a treating physician is required to report within days of an examination when an employee condition has become permanent and stationary,including any findings concerning the existence and extent of permanent impairment and limitations,tit,subd.g.the regulations specify that a treating physician may make this report on the preprinted primary treating physician permanent and stationary report form available in the regulations,tit,subd.g,referring to the form available at,tit.thus,not until the treating physician has made a determination that the employee status is permanent and stationary does the treating physician normally issue a report evaluating the extent of the employee impairment as relevant to the employee permanent disability rating.
the crucial fact for our analysis is that the treating physician report will describe the applicable impairment and limitations differently depending on whether the old schedule or the new schedule applies thus,when an employee has reached permanent and stationary status before january,before the effective date of the new schedule the treating physician report will necessarily incorporate the impairment standards applicable under the old schedule.conversely,as in this case,if the employee has not yet reached permanent and stationary status before january,a treating physician report will not have applied the old schedule in describing the employee impairments.
because a treating physician report indicating that an employee status has become permanent and stationary made before the promulgation of the new schedule on january,will necessarily incorporate an evaluation of the employee impairment based on the old schedule,it is reasonable to believe that the legislature intended the old schedule to apply to cases in which a treating physician had prepared a report prior to january,thus,we interpret the statute to mean that the old schedule will apply when,before the effective date of the new schedule,january,there has been a treating physician report indicating the status of the employee ratable disability is permanent and stationary.
we find additional support for this interpretation of the statute in other parts of the applicable administrative regulations because in the regulations the term permanent disability is defined id
