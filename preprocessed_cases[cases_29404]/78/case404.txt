introduction 
labor code section,subdivision d section d was enacted in as senate bill stats,reg,ch,sb,and provided that,unless approved by an injured employee employer,benefits for chiropractic treatments and physical therapy sessions were limited to no more than visits per industrial injury,if the injury occurred after january.the statute was amended the following year as part of senate bill stats,reg,ch,sb,a comprehensive reform of this state workers compensation system.as pertinent to section d,sb left in place the cap on chiropractic and physical therapy visits,but added a limit of occupational therapy visits per industrial injury as well.
petitioner jose petitioner received chiropractic treatments following an industrial injury he sustained while working for respondent nurserymen exchange nurserymen,whose insurer was respondent argonaut insurance company.he filed a writ of review with this court after a workers compensation appeals board wcab decision determined that he was entitled to benefits covering only chiropractic treatments,as specified by section d.
petitioner contends that section d violates the california constitution mandate to the state legislature,that it implement a complete system of workers compensation,including full provision for such medical,surgical,hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve from the effects of such injury.cal,art.xiv,section.similarly,he contends that vesting sole authority in employers to approve benefits for more than treatments without affording workers a right of judicial review of that decision is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power that denies him due process.
lastly,he also argues that the limitation on the number of chiropractic treatments in section d violates his right to equal protection under the law,as compared to the class of injured workers who undergo modalities of treatment not statutorily limited,or to the class of workers injured prior to january,the effective date of the statute,who were not limited to chiropractic treatments.
we reject all of these constitutional challenges to section d,and affirm the decision of the wcab.
ii.factual and procedural background 
on december,petitioner filed a request for a determination that he was entitled to medical treatment under section,and requested an expedited hearing pursuant to section,subdivision b.he claimed nurserymen had refused to authorize more than chiropractor visits to treat his industrial injury,including those treatments occurring before nurserymen accepted his initial claim for benefits.
a hearing was held before a wcab judge wcj on february,and an initial decision was issued on march.that decision was rescinded by the wcj upon petitioner application,and a further hearing was held on july.a new decision was filed on july,and petitioner filed a motion to reconsider that decision on several grounds,including that petitioner treating chiropractor was entitled to manage his further treatment and remain as petitioner treating health care provider,and the chiropractic visit limitation in section d was unconstitutional under both the california and federal constitutions.
the wcj determined that petitioner first ground for reconsideration had merit.therefore,a new decision was issued on september,in which the wcj rescinded her july decision,and made new findings and conclusions.these new findings included that petitioner was entitled to no more than chiropractic treatments per industrial injury under section d,and this section was applicable because petitioner injury occurred after january,because petitioner treating chiropractor,pevec,was a member of nurserymen medical provider network,pevec could serve as petitioner duly selected treating health care provider and therefore,petitioner was entitled to additional visits with pevec for the purpose of enabling pevec to manage his care and render opinions on all medical issues necessary to determine his eligibility for compensation.as to petitioner constitutional challenges,the wcj concluded that she lacked the legal authority to decide them.
petitioner sought reconsideration with the wcab.the wcab granted reconsideration and adopted the september decision of the wcj as its own.once again,it reaffirmed that it lacked the authority to decide appellant constitutional challenged to section d.the wcab decision was filed on october.
petitioner filed a petition for writ of review with this court on november,which was answered by nurserymen on december.this court granted the writ on january.
iii.legal discussion 
petitioner constitutional challenge under section 
section d was enacted in as sb.the statute was amended the following year as part of sb,a comprehensive reform of this state workers compensation system.rio linda union school dist.workers com.appeals bd.th,d rio linda.section d reads as follows 
d notwithstanding the medical treatment utilization schedule or the guidelines set forth in the american college of occupational and environmental medicine occupational medicine practice guidelines,for injuries occurring on and after january,an employee shall be entitled to no more than chiropractic,occupational therapy,and physical therapy visits per industrial injury.
paragraph shall not apply when an employer authorizes,in writing,additional visits to a health care practitioner for physical medicine services.
paragraph shall not apply to visits for postsurgical physical medicine and postsurgical rehabilitation services provided in compliance with a postsurgical treatment utilization schedule established by the administrative director pursuant to section.
because nurserymen would not approve more than chiropractic treatments for petitioner,he contends that section,both facially and as applied to him,violates section.in deciding this issue we are guided by general principles applicable to statutory construction,including that a ll presumptions and intendments favor the validity of a statute statutes must be upheld unless their unconstitutionality clearly,positively,and unmistakably appears.citation.voters for responsible retirement board of supervisors cal th,d.at the same time,we also must enforce the provisions of our constitution and may not lightly disregard or blink at a clear constitutional mandate.citation.citations.professional engineers department of transportation cal th,d.
the first,and for our purposes the most important,paragraph of section states in relevant part as follows 
the legislature is hereby expressly vested with plenary power,unlimited by any provision of this constitution,to create,and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,by appropriate legislation,and in that behalf to create and enforce a liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability,and their dependents for death incurred or sustained by the said workers in the course of their employment,irrespective of the fault of any party.a complete system of workers compensation includes adequate provisions for the comfort,health and safety and general welfare of any and all workers and those dependent upon them for support to the extent of relieving them from the consequences of any injury or death incurred or sustained by workers in the course of their employment,irrespective of the fault of any party also full provision for securing safety in places of employment full provision for such medical,surgical,hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve from the effects of such injury full provision for adequate insurance coverage against liability to pay or furnish compensation full provision for regulating such insurance coverage in all its aspects,including the establishment and management of a state compensation insurance fund full provision for otherwise securing the payment of compensation and full provision for vesting power,authority and jurisdiction in an administrative body with all the requisite governmental functions to determine any dispute or matter arising under such legislation,to the end that the administration of such legislation shall accomplish substantial justice in all cases expeditiously,inexpensively,and without encumbrance of any character all of which matters are expressly declared to be the social public policy of this state,binding upon all departments of the state government.
petitioner asserts that section proviso vesting plenary power in the legislature to create and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,including providing full provision for such medical,surgical,hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve from the effects of such injury,is nothing short of a constitutional mandate that the types and numbers of healing treatments available to injured workers can not be limited by the legislature.in his view,the state constitution prohibits restrictions such as those contained in section d,which limit benefits to a specific number of chiropractic treatments.while presenting his arguments with great force,petitioner cites little legal authority bearing on the precise constitutional challenges he mounts,admitting this case presents an issue of first impression,with questions yet to be answered by any court regarding the implementation of section d.
our first task is to determine what is intended by the broad language in section,and whether the proper interpretation of that provision supports petitioner argument.the principles of constitutional interpretation are similar to those governing statutory construction.in interpreting a constitution provision,our paramount task is to ascertain the intent of those who enacted it.citation.to determine that intent,we look first to the language of the constitutional text,giving the words their ordinary meaning.citation.if the language is clear,there is no need for construction.citation.if the language is ambiguous,however,we consider extrinsic evidence of the enacting body intent.citations.thompson department of corrections cal th,d,cited with approval in professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d.
petitioner argues that the language of section is unambiguous.complete and full need no further elucidation,he claims.he contends that the legislature was commanded to create and enact a workers compensation system virtually of unlimited breadth with the unwavering goal of furnishing full provision for such medical,surgical,hospital and other remedial treatment as is requisite to cure and relieve from the effects of such industrial injury.but,if that were so,why does section vest the legislature with plenary power,unlimited by any provision of this constitution to create such a system given this seemingly internal inconsistency,was it really the voters intent to command the legislature to act in the way petitioner perceives,including removing from lawmakers the power to enact laws which limit the scope of benefits available to workers injured by industrial accidents 
troubled by this facial inconsistency,we conclude that the wording of the provision at most creates an ambiguity,and that it is appropriate and necessary to consider the origin and background of this constitutional language to determine whether,in light of the purpose and objective of the constitutional provision,it is reasonable to interpret it in the manner proposed independent energy producers mcpherson cal th,d.constitutional language can not be given an unreasonably expansive construction unrelated to the purpose and intended scope of the constitutional provision in which that language appears.ibid.with this in mind,we turn to cases which have discussed the purpose and scope of section.
principal among these cases is mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,mathews.in mathews,the widow of an injured worker petitioned the supreme court after the wcab denied her survivor benefits following her husband death from injuries he received in a fight with a coworker.the supreme court noted that the case involved the deceptively simple issue of whether section,subdivision g section g,which bars an initial physical aggressor from benefits,is consonant with section,article xx of the california constitution.mathews,supra,cal d at,and fn.article xx,section section was the predecessor to section,until its repeal in,when section was enacted.cal,art.xiv,historical notes.
the first paragraph of section was virtually identical to section,and expressly vested in the legislature plenary power,unlimited by any provision of this constitution,to create and enforce a complete system of workmen sic compensation,which provides full provision of benefits to an injured worker irrespective of the fault of any party.mathews,supra,cal d at,fn,italics omitted.like petitioner here,the claimant in mathews argued that section g,which excepted from benefits any injury arising from an altercation in which the injured employee was the initial physical aggressor,was unconstitutional in that it conflicted with section 
the supreme court held that the state constitution did not prohibit the legislature from conditioning the right of compensation,as expressed in section g.mathews,supra,cal d at.noting that while the claimant argument that the exception in section g was in conflict with section had a surface plausibility,an examination of the legislative history behind the workmen compensation laws and section demonstrates that the contention rests upon a basic misconstruction of the constitution.mathews,supra,at.
the high court explained that during the first two decades of the century,california joined many other states by enacting a workers compensation system that operated largely without regard for the common law system of fault.because the enactment of a system of workers compensation was such a radical change from the common law relating to recompense for occupational injuries,the legislature sponsored an amendment to the state constitution in the form of section,to remove all doubts as to the constitutionality of then existing workmen compensation laws.mathews,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court in mathews clarified that,rather than imposing a mandate on the legislature to create and enforce an unlimited system of workers compensation benefits,section was intended to safeguard the full,unfettered authority of the legislature to legislate in this area,as it saw fit.thus,the intent of this section was,and is,quite the opposite of what had been ascribed by the claimant in mathews,and by petitioner in this case.that intent was not to impose a lawmaking mandate upon the legislature,but to endow that body expressly with exclusive and plenary authority to determine the contours and content of our state workers compensation system,including the power to limit benefits.the court noted further that if section prohibited the legislature from limiting entitlement to compensation,it would cast doubt on a host of other statutes comprising other parts of the workers compensation scheme.in light of the provision history,w e do not find that section requires any such wholesale butchery of the existing workmen compensation law.mathews,supra,cal d at,see also graczyk workers comp.appeals bd.d.
more recently,an injured employee argued the unconstitutionality of another section of the labor code in stores,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.in that case,the employee allegedly suffered an emotional injury incident to a physical injury she sustained while on the job.section,subdivision d limited benefits for psychiatric injuries to those employees who had been working for the potentially liable employer for more than six months.since the employee had worked for for less than six months,her claim for benefits had been denied,supra,at,d.as a result,one of several arguments made on appeal was that section was unconstitutional insofar as it restricted a worker right to benefits.in response,the court stated 
finally,at oral argument applicant suggested that section was unconstitutional insofar as it purports to abridge a worker right to benefits.but the california constitution does not make such a right absolute.section gives the legislature plenary power to establish a system of workers compensation for any or all workers in enacting the statute,the legislature has merely elected to ex
