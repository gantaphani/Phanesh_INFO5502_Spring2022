this appeal presents a dispute over an attorneys fees agreement between a law firm,representing an injured worker in a suit against a tortfeasor,and a workers compensation carrier,who claims subrogation rights for medical payments made to the worker.the district court granted summary judgment for the carrier,holding that the agreement was unenforceable.
the dispute arises from a medical malpractice case in which gray law represented the injured worker.that case settled for,of which the worker kept only approximately,after the lawyers and workers compensation carrier took their shares.having recovered more than in attorneys fees from its client,gray law then filed this action against the workers compensation carrier,transcontinental,seeking a share of the carrier subrogation recovery.gray law contends it entered an agreement with transcontinental that entitles it to attorneys fees transcontinental,arguing there was no meeting of the minds,denies any agreement.it insists that it is entitled to keep the disputed money.we decide that there was an agreement,but the controlling texas statute prevents it from being enforced.for reasons we will explain,the opportunity to enforce that agreement,including on behalf of the injured worker,was squandered.accordingly,we affirm the district court judgment for transcontinental,albeit on different grounds.
we begin with the underlying facts.
in,daniel huckabee sustained a neck injury at work that required surgery.complications from that surgery resulted in permanent brain damage.transcontinental paid workers compensation benefits to huckabee to cover his medical expenses.meanwhile,huckabee retained gray law to file a medical malpractice action against the medical providers who performed the surgery.the case eventually settled at mediation for,and by statute,transcontinental had a right to be reimbursed for the benefits it paid to huckabee 
the present dispute has its origins in correspondence exchanged early in the litigation between jay gray,of gray law,and jeffrey lust,transcontinental attorney.on february,gray wrote to lust 
it is my understanding that it is cna wish to have our firm represent their interest in this matter.to that end,we will receive a fee of of the insurance carrier recovery and a proportionate share of expenses.please acknowledge cna agreement,by signing in the space provided below and returning it to me 
upon receipt of the letter,lust discussed the proposed attorneys fees with william pratt,gray.lust then signed the february letter as requested and returned it on march.lust,however,also wrote in a cover letter 
attached is the letter that you sent regarding our agreement on fees and expenses in the above referenced matter.per our discussion of march,it is understood that my client agreement to reduce its lien by represents the fee mentioned in the attached letter.further,we agreed that my client share of proportionate expenses will be calculated based on what percentage that my client actual recovery bears to the total settlement amount or verdict.if the total settlement or verdict is million and cna recovers million,then cna will pay of the expenses.in that regard,please provide a detailed account of what the expenses are to date.
gray law interprets the correspondence as an agreement entitling it to one third of transcontinental subrogation recovery.transcontinental denies that the correspondence formed an agreement of any sort.
transcontinental argues alternatively that any agreement as to attorneys fees is unenforceable under the applicable texas statute because lust actively represented transcontinental interests in the case.transcontinental points out that lust filed a petition to intervene and claims that thereafter lust actively participated in the case on transcontinental behalf.according to gray law,however,lust attended only two or three of the more than forty depositions taken.gray was the lead attorney at trial.lust retained no experts for trial,made no statements on the record,did not question any witnesses,and did nothing to establish liability for recovery.he attended a few days of the trial,but he neither entered an appearance nor sat at counsel table.lust did,however,forward a check in the amount of to gray law to defray its trial expenses.the trial lasted nearly three weeks and ended in a hung jury.in mediation,which lust did attend and participate,the case settled for.gray law contingency fee with huckabee provided that gray law would receive forty percent of the gross recovery,plus expenses of the,gray law received a total,including expenses,of.was then paid to an annuity to provide payments to huckabee and his wife linda,who also received a cash payment.transcontinental,although its lien was worth approximately settled for and agreed to waive its statutory right to suspend future workers compensation benefits on the basis of huckabee recovery.huckabee guardian ad litem,who attended mediation,approved the settlement agreement and disbursement.
the state court approved the settlement agreement and disbursement and dismissed the case on april.the settlement agreement did not provide for any apportionment of the settlement proceeds between gray law and transcontinental.neither gray law nor transcontinental brought their prior correspondence to the court attention.nor did gray law disclose its correspondence with transcontinental to his client,huckabee.
three months later gray law sent a letter to transcontinental demanding a share of transcontinental recovery 
demand is hereby made upon insurance company to pay the previously agreed upon attorney fees and pro rata expenses for the recovery of the subrogation amount in the cause.
the total sum due and owing by insurance company share of the expenses is which constitutes for attorney fees of and for expenses of the total expenses of.
upon transcontinental refusal to pay,gray law filed this action in state court,alleging breach of contract.transcontinental removed the case to federal district court,and the district court granted summary judgment for transcontinental.the district court pretermitted whether an agreement had been formed.instead,the district court decided that lust had actively represented transcontinental and that under the controlling texas statute any agreement was of no moment because gray law had already received the maximum amount recoverable in attorneys fees.
although we agree with the district court that gray law is not entitled to additional attorneys fees,we arrive at our decision by a different route.see ballard burton,cir w e may affirm this judgment on any other grounds supported by the record.citations omitted.specifically,we decide whether there was an agreement before we decide what effect the controlling texas statute has on it.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.united states corpus,cir.summary judgment is appropriate only if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.in determining whether a genuine issue as to any material fact exists,we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.corpus,at.we may affirm a summary judgment on any ground supported by the record,even if it is different from that relied on by the district court.holtzclaw dsc communications,cir.
we first address the correspondence exchanged between gray law and transcontinental.transcontinental denies that the correspondence formed an agreement because,it argues,the correspondence failed to achieve a meeting of the minds.transcontinental is correct that under texas law a meeting of the minds is essential to any contract.see,sonne fdic,rehearing denied.
transcontinental first points to what it calls an inconsistency in the letters exchanged between jay gray and jeffrey lust.in his letter of february,gray sought to verify that,in exchange for its representation,gray law will receive a fee of of the insurance carrier recovery and a proportionate share of the expenses.on march,lust responded per our discussion of march,it is understood that my client agreement to reduce its lien by represents the fee mentioned in the attached letter.transcontinental asserts that because gray letter anticipated a fee,when lust responsive letter reflected an understanding to reduce transcontinental lien,the correspondence failed to achieve a meeting of the minds.
transcontinental next points to language in gray letter stating that,i t is my understanding that it is cna wish to have our firm represent their interest in this matter.although this language suggests that gray law,in response to a request by transcontinental,would represent transcontinental in the litigation,transcontinental contends that gray stated in deposition testimony that he represented huckabee,and not transcontinental.transcontinental argues that this testimony indicates that there was no meeting of the minds concerning representation.
transcontinental arguments are unconvincing.under texas law,to discern whether there was a meeting of the minds,we look in an objective fashion for what the parties actually said and did.choctaw properties,llc aledo isd,no pet.a court reviews in an objective fashion what the parties actually said and did without consideration of subjective intent.although it may be possible for transcontinental to read the letters to argue that they are inconsistent,we think an objective reading resolves any alleged inconsistency.lust letter states that,per prior discussion,the parties understood that the agreement was modified to reflect how transcontinental would satisfy its fee obligation,that is,transcontinental had agreed to reduce its lien by one third.that lust language is not an inconsistency,but instead a modification to which gray law had consented in prior conversation,is underscored by gray law acceptance of the written modification without any objection.these circumstances do not suggest a failure to achieve a meeting of the minds to the contrary they reflect that the parties reached a negotiated understanding and proceeded accordingly.
we thus conclude,based on what the parties said and did,that the correspondence achieved both a meeting of the minds and sufficient certainty to define its terms.nevertheless,although we agree with gray law that the correspondence formed an agreement,we disagree that it entitles gray law to one third of transcontinental subrogation recovery.gray law assumes,without arguing,that the agreement entitles it to fees.indeed,gray law has not been required to defend its interpretation because transcontinental has argued only that the agreement either does not exist or is unenforceable,not that gray law interpretation of its terms is incorrect.under texas law,however,if we conclude the agreement language can be given a certain meaning,then we must interpret it as a matter of law.see dewitt,parks,when a court concludes that contract language can be given a certain or definite meaning,then the language is not ambiguous,and the court is obligated to interpret the contract as a matter of law.we have already stated that the agreement is sufficiently certain,and we now conclude the agreement does not entitle gray law to additional fees from transcontinental,but instead plainly provides that transcontinental would satisfy its obligation to gray law by reducing its lien by one third 
having decided that there was an agreement that gray law would represent transcontinental and,in turn,that transcontinental would reduce its lien by one third,we next decide whether the agreement is enforceable under texas law.we refer to the texas workers compensation act for this determination.gray law argues that under the act the agreement is enforceable transcontinental argues that under the act it is not.
we begin our discussion by examining of the texas workers compensation act 
section generally provides for a worker attorney to collect fees from the workers compensation carrier as compensation for pursuing a action.gray law correctly points out that the purpose of is to pay a worker attorney for the benefit accruing to the carrier as a result of the attorney efforts.workers comp.ins.fund alcorta,antonio,no pet.the statute prevents a carrier from getting a free ride from the worker attorney efforts caesar bohacek,dist,no pet.
texas courts have interpreted to permit the recovery of attorneys fees in three distinct situations 
a where the insurer has an attorney but he does not actively represent it b where the worker attorney represents both the worker and the insurer and c where the insurer has an attorney who actively represents it and participates in obtaining recovery.
erivas state farm,paso,no pet.
thus,for each of the three situations,a separate condition applies.
gray law argues that a applies here because lust did not actively represent transcontinental.section a contemplates that the worker attorney and the insurer may form an agreement as to attorneys fees on the subrogation claim.gray law points to its agreement with transcontinental,and argues that transcontinental entered it with a in mind.
transcontinental argues that c,and not a,applies because,as the district court held,lust actively represented its interests and participated in obtaining recovery.under c,a court may still award attorneys fees,but must apportion them between the insurer attorney and the worker attorney,based upon the contribution of each.
alternatively,and not without some contradiction,transcontinental argues that,because gray law represented both huckabee and transcontinental,b applies.under b,an attorney who represents both the worker and the carrier must make full written disclosure of the representation of the carrier to the worker and obtain the worker consent.transcontinental argues that because gray law did not make full written disclosure to huckabee,under b it may not collect attorneys fees from transcontinental.
the district court agreed with transcontinental that lust had actively represented transcontinental interests and thus determined that c controlled the case.the district court then held that c does not contemplate that parties will form an agreement and,consequently,whether gray law and transcontinental had an agreement was of no moment.the district court also refused to apportion attorneys fees because it held that c does not envision that a worker attorney will collect fees from both the worker and the carrier on the same recovery.the district court further held that gray law had already recovered the maximum amount.
for the reasons stated below,we agree that gray law is not entitled to attorneys fees from transcontinental.we conclude,however,that b,and not c,controls this case.accordingly,we need not decide whether lust participation in the litigation constituted active representation within the meaning of c.
as stated,we conclude that b controls this case.transcontinental argues that because gray law did not make full written disclosure of its representation of transcontinental to huckabee,gray law did not comply with b,and it may not now collect attorneys fees from transcontinental we agree with transcontinental.
we note at the outset that the exact delineation between a and b is not altogether clear.texas courts have stated that a permits recovery where the insurer has an attorney but he does not actively represent it,while b permits recovery where the worker attorney represents both the worker and the insurer.erivas state farm,paso,no pet.as a practical matter,the worker attorney is at least assisting the carrier interests under either situation.of course what is clearly different is that b requires full written disclosure,but a does not.
transcontinental cites no case law in support of its argument that b should apply here,and indeed we have found no case law interpreting b.the text of b itself,however,is determinative in this case 
an attorney who represents the claimant and is also to represent the subrogated insurance carrier shall make a full written disclosure to the claimant before employment as an attorney by the insurance carrier the claimant attorney may not receive a fee under
