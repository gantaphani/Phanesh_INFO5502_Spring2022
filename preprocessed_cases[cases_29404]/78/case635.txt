background 
the record reveals that haulk was employed as a laborer for twice over clean in peoria,illinois.he was assigned to an asbestos removal job in minneapolis,minnesota,in december.on january,while performing heavy labor,he suffered chest pains.after he finished work,he went to his hotel and did not feel like eating.he again experienced chest pains and broke out in a cold sweat.he was taken by ambulance to hennepin county medical center the hospital,where he was admitted and diagnosed with an acute inferior myocardial infarction.upon his release,he returned to peoria,where he received additional care from his internist and a cardiologist.
haulk filed an application for adjustment of claim pursuant to the workers compensation act ilcs et west with the industrial commission commission seeking compensation for his heart attack.the claim was heard before an arbitrator.the principal disputed issue was whether the injury arose out of and in the course of haulk employment ilcs b west.
at the hearing,haulk testified that his work assignment on january,was to assist in the removal of to bags of asbestos,each weighing to pounds,located on the top floor of an unheated four to building in downtown minneapolis.the temperature in the building was approximately five degrees fahrenheit.haulk carried the bags down the stairs and outside to a dumpster located approximately feet from the building,where he had to pile the asbestos bags high in the dumpster.while performing this task,haulk was required to wear a large,facial respirator and protective clothing.at about,while performing this work,he noticed pains in his chest,neck,and left shoulder.the pains subsided when he sat down and rested for to minutes,but returned when he resumed working.he left work around.the pains never stopped entirely,although they were more severe at times.ultimately,he began having cold sweats and nausea,an ambulance was called,and he was taken to the hospital.haulk denied experiencing chest pain prior to january.
the hospital records for haulk treatment were admitted in evidence.an unsigned resident history and physical form,dated january,noted that haulk was evaluated for chest pain beginning while he was lifting items around that evening and returning while he was in bed around.an admission data profile,also dated january,signed by the person preparing it,recited that haulk described getting chest pain yesterday afternoon while loading a truck,but that it went away.a signed inpatient consultation stated that haulk presented with an onset of acute chest pain while lifting weight.narrative notes dated january,signed by a treating physician,referred to haulk as a patient with angina x wks.who experienced severe pain starting at about today.a critical care flow sheet dated january,signed by a nurse,recorded that haulk had chest pain with exertion in the morning that subsided on its own.haulk was diagnosed with and treated for acute inferior myocardial infarction.coronary angiography revealed a obstruction in a portion of the right coronary artery.these records were sent to haulk internist in peoria,brian cohen.
upon his return to peoria,haulk consulted cohen,who in turn referred him to a cardiologist,frank gold.those doctors provided care for haulk beginning january,and continuing until he was released to return to work on june.
haulk had recurring chest pain in february,and was admitted by cohen to methodist medical center in peoria,where he was seen in consultation by mark shima.the consultation record was admitted in evidence.shima impression was atypical resting chest discomfort which radiates to the back and the back of neck.despite this,this is the same discomfort the patient feels that he had in the period of the day or so prior to an inferior infarct occurring in january of for which he underwent angioplasty at hennepin county hospital in minnesota.shima found no evidence of a myocardial infarction on the occasion of this february consultation.
two written reports from gold were admitted at the hearing.the first,dated january,was a letter to cohen,confirming that haulk clearly sustained a myocardial infarction and was not capable of returning to his duties as a laborer.gold stated that,apart from smoking,haulk had limited risk factors for coronary artery disease.he reported haulk advised him that he underwent acute salvage angioplasty in minneapolis,and that the doctors told him there was a residual stenosis.in the second report,dated april,gold opined that haulk was then totally disabled as a result of a myocardial infarction sustained while working in minneapolis,minnesota.
the report of cohen,dated december,was admitted at the hearing.in the report,cohen wrote the myocardial infarction that howard haulk,suffered at on january,in my medical opinion,was precipitated by the heavy lifting that he did all day long at work.he was actually experiencing the chest pain while doing the lifting,and probably was developing his heart attack at that time.
the evidence deposition of cohen,taken on march,was admitted at the hearing.cohen testified that he was board certified in internal medicine.prior to january,he had seen haulk on only two occasions in,when he performed a physical examination and some studies.the examination revealed no problems.he and gold both followed haulk progress after january.cohen was primarily concerned with risk factors for coronary disease.he prescribed medication for elevated cholesterol and provided care through february.
cohen was asked to assume hypothetically that haulk performed the work duties haulk described in his testimony under those same conditions.he then was asked whether he had an opinion based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty as to whether the myocardial infarction that haulk suffered as indicated in the records from the hospital in minneapolis might or could have been caused by the physical activity engaged in on january.cohen responded affirmatively and stated that activity very likely could have led him to have a heart attack.he further opined,based on a review of enzyme studies taken on january and,that haulk heart attack could have occurred around 
on,cohen conceded the arteriogram taken at the time of his initial workup in minneapolis,showing a occlusion of the right coronary artery,was very significant and that any activity or no activity by a person having that degree of occlusion could put sufficient stress on the heart to result in a myocardial infarction.he testified that anybody can experience a myocardial infarction at rest,really.he also agreed with the statement that a person with that degree of occlusion is basically a heart attack waiting to happen.on redirect,cohen stated that physical activity contributes to the risk of myocardial infarction in persons having haulk degree of occlusion,and the kind of lifting haulk was doing in the afternoon is tremendous stress and causes a very high work load on the heart and the heart muscle.
twice over clean presented the evidence deposition of gary wilner of evanston,illinois,taken november.wilner,who is board certified in both internal medicine and cardiovascular diseases,was engaged by twice over clean to evaluate haulk medical records.he did not physically evaluate haulk.in his op
