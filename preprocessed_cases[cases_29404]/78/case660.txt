factual and procedural history 
this review arises from the decision of the first district court of appeal in flamily,in which the court reviewed a workers compensation case.during the proceedings,a judge of compensation claims jcc vacated a compensation settlement agreement.flamily was an employee of the city of orlando the city and permanently retired from that employment on january,due to a heart condition.flamily submitted a workers compensation claim for the heart condition and was represented by herbert hill.in approximately february,hill made two requests to the city to produce documents.in response,hill received a medical summary,which stated that the blood test results for the years through,during flamily employment,were within a normal range.the city accepted flamily as permanently totally disabled on september.
on december,hill office received a fax from cardiologist kakkar,which stated that flamily had attained maximum medical improvement on july.before receipt of this fax,both flamily and his attorney,hill,had signed all of the paperwork to effectuate the settlement of the workers compensation claim based on the heart condition.the settlement paperwork was then submitted to the city attorney,james condry,on december.on december,a jcc approved the settlement,which allegedly contained different terms than the settlement paperwork that hill and flamily had previously signed.for example,the settlement paperwork had previously contained a per visit limit for future medical expenses,but at the time the settlement was approved,the terms provided a per lifetime limitation.the settlement approved by the jcc also contained language that flamily waived any future workers compensation claims that were either known or unknown at the time of the settlement.
during flamily career with the city,he had physical examinations performed by the city,one each year and a preemployment physical,during which blood tests were performed.none of these examinations disclosed any significant health problems.a blood test first disclosed elevated levels of liver enzymes.in approximately,the city began requiring firefighters to use gloves and masks while performing their duties.blood tests performed in later years,and,also reflected abnormal liver functions.although flamily signed a memo in which he indicated that he had received the results of the blood test,he asserted that he was never advised of any abnormal results thus,he did not seek a evaluation or treatment based upon any of the results.
flamily claimed that during his career he had multiple incidents of patients vomiting in his mouth,having his body covered in blood,and receiving accidental wounds.despite the city policy that an employee was required to immediately file a report after a potential exposure,flamily never filed a report with regard to these alleged incidents.moreover,flamily could not specifically recall a wound which involved a patient that he knew suffered from hepatitis c,which is caused by the hepatitis c virus hcv.flamily was tested for hiv on february,after coming into contact with fecal matter from an aids patient,with the test producing a negative result.the city only began administering tests to firefighters for hcv in.in april,siraj islam ordered a liver biopsy for flamily after a referral from sunil kakkar due to elevated liver enzymes.the liver biopsy suggested liver cirrhosis at a serious level.in november,flamily was diagnosed with hcv.on january,flamily notified the city of his hcv condition and then submitted a workers compensation claim for his hcv condition.
after a final hearing before a jcc on march and,flamily petition for benefits for his hcv condition was denied.during these proceedings,the city asserted that flamily engaged in multiple activities prior to his employment with the city that could have exposed him to hcv.in a psychological report,flamily stated that he had used cocaine,opium,marijuana,and lsd while in vietnam,but he later denied ever using illegal drugs.the jcc found that flamily hcv condition was not presumptively suffered in the line of duty under section of the florida statutes and also that his hcv was not an occupational disease.see flamily,so d at.the jcc vacated the settlement agreement based on flamily heart condition because it contained material misinformation upon which flamily had relied when he agreed to the settlement.see id.
on appeal,the first district held,in part,that the jcc lacked subject matter jurisdiction to vacate the settlement agreement.see id.the first district reasoned that marchenko sunshine companies,so d dca,established that a jcc no longer has jurisdiction to vacate settlement agreements pursuant to the statutory changes made in to section c.flamily,so d at the first district further reasoned that this statutory change was a procedural change,which permitted retroactive application to flamily settlement agreement.see id.this review followed.
ii.analysis 
introduction 
the city asserts that the amendment that added subsection c to section divested the jccs of the authority to vacate or set aside settlement agreements entered into by claimants who are represented by counsel.as a preliminary matter,the issue under review is a pure question of law that is subject to de novo review.see borden ins,so d,holding that the issue under review was a question of statutory interpretation and thus was subject to de novo review emphasis supplied.
historical background 
to address this issue,we must first look to the historical context of the relationship between jccs and article v courts with regard to workers compensation matters.all article v courts that have been presented with the issue of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving workers compensation matters have uniformly held in very broad,general,and generic terms that article v courts have no subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving workers compensation issues.all article v courts have placed exclusive subject matter jurisdiction for such disputes within the workers compensation proceedings.these cases present a vast variety of disputed matters touching upon issues within the workers compensation context and uniformly reject subject matter jurisdiction of worker compensation disputes.see,steadman,so d at a circuit court has no jurisdiction over an action against a compensation carrier for injuries covered by the workers compensation act.citing moriarty,so d protegrity,brehm,so d,dca substantially the same moriarty,so d at substantially the same citing old republic ins.whitworth,so d dca covert,so d at substantially the same whitworth,so d at substantially the same.instead,the uniform approach has historically been that jccs have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction over disputed workers compensation claim matters.
additionally,prior to the statutory amendment,courts including this court have consistently interpreted the workers compensation act to empower the jccs to vacate or set aside settlement agreements.see,steele.contractors,so d,discussing the power of a jcc,formerly known as a deputy commissioner,to set aside settlement agreements for various reasons quintana precast,so d,dca substantially the same.in fact,multiple decisions have even concluded that the failure of a jcc to set aside a settlement agreement under certain circumstances constitutes error.see,gilliland wood n you,so d,dca reversing the decision of the jcc to deny setting aside an earlier order that approved a settlement agreement east pensacola tractor equip,so d,dca reversing the decision of the jcc to deny setting aside a settlement agreement.these judicial interpretations are consistent with the express terms of chapter,florida statute
