the main issue presented by this appeal is whether claimant was an employee entitled to receive disability benefits within the meaning of section of the workers compensation act the act ilcs west,so that he was required to submit to an medical examination to avoid suspension of benefits.we answer in the affirmative.
background 
claimant,scott hunter,filed an application for adjustment of claim to recover benefits for a back injury he allegedly sustained while working for masonry masonry on august.masonry disputed the claim and requested that claimant be examined by avi bernstein pursuant to section of the act.on december,claimant was examined by bernstein,and the cause proceeded to a hearing before an arbitrator on march.the arbitrator awarded claimant temporary total disability ttd benefits from august,through march,finding bernstein report unpersuasive.
thereafter,masonry filed for review of the arbitrator decision to the industrial commission commission.while review was pending before the commission,masonry insurance carrier sent a letter to claimant attorney on may,requesting that claimant be examined by bernstein on may.the claimant did not attend the appointment.claimant testified that his attorney never told him of the scheduled appointment so he was unaware of it.but claimant attorney testified that he instructed claimant not to attend the examination.
on may,masonry insurance carrier sent another letter to claimant attorney offering to reschedule an appointment with bernstein.claimant attorney responded with a letter on june,informing the insurer that his client would not attend any examination until masonry complied with the arbitrator decision.
on june,the commission modified the arbitrator calculation of claimant average weekly wage,but otherwise affirmed the arbitrator decision.masonry filed for judicial review of the commission decision in the circuit court of cook county.the circuit court recalculated claimant average weekly wage,but confirmed the remainder of the commission decision.masonry appealed,and on december,the appellate court affirmed the circuit court decision.
in january,masonry paid claimant,which covered the ttd award through march,plus interest.masonry also paid claimant an additional for ttd benefits for the period running from march,through may.masonry,however,did not pay any benefits for the period after may,the date of the scheduled medical examination that claimant refused to attend.
claimant then filed another petition before the arbitrator,this time requesting ttd benefits for the period after may.the arbitrator found,however,that claimant was not entitled to benefits after may,because he refused to attend the scheduled medical examination pursuant to section of the act,which requires a n employee entitled to receive disability payments to submit himself or herself to a medical examination if requested by the employer.see ilcs west.accordingly,the arbitrator entered an order awarding claimant ttd for the period from march,through may.
the commission,with one commissioner dissenting,ruled that because masonry was not making ttd payments to claimant at the time of the medical examination scheduled for may,claimant was not an employee entitled to receive benefits within the meaning of section,and claimant was therefore not required to attend the examination.consequently,claimant right to receive benefits was not subject to suspension under section.the commission further found,however,that because claimant need for further treatment and his work status were unknown,masonry demand for the second medical examination was for a proper purpose and not for harassment.finally,the commission denied claimant request for penalties,finding that masonry conduct was objectively reasonable.the circuit court confirmed the decision of the commission.
the appellate court,with one member of the panel dissenting,reversed the circuit court confirmation of the commission ruling that claimant was not required to submit to a medical examination.d.the appellate court found that the commission had misconstrued section of the act,noting as follows 
according to the commission,at the time that masonry requested the examination,it had not agreed to pay benefits to the claimant,was appealing the arbitrator finding as to liability and was withholding the payment of ttd benefits pending the outcome of that appeal and,as a consequence,the claimant did not know whether he was entitled to receive benefits.the commission seems to imply that,before a claimant is required to submit to a section examination,he must know that he is entitled to receive benefits.however,we find no authority for such a conclusion either in the language of section or any reported case.
section of the act requires an employee entitled to receive disability payments to submit,at his employer request,to a physical examination.as our supreme court held in jackson coal industrial comm n,
it is not restricted to cases where the employer acknowledges his liability and makes compensation payments.it applies to all cases where the employee is entitled to receive disability payments,and whether he is entitled to them is not dependent on whether the employer acknowledges liability by making the payments.see also paradise coal industrial comm n.d at.
the appellate court remanded the cause to the commission to reinstate the arbitrator decision limiting claimant ttd benefits to the period ending may.d at.two justices of the panel certified that the case involved a substantial question that warrants consideration by this court.we subsequently allowed claimant petition for leave to appeal a.
claimant initially argues that the commission made a factual finding as to whether he was an employee entitled to receive benefits,and therefore its ruling is subject to the manifest weight of the evidence standard of review.we disagree.the essential facts are undisputed and the matter before us is solely a matter of statutory construction.accordingly,the case presents a question of law that we review de novo.sylvester industrial comm n.
claimant argues that if an employer places an employee entitlement to receive benefits in dispute by challenging liability,then the employer loses the right to rely on the examination requirement and remedy provided by section.claimant maintains that because masonry challenged his right to compensation and was not making any disability payments to him at the time it requested the exam in may,masonry was not within its rights to either request an exam or suspend compensation for failure to comply with the request to attend.
section provides in relevant part as follows 
an employee entitled to receive disability payments shall be required,if requested by the employer,to submit himself,at the expense of the employer,for examination to a duly qualified medical practitioner or surgeon selected by the employer,at any time and place reasonably convenient for the employee,either within or without the state of illinois,for the purpose of determining the nature,extent and probable duration of the injury received by the employee,and for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of compensation which may be due the employee from time to time for disability according to the provisions of this act.
if the employee refuses so to submit himself to examination or unnecessarily obstructs the same,his right to compensation payments shall be temporarily suspended until such examination shall have taken place,and no compensation shall be payable under this act for such period.ilcs west.
the principles to be applied in construing a statute are well settled.our primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature,and to this end all other rules of construction are subordinate.metzger darosa.we determine intent by reading the statute as a whole and considering all relevant parts.sylvester,at.in doing so,we presume that the legislature did not intend absurdity,inconvenience or injustice.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.
it is also a principle of statutory construction that where terms used in a statute have acquired a settled meaning through judicial construction and are retained in subsequent amendments or of the statute,they are to be understood and interpreted in the same sense theretofore attributed to them by the court unless a contrary intention of the legislature is made clear.in re marriage of,quoting people ex rel.nelson wiersema state bank.this is because the judicial construction of a statute becomes a part of the law,and it is presumed that the legislature in passing the law knew of the construction of the words in the prior enactment.in re marriage of,at.a related principle is that where the legislature chooses not to amend terms of a statute after judicial construction,it will be presumed that it has acquiesced in the court statement of legislative intent.in re marriage of,at.
applying the principles to the present case leads inexorably to the conclusion that the legislature did not intend that an employer who denies liability and declines to make payments in a workers compensation case be precluded from availing itself of the independent medical examination provision of section.the same argument that claimant makes here was soundly rejected by this court shortly after the workmen compensation act was first passed in illinois in.in jackson coal industrial comm n,the claimant argued that the statute did not require an employee to submit to a physical examination where the employer is denying that the employee is entitled to receive compensation.this court held that the claimant construction was not warranted,and stated as follows 
the statute requires an employee entitled to receive disability payments to submit,at the request of the employer,to a physical examination.it is not restricted to cases where the employer acknowledges his liability and makes compensation payments.it applies to all cases where the employee is entitled to receive disability payments,and whether he is entitled to them is not dependent on whether the employer acknowledges liability by making payments.that the provisions of section must be complied with by the employee to entitle him to the benefits of the act was decided in hafer washed coal industrial com.jackson coal,at.
the holding of jackson coal was followed by this court in subsequent cases.see pocahontas mining industrial comm n,and paradise coal industrial comm n.in paradise coal,the claimant objected to the employer request for a medical examination on the ground that no compensation was being paid and that he was not required to submit himself for examination until after it had been judicially determined that he was entitled to compensation.this court rebuffed that argument,holding that t he employer right to require an injured employee to submit to an examination is not restricted to cases where the employer acknowledges his liability to make compensation payments,and if the employee refuses to submit to such examination at a time and place reasonably convenient his right to compensation payments is suspended until such examination shall have taken place.paradise coal,at.
the critical language of section at issue in this case has remained unchanged since the inception of the act in,despite numerous reenactments.the act was amended in and again in,but neither amendment changed the crucial language providing that a n employee entitled to receive disability payments shall be required,if requested by the employer,to submit himself at the expense of the employer for examination to a duly qualified medical practitioner or surgeon selected by the employer,at a time and place reasonably convenient for the employee,ch,par,historical note,at see also ilcs west.the amendment merely omitted the words as soon as practicable after the injury,and also one week after the first examination and thereafter at intervals not oftener than once every four weeks,which examination shall be after the words at any time and place reasonably convenient for the employee,and preceding the words for the purpose of determining the nature,extent and probable duration of the injury received by the employee,ch,par,historical note,at.the amendment simply added a proviso requiring the employer to pay in advance sufficient money to defray traveling expenses,cost of meals and loss of wages where an employer requires a physical examination,ch,par,historical note,at.because the general assembly has retained the identical language requiring an employee entitled to disability payments to submit himself for examination to avoid suspension of benefits,rather than changing this language in response to the judiciary construction of the statute,we believe that the cases discussed above properly express the legislative intent.
claimant argues that because masonry denied liability from the outset,it should be prevented from asserting that he was an employee entitled to receive benefits for purposes of section.claimant argument,of course,ignores that by filing an adjustment of claim with the arbitrator for his injury,claimant asserted from the outset that he was an employee entitled to compensation payments.
claimant also argues that any right to examination by an employer under section should be limited to a single examination.claimant interpretation of the statute,however,would lead to an absurd result.section provides that the purpose of medically examining an injured employee at the employer request is to determine the nature,extent and probable duration of the injury and to ascertain the amount of compensation that may be due from time to time for disability.ilcs west.if we were to accept claimant interpretation,an employer would not be able to address these issues as they arose from time to time.section,when initially enacted,contained time intervals as to when a further examination could take place.laws.the general assembly subsequently removed the time limits,and thus the need for a medical examination is not now limited to any specific time frame and has never been limited to any specific number.see ilcs west.laws.the need for a medical examination is instead tied to the need to address the nature,extent and duration of the injury and the amount of compensation.ilcs west.furthermore,no illinois court has ever stated that the number of section examinations is limited to any specific amount,though it has been continuously noted that section can not be used to harass or oppress an employee by unnecessary examinations king industrial comm n,jackson coal,at.
our conclusion that the right to request a section examination is not limited to situations where an employer is paying compensation payments is consistent with the requirements of our act as whole.section b of the act provides that t he arbitrator may find that the disabling condition is temporary and may order the payment of compensation up to the date of the hearing,which award shall be reviewable and enforceable in the same manner as other awards,and in no instance be a bar to a further hearing and determination of a further amount of temporary total compensation or of compensation for permanent disability.ilcs b west.thus,it has been held that a second arbitration hearing involves different legal and factual issues than a first arbitration hearing addressing ttd,as the first hearing addresses a claimant right to ttd up to the date of the first hearing.national wrecking industrial comm n,d.each section b proceeding is a separate proceeding,limited to a determination of temporary total disability up to the date of the hearing,and each b decision is a separate and appealable order.stone industrial comm n,d.
while it is true that payment of compensation by an employer to an injured employee does not constitute an admission of the employer liability to pay compensation ilcs b west,it is also true that our act does not require payment of temporary compensation prior to a final determination of liability on review where reasonable grounds exist to challenge that liability avon products,industrial comm n.this is because many claims and awards can be challenged in the legitimate hope that the reviewing tribunal will review the evidence in a way favorable enough to the employer to reduce or rule out his liability.board of educat
