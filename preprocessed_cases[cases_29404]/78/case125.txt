this case is a breach of contract dispute in which facility insurance company fic seeks to recover monies that it,and its predecessors,paid to employers insurance of wausau wausau.wausau argues that fic is not suing on an open account,so the statute of limitations bars fic contract claim.in the alternative,wausau argues that the disputed contract provision unambiguously establishes that wausau complied with the contract.we reject both arguments,and accordingly affirm the district court ruling.
facts and proceedings 
fic is the successor in interest to the texas workers compensation assigned risk pool pool.in,the texas legislature created the pool as an unincorporated association of workers compensation insurers.the pool acted as the insurer of last resort for texas employers who could not obtain workers compensation insurance in the private market.texas law required all workers compensation insurance carriers to participate in the pool in proportion to their individual level of texas business.
the pool contracted with several of its member insurance provide a variety of services for the pool.these servicing companies issued policies,collected premiums,adjusted claims,and improved the insureds workplace safety through accident prevention measures.the accident prevention measures were also referred to as loss control services.
in,the state board of insurance the board amended the pool contract with its servicing companies.specifically,the board amended paragraph x of the pool rules and regulations rule x,entitled administration of the fund.rule x set forth that the servicing companies would receive percent of the premiums as compensation for their services to the pool.the amendment to rule x added a provision stating that of the percent compensation should be designated for loss control services,percent of the total premiums.rule x stated that t he shares of premium to which the servicing company shall be entitled included a loss control services factor equivalent to percent.in the preamble to this amendment preamble,the board stated the following 
the amended rules and regulation incorporates changes made in board order,dated december,a reduction in servicing carrier fees to be effective on and after,april,and a requirement that at least two points of the servicing carrier share of premium be used to provide accident prevention services effective april.
in october,the board again amended rule x to reduce the loss control services factor from percent to percent.
during,representatives from the pool,the board,and wausau expressed in writing that each one understood that the percent loss control services factor meant that servicing companies must devote percent of the premium to loss control activities.between april and november,wausau received a total of in loss control services fees,but only expended on actual accident prevention measures.wausau treated the difference between the loss control services factor that rule x specified,and the amount that wausau actually spent on accident prevention services general revenue.
effective january,the texas legislature terminated the pool and replaced it with a new insurer of last resort,the texas workers compensation insurance facility facility.the facility assumed all of the assets and liabilities of the pool,including its servicing company contracts,and continued operating in the same manner.on december,the facility stopped writing policies,but did continue to service the workers compensation claims that had accrued under the policies it had written prior to that date 
in,the texas legislature authorized the unincorporated association of insurers which constituted the facility to sell the assets and liabilities of the facility to a private insurance company,the facility insurance corporation fic.the former members of the facility became shareholders of fic parent corporation.by statute,fic was to be considered a continuation of the f acility with the right to enforce all contract and statutory rights of the f acility under any servicing company arrangements.texas acts,ch,b.after the sale of the facility,fic acted as the insurer on the existing policies,and wausau continued to service those policies pursuant to the servicing contract that it originally entered into with the pool.
the pool,the facility,and later fic,paid the servicing companies fees by establishing a running account of mutual credits and debits.the transactions were tracked by a bordereau and operated as follows each quarter a servicing company would file a report a bordereau with the pool or its successor listing thousands of premium transactions and claim payments that the servicing company handled during the preceding quarter.these amounts were tallied up on the bordereau to arrive at a net amount that the pool owed to the servicing company as its servicing fee.although the bordereaux never specified the percentage of the fee applicable towards loss control services,the fee did in fact include an amount for loss control services under the terms of rule 
the servicing fees that the pool and its successors paid to the servicing companies were not final.the servicing companies would make adjustments to claims that had already been processed.these claim adjustments would affect the premium amount collected,and in turn the premium amount affected the past servicing fees charged.consequently,the pool and the servicing companies revised and corrected past bordereau entries on subsequent bordereaux.these adjustments accordingly affected the amount of fees for loss control services credited to the servicing companies.
in,the last facility policy expired.yet wausau continued to make adjustments,collect corresponding premiums from insureds,and enter corrections on subsequent premium bordereaux.in october,wausau processed the last premium transaction on the open account.the last adjustment to the premium and servicing fee portion of the bordereaux occurred in november.on november,fic closed the premium and servicing fee portion of the bordereau account.
in november,fic sued wausau in texas state court to recover the loss control services fees that wausau did not expend in loss control services.wausau timely removed the case to federal court based on diversity jurisdiction.texas law governs the dispute.
on cross motions for summary judgment,the district court concluded that the statute of limitations does not bar fic claim because it is a suit on an open account,and rule x required wausau to spend the full amount of loss control services fees on loss control services.the court entered judgment against wausau for the amount wausau collected in loss control services fees but did not spend on loss control services.these two dispositive issues are now before this court.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the district court judgment.
standard of review 
the standard of review for a district court grant of summary judgment is de novo.gowesky singing river hosp,cir.summary judgment is only appropriate if the evidence shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact,and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c gowesky,at.
discussion 
as a threshold matter,wausau argues that fic lacks standing to sue wausau because even if wausau breached the servicing contract,fic has not suffered any breach of contract damages.wausau bases this argument on the fact that the predecessors to fic were merely conduits for the member insurance companies,who were the actual insurers of last resort.wausau argues that only those member companies have standing to sue for any contract breach.
wausau argument is without merit.texas law provides an unincorporated association the right to sue and be sued in its own name without joining all of its members.civ.ann.art.vernon when an association does so,it asserts the collective rights of its members.accordingly,the facility could seek redress for an injury to its members.just as the facility could seek redress for an injury to its members when an insured fails to pay a premium,see,sunbeam environmental services twcif,no writ,so also could the facility seek redress when the servicing companies did not perform their duties in conformity with rule x.the facility thus had standing.when fic bought the assets of the facility,fic bought the rights to pursue the facility causes of action.fic has standing to sue wausau.
ii.statute of limitations 
an important issue before this court is whether the statute of limitations has expired for fic to bring suit against wausau.under texas law,a party must bring suit for breach of contract within four years after the cause of action accrues.civ.prac.a.normally,a cause of action for breach of contract accrues when the breach occurs.stine stewart.if the instant case were a normal breach of contract situation,fic suit would be barred as the last alleged breach occurred in october,more than four years prior to the november suit.
however,texas law provides a special limitations period for parties suing on an open account.civ.prac.c.an open account exists where parties have conducted past and current dealings in a financial account it remains open as long as the parties expect to conduct future dealings in the account.livingston ford mercury,haley,no writ.the texas civil practice and remedies code c section c states 
c a person must bring an action on an open or stated account not later than four years after the day that the cause of action accrues.for purposes of this subsection,the cause of action accrues on the day that the dealings in which the parties were interested together cease.
emphasis added.thus,the limitations period for a suit concerning a transaction on an open account does not begin running until the account is closed.id.
given the extended limitations period on open account disputes,an essential question in the instant case is whether fic sues wausau on an open account.a suit on an open account other which arises out of the general course of dealing between a debtor and creditor.livingston ford,at citing mccamant batsell.such a suit need not be restricted to suits involving physical items section c includes suits involving performance of services.livingston ford,at applying section c where the parties had a running account for the purpose of accounting for one party performance of services.
here,fic sues wausau over wausau failure to spend all of the monies that the pool and its successors provided to wausau for the specific purpose of loss control services.the pool and its successors transferred these monies to wausau through the bordereaux,which is an open account that existed between wausau and the pool.fic argues that because wausau obligation to spend the fees earmarked for loss control services was contingent on the bordereau open account,the suit over wausau failure to spend those fees is a suit on the open account.because that account between wausau and fic did not close until november,fic contends that under section c,fic brought suit against wausau well within the limitations period.
wausau does not dispute that the bordereau system constitutes an open account between it and fic.wausau disputes,however,that fic is suing on that account wausau offers two general arguments for this conclusion the bordereaux did not itemize the unspent fees for loss control services,and suits over open accounts can only be over a party failure to pay for performance.neither argument is persuasive.
itemization on an open account 
with respect to wausau first argument,wausau concludes that fic is not suing on the account because the bordereaux did not itemize either the loss control services fees or the amount of those fees which wausau failed to spend from the fact that fic is not suing for any specific itemized entry listed on the account,wausau infers that fic must not be suing on the open account.
this argument is untenable.wausau equivocates the meaning of on in section c,a person must bring an action on an open account,with the meaning of on in the statement,fic does not have an itemized entry listed on the open account.in the former statutory phrase,on denotes suing over an item included in an account transaction in the latter statement of fact,on denotes the actual presence of an itemized listing.the meaning of on in these two contexts varies significantly.consequently,the statutory meaning of on does not necessitate the factual condition that wausau asserts.the plain language of the statute does not suggest that an item contained within an account must be itemized on the account in order to bring suit on an open account.
wausau further contends that the absence of an itemized entry means that the bordereaux never accounted for the fees.because the bordereaux apparently never accounted for these expenditures,wausau infers that the amount credited for loss control services did not contribute to bordereaux balances.and because a suit over an open account must affect the final balance,this suit,wausau concludes,must not be over the open account.
such reasoning is specious.wausau concedes that the credits on the bordereaux included payments for loss control services.notwithstanding the absence of a specific listing for those payments,the credits did include amounts for loss control services.therefore,the loss control services payments that fic disputes did contribute to the open account final balance.
wausau also claims that the failure to itemize wausau unspent portion of the fees paid for loss control services implies that the suit is not on an open account.in support of this proposition,wausau relies exclusively on texas rule of civil procedure which states when any action or defense is founded upon an open account on which a systematic record has been kept from this phrase,wausau argues that to be an actionable open account,the account must have a systematic record,and the alleged amount owed must be calculable from that account.because the unspent portion of the loss control services fees are not calculable from any amount on the bordereaux,wausau contends that the action can not be on an open account.
wausau inference is completely unsupported.first,the cited statute does not suggest the conclusion that the disputed amount in a suit on an open account must be calculable from that account.the fact that a systematic record must be kept does not imply that the disputed amount must be calculable from that record.second,rule is an optional pleading mechanism that allows a plaintiff to prove the prima facia validity of particular kinds of claims for which a systematic record has been kept.civ.an open account is merely one of the categories of such a claim,but a party suing on an open account need not use this pleading mechanism.see,fuqua moody clary,dist,no writ suing on an unsworn open account.rule,on which wausau relies,is irrelevant in determining the validity of an open account claim under section c.wausau reliance upon rule is therefore unfounded.
the absence of an itemized reference to the payment for loss control services does not imply that fic can not bring suit on the open account.wausau first argument thus fails.
suit over the failure to perform services 
wausau second argument is that a suit on an open account can only be over the failure to pay for performance,which is reflected in the final balance.wausau attempts to reach this conclusion by citing to cases where a party has sued on an open account for the failure to pay for performance,see,bernsen live oak ins.agency,christi,no writ kersh sons,texas employers ins.ass n,writ ref,and to cases holding that an open account must have a final balance,see,baggett transp.united states,seubert excavators,eucon,idaho,rev on other grounds,idaho,from these two bodies of caselaw,wausau argues that a suit on an open account can only be over of a performed obligation.if this argument were true,then a suit on an open account could not be over the of an item already paid for.according to this reasoning,fic suit would not qualify as a suit on an open account because fic is suing over wausau of its apparent obligation to spend the full amount of loss control services fees.
wausau conclusion is wrong.none of the cases on which wausau relies states that a suit on an open account must be for the of an obligation already performed.mo
