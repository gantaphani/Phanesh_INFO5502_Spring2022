an employer who failed to carry workers compensation insurance as required by law is being sued by a former employee for personal injury,unfair competition and declaratory relief.plaintiff elias valdez claims he was injured in the course of his employment as a cook,janitor,dishwasher and gardener at defendants malibu restaurant.defendants motion for summary judgment did not dispute valdez allegation they failed to carry workers compensation insurance for their employees.rather,defendants contended valdez causes of action for negligence and declaratory relief were barred by the statute of limitations in effect at the time of his injury and his unfair competition cause of action failed to include a prayer for relief within the trial court jurisdiction.the trial court granted defendants summary judgment motion and sanctioned valdez and his attorneys jointly in the sum of for bringing the action in bad faith.
valdez filed a timely appeal from the judgment for defendants but no appeal was filed on behalf of valdez or his attorneys from the sanction order.
as we shall explain,the trial court committed prejudicial error in its analysis of the applicable statutes of limitations.this error not only requires reversal of the judgment for defendants but undermines the basis for the court sanction order.although we have no jurisdiction to reverse that order it would be an abuse of discretion for the trial court,after remand,not to reconsider its order under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c.
facts and proceedings below 
the principal facts are undisputed.
in valdez filed a timely workers compensation claim with the workers compensation appeals board wcab alleging he injured his lower back while removing a tree stump at the direction of his employer and in the course of his employment at the mission club where he worked as an assistant cook,laborer,janitor,dishwasher and gardener.
in may valdez filed the present action for personal injury,unfair competition and declaratory relief alleging the mission club was a business operated by defendant himmelfarb and others who intentionally and without good cause failed and refused to maintain workers compensation coverage for the benefit of their employees all as required by law.in his unverified complaint valdez alleged he discovered defendants lack of workers compensation insurance in august.
defendants answered with a general denial and moved for summary judgment and sanctions against valdez and his attorneys.
as to the personal injury cause of action defendants based their motion on evidence plaintiff discovered defendants did not maintain workers compensation insurance prior to december,and as early as august.defendants argued,and the trial court agreed,a personal injury action against an employer who does not have workers compensation insurance must be filed within one year from the date the plaintiff discovers the employer is uninsured.the court found there was undisputed evidence showing valdez had actual or constructive knowledge the defendants were uninsured at least by december,and therefore his personal injury action filed in may was time barred this ruling also disposed of the declaratory relief claim because that cause of action is inextricably tied to the personal injury claim 
treating the motion for summary judgment as to the unfair competition cause of action as a motion for judgment on the pleadings the trial court granted the motion on the ground the prayer of the complaint did not ask for an injunction or restitution,the only remedies available to a private party under the unfair competition law.
the trial court also granted defendants motion for sanctions under code of civil procedure section against valdez and his attorneys in this action the court reasoned defendants conclusively established valdez knew no later than december defendants did not have workers compensation insurance.therefore if the complaint had at all times so reflected the truth,defendants could have successfully demurred and saved themselves the time and expense of this lawsuit.the court sanctioned valdez and his attorneys for their bad faith.
discussion 
defendants failed to produce undisputed evidence showing the statute of limitations had run on valdez personal injury cause of action.
the strong public policy for employers to compensate their injured employees is reflected in our state constitution,which vests the legislature with plenary power to create and enforce a complete system of workers compensation and in that behalf to create and enforce liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability sustained by the said workers in the course of their employment,irrespective of the fault of any party and to accomplish substantial justice in all cases expeditiously,inexpensively,and without incumbrance sic of any character all of which matters are expressly declared to be the social public policy of this state.
in carrying out this public policy the legislature has directed the workers compensation laws shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.normally this liberal construction operates in favor of awarding workers compensation,not in permitting civil litigation as we discuss below,however,the legislature has made an exception to the rule favoring workers compensation over civil litigation when the employer is illegally uninsured.
an employer failure to carry workers compensation insurance for its employees can result in criminal punishment,including a fine or imprisonment or both administrative penalties and a civil suit for damages by an injured employee 
as relevant to this case labor code section requires e very employer to secure the payment of compensation in one or more of the following ways a by being insured against liability to pay compensation by one or more insurers or b by securing from the director of industrial relations,a certificate of consent to.absent compliance with one of these alternatives an employee is not subject to the exclusive remedy of workers compensation but may bring a claim before the wcab and a tort action against the uninsured employer this is what valdez chose to do.he first filed a workers compensation claim with the wcab under labor code section and later filed a personal injury action in the superior court under labor code section.
as we discuss below,in an action brought under labor code section an employer liability is determined under rules of pleading and proof,which differ significantly from those of a common law personal injury action.for that reason we conclude section creates a statutory cause of action for personal injuries subject to the three year statute of limitations 
as an independently sufficient reason for reversing the judgment we conclude even if the former one year statute of limitations for negligence actions applies to this case the statute was tolled while valdez pursued his workers compensation remedy 
under either alternative holding it is irrelevant whether valdez discovered defendants lack of workers compensation insurance in december or march.thus there is no basis for the trial court sanction order,which was premised on the theory if valdez had alleged the true date of discovery defendants could have prevailed on a demurrer to the complaint and saved the time and expense of a summary judgment motion.
a.a suit based on labor code section is governed by the three year limitation period because the employer liability is created by statute.
under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a an action may be brought within three years if it is a n action upon a liability created by statute,other than a penalty or forfeiture.
as a general rule,an action brought under labor code section differs markedly from a common law negligence action.in describing these differences in rideaux torgrimson our supreme court explained if an employer fails to secure the payment of compensation,either an injured employee or his dependents may sue the employer for damages.in such an action the plaintiff may attach the property of the employer and is given the benefit of a presumption that the employer was negligent.the employer may not defend upon the ground that the employee was contributorily negligent,or assumed the risk of the hazards attending his employment,or that he was injured through the negligence of a fellow servant.after considering the dissimilarities between the two actions the court concluded the legislature,by enacting the predecessor to labor code section,provided a statutory cause of action for personal injuries quite different from that of the common law.in hall copco pacific the ninth circuit,relying on rideaux construction of section as creating a statutory cause of action,held an action brought under that section was subject to the three year limitations period for an action upon a liability created by statute.the court of appeal concurred with hall in lewis bonner observing the statute of limitations upon an action under labor code section appears to be no more than three years 
in the present case the undisputed facts show valdez was injured in july and commenced his section action in may,less than three years from the date of his injury.thus,regardless of when valdez discovered defendants were uninsured he brought this action well within the three year limitations period of code of civil procedure section,subdivision a 
valdez personal injury action is not barred by the one year statute of limitations because the statute was equitably tolled while he pursued his workers compensation claim.
as a separate and independently sufficient reason for reversing the summary judgment as to the personal injury cause of action we hold,under our supreme court decision in elkins derby even if the former one year statute of limitations for a negligence action applied to this case the statute was tolled until valdez obtained a final determination of his workers compensation claim.
in arguing the one year statute of limitations bars valdez personal injury cause of action defendants rely on the provision of labor code section which states an employee of an uninsured employer may bring an action for damages as if the workers compensation law did not apply.if the workers compensation law does not apply,defendants reason,then an action authorized by labor code section must be governed by the laws governing negligence actions generally including the statute of limitations for an action based on negligence the limitations period begins to run,defendants maintain,when the employee discovers the employer is uninsured.
defendants argument overlooks our high court decision in elkins derby,which held the one year period for bringing a personal injury action was tolled while the plaintiff,acting in good faith,pursued his workers compensation remedy against his employer although elkins personal injury action did not arise under labor code section we conclude the court reasoning is applicable to such cases.
in elkins the plaintiff first pursued a workers compensation claim against defendants whom he believed were his employers.several months later the workers compensation referee determined plaintiff had not been an employee of defendants at the time of his injury and dismissed his claim.approximately one month after the referee decision became final the plaintiff filed a personal injury action against the same defendants for the same injury which had served as the basis for his workers compensation claim.the trial court sustained the defendants demurrer on the ground the action was barred by the one year statute of limitations because it was filed more than a year from the date of plaintiff injury the supreme court reversed holding plaintiff action was not barred by the one year statute of limitations because the limitations period was equitably tolled while he pursued his workers compensation claim 
the court gave several reasons for tolling the statute of limitations on elkins personal injury cause of action.
principally,the court concluded tolling would not interfere with the primary purpose of the statute of limitations to prevent surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost,memories have faded and witnesses have disappeared.loss of evidence is not a concern because the d efendants interest in being promptly apprised of claims against them in order that they may gather and preserve evidence is fully satisfied when prospective tort plaintiffs file compensation claims within one year of their injuries.the court also pointed out a civil action,even if filed while the compensation claim was pending,would normally not move forward until the compensation claim was resolved finally,the court noted requiring an injured employee to maintain duplicate actions against the employer before the wcab and a civil court might work an inequity upon an injured employee,would be inefficient,awkward and laborious and lead to the assertion of mutually inconsistent allegations before different tribunals 
in sum,elkins stands for the proposition that when an injured person has two legal remedies and reasonably and in good faith pursues one,the statute of limitations should not bar pursuit of the second unless doing so would unfairly prejudice the defendant 
defendants have not shown prejudice in the present case.they make a perfunctory argument evidence has been lost,memories have faded,and witnesses may have disappeared but they produced no evidence to back up these contentions.furthermore,in elkins the supreme court held as a matter of law the likelihood the employer will suffer prejudice if the compensation claimant files a tort action more than a year after the date of injury is minimal.the court reasoned filing the workers compensation claim is enough to put an employer on notice it needs to identify and locate witnesses with knowledge of the events causing the injury and the nature and extent of the injury the likelihood,however,that the employer will suffer prejudice if the compensation claimant files a tort action more than a year after the date of injury is minimal.after the filing of a compensation claim,the employer can identify and locate persons with knowledge of the events or circumstances causing the injury.by doing so,he takes the critical steps necessary to preserve evidence respecting fault.although he may choose not to gather evidence bearing on fault from these parties when faced only with a compensation claim,he will be able in most instances to recontact these people,particularly if they are continuing employees,for further evidentiary contributions should a controversy as to fault later arise in a tort action.
in a case such as the one before us,where the employer knows it is uninsured,it has an even greater incentive to initially gather evidence of fault because it can anticipate having to rebut the presumption of negligence in a civil action under section as the court explained in elkins,an employer who even suspects the claimant may seek tort remedies may well choose to obtain evidence of fault immediately upon the filing of a compensation application even though no court action has yet been initiated.the employer can not assume the claimant will not file a tort action.he thus may elect to gather evidence of fault immediately in order to save himself the trouble later.
defendants attempt to distinguish elkins on the ground the plaintiff in that case filed his civil complaint within a month after learning he was not eligible for workers compensation and only a year and three months from his date of injury.in contrast valdez did not file his civil complaint until more than a year after learning defendants were uninsured and almost two years after his date of injury.we find this argument unpersuasive.even if valdez had filed his civil action the same day he learned defendants were uninsured the action would have been held in abeyance pending a determination of his workers compensation claim as previously noted,labor code section explicitly permits an employee of an uninsured employer to proceed simultaneously on a workers compensation claim and a civil action for n
