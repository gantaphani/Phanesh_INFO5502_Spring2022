plaintiff,gregory smith,sued his employer,the waukegan park district,in the circuit court of lake county,alleging the district discharged him in retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim.the district filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section a of the code of civil procedure code ilcs a west,claiming immunity pursuant to the local governmental and governmental employees tort immunity act tort immunity act ilcs et west.the circuit court granted the motion to dismiss,and the appellate court affirmed the dismissal.d.we allowed smith petition for leave to appeal.we now reverse and remand.
factual background 
in his complaint against the district,smith alleged he was a seasonal park maintenance employee for the district and performed his work satisfactorily.he suffered a injury on may,requiring medical treatment and time off work.smith filed a claim under the workers compensation act ilcs et west.
on june,smith returned to work and the district insisted he submit to a drug and alcohol test.smith refused.smith alleged the demand was retaliatory harassment for filing a workers compensation claim.after smith refusal,district supervisor mike trigg informed smith by letter that he was terminated effective june for his failure to take the drug and alcohol test.
the district responded to the complaint by filing a motion to dismiss under section a of the code.the motion asserted immunity from smith claim of retaliatory discharge under section of the tort immunity act ilcs west.specifically,the district argued section provided immunity to local public entities when the entity employee could not be held liable for the act or omission causing the alleged injury.under our holding in buckner atlantic plant maintenance,the district asserted that individual employees are not liable for retaliatory discharge.since trigg could not be held liable for the decision to fire smith,the district argued it could not be held liable.
alternatively,the district contended it would not be liable since it enjoyed discretionary immunity under the combined effect of sections and because section of the tort immunity act ilcs west provides immunity to governmental employees for their acts or omissions involving discretion or determination of policy.in support of its contention that trigg firing of smith was a discretionary act and a determination of policy,the district attached trigg affidavit.
trigg affidavit averred the district drug and alcohol testing policy permits testing an employee if the district has reasonable suspicion that the employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol.in processing the workers compensation claim,the district received a medical record indicating smith used marijuana every morning and evening.smith was then asked to take a drug test.smith statement to his doctor,admitting daily marijuana use,indicated to trigg that smith came to work after smoking marijuana.therefore,trigg thought he had the reasonable suspicion necessary to demand a drug test.
after smith refusal,trigg terminated smith.in deciding to terminate smith,trigg considered several factors public safety in light of smith marijuana use the legal and financial risks to the district presented by smith potentially operating vehicles and other equipment while under the influence public loss of confidence in the district if smith were to harm someone while under the influence,especially in light of the district prior knowledge of smith drug use and the deterrent effect smith firing would have on other district employees.
the circuit court granted the district motion to dismiss smith complaint with prejudice.smith appealed and the appellate court affirmed.d.the appellate court held the district immune from suit under section of the tort immunity act ilcs west.in particular,the appellate court determined that since retaliatory discharge claims can only lie against employers and not supervisory employees,public entities can never be liable for retaliatory discharge because public entities can not be liable when its employees are not liable.d at.
ii.analysis 
this case requires us to address whether public entities enjoy immunity under the tort immunity act against claims of retaliatory discharge for exercising workers compensation rights.the existence and preclusive effect of tort immunity are properly raised in a section a motion to dismiss.van meter darien park district.we review the dismissal of a complaint pursuant to section a de novo.glisson city of marion.we also review construction of the tort immunity act de novo.barnett zion park district.
we first analyze the appellate court basis for finding the district immune.the appellate court held the district immune solely under section relying on our holding in buckner that only the municipal employer,and not its employees,may be liable for the tort of retaliatory discharge.
smith agrees with the appellate court view of buckner that a decision to terminate an employee in retaliation for filing a workers compensation claim belongs only to the employer,not to the supervising employee.smith disagrees,however,with the appellate court conclusion that buckner thereby precludes all retaliatory discharge claims because public employers can not be liable when their employees are not liable.smith stresses that the specific language of section relieves a public entity from liability only when the employee act or omission caused the injury,and the employee can not be held liable.according to smith,buckner actually removes section from consideration because it establishes that the employee never acts in a case of retaliatory discharge.
in buckner,we squarely addressed whether a plaintiff may bring a retaliatory discharge action against the employee or agent of his former employer who effected the discharge on behalf of the employer.buckner,at.in rejecting the plaintiff argument in buckner that he could sue his former supervisor,we pointed out that even if an employee devise s the plan to discharge wrongfully the employee,the discharge is still authorized by the employer.emphasis in original.buckner,at.we further noted that the presumed motive for a discharge in retaliation for the exercise of workers compensation rights,namely,the avoidance of paying workers compensation benefits,inured only to the employer,not the employee carrying out the discharge.buckner,at.based on these premises,we ultimately concluded that general principles of agency law may not be logically applied to the tort of retaliatory discharge,and held that the tort of retaliatory discharge may be committed only by the employer.emphasis added.buckner,at.
as smith suggests,it is not the public entity employee who causes the retaliatory discharge.rather,it is the employer.section only grants immunity to a public entity from an injury resulting from an act or omission of its employee where the employee is not liable.emphasis added.ilcs west.accordingly,we hold section immunity does not apply in cases of retaliatory discharge because the employer,not the employee,ultimately causes the injury.
we foreshadowed today decision in boyles greater peoria mass transit district.in boyles,we allowed a municipal employee retaliatory discharge claim to proceed,despite the unavailability of punitive damages against her public employer,and the existence of possible alternative remedies through or against her union.we noted our concern that if a union refused to arbitrate a claim of retaliatory discharge the plaintiff would be left without an effective remedy.boyles,at.we further noted that by forcing the employee to sue her union representative prior to bringing a wrongful discharge action,judicial attention would be detracted from the true focus of the complaint that is,whether the employee was improperly discharged by her employer.boyles,at.we concluded 
u nder appropriate circumstances,an employee may bring an action for retaliatory discharge against a local public entity employer for compensatory damages,even though the public entity is not subject to an award of punitive damages.under our holding,only the damages available are restricted the cause of action in tort for retaliatory d
