eastern associated coal corporation petitions for review of the decision of the benefits review board the brb affirming an award of black lung benefits to arvis toler.toler first applied for black lung benefits in,but that claim was denied.in granting toler second claim for benefits,which was filed in,an administrative law judge alj invoked the rebuttable presumption that a coal miner with a work history of underground coal mining and a totally disabling pulmonary impairment is disabled due to pneumoconiosis the presumption.eastern contends that,by applying the presumption to toler second claim,the alj contravened the black lung benefits act,the act,and its regulations,as well as principles of finality and separation of powers.as explained below,we deny the petition for review and thereby affirm the brb decision.
congress created the black lung benefits program in to provide benefits to coal miners who are totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis and to the surviving dependents of miners whose death was due to such disease.a.pneumoconiosis is defined as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.id.b.
the act empowers the secretary of labor the secretary to implement its provisions and promulgate appropriate standards for determining whether a coal miner is entitled to benefits thereunder.see c,b,a.pursuant to the regulations,a miner must establish four c onditions of entitlement to obtain black lung benefits that he has pneumoconiosis that his pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment that he is totally disabled and that pneumoconiosis contributes to his total disability.see d see also.cwp fund bender,cir.
the applicable regulations identify two types of pneumoconiosis legal and clinical.a.clinical pneumoconiosis consists of those diseases recognized by the medical community as pneumoconioses,the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment.id.a.legal pneumoconiosis is defined more broadly to include any chronic pulmonary disease or respiratory or pulmonary impairment significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by,dust exposure in coal mine employment.id.a.clinical pneumoconiosis can be further classified as either simple or complicated.see usery turner elkhorn mining,d.complicated pneumoconiosis,sometimes referred to as progressive massive fibrosis,see lisa lee mines,owcp,cir en banc,is characterized by the presence of massive lesions in the lungs that resolve on imaging as opacities at least one centimeter in diameter.see c.
congress has occasionally recalibrated the applicable standards for entitlement to benefits under the act.see.cwp fund stacy,cir.in,responding to mounting evidence that meritorious claims were being unjustifiably denied,congress amended the act to afford a presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis to a coal miner who could show that he had worked underground for at least fifteen years and was suffering from a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment.see black lung benefits act of,c,stat,codified as amended at c bozwich mathews,cir.the presumption could be rebutted only by establishing that a such miner does not,or did not,have pneumoconiosis,or that b his respiratory or pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,employment in a coal mine.see c in,congress repealed the presumption for claims filed on or after january.see black lung benefits revenue act of,b,stat,repealed bender,at.
in march,congress restored the presumption after a hiatus by enacting a of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca,stat,codified at c.section c of the aca provided that the presumption shall apply with respect to claims filed after january,that are pending on or after the date of enactment of the aca that is,march.
in,the secretary promulgated regulations implementing the revived presumption.see bender,at.under those regulations,a party opposing a claim for benefits is entitled to rebut the presumption by establishing either that the miner has neither legal pneumoconiosis nor clinical pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment,or that no part of the miner respiratory or pulmonary total disability was caused by pneumoconiosis.d.in other words,to rebut the presumption,the opposing party is obliged to rule out any connection between the miner pneumoconiosis and his disability.see bender,at.
under the regulations governing subsequent black lung benefits claims,a coal miner who has had an earlier claim for benefits denied must establish that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement specified in d has changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.see c.the regulations limit the applicable conditions of entitlement to those conditions upon which the prior denial was based.id.c.if the applicable conditions of entitlement relate to the miner physical condition,then the subsequent claim may be approved only if new evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent claim establishes at least one applicable condition of entitlement.id.c.if a claimant fails to show a change in an applicable condition of entitlement,the claim must be denied.id.c.but,if the claimant shows a change in an applicable condition of entitlement,none of the findings from the prior adjudication are binding,and the new claim must be evaluated de novo,based on all of the evidence.id.c.even if the claimant prevails on the subsequent claim,no benefits may be awarded for the period adjudicated by the prior claim.id.c.
prior to,required a coal miner whose earlier claim was denied to show a material change in conditions in order to pursue a subsequent claim.see lisa lee mines,at.during that period,the director of the office of workers compensation programs the director,the brb,and the courts of appeals rendered conflicting interpretations of the regulatory phrase material change in conditions.to resolve that conflict and clarify the applicable standard,the secretary initiated rulemaking pursuant to the administrative procedure act.see regulations implementing the federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended,proposed.at the conclusion of that rulemaking process,the secretary promulgated a final rule the final rule establishing the standard currently specified in.see regulations implementing the federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended,to be codified at c.
the secretary final rule expressly adopted our court en banc decision in lisa lee mines on the meaning of a material change in conditions.in the preamble to the final rule,the secretary explained that she was effectuat ing lisa lee mines.see final rule.at see also regulations implementing the federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended,proposed,the secretary subsequent claims provision gives full effect to the fourth circuit decision in lisa lee mines.because the secretary expressly endorsed and adopted lisa lee mines when she promulgated the final rule,lisa lee mines remains the law of this circuit and guides our interpretation of 
alva rutter,the coal in lisa lee mines,unsuccessfully sought black lung benefits in.see at.three years thereafter,he filed a second claim,supported by more recent that indisputably established his entitlement to benefits.id.at.lisa lee mines,the responsible operator,contested rutter claim solely on the ground that rutter had not shown a material change in conditions.id.at.an alj ruled that rutter had shown such a change,reasoning that the medical evidence showed a definite progression of rutter disease resulting in rutter reduced capacity to do his former coal mine work.id.the alj further concluded that,even if rutter failed to show a material change in conditions,the denial was erroneous on its face and null and void ab initio.id.accordingly,the alj awarded benefits effective on the date that rutter first claim was filed.id.the brb affirmed the award of benefits,but concluded that the alj was not entitled to reopen the denial.id.it therefore modified the award to provide that benefits would be payable only as of the date rutter filed his second claim.id.
lisa lee mines then sought review in this court.in our en banc decision,we agreed that the brb had properly reversed the alj reopening of the denial.see lisa lee mines,at.we explained that,because the decision was final,that decision and its necessary factual underpinning must be accepted as correct.id.we emphasized,however,that the first brb decision did not bar a subsequent claim as a matter of ordinary res judicata,because t he health of a human being is not susceptible to a adjudication.id.at.rutter second claim for black lung benefits required an assessment of his condition when that claim was filed,an issue which neither was nor could have been litigated in connection with rutter first claim.id.
we then addressed the appropriate standard for evaluating subsequent claims for black lung benefits,and we adopted the one element standard advanced by the director.see lisa lee mines,at.that rule required the claimant to prove,under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition after the prior denial,at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.id.at.we rejected a more stringent standard,drawn from the seventh circuit decision in sahara coal owcp,cir,that would have required the claimant to show a change in condition on every element previously decided against him,because it did not account for the frailty of alternative holdings,and because it required a plenary review of the evidence behind the first claim.lisa lee mines,at.we also rejected the standard sponsored by the brb in spese peabody coal,blr,which would have allowed a coal miner subsequent claim to proceed if the miner presented new evidence that raised a reasonable possibility of changing the result,deeming such a standard vague,illogical,and arguably too lenient.lisa lee mines,at.
for years,arvis toler worked in and about eastern coal mines in southern west virginia,primarily as an electrician.for sixteen of those years,toler toiled underground,where he was exposed to high concentrations of coal dust.between approximately and,he generally smoked a pack of cigarettes each day.toler began to experience shortness of breath in the mid.his breathing problems worsened,and,in,at age,toler failing health caused him to quit his job as a coal miner.
in,shortly before he left eastern,toler filed his first claim for black lung benefits.an alj found that toler was totally disabled by severe obstructive pulmonary disease,but also that toler had failed to show that his work in the coal mines rather than his smoking habit caused his pulmonary illness.as such,the alj denied toler claim for benefits.the brb affirmed the alj decision,explaining that the alj had properly weighed the evidence and permissibly found that toler had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered from pneumoconiosis.toler thereafter petitioned this court for review of the brb adverse decision.in,we denied toler petition for review and affirmed the brb.see toler coal,cir,unpublished.
despite leaving his coal mine work and abandoning his smoking habit,toler respiratory condition continued to decline.by,toler required supplemental oxygen,and he began using oxygen hours per day in.
toler filed his second claim for black lung benefits on february.in april,the director had toler undergo a complete pulmonary evaluation.see a.as part of that evaluation,toler had a chest,which a radiologist read as positive for simple pneumoconiosis,as well as blood gas and pulmonary function tests,which indicated that toler was permanently disabled due to a pulmonary impairment.based on those tests,and on his own examination of toler,john burrell diagnosed s imple pneumoconiosis category,severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and arteriosclerotic heart disease with coronary artery disease,based on history,physical,chest,arterial blood gas test results pulmonary function studies.see burrell identified smoking and occupational exposure to coal dust as causes of toler pulmonary impairments.
both toler and eastern submitted additional evidence to the director regarding the second claim.toler furnished a radiologist reading of a july,that was also positive for simple pneumoconiosis,and eastern introduced a negative reading of the april.
on october,the district director issued a proposed decision and order granting toler second claim.because eastern objected to the decision,toler second claim was scheduled for a march,hearing before an alj.toler testified at the hearing and introduced several new exhibits.toler exhibits included a second reading of the july,as positive for pneumoconiosis,as well as additional pulmonary function and blood gas studies.toler also submitted a letter from his treating physician advising that toler has severe obstructive lung disease with pulmonary nodule and intermittent infiltrates and opining that it is quite probable given the severity of toler disease that coal dust played an integral role in its development.
eastern introduced several other exhibits into evidence,including negative readings of the april and july,a december,digital,and five ct scans taken between december and november.in addition,eastern furnished reports by david rosenberg and joseph renn concluding that toler did not have pneumoconiosis.finally,eastern took the uncontested depositions of rosenberg and renn and introduced those depositions.
on june,the alj issued his decision and order the alj order granting toler claim for benefits.the alj accepted the parties stipulations that toler was a coal miner,that toler was totally disabled from a pulmonary impairment,and that eastern was the responsible operator.based thereon,the alj applied the newly restored presumption to toler claim and identified the only remaining issue as w hether eastern can establish that toler does not suffer from pneumoconiosis.see alj order.the alj then examined the opinions of rosenberg and renn,rejecting both because they were grounded in a misinterpretation of a medical study and because those experts had failed to consider toler history of coal mine employment.accordingly,the alj concluded that eastern had failed to demonstrate that toler did not have pneumoconiosis or that his pulmonary impairment did not arise out of,or in connection with,toler coal mine employment.
eastern appealed the alj order to the brb,which promptly remanded to the alj to afford eastern the opportunity to submit new evidence aimed at rebutting the presumption.on remand,eastern submitted to the alj an additional report from rosenberg,and both eastern and toler submitted briefs supporting their respective positions.
on august,the alj issued his second decision and order the alj order granting toler claim for black lung benefits.relying on the seventh circuit decision in consolidation coal director,owcp,cir hereinafter bailey,the alj again applied the presumption to toler second claim.in assessing whether eastern had rebutted that presumption,the alj discussed the evidence in some detail.the alj first concluded that the radiological evidence was inconclusive as to pneumoconiosis,and thus insufficient to meet eastern burden.turning to the expert evidence,the alj again rejected rosenberg and renn opinions for much the same reasons specified in the alj order.the alj evaluated and rejected rosenberg supplemental report,reasoning,inter alia,that rosenberg conclusions were inconsistent with the secretary findings in the preamble to the final rule.see alj order thus,the alj concluded that eastern had failed to rebut the presumption and that toler was entitled to benefits.
eastern thereafter appealed the alj order to the brb,which affirmed the alj by its decision and order of july,the brb decision.the brb considered and rejected eastern arguments that principles of finality and res judicata precluded application of the presumption to toler second claim.in rejecting eastern contention that toler improperly sought to relitigate or reopen his first claim,the brb invoked our teaching in lisa lee mines,at,that a subsequent claim is not the same as a prior claim and is not barred by the denial of the earlier claim.because the adjudication of toler second claim did not disturb either the denial of benefits on his first claim or this court disposition of his petition for review,the brb concluded that granting the second claim did not offend any constitutional principles relating to separation of powers.relying on the seventh circuit bailey decision,the brb also rejected eastern contention that the presumption can not be used to establish a change in an applicable condition of entitlement.finally,the brb rejected eastern contentions that the alj had applied an improper rebuttal standard and erred in ruling that eastern failed to rebut the presumption.
eastern has filed a timely petition for review of the brb decision,in which the director and toler widow are presently the respondents we possess jurisdiction to consider toler petition for review pursuant to a and c.
we review an alj decision that has been affirmed by the brb to determine whether it is in accordance with the law and supported by substantial evidence.see island creek coal compton,cir.in so doing,we confine our review to the grounds upon which the brb based its decision.see grigg,owcp,cir.as always,we review de novo the brb conclusions of law.see milburn colliery hicks,cir.
eastern presses two primary assignments of error in its petition for review that,by applying the presumption to toler second claim,the alj reopened a final judgment of an article iii court,in contravention of separation of powers principles and that the alj improperly used the presumption to establish that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement had changed since the denial of toler first claim because eastern first contention requires us to pass on the constitutionality of agency action,we are obliged to first address its second contention.see marshall stevens people friends for freedom,cir resolving statutory challenges to administrative subpoenas before addressing constitutional issues citing ashwander.valley.brandeis,concurring.
first,eastern maintains that utilizing the presumption to show a change in a condition of entitlement pursuant to c contravenes the act and the implementing regulations.we disagree.
both the act and the regulations show plainly that a coal miner armed with new evidence may invoke the presumption to establish a change in an applicable condition of entitlement.section c requires a coal miner to show that an applicable condition of entitlement has changed since the prior denial.if the applicable condition s of entitlement relate to the miner physical condition,then the miner may rely only on new evidence to show a change in an applicable condition of entitlement.see id.c see also consol.coal williams,cir o nly new evidence following the denial of the previous claim,rather than evidence predating the denial,can sustain a subsequent claim.section d lists the conditions of entitlement for a coal miner claim,including that the miner must have pneumoconiosis as it is defined in.section identifies several ways a miner can establish pneumoconiosis,including by use of the presumption described in.see a requiring the decisionmaker to presume that the coal miner has pneumoconiosis i f the presumptions described in or are applicable.and tracks the presumption revived in by a of the aca,which,pursuant to c,applies to toler second claim because that claim was filed after january,and was pending on or after march.congress use of the term claims in c without any qualifying language supports the position that amended c applies to all claims that comply with c time limitations,including subsequent claims.union carbide richards,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the preamble to the final rule reinforces our textual conclusion that the presumption,together with new evidence,may establish a change in a condition of entitlement.in the preamble,the secretary rejected a comment suggesting that a coal miner should be obliged to submit scientific evidence establishing that the change in his specific condition represents latent,progressive pneumoconiosis.see.at.instead,as the secretary explained,the miner continues to bear the burden of establishing all of the statutory elements of entitlement,except to the extent that he is aided by the two statutory presumptions in effect at the time the secretary promulgated the final rule.id.in other words,the preamble evinces the secretary intention that any applicable statutory presumptions may aid a miner subsequent claim.
thus,the text of the statute and regulations,as well as the preamble to the final rule,demonstrate that the presumption applies to subsequent claims and may be used to establish a change in an applicable condition of entitlement.even if we harbored doubts about that conclusion,we would defer to the director reasonable and consistent interpretation of the applicable regulations.see clinchfield coal harris,cir explaining that director interpretation of applicable regulation is entitled to substantial deference and will be respected unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the express language thereof quoting mullins coal,owcp,d.
contrary to eastern suggestion,application of the presumption to a coal miner subsequent claim does not amount to a double presumption.see br.of petitioner.under the test,the miner is required to prove,under all of the probative medical evidence of his condition after the prior denial,at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.see lisa lee mines,at see also.c requiring the miner to demonstrate that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement has changed.the presumption merely helps the miner to establish the conditions of entitlement in the second claim.it does not allow the alj to waive finality by presuming that something changed.see br.of petitioner.
in advancing its preferred interpretation of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions,eastern relies on the secretary concession in national mining ass department of labor that the most common forms of pneumoconiosis are not latent,see.that concession,in eastern view,is simply inconsistent with utilization of the presumption to establish a change in a condition of entitlement.although eastern does not dispute that complicated pneumoconiosis can be latent and progressive,it insists that simple clinical and legal pneumoconiosis are neither latent nor progressive,and that the secretary conceded as much in national mining ass see br.of pet r.
put succinctly,we are not empowered to substitute our judgment for that of the secretary on matters within the secretary area of expertise.see hughes river watershed conservancy johnson,cir see also midland coal,owcp,cir w e see no reason to substitute our scientific judgment,such as it is,for that of the responsible agency.eastern therefore bears a heavy burden of showing that the secretary was not entitled to use her delegated authority to resolve the scientific question in this manner.midland coal,at.eastern has failed to meet that burden in this proceeding.
the secretary,after reviewing all of the medical literature referenced in the rulemaking record,located abundant evidence demonstrating that pneumoconiosis is a latent,progressive disease.see.at.the discussion of the medical literature in the preamble to the final rule demonstrates that both simple and complicated pneumoconiosis can be latent and progressive.in one study,fourteen of the miners who showed progression of pneumoconiosis after leaving the coal mining industry had simple pneumoconiosis.see.at see also donnan et,progression of simple pneumoconiosis in ex coalminers after cessation of exposure to coalmine dust inst.of occupational.another study reported both small opacities evidence of simple pneumoconiosis and large opacities evidence of complicated pneumoconiosis in who did not show evidence of coal workers pneumoconiosis after the miners left the industry.final rule.at.thus,t he medical literature makes it clear that pneumoconiosis even in its simple form may be latent and progressive.mining ass n,at acc
