this case arises from a wave of state and federal litigation brought by employees and former employees of mobil,as well as their relatives.generally,the employees assert that mobil failed to comply with texas workers compensation law,such that mobil was never a valid subscriber to the workers compensation system.under texas scheme,employees covered by policies receive compensation on a basis,and,in exchange,subscribing employers benefit from an exclusive remedy provision.this provision prevents employees from suing subscribers for negligence.thus,the theory is that these employees were injured because mobil allegedly fraudulent representations that it was a subscriber caused them to forgo negligence lawsuits against mobil.
in the instant case,the plaintiffs,ozan patterson and john ballenger,are using this theory to allege a variety of civil violations under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,et.originally,patterson and ballenger brought this suit as a class action under fed.civ,but we previously vacated the district court class certification.see patterson mobil oil,cir.upon remand,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants.the plaintiffs timely appeal.
the issues presented by this case necessitate a detailed recitation of the facts and procedural background,including a brief summary of the allegations in the pleadings and the roles of the parties.in the primary cause of action,the plaintiffs allege that mobil violated rico by conspiring with various insurers and claims adjusters over a period hereinafter the rico suit.specifically,they allege that the defendants engaged in a scheme to deprive the plaintiffs of their negligence causes of action against mobil for workplace injuries.mobil allegedly used fronting insurance companies to obtain sham workers compensation policies in order to hide the fact that it was,which was not permitted by the texas workers compensation scheme then in force.further,the plaintiffs allege that the defendants used the interstate mail and telephone wires to further this illegal enterprise.
during the relevant years,mobil obtained its workers compensation insurance from several different companies.through,mobil insurer was forum insurance company forum from through,mobil insurer was national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh,pennsylvania in,mobil insurer was american home assurance company and,in,mobil was insured through the insurance company of the state of pennsylvania.all are named as defendants in the rico suit.the latter three insurers are members of the american international group of companies aig and other various aig companies have also been named as defendants collectively,the aig defendants.in addition,the plaintiffs have sued glenda matous and robert gronwaldt,representatives of aig who adjusted mobil workers compensation claims,individually and as agents of mobil.
patterson was a mobil employee from to.in,and,patterson suffered injuries.for each injury,patterson sought and received workers compensation benefits from mobil various insurers.ballenger is the son of thomas ballenger,who died in from burns sustained after an explosion at a mobil plant.ballenger mother,ella ray whitehead,sought and received workers compensation benefits from forum,mobil carrier at that time.she also filed suit,on behalf of her and her surviving children,against mobil,claiming gross negligence and seeking punitive damages.see ballenger mobil oil,cir.the jury found mobil grossly negligent,but we reversed,concluding that the evidence did not support that finding.id.at.during that suit,mobil stated in its pleadings that it had workers compensation insurance.
on march,the same day the plaintiffs filed the rico suit,whitehead filed a request for relief from judgment under fed.civ.b the rule b motion.she requested that the district court set aside the ballenger judgment,arguing that mobil had perpetrated a fraud on the court by representing that it had workers compensation insurance 
the rico suit was originally assigned to judge fisher.just after granting class certification,judge fisher recused himself,sua sponte,without explanation.the case was reassigned to judge cobb the defendants immediately moved to have the certification order vacated,arguing that it was inappropriate for judge fisher to have ruled on the issue since nobody knew why judge fisher recused himself or when the conflict came to judge fisher attention.
the plaintiffs moved to have judge cobb recuse himself,citing and as support.specifically,they alleged that disqualification was mandatory because john tucker,a partner in judge cobb former law firm,orgain,bell tucker,represented mobil in the original ballenger suit while judge cobb was still a partner at that firm.the plaintiffs also argued that judge cobb impartiality might reasonably be questioned because of his relationship with tucker and.finally,they contended that judge cobb was actually biased because he might be required to consider the actions of his former law partner and law firm during the course of the case.in particular,they noted that tucker was one of the lawyers representing mobil in the rico suit the plaintiffs also submitted an affidavit from john ballenger in which he stated that he believed judge cobb was biased against his case and would not be able to preside impartially over the rico suit.
at the hearing on the defendants motion to vacate,judge cobb asked the plaintiffs whether tucker or were mentioned in the complaint or whether the plaintiffs were seeking recovery against tucker or the firm.the plaintiffs answered no to both questions,and judge cobb denied the motion to disqualify.following this,the plaintiffs petitioned this court for a writ of mandamus,seeking judge cobb disqualification,and we denied that petition.in re patterson,cir,unpublished order denying mandamus.
after this court reversed the class certification,the defendants moved for summary judgment and the plaintiffs made a supplemental motion for disqualification.the basis of the plaintiffs motion was new evidence that judge cobb had represented forum in a mobil workers compensation case in.see forum ins.mitchell,no.dist,jefferson county,unpublished.they contended that this gave judge cobb personal knowledge of relevant facts,including whether forum was a sham company that was actually controlled by mobil at that time and whether mobil was a valid subscriber in the texas workers compensation system.the defendants opposed the motion.judge cobb noted in a later order that he was asked to recuse himself in an earlier stage of the mcclelland litigation for similar reasons,but had refused to do so.in one of his final memorandum orders,judge cobb explicitly stated that his position as forum counsel of record years ago in a separate litigation did not warrant disqualification and emphasized that the plaintiffs earlier attempt to secure disqualification from this court had been unsuccessful.he then denied the motion to disqualify.
in a separate order,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment and denied the rule b motion.plaintiffs now appeal judge cobb refusal to stand recused and the adverse summary judgment ruling 
we first address the recusal issue.the denial of a motion to recuse is reviewed for abuse of discretion.matassarin lynch,cir citing in re billedeaux,cir.
under,a judge is to recuse himself if a party to the proceeding makes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge before whom the matter is pending has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of any adverse party a party may only file one such affidavit for that case.id.in addition,the affidavit must be filed not less than ten days before the beginning of the term at which the proceeding is to be heard unless good cause is shown,and the affidavit must state the facts and reasons for the party belief that bias or prejudice exists.id.
this provision relates only to charges of actual bias.henderson dep t of pub.safety,cir.when a party files a motion,the judge must pass on the sufficiency of the affidavit,but may not pass on the truth of the affidavit allegations.id.a legally sufficient affidavit must state material facts with particularity state facts that,if true,would convince a reasonable person that a bias exists and state facts that show the bias is personal,as opposed to judicial,in nature.id.
admittedly,judge cobb did not specifically address the sufficiency of ballenger affidavit during the hearing or in his written order.he did,however,refer to the recusal analysis he published in the mcclelland case.see mcclelland gronwaldt.in that case,the plaintiffs filed a motion and accompanying affidavit,arguing that judge cobb was biased because of his association with.judge cobb ruling on the issue went into painstaking detail and concluded that mcclelland affidavit failed the reasonable person test.id.at.
although ballenger affidavit is slightly more specific than the one at issue in mcclelland,we find that it suffers from the same overall defect.judge cobb relationship with tucker and is,by itself,insufficient to convince a reasonable person that judge cobb would be biased against the plaintiffs or in favor of mobil.tucker representation of mobil in the ballenger suit is also insufficient.that suit was litigated more than years ago,and it has little bearing on the merits of the present action.it was a workers compensation suit involving mobil,and mobil participation in texas workers compensation system had no direct bearing on whether it was grossly negligent with regard to the explosion that fatally injured ballenger father finally,judge cobb representation of forum on a separate matter from long ago does not prevent him from ever hearing cases in which forum or mobil are parties.see chitimacha tribe of harry laws,cir.thus,we conclude that judge cobb did not abuse his discretion when he denied the plaintiffs motion.
recusal is also addressed in the plaintiffs continue to argue that judge cobb was required to recuse himself under a,b,and b.we consider each in turn,again reviewing for abuse of discretion.united states monroe,cir.
when considering a claim under a,we must consider whether a reasonable and objective person,knowing all of the facts,would harbor doubts concerning the judge impartiality.in re chevron,cir internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added.this is because the goal of this provision is to avoid even the appearance of partiality.liljeberg health servs.acquisition,d internal quotation marks omitted.thus,recusal may be required even though the judge is not actually partial.in re cont l airlines,cir.
the plaintiffs have a stronger argument under this provision than under,although we are not convinced that these facts would cast doubt in a reasonable person mind regarding judge cobb impartiality.at first glance,a reasonable person might be inclined to think judge cobb could be biased in favor of his former law partner and firm,especially given judge cobb participation in at least one similar case.but a reasonable person would temper this inclination with the knowledge that the events in question occurred almost three decades ago.thus,considering all the relevant facts,one could conclude that judge cobb did not abuse his discretion with regard to a.nevertheless,we recognize that this is a close question.i f the question of whether a requires disqualification is a close one,the balance tips in favor of recusal.in re chevron,at quoting nichols alley,cir see also in re faulkner,cir noting that p eople who have not served on the bench are often all too willing to indulge suspicions and doubts concerning the integrity of judges quoting liljeberg,at.we are bound to conclude that,given the specific facts alleged in the plaintiffs original and supplemental motions to disqualify,judge cobb should have recused himself under a.thus,we need not address the other provisions of.
although we conclude that judge cobb should have stood recused under a,we do not automatically vacate the rulings issued after he should have recused himself.in our circuit,the harmless error rule has long been applied in this context.monroe,at united states,cir doddy oxy usa,cir in re continental,at.we consider the following factors in determining whether reversal or vacation is mandated the risk of injustice to the parties in this case the risk that denial of relief will create injustice in other cases and the risk of undermining the public confidence in the judicial process.liljeberg,at.in re continental,at.
the plaintiffs dispute the applicability of the harmless error rule,arguing that when a judge erroneously fails to stand recused,our precedent dictates that the judge orders must be automatically vacated.tramonte chrysler,cir see also republic of pan.am.tobacco,cir citing tramonte trevino johnson,cir same.to the extent tramonte and the cases that cite it are inconsistent with in re continental and its progeny,the older line controls.diamond offshore v.a b builders,cir reiterating that one panel of this court can not overrule an earlier panel decision.this conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the rule established in in re continental is based on the clear wording of liljeberg,wherein the supreme court stated relief is neither categorically available nor categorically unavailable for all a violations.at.liljeberg also announced the factors applied by this court in in re continental.id.
finally,although the plaintiffs focus many of their recusal arguments on b,we reiterate that we need not consider judge cobb decision with respect to this provision.it could only be relevant if the harmless error test applied to a,as we conclude above,but not to b.for the reasons given in harris champion,cir,we are confident that b violations are also subject to the doctrine of harmless error.id.at.
we now apply the harmless error test of in re continental to the district court subsequent rulings specifically,its summary judgment ruling in the rico suit and its denial of the rule b motion.with regard to the first prong,we noted in in re continental that the risk of injustice to the parties in allowing a summary judgment ruling to stand is usually slight.at.because we review a summary judgment ruling de novo,using the same standards as the district court,the parties are guaranteed a fair,impartial review of the merits of the ruling.as we stated in in re continental in cases where we would otherwise affirm such a ruling,little would be gained by vacating and remanding with instructions that it be essentially reinstated.id.
the grant or denial of rule b relief is reviewed for abuse of discretion,however.flowers reg l physician,cir.nonetheless,given the long period of time between the original ballenger judgment and the rule b motion,as well as the motion unique relationship to the rico suit,we find that the possibility of injustice to the parties is slight.the rule b motion is premised on mobil alleged fraud with respect to its subscriber status.accordingly,the merits of the motion will be determined by our de novo evaluation of the district court summary judgment ruling,which was based on the fraud issue.thus,we find the first prong of the harmless error test satisfied.
next,we consider whether it is likely that our refusal to vacate the orders would create injustice in future cases.again,we note that other cases appealed after a summary judgment ruling will receive fair,impartial treatment from this court.moreover,our holding that judge cobb erred by failing to stand recused will serve as a cautionary note to future district courts considering recusal motions in similar circumstances.thus,we find the risk of injustice to other cases to be slight,and so the second prong is met.
finally,we do not believe the public confidence in the judicial process will be undermined if we hold the violation of a to be harmless error.the public will recognize that we have clarified that,under these circumstances,a judge should recuse himself.in addition,reasonable people will recognize that almost thirty years passed between the events in question and the district court present rulings.the notion that all conflicts fade with time is a strong one,and we are confident that this notion will moderate the public reaction.in fact,in light of the long passage of time,the public may be more inclined to lose faith in the system if this court were to mindlessly vacate judge cobb rulings.see in re continental,at.thus,we find that the a violation constituted harmless error.
finding the recusal error to be harmless,we turn to the merits of the district court summary judgment ruling.the district court held that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the evidence showed that mobil had workers compensation insurance from through,and thus was a subscriber in texas system.further,it held that ballenger and patterson had not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether mobil arrangements with its various workers compensation insurers were fraudulent under texas law.
thus,the district court decision was based entirely on texas law.for this reason,mobil,forum,matouse and gronwaldt have asked this court to certify the following question to the texas supreme court 
where an employer is the holder of a policy of workers compensation insurance from an authorized insurer and gives notice of such to its employees,is the employer right to the exclusive remedy provisions available to a subscriber under the texas workers compensation act conclusively established 
the plaintiffs oppose this motion,arguing that we should not ask the texas supreme court to consider this case because the record is too undeveloped.alternatively,the plaintiffs ask that we abate this appeal pending the outcome of ballenger state court action.
the decision of whether to certify a question lies within our sound discretion.nationwide mut.ins.unauthorized practice of law,cir.as a general rule,we do not use certification as a panacea for resolution of those complex or difficult state law questions which have not been answered by the highest court of the state.free abbott,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although the state law questions created by this case are important and complex,we feel,for the reasons given infra in part,that texas law is sufficiently clear.accordingly,we deny the defendants motions to certify and we deny the plaintiffs motion to abate the appeal.
as noted above,we review a grant or denial of summary judgment de novo,using the same criteria employed by the district court.mongrue monsanto,cir.summary judgment is proper if,drawing all inferences in favor of the party,there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.fed.civ.c.generally,the plaintiffs must establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding mobil status as a workers compensation subscriber we consider each of the plaintiffs contentions in turn at the outset,however,it should be emphasized that although we conclude that many of mobil actions were improper or illegal,these actions did not affect its status,under texas law,as a workers compensation subscriber and thus did not affect its entitlement to the exclusive remedy protection of the workers compensation system.
first,the plaintiffs argue that mobil was not a subscriber during the years that forum was its insurer because mobil and forum have not proven that mobil actually purchased policies from forum during the relevant years.moreover,the plaintiffs emphasize that forum was a subsidiary of mobil and that forum was completely controlled by mobil.according to the plaintiffs,forum was nothing more than a front for and so mobil was not a valid subscriber.
under the relevant statutory scheme,a workers compensation subscriber is defined as any employer who has become a member of the association by paying the required premium provided that the association holds a license issued by the texas commissioner of insurance.stat.ann,vernon emphasis added.association is defined as the workers compensation carrier or other insurance company authorized to write workers compensation policies.id.thus,the plaintiffs are correct that,in order to achieve subscriber status,mobil was required to obtain a workers compensation policy by paying a premium to an authorized insurer 
in response to this allegation,the defendants produced the following proof certificates of authority for forum issued by the state of texas,which indicate that forum was authorized to write workers compensation insurance during the relevant period declaration pages from the workers compensation policies issued by forum from to,accompanied by the sworn affidavit of an authorized agent for forum stating that the declaration pages were true and correct copies and copies of notices of coverage from the industrial accident board,indicating that mobil was a subscriber in the system during each of the eleven years.despite this overwhelming proof,the plaintiffs persist in their argument that there is a genuine issue of material fact because the defendants have not produced the policies themselves,but only the declaration pages,and mobil and forum have not shown that the premium funds actually exchanged hands.we find these arguments to be meritless.martinez zachry,dist,pet.denied finding a copy of the information page of a workers compensation policy,accompanied by a sworn affidavit from an agent stating that the copy was true and correct,to be sufficient to establish the employer was a subscriber at the summary judgment stage see also dealers ins.simmons,dist,writ ref accepting copy of voluntary endorsement and testimony of employer that policy had been issued but destroyed after it expired as evidence that the policy was issued.the plaintiffs can not suggest that there is a genuine issue of material fact on this point simply by listing the other possible evidence of coverage that mobil and forum could have produced.
likewise,we reject the plaintiffs argument the workers compensation scheme does not forbid an employer and an insurer from being one and the same.otis elevator allen,worth explicitly allowing an authorized insurer to carry workers compensation insurance on its own employees,aff in relevant part and rev on other grounds.even assuming the plaintiffs are correct that forum was under mobil complete control during some or all of the relevant years,this is immaterial.forum was authorized by the state of texas to write workers compensation policies,and mobil obtained just such a policy.thus,the requirements of the statutory scheme were met,and,as a matter of law,mobil was a subscriber.
second,the plaintiffs contend that mobil was not a subscriber during the years it was insured by the aig defendants,through,because the aig defendants only fronted coverage for mobil and thus mobil was actually.this argument is similar to the one mentioned above,see supra part,but the alleged scheme is slightly more complex.during this period,mobil supposedly engaged in a retrospective plan.under this plan,mobil had the insurer file a conventional retrospective rated insurance policy with the state,but did not actually pay the premium indicated by that policy.instead,mobil paid only a fraction of that premium to cover the insurer expected losses paid,expenses,insurance risk premium and premium taxes.in addition,mobil issued letters of credit to the insurer for the difference between the conventional premium and the amount actually paid.mobil also reinsured the insurer risk through an subsidiary.through this complex arrangement,mobil and its reinsurance subsidiary became the true insurers of the risk associated with mobil workers compensation program.
mobil does not dispute that it used this retro plan.instead,it argues that such an arrangement does not invalidate its subscriber status because its side agreements with the insurer and reinsurer are immaterial.our review of the summary judgment evidence leads us to believe that mobil retro plan was,at the very least,highly improper.mobil was aware that such a plan had been formally forbidden by the texas state board of insurance but chose to use a retro plan anyway because it was significantly cheaper.moreover,mobil designed the arrangement with a number of safeguards to avoid detection.nonetheless,mobil is correct that,under texas law,its status as a subscriber was not invalidated by its use of this arrangement.
the wording of the texas insurance code is clear 
the board of insurance shall prescribe a uniform policy for workmen compensation insurance and any contract or agreement not written into the application and policy shall be void and of no effect and in violation of the provisions of this subchapter,and shall be sufficient cause for revocation of license to write workmen compensation insurance within this state.
ins.code ann.emphasis added.further,the texas courts have repeatedly held that a side agreement to a valid and enforceable workers compensation policy which violates a statutory or regulatory requirement is invalid and ineffective.brookshire grocery bomer,pet.denied listing cases associated employer lloyds dillingham,worth,writ ref holding that a contract to rebate part of the premium in the policy,directly or indirectly,is illegal and void and can not be a defense to a suit for the full premium brought by the insurer receiver glenn mccarthy,knox,writ ref same.
thus,the retro agreements between mobil and the aig defendants were illegal and void.the conventional policies executed by the parties and filed with the state remained in full force and effect during the years in question.if the aig defendants had become bankrupt and their trustees had chosen to sue mobil for the premiums it did not pay,mobil might well have been liable.in addition,if the scheme had been discovered by the appropriate state agencies,mobil and the aig defendants would undoubtedly have been fined,and the aig defendants might have lost their workers compensation insurance licenses.see.ins.code ann.but nothing in texas statutory law or case law suggests that these illegal retro arrangements would have affected mobil subscriber status 
the defendants have provided copies of the entire policies issued by the aig defendants to mobil for the relevant policy years,as well as authenticating affidavits.we have examined the policies and find no mention of a rebate system or arrangement in any of them.we conclude that these policies remained valid during their terms and satisfied the necessary conditions for mobil to achieve subscriber status.see tankersley durish,writ denied where the illegal agreement is not incorporated in the policy,but is apart from it,the policies themselves are valid.see also.ins.code ann.civ.stat.ann,vernon stating that when an authorized insurer issues a policy conditioned to pay workers compensation,the holder of such policy shall be regarded as a subscriber so far as applicable under this law.
third,the plaintiffs contend that mobil own employees adjusted mobil workers compensation claims from to,in violation of texas law.they argue that this precludes summary judgment on the issue of whether mobil qualified as a workers compensation subscriber.after considering the arguments of the parties and the applicable state law,we again conclude that mobil actions were probably illegal.again,however,we can not conclude that these actions deprived mobil of its subscriber status under state law.
the plaintiffs first cite to.ins.code ann,which was repealed in.although it existed in various forms over the period at issue,article generally addressed unauthorized insurance.it included the act of adjusting claims or losses in the definition of insurance business and prohibited unauthorized persons or insurers from directly or indirectly doing the acts of an insurance business.see,id.vernon.a violation of article subjected the offending person or entity to administrative and civil penalties.id.but the statute does not contain any language that could be interpreted to affect an employer subscriber status.see also.admin code,suggesting that it is unethical and fraudulent for an insurer to allow an employer to adjust claims and that the remedy for such conduct is to ban the person from appearing before the workers compensation board.
the plaintiffs attempt to buttress their argument by citing to aranda insurance of north america,and natividad alexsis,for the proposition that texas law requires the insurer or someone acting under the insurer direct control to adjust claims,because of the insurers duty of good faith and fair dealing to the insured.this is undoubtedly an accurate reflection of texas law.neither aranda nor natividad,however,address the issue at hand whether improper claims adjustment behavior by an employer prevents that employer from attaining subscriber status in texas workers compensation system.instead,aranda and natividad address the circumstances under which an employee may bring a tort action against a workers compensation insurer for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.natividad,at aranda,at.thus,they are almost entirely irrelevant.
aranda and natividad do offer one valuable insight into texas workers compensation law together they indicate that the duty of good faith and fair dealing owed by an insurer to an employee is separate from the compensation claim and.natividad,at aranda,at.in natividad,the workers compensation insurer had contracted with an outside adjusting firm for the performance of claims handling services.at.the texas supreme court held that an employee suit for breach of good faith and fair dealing was not viable against the adjusting firm because the insurer remained liable for actions by those agents or contractors that breach the duty of good faith and fair dealing owed to the insured by the carrier.id.at.if anything,natividad indicates that mobil insurers would be liable to mobil employees for any improper claims handling under a tort theory of recovery,assuming that those employees could show the misdeeds amounted to a breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing.in addition,the employees would almost certainly have to show that their tort claims were separate from their compensation claims and produced an independent injury.see aranda,at.
mobil may have risked administrative and civil penalties when it adjusted the workers compensation claims of its own employees,in violation of article.likewise,forum and the aig defendants may have risked tort liability or various civil sanctions by improperly allowing mobil to adjust claims.but,even under this worst case scenario,mobil subscriber status was not invalidated.
thus,despite the plaintiffs vigorous arguments to the contrary,we conclude that there is no genuine issue of material fact with regard to mobil subscriber status and,in turn,there is no genuine issue of material fact that mobil was engaged in a scheme to defraud its employees by lying about its subscriber status during the years in question.in light of the foregoing,we find that the district court correctly awarded summary judgment to the defendants with regard to the rico suit 
for these reasons,we find that the district court properly awarded summary judgment to the defendants and we affirm.
affirmed defendants motions to certify is denied plaintiffs motion for abatement of the appeal is denied plaintiffs motion for judicial notice is granted in part and denied in part aig defendants motion for judicial notice is denied.
this case also has an extended and complex litigation history in state court.first,both plaintiffs were members of a class action suit,filed in,which involves similar theories and defendants.mcclelland gronwaldt,no.dist,jefferson county.most recently,a texas court of appeals reversed the class certification on procedural grounds.see gronwaldt mcclelland,wl,at june,no pet.unpublished.in addition,on october,patterson and ballenger filed separate suits based on various state causes of action in the judicial district of jefferson county,texas.patterson mobil,no.dist,jefferson county,whitehead mobil,no.dist,jefferson county.the ballenger case is set for trial in september.although not all of the above information on the state court proceedings is part of the record on appeal,we may take notice of pending judicial proceedings.see,lowrey,cir.in fact,patterson and ballenger have formally moved us to take judicial notice of several documents.we grant the motion with respect to the transfer order from the judicial district court of jefferson county,and the letter agreement setting the ballenger
