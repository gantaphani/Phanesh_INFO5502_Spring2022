the workers compensation appeals board the board ordered employer,united airlines to provide vocational rehabilitation maintenance allowance vrma benefits to an injured worker,clifford gamble,but allowed united a credit for wages gamble earned at his concurrent employment at the los angeles unified school district the school district.gamble asserts the board erred in allowing such a credit and argues the credit unfairly penalizes an injured worker who must work two jobs to support himself and his dependents and amounts to a windfall to the employer as a result of the worker diligence.united contends gamble is not entitled to any wage loss because vrma benefits can not exceed per week and because gamble school district earnings alone exceed this statutory maximum.gamble does not dispute the statutory maximum,but insists his earnings from his second job are not a proper consideration in calculating united liability for vrma benefits.we agree with gamble and conclude the board finding is unsupported by the statutory or case law.accordingly,the decision of the board is annulled.
background on workers compensation 
workers compensation is not an area of the law that routinely gives rise to california appellate court decisions.for this reason,we begin with a brief synopsis of this state workers compensation scheme and its development,an overview of the common jargon,and a discussion of the relevant legal provisions.
more than years ago,our legislature was directed to create and enforce a liability on the part of all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by the said employees in the course of their employment irrespective of the fault of either party.citation.the legislature complied with this directive by enacting various provisions of the labor code.department of rehabilitation workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,fn.omitted lauher.
this system attempts to assure employees of an expeditious remedy both adequate and certain,independent of any fault on the part of employees and employers.at the same time,it provides the employer with a liability which is determinable within defined limits.it represents a philosophy that industry,as a cost of doing business,should provide for the care and rehabilitation of workers disabled by work injuries.in this way,society supports the program as a n integral element of commerce and industry,rather than through plans.citation.lauher,supra,cal th at,d.
in creating and maintaining a system of workers compensation,the people of this state made an important public policy decision and transformed how we address workplace injuries.it should be remembered,however,that the purpose of an award under the workers compensation scheme is not to make the employee whole for the loss which he has suffered but to prevent him and his dependents from becoming public charges during the period of his disability in short the award transfers a portion of the loss suffered by the disabled employee from him and his dependents to the consuming public complete protection is not afforded the employee from disability because this would constitute an invitation to malinger or to be careless on the job as he would then lose nothing in assuming a disabled status.citation.lauher,supra,cal th at,d.
a.the basic components of the compensation scheme 
the basic compensation scheme has two key components disability indemnity,and vocational rehabilitation.from these components arise four distinct classes of benefits td temporary disability vrtd vocational rehabilitation temporary disability vrma vocational rehabilitation maintenance allowance and pd permanent disability.kopitske workers comp.appeals bd.th,d kopitske.before delving into what these various forms of assistance are,and the differences and similarities between and among them,we will briefly discuss,in general terms,the intended purpose behind the compensation scheme key components.
disability disability and permanent disability 
the purpose of temporary disability indemnity is to provide interim wage replacement assistance to an injured worker during the period he or she is healing.kopitske,supra,th at,d.depending on the severity of the injury,workers can be deemed partially or totally temporarily disabled and will receive temporary disability until they recover or become permanently disabled,jimenez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d jimenez.
once the employee condition has become permanent and stationary,he or she is entitled to permanent disability indemnity these benefits are intended as reimbursement for the employee impaired future earning capacity or decreased ability to compete in the open labor market.citation.ritchie workers comp.appeals bd.th,d ritchie.permanent disability is expressed in percentages,and if a disability is deemed less than percent,it is referred to as a permanent partial disability.cal.workers compensation practice ed.permanent disability.the amount of compensation payable for a given percentage of permanent disability varies according to the date of injury.id,at.
the distinction between compensation for wage loss temporary disability and permanent impairment is well established.in nickelsberg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,the california supreme court reiterated in another context the fundamental distinctions,under the california workers compensation system,of benefits compensating for wage loss,providing medical treatment,and compensating for bodily impairment.permanent disability indemnity is awarded injured workers in california in lieu of tort damages against employers.appleby workers comp.appeals bd.th,d appleby.
vocational program 
if a worker is precluded,or anticipated to be precluded,from returning to his or her former position due to an industrial injury,it is in the public and the worker best interest for him or her to return to the labor force in a different position that accommodates the worker disability.so,it is not surprising the compensation laws also currently include provisions for the payment of vocational rehabilitation,subd.k for workers injured before january.
the purpose of vocational rehabilitation is to restore the worker to as near his or her previous status as can be reasonably and properly done.citation.ritchie,supra,th at,d.the law encourages the injured worker to engage in rehabilitation.in fact the term compensation is now defined to include vocational rehabilitation benefits.jimenez,supra,th at,d.
in the case of a worker who will be unable to return to his or her former job due to industrial injury,rehabilitation benefits consist of the costs of vocational training,counseling,and guidance,as well as certain additional living expenses,all for the purpose of preparing and adapting the worker to perform a new job or trade and enter a new work environment.citation.ritchie,supra,th at,d.additional living expenses include,but are not limited to,reasonable costs for food,lodging,transportation,clothing,and dependent care,tit,adm dir rules.cal.workers compensation practice,supra,at.
an employer is required to provide vocational rehabilitation w hen an employee is determined to be medically eligible,a qualified injured worker,subd.c.historically,a qualified injured worker must meet two criteria medical eligibility and vocational feasibility.medical eligibility contemplates the injured worker will be permanently precluded from returning to his or her usual occupation or position held at the time of the injury.cal.workers compensation practice,supra,at.the vocational feasibility requirement relates to the question of whether rehabilitation services would help the worker return to suitable gainful employment.id,at.this requires evaluation of the employee qualifications,interests,aptitudes,and earning capacity,as well as,the labor market and the type of disability.ibid.
statutory history of section 
the definition,scope,and limits of vocational rehabilitation benefits are contained in section.a discussion of this provision evolution is helpful to gain insight as to why rehabilitation services will differ depending on the particular circumstances of the injured worker.
section,subdivision c,was first enacted in,and made the employer initiation of and the employee participation in the rehabilitation program voluntary.ritchie,supra,th at,d.in,the statutory provision was amended to make rehabilitation programs mandatory for employers and to expressly authorize the continuation of temporary disability indemnity payments during rehabilitation.ibid.the legislature envisioned vocational rehabilitation as a service to be provided before disability becomes stationary.webb workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.
consequently,after the amendment,a q ualified i njured w orker who enrolled in a rehabilitation program continued to receive temporary disability,as well as benefits such as additional living expenses necessitated by the vocational rehabilitation program.former,subd.c,stats,ch.temporary disability indemnity received in conjunction with a vocational rehabilitation program is sometimes referred to as vrtd to distinguish it from medical td temporary disability received outside a rehabilitation program.jimenez,supra,th at,d.
however,it soon became apparent vocational rehabilitation services frequently did not commence until after the disability had become permanent.this prompted the legislature to amend section in to provide for the payment of a maintenance allowance benefit for those workers already deemed permanently disabled,the creation of vrma.ritchie,supra,th at,d.it was specified that i n no event shall temporary disability indemnity and maintenance allowance be payable concurrently,subd.d.the new maintenance allowance took effect january.
to summarize,under the amendment,an injured worker who is medically eligible may choose to enroll and receive vocational rehabilitation services while also receiving temporary disability indemnity.when the worker medical condition becomes permanent and stationary,he or she may continue with vocational rehabilitation services.however,temporary disability indemnity payments must cease,and the worker may receive a section maintenance allowance,permanent disability indemnity,or a combination of both if the total sum does not exceed the maximum payment limit discussed in more detail anon,subd.c.
the maintenance allowance is measured at of the worker average weekly earnings at the date of the injury,subd.d.however,the maximum payment is capped at a week,which is a much lower maximum rate than permitted for workers receiving temporary disability or vrtd,subd.d jimenez,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.it is believed the legislature created this discrepancy to provide an incentive to the injured worker to quickly complete vocational rehabilitation while he or she is still temporarily disabled.ritchie,supra,th at,d.
in,section was amended once more to impose additional monetary restrictions on vrma benefits.for example,the legislature placed a cap on the length of time weeks and the total amount of money spent,subd.c.notably,the legislature expressly excluded workers receiving vrtd from this same time and payment limitations.again,it was believed the new limitations would encourage injured workers to enroll in rehabilitation as soon as possible,while still medically temporarily disabled,to avoid receiving less money and services when permanently disabled.see ritchie,supra,th at,d.
ten years later,the legislature decided to scrap the entire vocational rehabilitation program,and repealed section.however,within three months,the section was to accommodate injured workers already enrolled in the program.consequently,section now has limited application to workers injured before january,and the program will expire on january,unless a new statute is enacted extending the benefit,subds.k,l.
ii.factual and procedural background 
keeping in mind the background and evolution of the compensation scheme,we turn to the particulars of this case.the parties do not dispute the underlying facts.after years of employment with united as an air freight agent,gamble injured his back.at the time of his injury,gamble was also working for the school district,where he had been employed for years.although the injury precluded him from continuing his job at united,gamble was able to continue working as a teacher and dean with the school district.in january,the parties stipulated to a permanent disability indemnity award and gamble right to various benefits.thereafter,a dispute arose over gamble claim for vrma benefits.
gamble application for vrma benefits 
after stipulating to a permanent disability indemnity payment,gamble applied for vocational rehabilitation benefits.the vocational rehabilitation unit the unit,which oversees all aspects of vocational rehabilitation,subd.a,determined gamble was a qualified injured worker,and therefore,eligible to receive vrma benefits.united disputed gamble designation as a qualified injured worker and disputed his eligibility for vrma benefits.it asserted that if these benefits were awarded,it was entitled to pay gamble the maintenance allowance component on a basis and receive a credit for gamble school district wages.
a hearing was held in july,and on november,the workers compensation administrative law judge,honorable jules greenberg,issued his findings and order and his opinion on decision.giving the unit determination the great weight to which it was entitled,judge greenberg denied united appeal and found gamble was a qualified injured worker entitled to vocational rehabilitation benefits and services.the judge also concluded the january stipulation resolved all claims for any past vrma owed,but gamble was entitled to these rehabilitation benefits after the date of the stipulation.united was ordered to provide the services requested.in the order,judge greenberg added united was entitled to assert its credit for wages paid to the applicant as part of applicant concurrent employment with the school district.italics and underscoring added.
gamble petition for reconsideration 
gamble petitioned the board for reconsideration of judge greenberg decision.before the hearing,judge greenberg issued a judge recommendation on petition for reconsideration.rather than address the issues for the benefit of the board,the judge rescinded his november,ruling and set a new hearing.judge greenberg explained the action was warranted to allow for time to consider carefully the arguments advanced by the applicant in his petition,which also appear to have some merit.the judge noted the inconsistency between the opinion on decision which stated united would be entitled to credit and his finding and order that stated united was entitled only to assert its right to credit.italics added.
at the hearing,the parties discussed the credit issue and resubmitted the matter on the existing record.a new findings and order was issued on july.gamble was again determined to be a qualified injured worker who was entitled to vrma benefits after the date of the january stipulation.in addition,united was ordered to provide these benefits and expressly denied a credit for gamble school district wages.the opinion on decision was issued in conjunction with the new findings and order.
judge greenberg written opinion contained much of the same reasoning as the previous one,but also included a discussion of vrma benefits and an employer right to an offset.he noted,there was unrebutted trial testimony gamble and his family were dependent on his two incomes,and concluded gamble should not be penalized for his continuing work in a much less physically demanding occupation with the school district.in addition,judge greenberg concluded gamble was entitled to receive the maintenance allowance to allow him to successfully complete a rehabilitation plan and pursue another second employment consistent with his stated desire.
united petition for reconsideration 
united petitioned the board for reconsideration of the july decision.united again disputed gamble was a qualified injured worker and reasserted it should be given credit for wages earned by gamble at the school district.judge greenberg submitted a thorough,judge report on petition for reconsideration recommending denial of united petition.in the report,he included a procedural history of the case,a statement of the issues,a lengthy discussion of the law,and his reasoning for denying united a credit.
the board granted united petition for reconsideration.it reaffirmed judge greenberg finding gamble was a qualified injured worker entitled to vrma benefits.however,it amended the findings and orders to allow united a credit for wages paid to gamble by the school district on a basis.it is from this decision gamble seeks appellate review.
iii.the credit issue 
the sole issue raised by gamble petition is a challenge to the board award of a credit on a basis against his vrma benefits due solely to his concurrent employment with the school district.united did not file a petition to challenge the board determination gamble was a qualified injured worker or its finding gamble was entitled to receive vrma benefits.
board opinion and order 
in its opinion and order,the board stated there were cases indicating an employer is entitled to credit for amounts an injured worker earned while also receiving vocational rehabilitation.the board also specifically noted,and attached significance to,the fact gamble failed to prove he looked for a second job in the past four years.the board recited gamble testimony he believed he may be able to find work as a reservations clerk for a different airline.the board concluded that rather than looking for work with another employer,the record showed gamble waited to see if united would allow him to come back as a reservation clerk or give him early retirement.in addition,the board observed a second job did not seem feasible,stating,it is not at all obvious how gamble could be available for rehabilitation services while he is working for the school district as an educator and as dean of students.
we conclude the factual circumstances discussed by the board are relevant only to the question of whether gamble could satisfy the vocational feasibility requirement to be deemed a qualified injured worker.those facts have no bearing on the credit issue.moreover,we conclude the board misinterpreted the applicable law concerning an employer right to receive a credit for wages when calculating the monetary allowance component for living expenses and costs incurred by a vocational rehabilitation recipient.
standard of review 
we are bound by the board factual findings and decision if supported by substantial evidence.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.we may not reweigh evidence or decide disputed fact s.ibid.on the other hand,interpretation of governing statutes is decided de novo by the appellate court,even though the board construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
case authority discussing credits for wages 
the parties agree there is no explicit authority that provides an employer may receive a credit against the vrma benefits owed to a permanently disabled worker simply because he continued to receive wages from a second job.united advances several theories for its entitlement to a wage credit based on cases discussing the credit issue in other contexts.we have carefully reviewed this authority,and conclude none are sufficiently analogous to be controlling here.
instead,we found the legislature has clearly designated specific formulas to be applied when calculating each category of compensation benefits,including vrma benefits.below,we will discuss the calculations used for each kind of benefit,demonstrating the wage credit concept applies only in limited circumstances involving temporarily disabled workers and is not applicable here.
looking first at permanent disability indemnity,we found the wage credit concept does not apply when calculating payments regardless of whether the worker is totally or partially permanently disabled.as mentioned earlier,compensation for permanent disability indemnity relates to the employee diminished ability to compete in an open labor market rather than to whether a wage loss was being incurred at the time the disability became permanent and stationary.cal.workers compensation practice,supra,at,italics added.consequently,the payment scheme contained in sections and only takes into account the year of injury and the percentage of disability.see.
moreover,it is settled law in this state that an employee may receive a permanent disability rating of percent and be entitled to the disability payments incident to such rating although he is able to return to work at the wages he received before the injury which caused disability.t he right to compensation is not lost or diminished by the injured employee return to work at the same or a different wage than that theretofore earned by him.the statute does not require a showing of loss of earning power as a prerequisite to the payment of compensation for a permanent disability,but,on the contrary,provides for the payment in installments of a fixed and definite sum of money therefor.citations.smith industrial acc.com.cal d.thus,it is unnecessary for the injured employee to have a current wage loss in order to be entitled to permanent disability payments.cal.workers compensation practice,supra,at.for this reason,there is no dispute gamble permanent disability indemnity payment is unaffected by his wages from the school district.
the formulas used for temporary disability indemnity payments are more complicated.different calculations must be applied depending on whether the worker is totally temporarily disabled and unable to continue working,versus partially temporarily disabled,and may be able to work a reduced number of hours or at an alternative position.
the starting point for both kinds of workers is the measurement of his or her average weekly earnings awe,which is a concept defined by statute.section,subdivision c,provides several different methods for computing the awe depending on whether the employee has more than one employer,works less than hours a week,or is paid at a regular and constant rate.generally,when a worker has more than one employer,the awe is the total of all weekly earnings capped at the rate earned on the job in which the employee was injured.the computation can change depending on the hours worked at each employment and whether it produces a fair and reasonable result.see,subd.c.
the payment given to a temporarily totally disabled worker like payments for the permanently disabled does not contemplate a wage credit because the worker is not expected to be capable of earning supplemental wages.the formula applied is simply of the worker awe at the date of injury,subd.a subject to a maximum of for workers injured in when gamble was injured.
however,the payment made to a temporarily partially disabled worker must take into account wages earned or expected to be earned by the worker in an alternative job.such benefits are often called the benefit,because it pays a portion of the earnings that the injured worker loses during the period of healing or until their condition become permanent or stationary.cal.workers compensation practice,supra,at.stated another way,employers of these workers are given a credit for any wages earned by the employee able to work less hours or at a position.
section delineates the formula to calculate the loss in wages for the temporarily partially disabled worker.the payment equates to the difference between the awe of the injured employee and the weekly amount which the injured employee will probably be able to earn during the disability,to be determined in view of the nature and extent of the injury 
not surprisingly,this same loss in wages credit formula applies when calculating the temporary disability indemnity component of a worker also receiving vocational rehabilitation services.in other words,workers receiving vrtd benefits can participate in vocational rehabilitation programs while continuing to collect temporary disability indemnity payments calculated on a basis.
this category of benefits was discussed in the two california compensation cases cited by united and the board county sanitation district of los angeles workers comp.appeals bd.reyes and douglas workers comp.appeals bd.wiley.
in reyes,the court recognized that to receive vrtd benefits an injured worker must meet the following requirements he or she is deemed a qualified injured worker justifying rehabilitation services and the worker continues to show a current wage loss in order to receive temporary disability indemnity payments.reyes,supra,at.
cesar reyes,a sanitation worker,suffered a injury to his psyche.reyes,supra,at.he was denied retroactive vrtd benefits after the workers compensation judge determined he failed to satisfy the vocational feasibility criteria to be a qualified injured worker.the judge relied on the fact reyes started working as a salesman in his own office sales enterprise the same year he claimed to be injured at his job with the sanitation district.ibid.the judge reasoned,h e should not be entitled to rehabilitation benefits during the evaluation process since he had already returned to suitable gainful employment.ibid.
the board granted reyes petition for reconsideration and affirmed the prior decision reyes did not meet the criteria to be deemed a qualified injured worker status.however,the board held reyes was entitled to retroactive vrtd benefits during the evaluation period because there was prima facie evidence of eligibility and good faith issues existed as to his qualified injured worker status.reyes,supra,at,relying on industrial indemnity workers comp.appeals bd.d.applicant ultimately determined not to be qualified injured worker was found to be entitled to some vrtd benefits.the board explained,t he amount to be awarded should be calculated on a basis because reyes did have some earnings during the relevant evaluation period.reyes,supra,at.it recognized the temporary disability component of the vrtd benefits is measured on a basis and the employer should be credited for wages earned,if any,by new supplemental employment.
similarly,in wiley,the board applied a credit on vrtd benefits on a basis for the commissions the injured worker earned from insurance policies sold during wiley temporary disability.wiley,supra,at,italics added.unlike the worker in reyes,william wiley was working concurrently at two different jobs.he sustained a back injury while employed as a truck driver,but it did not prevent him from continuing his work as an independent agent selling insurance.ibid.while receiving temporary disability,wiley sought rehabilitation services because he was not interested in pursuing insurance work on a basis.it was undisputed wiley was a qualified injured worker,and he had not been provided with suitable gainful employment.ibid.the board reasoned,wiley was entitled to rehabilitation benefits because,regardless of his income from insurance work,it is undisputed his total income was lowered by virtue of his inability to drive a truck.ibid.
the board also noted that although the trucking employer was entitled to a credit for income earned on new policies sold during wiley disability,the employer was not entitled to a credit for renewal premiums because commissions on renewals could not be considered a current wage.wiley,supra,at.
thus,to summarize,the board held wiley was entitled to vrtd benefits comprised of vocational rehabilitation services because he met the requirements of a qualified injured worker and continuation of temporary disability indemnity payments based on his weekly loss earnings the difference between his awe and the current weekly wage earned on new policies sold.wiley,supra,at.
no wage credit for vrma benefits 
united argues the same rationale applied in reyes and wiley should apply to a worker falling under the vrma benefit scheme.it maintains vrtd and vrma benefits play essentially the same role in the scheme both are forms of temporary compensation.but united overlooks the fact the legislature designed different formulas for calculating payments due to injured workers falling within these two benefit categories.
as discussed above,the legislature determined the temporary disability indemnity component of vrtd must be based on a formula found in section.however,the legislature specified the maintenance allowance given to a permanently disabled worker vrma shall be of the employee awe at the date of injury,subd.d.the latter does not contemplate a wage credit for employers because it is not intended to replace lost earnings.rather,it is one of many components of the array of vocational rehabilitation services available to qualifying,permanently disabled workers.
united apparently overlooks the fact the maintenance allowance is only available to workers deemed permanently disabled.indeed,section,subdivision c,explicitly states that once a worker is permanent and stationary,the payment of temporary disability indemnity ceases and is replaced with the payment of a different benefit called maintenance allowance.
the maintenance allowance payment is measured in the same way as permanent disability indemnity payments.it is a fraction of the worker awe at the date of injury.section also sets a maximum limit for the amount of maintenance allowance permitted using the awe based formula if the legislature had intended the maintenance allowance to also be reduced by wages earned,it could have used similar language found in section containing the formula for temporarily partially disabled workers.we can not rewrite section to include it.
we note the legislature recognized the maintenance allowance would likely be small in comparison to what the worker was awarded for permanent disability indemnity.the worker receiving vrma benefits can supplement the maintenance allowance with an additional amount from permanent disability indemnity due or payable,sufficient to provide the employee with a maintenance allowance equal to of the employee awe at the date of injury subject to the limits specified in subdivision a of section,subd.d.in other words,the worker has the option of combining the maintenance allowance with permanent disability benefits so long as the total combined payment does not exceed what a worker receives under vrtd benefits very telling is the legislature decision to set the maximum payment allowable for this combination of benefits by referring to section used for measuring permanent disability limits,with no reference to the wage credit reduction formula found in section.what would be the point of supplementing the maintenance allowance with permanent disability indemnity if an employer could reduce the total amount to zero 
we are required,as is the board,under section to liberally construe the workers compensation provisions of the code with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.we first look to the plain meaning of the statutory language,when clear and unambiguous.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.effect also should be given to the statute every word and clause,thereby leaving no part or provision useless,deprived of meaning,or contradictory.id.at,d.finally,the statute should be interpreted consistently with its intended purpose,and harmonized within the statutory framework as a whole.ibid.
in light of the above,we conclude that when the legislature amended section to create the maintenance allowance component for permanently disabled workers,it clearly and unambiguously determined the payment would be less than what a temporarily disabled worker would receive and,more importantly,would be based on a preset fraction of the worker awe.it was foreseeable that permanently disabled workers could be collecting permanent disability indemnity as well as income from secondary employment.yet,nowhere in section is there any indication the legislature contemplated a credit for wages to employers paying the maintenance allowance.just as gamble can supplement the maintenance allowance with permanent disability payments without fear of losing it,he can continue to earn wages from the school district while seeking under the vrma benefit scheme a second job to replace his united air freight employment.
limited applicability of section 
as an alternative argument,united asserts it is entitled to a credit for wages pursuant to section.it misunderstands th
