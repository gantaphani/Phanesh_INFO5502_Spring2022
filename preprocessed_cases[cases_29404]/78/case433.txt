kim jones appeals a summary judgment granted to her employer,the california department of correction and rehabilitation cdcr,and individual supervisors,sergeants james bolin and gary kuske,crew officer michael mcminn,and robert hernandez,the warden at the donovan correctional facility collectively,respondents jones contends the trial court erred in finding she did not present evidence of triable issues of material fact showing the respondents conduct constituted adverse employment actions a nexus existed between her gender and race and the adverse actions she was subjected to a severe and pervasive hostile work environment based upon her gender jones also contends as a matter of law,her causes of action for assault and battery,emotional distress,and negligent supervision were not barred by the exclusive remedies of the workers compensation statutes.
we conclude respondents met their burden on summary judgment and jones failed to establish the existence of triable issues of material fact which could lead a reasonable trier of fact to find that she experienced harassment,discrimination and retaliation within the meaning of california fair employment and housing act feha,et we conclude the causes of action for assault and battery and emotional distress are barred by the workers compensation exclusivity rule.the negligent supervision cause of action also fails because it was based on jones claims of discrimination and assault and battery.we affirm.

in april,jones was not permitted to change her work schedule,although two male correctional officers,newton and mcminn,were allowed to change theirs.after jones inquired about this disparate treatment,turner notified mcminn that the practice of making such schedule changes was cancelled.as a result,mcminn and other male correctional officers escalated their abusive and hostile behavior towards her.
on may,captain talbert met with jones and gave her a job expectations memorandum that primarily summarized california code of regulations sections dealing with employee conduct and the rights and respect of others.shortly afterwards,captain talbert met with mcminn and issued him a similar memorandum.
from approximately october through december,sergeant gary kuske directly supervised jones.on or about november,sergeant kuske forbade jones and all other crew officers from doing paperwork in his office.jones claims kuske directed her to the connex outside the facility where the tools were kept.
on december,jones and mcminn had an altercation regarding the use of a wheelbarrow.jones testified in her deposition that the inmates she was supervising needed the wheelbarrow,but mcminn took it.jones was displeased and went to retake it however,mcminn blocked her and refused to move out of her way.he grabbed her arm and started banging her body around and stuff.just then,another correctional officer called out to mcminn that the sergeant wanted to see him.mcminn walked away,and jones took the wheelbarrow.that day jones reported pain in her neck and right wrist and shoulder,for which she received medical care at donovan.carol capper,the treating medical technical assistant,stated in a declaration,my examination indicated officer jones right wrist had a full range of motion.her skin was intact meaning she had no wounds or cuts and there was no redness.jones was placed on medical disability leave on december,and has not returned to work.she has collected workers compensation benefits.
in january and september,jones filed complaints with the department of fair employment and housing dfeh against donovan and several employees.in february and september,the dfeh issued notices,and she filed the underlying complaint on october.
on september,cdcr filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication on behalf of itself and all defendants,arguing that the feha causes of action a matter of jones could not state a prima facie case,given that none of the claimed wrongful conduct constituted an adverse action but even if they were so deemed,they were made for legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons.respondents also contended the exclusive remedy provided in the workers compensation statutes barred the causes of action for assault and battery,intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress,and negligent supervision and retention of employees.
jones opposed the motion and listed a series of adverse employment actions against her.specifically,her male inflicted hardship on her in the following nine ways criticized her without reason treated her in a hostile manner on a daily basis did not respond to her calls for assistance made false accusations about her to inmates,including misleading the inmates into believing she was responsible for a failure to timely pay the inmates intentionally mislead her into believing she and her inmates were responsible for working expanded areas treated her inmates disparately and more harshly than their own crews.she was given an expectations memo on the same day she inquired why mcminn and newton were allowed to change their work schedules mcminn responded by accusing her of creating a hostile work environment.sergeant kuske ordered her out of his office,and directed her to work in the connex,which was infested with,because the male officers did not welcome her presence in the more desirable areas.finally,cdcr investigated her for misconduct following the wheelbarrow incident.
respondents pointed out in their reply papers that jones opposition presented no evidence that her race or gender was the basis for her claims of adverse action,discrimination,sexual harassment and retaliation.moreover,jones did not present any evidence to refute respondents claims their employment actions were made for legitimate,nondiscriminatory reasons.in particular,jones and mcminn each received a memorandum of expectations in accordance with cdcr policy to improve employee conduct and working relationships kuske banned all crew officers from his office because he did not want them spending time away from their supervisory duties and,jones was assigned to work in the connex because she was to inventory tools there.jones did not dispute that the rats and rodents are native to the desert area around donovan,and make their home under the connex.
the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of all defendants.

sexual harassment 
feha prohibits a variety of unfair labor practices,including discrimination,in terms,conditions or privileges of employment on the basis of specified characteristics,subd.a beyda city of los angeles th,d.specifically,it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to harass an employee based on his or her sex,subd.j.the statutory scheme requires an employer to take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from occurring in the workplace and to take immediate and appropriate action when it is or should be aware that harassment has occurred.carrisales department of corrections cal th,d,superseded by statute on other grounds as noted in chapman enos th,fn,d.an employer is strictly liable for harassment committed by its agents or supervisors,but is liable for harassment committed by its other employees only if it fails to take immediate and appropriate corrective action when reasonably made aware of the situation.carrisales,at,d.
claims of a hostile or abusive working environment due to sexual harassment arise when a workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation,ridicule,and insult citation that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim employment and create an abusive working environment harris forklift systems,d see also meritor savings bank vinson,d sheffield los angeles county of social services th,d beyda,supra,th at,d fisher san pedro peninsula hospital d.fisher.the elements of such a cause of action are p laintiff belongs to a protected group plaintiff was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment the harassment complained of was based on sex the harassment complained of was sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment and respondeat superior.fisher,supra,at.
the court in aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th,d,citing decisions applying title vii of the civil rights act of title vii,observed that not all workplace conduct that may be characterized as harassing affects a term,condition or privilege of employment within the meaning of title vii.instead,the conduct must be both objectively and subjectively offensive conduct that is not severe or pervasive enough to create an objectively hostile or abusive work environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or beyond title vii purview.likewise,if the victim does not subjectively perceive the environment to be abusive,the conduct has not actually altered the conditions of the victim employment,and there is no title vii violation.aguilar avis rent a car system,supra,cal th at,d.the requirement that the conduct be sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a working environment a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive is a crucial limitation that prevents sexual harassment law from being expanded into a general civility code.oncale sundowner offshore services,d.the conduct must be extreme simple teasing,citation offhand comments,and isolated incidents unless extremely serious will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.faragher city of boca raton,d.the harassment can not be occasional,isolated,sporadic,or trivial the plaintiff must show a concerted pattern of harassment of a repeated,routine or a generalized nature.aguilar avis rent a car system,cal th at,d.
thus,for example,mere utterance of an epithet which engenders offensive feelings in a employee,citation does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate title vii.harris forklift systems,supra,at.rather,s exual harassment creates a hostile,offensive,oppressive,or intimidating work environment and deprives its victim of her statutory right to work in a place free of discrimination,when the sexually harassing conduct sufficiently offends,humiliates,distresses or intrudes upon its victim,so as to disrupt her emotional tranquility in the workplace,affects her ability to perform her job as usual,or otherwise interferes with and undermines her personal sense of.fisher,supra,d at.
whether an environment is hostile or abusive can be determined only by looking at all the circumstances.harris forklift systems,supra,at.faragher city of boca raton,supra,at.these may include the frequency of the discriminatory conduct its severity whether it is physically threatening or humiliating,or a mere offensive utterance and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee work performance.the effect on the employee psychological well being is,of course,relevant to determining whether the plaintiff actually found the environment abusive.but while psychological harm,like any other factor,may be taken into account,no single factor is required.harris forklift systems,at.see fisher,supra,d at.including in the totality of circumstances to be considered the nature of the threatening acts in that physical touching is more offensive than unwelcome verbal abuse the total number of days over which all of the offensive conduct occurs and the context in which the sexually harassing conduct occurred sheffield los angeles county of social services,supra,th at,d.
we conclude,based on the totality of the circumstances,jones failed to present a triable issue of material fact from which it reasonably could be inferred she suffered harassment proscribed by feha.specifically,respondents,in their moving papers,pointed to jones deposition testimony in which several times she was asked whether the comments and complaints her coworkers made about her were prompted by her gender or race.jones repeatedly answered,no and i do know.the absence of the nexus between the alleged harassment and jones gender negates her feha claim.
jones claim also fails for the independent reason that she did not produce evidence that the conditions she complained of were sufficiently severe or pervasive to constitute harassment.as the trial court concluded regarding all jones complaints about adverse employment action,these incidents are akin to being a collection of isolated and objectively events.we regard the wheelbarrow incident as the most severe conduct she complained about because it involved physical conduct however,it was a occurrence,which was unrelated to her gender.several of her other complaints similarly were either regarding discrete incidents or matters that were not severe illustrative examples are the dispute with the inmates regarding their pay the expectations memorandum she received and mcminn response to the memorandum he received.there is no evidence the male coworkers daily criticisms were severe because,as recounted in jones deposition testimony,they amounted to no more than comments that she was not doing her job.
