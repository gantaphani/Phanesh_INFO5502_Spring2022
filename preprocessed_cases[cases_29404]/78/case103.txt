this case addresses whether an insurance policy that excludes coverage for an obligation incurred under any workers compensation law bars coverage for a judgment that an employee recovers in a negligence action against a texas employer that does not subscribe to the texas workers compensation system.because the texas workers compensation act twca imposes no obligation on a nonsubscriber to compensate an employee for injuries sustained due to the employer own negligence,we find that the exclusion is not applicable.accordingly,we affirm the district court summary judgment in favor of.
american international specialty lines insurance aislic appeals from the district court summary judgment in favor of defendants,holding that aislic umbrella insurance policy the aislic policy,issued to rentech boiler systems,covered the negligence claims that preston teel,lesa crosswhite,and jennings teel the teels asserted against rentech steel,in the underlying litigation and the resulting judgment.rentech steel,rentech boiler systems,and renz family partnership,are entities under the control of or owned by a common.rentech steel,a nonsubscriber to the texas workers compensation insurance system,maintained both a primary indemnity policy,which is not implicated in this case,and the aislic policy.rentech steel shared the aislic policy with rentech boiler systems,a subscriber to the workers compensation system,but they maintained separate primary policies due to their differing statuses in relation to the workers compensation system.
the underlying litigation commenced when preston teel sustained severe injuries while working at rentech steel manufacturing facility in abilene,texas.following the incident,the teels sued rentech steel in state court for gross negligence,negligence,and negligence per se.lexington insurance company,rentech steel primary insurer,initially defended rentech steel in the litigation.but after lexington insurance denied further coverage,aislic assumed rentech steel defense as the umbrella insurer.a few weeks before trial was to begin,aislic sought a declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify rentech steel in the lawsuit.on the first day of trial,rentech steel entered chapter bankruptcy.according to rentech steel,the bankruptcy was necessary because aislic would not pay for the suit.the bankruptcy court,however,lifted the stay and permitted the case to proceed to trial on the condition that any recovery would be limited to the proceeds of the aislic insurance policy.
the jury found for the teels on their negligence and negligence per se claims,but it did not find gross negligence on the part of rentech steel.the court then entered a judgment against rentech steel for in actual damages,which was reduced to after applying a settlement credit.rentech steel has appealed the judgment,and aislic has continued to defend rentech steel under a reservation of rights during the appeal.as a consequence of the judgment,the teels became proper claimants to rentech steel insurance policy.
shortly after the state court entered its judgment,aislic filed a declaratory judgment action in federal court seeking to establish that it had no duty to either defend rentech steel in the underlying lawsuit or to indemnify rentech steel for the judgment because the aislic policy various laws exclusion excluded coverage for any obligation of the insured under any workers compensation,disability benefits,or unemployment compensation law,or any similar law.aislic moved for summary judgment,arguing that a negligence claim filed against a nonsubscribing employer is an obligation arising under the twca,not state common law,so the teels judgment against rentech steel was necessarily an obligation under texas workers compensation obligation explicitly excluded from coverage under the various laws exclusion.the teels and rentech steel opposed aislic motion.
the district court denied aislic motion,holding that the judgment against rentech steel did not fall within the policy various laws exclusion.the order explained that,although the twca deprives appellees of the right to assert a negligence or negligence per se claim against a subscribing employer,the act imposed no obligation on a nonsubscribing employer to compensate an employee for injuries resulting from the employer negligence,but merely limited an employer defenses against an employee claims.alternatively,the court held that,because the various laws exclusion was ambiguous,texas law required that the exclusion be interpreted against aislic and in favor of coverage where appellees interpretation of the exclusion was reasonable.
following the district court denial of aislic motion for summary judgment,appellees filed for summary judgment on the ground that the aislic policy various laws exclusion did not bar coverage of the judgment against rentech steel,which the district court granted.this appeal followed.

at issue in this case is whether an employee negligence action against an employer that does not subscribe to the texas workers compensation system is an obligation under the twca,such that it is excluded under the aislic policy various laws exclusion.the aislic policy various laws exclusion provides

because texas law governs this claim,we employ the principles of texas contract construction in interpreting the various laws exclusion.texas law provides that insurance policies are construed according to common principles governing the construction of contracts,and the interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law for a court to determine.new york life ins.travelers ins,cir.limiting our inquiry to the four corners of the underlying complaint and the four corners of the insurance policy,we interpret the contract to discern the intention of the parties from the language expressed in the policy.see amerisure ins.navigators ins,cir.no single provision taken alone will be given controlling effect rather,all the provisions must be considered with reference to the whole instrument.see coker coker,citations omitted.where,as here,the disputed provision is an exclusion,the insurer bears the burden of establishing that the exclusion applies.guaranty ins.vic,cir.

employing these principles,we find no ambiguity in the language of the various laws exclusion.the exclusion plainly excludes from coverage only those legal obligations imposed by any workers compensation law.this provision is straightforward.if texas workers compensation law imposes a duty upon rentech steel to compensate the teels for the injuries preston teel incurred due to rentech steel negligence,the exclusion applies and bars coverage.hence,the only question before the court concerns the proper interpretation of texas law does the twca obligate a nonsubscribing employer to compensate an employee for injuries sustained as a result of the employer own negligence,or is such compensation a duty under texas common law 
aislic and appellees disagree on two fundamental aspects of texas law whether an employee negligence claim against a nonsubscribing employer arises under the twca or common law,and if it arises under the twca,whether the twca imposes an obligation upon a nonsubscriber to compensate an employee for injuries caused by its own negligence.aislic contends that the provision of the twca addressing negligence actions against nonsubscribers,codified at section of the texas labor code,wholly supplanted the texas claim with a statutory claim.according to aislic,because the twca creates the cause of action under which the teels sued rentech steel for negligence,the twca necessarily imposes an obligation on rentech steel to pay the teels judgment.aislic premises its theory on the fact that section deprives nonsubscribing employers of certain defenses available at common law and sets out an employee burden of proof in negligence cases.labor code b,c.
appellees contend that aislic can prove neither that the twca creates the cause of action for negligence against a nonsubscriber,nor that section imposes any obligation on a nonsubscriber to pay a judgment to an employee for injuries caused by negligence.according to appellees,rather than displacing the common law,section simply leaves the common law intact with one modification as a incentive to participate in the compensation program,the twca deprives nonsubscribers of some traditional defenses.but regardless of what law creates the cause of action,appellees argue that section is devoid of any language creating an obligation for nonsubscribing employers to compensate employees for accidents resulting from negligence,so the exclusion does not apply.
where,as here,the proper resolution of the case turns on the interpretation of texas law,we are bound to apply texas law as interpreted by the state highest court.barfield madison,cir.because the texas supreme court has never ruled on whether the texas workers compensation act obligates a nonsubscribing employer to compensate an employee for injuries sustained due to employer negligence,we must make an erie guess as to how the texas supreme court would rule upon the issue based on 
decisions of the texas supreme court in analogous cases,the rationales and analyses underlying texas supreme court decisions on related issues,dicta by the texas supreme court,lower state court decisions,the general rule on the question,the rulings of courts of other states to which texas courts look when formulating substantive law and other available sources,such as treatises and legal commentaries.

turning first to the text of section,nothing in the text indicates that the texas legislature intended to impose a legal obligation on a nonsubscriber to compensate an injured employee.the statute simply specifies that,i n an action against an employer who does not have workers compensation insurance coverage to recover damages for personal injuries or death sustained by an employee in the course and scope of employment,the defendant employer is deprived of certain defenses available at common law,though other defenses remain available.a,b.it also clarifies that the negligence standard continues to apply the plaintiff must prove negligence of the employer or of an agent or servant of the employer acting within the general scope of an agent or servant employment.c.
although we believe that this statute,on its face,does no more than modify the defenses available at common law,and does not create a cause of action that usurps the cause of action,we are emphatically not permitted to do merely what we think best we must do that which we think the texas supreme court would deem best.jackson sales,cir en banc.thus,we consider the relevant authorities to determine how the texas supreme court would interpret section.
texas cases 
in making our erie guess,we look first to those texas supreme court cases that,while not deciding the issue,provide guidance as to how the texas supreme court would decide the question before us.our preeminent authorities,language and decisions from the texas supreme court,suggest that the court would find that a negligence claim against a nonsubscriber is a claim,and that section imposes no obligation upon rentech steel to pay the teels judgment.the texas supreme court in kroger company keng,indicated in dicta that a negligence claim against a is modified by the twca,but remains a claim at common law.in that case,the court addressed whether chapter of the texas civil practice and remedies code required the district court to submit a question to the jury in a negligence action against a nonsubscriber,or alternatively,whether section prevented the jury from considering comparative responsibility.the texas supreme court explained in dicta that the twca 
allow s injured workers,whose employers subscribed to workers compensation insurance,to recover without establishing the employer fault and without regard to the employee negligence.in exchange,the employees received a lower,but more certain,recovery than would have been possible under the common law.employers were,however,allowed to opt out of the system,resulting in their employees retaining their rights 
id.at emphasis added.this suggests that the right to bring a claim against a nonsubscriber for negligence remains what it has always right arising under common law.
aislic,however,argues that this case supports exactly the opposite conclusion that such a claim is an obligation arising under the twca because the twca governs the negligence cause of action.aislic reads kroger as unequivocally stat ing that the twca governs an employee claim against a nonsubscribing employer,as the texas supreme court there explained that 
labor code,which is part of the workers compensation act,governs an employee action against his or her employer,when the employer is a nonsubscriber under the act.
in enacting section and its predecessors,the legislature intended to delineate explicitly the structure of an employee action against his or her nonsubscribing employer.section a prescribes the defenses that are unavailable to a nonsubscriber section c dictates the defenses that implicate the employee conduct and on which an employer may rely and section d provides the employee burden of proof 
thus,according to aislic,because the twca governs an employee negligence claim against a nonsubscriber,it also provides an obligation for the nonsubscriber to compensate the injured employee.
not so.we agree that this language in kroger indicates that a negligence claim against a nonsubscriber must proceed within the parameters delineated in section.but it does not follow that simply by virtue of governing the claim,the twca also obligates rentech steel to pay the teels judgment.many claims are governed by statutes of limitations,but those statutes neither give rise to the cause of action they govern,nor do they obligate any party to pay a judgment arising from a governed claim.see texas civ.prac.a,b providing a statute of limitations for such claims as trespass,injury to the estate or property of another,conversion of personal property,taking or detaining the personal property of another,personal injury,and forcible entry and detainer porterfield ethicon,cir citing section a for the premise that a statute of limitations governs personal injury actions.emphasis added.because it is clear that aislic chain of logical assumptions is missing a key link,we must conclude that kroger provides no support for aislic theory.
moreover,in kroger,the texas supreme court explicitly declined to adopt the appellate court reasoning,favorable to aislic,that a suit against a nonsubscriber is an action to collect workers compensation benefits under the workers compensation laws of this state.see kroger,at quoting texas civ.prac.c.the court reserved that question for another day,and instead affirmed the appellate court decision that no jury instruction was required on the ground that no such jury instruction was possible because section precludes a finding of comparative responsibility.id.thus,we do not read kroger to suggest that the twca imposes an obligation on rentech steel to compensate the teels for preston injuries.
further,the texas supreme court decision in fairfield insurance stephens martin paving,demonstrates that,even where the twca sets certain parameters on an employee claim against a nonsubscriber,it does not necessarily transform the claim into an obligation under the twca.in fairfield,the texas supreme court held that the employers liability same policy aislic issued to rentech steel,containing the very same various laws not exclude coverage for claims of gross negligence against nonsubscribers.see id.this holding is significant because texas labor code section b,the provision of the twca governing claims against nonsubscribers,specifies the employee burden of proof in that action the employee must prove that the employee death was caused by an intentional act or omission of the employer or by the employer gross negligence.b.fairfield thus belies aislic contention that section subsumed the common law because it specif ies the employee burden of proof and the defenses available to the employer.where the twca provides the employee burden of proof for both and negligence claims,and the former are unquestionably covered by the insurance policy,the statute provision of the employee burden of proof can not provide the basis for a contrary result here.
though the decisions and dicta of the texas supreme court weigh more heavily in our erie analysis,we also consider those decisions of texas appellate courts in determining how the texas supreme court would rule on this issue.aislic invites us to follow robertson home state county mutual insurance,wl.worth,no pet,which held that the employee judgment for damages against his nonsubscribing employer was an obligation under workers compensation law,excluded from coverage by the various laws exclusion in his employer liability policy we decline this invitation,as robertson is inconsistent with both the relevant texas supreme court caselaw and the plain reading of section.see warfield byron,cir finding that,where authorities were split,the texas supreme court would adopt the view that was most consistent with the plain reading of the statute.
we consider robertson to be unpersuasive because it conflates governs with obligates,and because it fails to account for the texas supreme court decision in fairfield.see robertson,wl,at.the robertson court grounded its holding that no coverage existed on the statute provision of the plaintiff burden of proof,id.at.this conflicts,however,with fairfield holding that the standard employers liability policy covered claims for gross negligence,though the twca sets the standard of proof for those claims as well,see fairfield,at.we are convinced by the plain language of section and by fairfield that the texas supreme court would not follow robertson,so we do not defer to it.mem l hermann healthcare,eurocopter deutschland,gmbh,cir explaining that we need not defer to an intermediate state appellate court decision where we are convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.see also warfield,at holding that the texas supreme court would follow those decisions that were most consistent with the plain reading of the statute.
decisions from other courts 
although texas cases provide greater guidance for our erie analysis,we may likewise consider,among other sources,treatises,decisions from other jurisdictions,and the majority rule.smi owen steel marsh usa,cir citation omitted see also amerisure ins.navigators ins,cir.here,we have the benefit of a number of federal cases interpreting the twca,and we consider these cases in determining whether the texas supreme court would conclude that section imposes an obligation on rentech steel to pay the teels judgment.
we begin this analysis by considering middleton texas p l,a supreme court decision examining the twca only a few years following its enactment.the twca withstood constitutional challenge in the texas supreme court in but with united states supreme court review imminent,the texas legislature amended the act while the appeal was pending to allow workers to forego workers compensation remedies and thereby retain their rights of action.see ferguson hosp.int l,cir.in,the supreme court affirmed the texas supreme court and held that the statute was constitutional.middleton,at.in describing the act,the court explained that the twca shielded employers from suits,but e mployers who do not become subscribers are subject as before to suits for damages based on negligence.id.emphasis added.negligence suits preceding the enactment of the twca were unquestionably suits under common law.therefore,the supreme court statement leaves little doubt that it interpreted the twca as not fundamentally changing the characterization of negligence claims against nonsubscribers.
we are also guided by those federal decisions that have considered the question whether an action against a nonsubscriber arises under common law or the twca.rentech steel argues that we should follow pyle beverly,holding that negligence claims against nonsubscribers exist independently of the twca in that opinion,judge fitzwater considered whether the plaintiff negligence suit against her nonsubscribing employer arose under the twca,such that it was not preempted by erisa.the court held that they were not so preempted because the plaintiff 
state court petition does not seek recovery pursuant to the twca.it clearly alleges common law claims of negligence,intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing.these are not causes of action that are created by the twca they exist independently.moreover,the fact that the twca deprives employers of certain defenses to negligence claims does not mean that claims by employees against nonsubscribing employers are brought pursuant to the twca.see eurine wyatt cafeterias,wl at,sanders,a cause of action does not arise under workers compensation laws merely because the workers compensation statute deprives the defendant of certain defenses to the cause of action.
this approach,we believe,is consistent with the texas supreme court approach in kroger keng,and with the history of the twca,see nunez.at when the texas legislature put a workers compensation law into effect in it,for all practical purposes,abolished the right of an employee to bring a action against an employer having workers compensation insurance coverage.however,the legislature preserved the common law right of action for the employees of an employer who elected not to carry workers compensation insurance,and enhanced those rights by a statutory provision that prevented an employer in such an action from asserting defenses that theretofore had been available to employers.
aislic,however,contends that we must consider those decisions holding that claims against nonsubscribers are not removable to federal court under c,the federal statute addressing nonremovable actions,because such claims arise under the twca.see figueroa healthmark partners,d,see also
