the primary issue in this breach of contract action is whether a municipality liability upon withdrawing from a county fund should have been discounted to present value.under the circumstances presented,we hold that the withdrawal fee reflected benefits to be paid in the future and therefore should have been discounted to its current value as of the date it was due.
the case arises out of a dispute over the administration of a workers compensation plan plan administered by herkimer county county.in,the county created the plan pursuant to article of the workers compensation law.by,the participants included cities,towns,and villages,including plaintiff the village of herkimer village.the terms of the plan were dictated by local law see local law of the county of herkimer local law of the county of herkimer.rather than purchasing private insurance,the participants pooled their funds to administer and pay for all of their workers compensation claims.each year the plan administrator estimated the plan costs for the upcoming year and apportioned them among the participants.the apportionment was based on a formula contained in the plan,which,following the adoption of a amendment,was based partially on the property taxes levied by each municipality,and partially on a valuation of each participant workers compensation claims.
participants in the voluntary plan could withdraw at the end of any calendar year by giving notice of withdrawal by the preceding july and by paying an equitable share of the outstanding liabilities of the plan as of the date of withdrawal local law of the county of herkimer see also workers compensation law.although neither the plan nor the workers compensation law provided a mechanism for determining the plan outstanding liabilities,the plan followed the standard practice in the insurance industry of obtaining an actuarial assessment,also known as a reserve analysis.so,for example,when the town of webb gave notice in of its intention to withdraw from the plan,the county hired an actuarial firm to estimate the plan liabilities as of june of that year.the reserve analysis estimated the total projected liabilities at almost million,on an undiscounted basis.the report also provided examples of discounted liabilities tied to various interest rates,including approximately million interest rate,million,and million.the reserve analysis explained the basis for the discounted amounts as follows 
the timing of payments and the time value of money are reflected in the discounted values the effect of investment income is determined by applying a payout pattern and an assumed interest rate to projected ultimate loss,expenses and assessments in order to calculate anticipated payments in future periods.the payments are then discounted to the date of withdrawal.
the town of webb decided not to withdraw in but reversed course in and,along with the town of salisbury,gave notice of withdrawal effective december.another reserve analysis was commissioned,and the estimated liabilities dramatically increased to about million.like the analysis,the report referred to the assessed amount as undiscounted and provided examples of discounted totals,based on interest rates ranging from one to five percent.
due to concern over rising costs,in june the county passed a resolution to terminate the plan pursuant to workers compensation law,effective december,local law of the county of herkimer.the plan would take on no new claims after that date,but would remain in existence to fund the approximately outstanding workers compensation claims,known as tail claims.in order to ensure funding for the tail claims,the county created an abandonment plan abandonment plan that gave member municipalities two choices.they could either remain as participants in the abandonment plan and pay an annual assessment of their portion of the tail claim liabilities,or they could withdraw from the plan and pay a lump sum withdrawal fee.the lump sum fee,due at the end of the calendar year,would reflect the withdrawing member equitable share of the plan outstanding liabilities according to the final annual estimate prior to abandonment.the final reserve analysis would assess the plan future losses as of december,reserve analysis.
in october,seven of the participating municipalities,including the village,instituted the instant action,challenging the plan and the abandonment plan based on alleged mismanagement by the county.the county answered and,insofar as relevant here,raised counterclaims for breach of contract,seeking to recover the withdrawal liability based on the reserve analysis.
in june,while the litigation was pending,the reserve analysis was released.the report estimated the plan outstanding liabilities as of december,to be million on an undiscounted basis,an increase of million from the previous year.the village share was calculated as approximately million.
at this point,the plan had run out of money and had resorted to borrowing funds from the county to keep up with payments on the tail claims.given the dire situation,in october the county adopted a resolution allowing withdrawing municipalities to pay of their withdrawal liability in full satisfaction of their obligations under the abandonment plan.four of the seven plaintiffs in the lawsuit took the settlement offer,but the village,along with two other municipalities,declined.
as relevant to this appeal,the county prevailed on summary judgment as to liability on its counterclaim for breach of contract against the village.at the ensuing jury trial on damages,the parties presented extensive evidence on the actuarial methods underlying the reserve analyses.there was also testimony regarding various discount rates for the plan liabilities contained in the reports.witnesses for the county testified that the million assessment in the reserve analysis represented an undiscounted liability and that examples of discount percentages ranged from one to five percent.a former executive director of the state insurance fund sif testified that the state requires the sif to apply a discount rate of five percent.over the village objection,the jury was provided with a verdict form that did not allow for any damages discount.the jury returned a verdict in favor of the county and awarded the full amount of damages sought by the county against the village.this figure represented the village undiscounted withdrawal liability as of december.judgment was entered against the village for,including in prejudgment interest on the undiscounted verdict.the two other municipal plaintiffs did not perfect their appeals.
on the village appeal,the appellate division affirmed,concluding,in pertinent part,that discounting was inappropriate because the county award of damages did not actually constitute compensation for future losses by its verdict,the jury found that plaintiff owed the county as of december,a sum that it thereafter wrongfully withheld village of ilion county of herkimer,dept.we granted leave to appeal,and now modify.
generally,discounting future damages to their value at some point in the past is appropriate because it takes into account the time value of money.w hen an amount intended to compensate for a future loss is discounted back to a particular time,the discounted amount represents the sum which,if invested at that time at reasonable rates of return,would theoretically produce the intended amount at the future time when the loss is incurred milbrandt green refractories,see also jones laughlin steel v pfeifer.we are perhaps most familiar with discounting in wrongful death,personal injury,and medical malpractice actions,where discounting is required by statute see cplr.in those contexts,it is often the future earning power of the injured party,or a similar measure of future damages,that must be reduced to its value on the date of injury.however,there is no material difference between the value of a decedent future income in a wrongful death case and the value of workers compensation benefits to be paid out over the life of a disability claim.in both cases,some or all of the losses will be incurred in the future.here,the injury in question is a breach of contract,and the future losses manifest themselves in the form of contract damages.
it is undisputed that the abandonment plan constituted a contract between the county,as plan administrator,and the municipalities,as participants.the contract provided that if a participant chose to withdraw from the abandonment plan,it would have to pay a lump sum reflecting its equitable share of the plan outstanding liabilities,as of the date of withdrawal.to determine the amount due,the contract incorporated by reference the final annual estimate and apportionment of costs prior to the abandonment of the plan,the reserve analysis for the participant last year of membership.in the village case,this was the reserve analysis since,by refusing to pay and initiating litigation,the village effectively withdrew from the plan on december,and became liable for the lump sum withdrawal fee.
the county contends,and the courts below agreed,that the million assessed against the village in the reserve analysis represents a liquidated sum due upon withdrawal from the plan and thus should not be discounted.but the purpose of the withdrawal fee was to provide the county with sufficient funds to dole out future benefits to tail claim beneficiaries.according to the county,many of those benefits would be disbursed over,or even years.the actuarial estimate of each municipality withdrawal liability therefore represented its aggregate future liability for existing claims.as the county concedes,those amounts were not discounted to present value.
indeed,the actuarial report expressly stated that t he plan total liability of million did not reflect the fact that future benefits will be paid out over time and interest can be earned if the liabilities are prefunded.the report further provided examples of discounted liabilities to account for t he timing of payments and the time value of money.for instance,the reserve analysis estimated that,at a rate of return,the million should be discounted to million.at the other extreme,the report calculated that,on december,the plan outstanding liabilities would be worth million if invested at a interest rate.by its own terms,the report thus refutes the county argument that the million figure constituted a liquidated sum due upon withdrawal.rather,the million represents the village share of the plan estimated aggregate future losses.to require the village to pay the undiscounted amount would give the county an impermissible windfall see generally toledo iglesia ni christo,see also workers compensation law.
the county nonetheless argues that the realities of the situation make discounting inequitable.the county points to the difficulties of making accurate projections in light of the many variables and unreliable assumptions inherent in actuarial analysis.the county also notes that the report qualified its examples of discounted liabilities,explaining that they were 
provided for informational purposes only.in practice,in order for a discounted liability amount to be appropriate,the plan would need to have sufficient assets available for investment to prefund the liabilities.further,the actual interest rate achievable by the plan would need to be recognized.
moreover,the county asserts that the concept of discounting is inapplicable here due to the plan insolvency.in other words,discounting assumes the payee will earn a return on an investment and is therefore inappropriate when no such investment is feasible.
the county arguments highlight the unique circumstances of this case.it is possible that the factors identified by the county could affect the appropriate discount rate.however,ultimately this is an action for breach of contract.the contract at issue,the abandonment plan,was drafted by the county and provided that the withdrawal liability would be determined by the reserve analysis.in turn,the reserve analysis calculated each member share based on undiscounted,aggregate future losses.any inherent uncertainty in that assessment does not alter the terms of the contract.furthermore,to the extent the abandonment plan contains any ambiguity as to the amount of the village withdrawal liability,it should be construed against the drafter,herkimer county.had the county chosen to expressly define the withdrawal liability as an undiscounted,gross sum,rather than referring to the assessments in the reserve analysis,our result might be different.as it stands,the contractual liability,defined in the statutes,the abandonment plan,and the reserve analysis,encompasses future damages.discounting is therefore appropriate.
the parties also dispute the date from which the preverdict interest should be calculated.the county agrees with the conclusion of the courts below that the interest should run from december,when the withdrawal payment became due.the village,on the other hand,proposes two alternative dates june,when the reserve analysis was released,or january,when the county asserted its counterclaims for breach of contract.
preverdict interest shall be computed from the earliest ascertainable date the cause of action existed cplr b.subject to certain exceptions,a claim for breach of contract exists on the date of the breach see cplr ely cruikshank bank of montreal.here,the cause of action existed on december,when the village owed the withdrawal fee.this date is readily ascertainable not only from the abandonment plan,but also from the enabling statute,which provides that,upon withdrawal from a workers compensation plan,a participant shall pay an equitable share of the outstanding liabilities of the plan as of the date of withdrawal workers compensation law emphasis added.
although the village undiscounted liability was not calculated until june,the liability existed as of the date of withdrawal.moreover,in the intervening six months,the county was paying the village share of the workers compensation benefits,and the village was wrongfully withholding the funds owed.accordingly,there is no reason to extend the accrual date simply because the reserve analysis was not released until june.
the proposed january accrual date is similarly unavailing.in support of this date,the village invokes the principle that interest on an accrued claim against a municipality is payable only from the time that payment is demanded,not from the point at which the debt matured see rapid tr.subway constr.v city of new york,smith city of,city of new york,taylor mayor.however,this rule has no application in this context.
calculating interest on a municipality debt from the time of demand was developed as a means to deter opportunistic creditors from buying up small claims against municipalities and waiting to demand payment until the statute of limitations has nearly expired in order to reap the benefits of the statutory interest rate see,at.the case law emphasizes that a municipal defendant should not be required to seek out those who have claims against it taylor,at accord rapid,at,at it would be exceedingly difficult for the comptroller of a large city to look up claimants or their heirs or assigns and tender payment as their claims matured and became due.
the policy justifications for protecting municipalities from scheming claimants do not apply here.by waiting to assert its counterclaims,the county was not delaying a demand of payment from an unwitting municipality in order to allow.interest from such maturity to afford a safe and profitable investment,at.on the contrary,the village was well aware of the debt maturity date,having anticipated the withdrawal liability in the october complaint.under these circumstances,the courts below properly concluded that the claim accrued on december.the village damages should be discounted to that date,based on an appropriate discount rate to be determined upon remittal.
finally,we note that this dispute between related governmental entities has already spawned nearly a decade of litigation.in the interest of minimizing additional costs to taxpayers and conserving judicial resources,the parties might well consider the wisdom of compromise going forward.
accordingly,the order of the appellate di
