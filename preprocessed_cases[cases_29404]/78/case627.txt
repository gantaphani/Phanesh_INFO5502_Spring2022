this case involves the texas workers compensation subsequent injury fund and the texas municipal league intergovernmental risk pool.the issue is whether the fund and the regulations implementing the fund are unconstitutional as applied to the risk pool,because they either require texas cities to make gratuitous payments to individuals,associations,or corporations,or because they impose a statewide ad valorem tax.see.const.art.iii,a,art.viii.
the trial court determined that sections a and c of the texas labor code and the implementing regulations violate both constitutional provisions.the court of appeals concluded that,because the provisions are analogous to statutes,they are constitutional.the court of appeals thus reversed the trial court judgment and rendered judgment in the texas workers compensation commission favor.at.we agree the provisions are constitutional,but not for the reasons the court of appeals articulated.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
background 
the texas municipal league risk pool includes more than texas cities providing workers compensation benefits to their employees through a fund.the cities formed the risk pool under the labor code,which requires all political subdivisions to provide their employees workers compensation benefits by becoming a,obtaining an insurance policy,or joining with other political subdivisions to through a fund.according to its bylaws,the risk pool objectives are to formulate,develop and administer a program for its members,to obtain lower costs for workers compensation coverage,and to develop a comprehensive safety program.
the risk pool charges its member cities contributions based on a modifier system.under this system,the risk pool board of trustees requires its member cities to contribute a standard rate for each job classification.the cities contributions go to a common fund,which the risk pool uses to pay for its member cities workers compensation claims and administrative expenses.the risk pool also invests its member cities contributions and combines any investment returns with the existing funds available for benefits.
every eighteen months,the risk pool board analyzes each member city claims history to determine the future contributions the city must make.depending on each city claims history,the board assigns a modifier to adjust each city contributions.if the city claims history is good,the risk pool offers a discount on contributions and returns money as equity to the eligible cities.
in,the twcc directed the risk pool to pay its unclaimed death benefits to the subsequent injury fund,as labor code sections a and c require.the risk pool paid before halting its payments.the risk pool then sought declaratory relief that labor code sections a and c,and the rules the twcc promulgated under those sections,are unconstitutional.specifically,the risk pool claimed the provisions,as applied to the risk pool,violate texas constitution article iii,section a,which prohibits the legislature from authorizing any state political subdivision to lend its credit or to grant public money to any individual,association or corporation.the risk pool also alleged the provisions,as applied to the risk pool,violate texas constitution article viii,section e,which prohibits the state from levying an ad valorem tax on any property within the state.
the trial court determined that the provisions violated both sections of the constitution.the court of appeals reversed and rendered in the twcc favor.it held that the provisions are not unconstitutional because they operate like statutes.at.the court of appeals reasoned that because the challenged provisions only transfer custody of,and not title to,the risk pool funds,the escheat of the unclaimed death benefits can be neither a lending of credit that article iii,section a prohibits nor a recapture of local taxes that article viii,section e prohibits.at.
we granted the risk pool petition for review to consider whether the challenged provisions operate like statutes whether the challenged provisions violate texas constitution article iii,a and whether the challenged provisions violate texas constitution article viii.
ii.the subsequent injury fund 
a.the subsequent injury fund 
the fund,originally established in as the second injury fund,is a special account in the state treasury.a.the legislature established the fund to pay lifetime workers compensation benefits to injured employees and to encourage employers to hire people with disabilities or preexisting injuries.miears industrial accident.under labor code section,which authorizes the twcc to adopt regulations to enforce the texas workers compensation act,the twcc has adopted regulations to implement the fund.admin.code.
the fund pays workers compensation benefits when an injured employee suffers a compensable injury that,when combined with a previous injury effects,results in a condition that entitles the employee to lifetime benefits.see.a.thus,if an employee suffers a subsequent compensable injury,the employer must pay benefits for that injury only to the extent that the injury would have entitled the employee to benefits had the previous injury not occurred.a.then,the fund pays for the claimant remaining lifetime benefits.b.
to subsidize the fund,labor code sections a and c require insurance carriers to contribute to the fund any unclaimed death benefits not distributed under labor code section.see also.admin.code a.section lists the beneficiaries eligible to receive benefits if an employee suffers a compensable injury that results in a death.see also.admin.code a.if a beneficiary on the list does not exist or does not timely claim the benefits,a workers compensation carrier must then contribute those benefits to the fund.a e see also.admin.code a.
ordinarily,a beneficiary must file a claim for death benefits within one year of an eligible employee death.a.if the beneficiary does not file a claim within one year,the claim is barred unless the beneficiary is a minor or incompetent or good cause exists for the beneficiary failing to file a claim.b.but,for purposes of financing the fund,the labor code presumes that no legal beneficiary survives the employee if a claim is not filed with the twcc within one year of the employee death.c see also.admin code h.this presumption applies unless the beneficiary is a minor or an incompetent lacking an appointed guardian.c see also.admin code i.
statutory construction 
if possible,we construe a statute in a manner that renders it constitutional and gives effect to the legislature intent.see quick city of austin,liberty mut.ins.garrison contractors.we presume that the legislature intended for the law to comply with the united states and texas constitutions,to achieve a just and reasonable result,and to advance a public rather than a private interest.gov t code spence fenchler.nevertheless,the legislature may not authorize an action that our constitution prohibits.see maher lasater,travelers ins.marshall.the burden is on the party attacking the statute to show that it is unconstitutional.see texas pub.auth.mattox.
in an constitutional challenge,we must evaluate the statute as it operates in practice against the particular plaintiff.see texas workers comp.comm garcia.in construing the statute and its effect,we consider several factors,including the statute purpose the circumstances of the statute enactment the legislative history or former statutory provisions,including laws on the same or similar subjects a particular construction consequences administrative construction of the statute and the title,preamble and emergency provision.gov t code ken petroleum questor drilling.
iii.custodial escheat 
the risk pool argues that labor code sections a and c are unconstitutional.it contends the challenged provisions are not analogous to a statute,because the state acquires permanent control over the unclaimed benefits and does not have to return the benefits to rightful claimants whenever they appear.moreover,the risk pool asserts,the challenged provisions do not require that the twcc publish notice to potential claimants that the state has assumed temporary custody over the benefits.
the twcc,on the other hand,argues that the challenged provisions operate like certain insurance code provisions that,in requiring the state to remit unclaimed benefits to rightful claimants,operate as statutes.the twcc asserts that labor code sections a and c give the state temporary custody,not absolute title,over unclaimed benefits until beneficiaries try to recover those benefits.therefore,the twcc argues,these provisions do not violate the texas constitution.
applicable law 
escheat is a procedure by which a sovereign state acquires title to abandoned property if no rightful owner appears after a specified time period.anderson bank luckett.escheat statutes can be either absolute or custodial.see comment,escheat in texas a current look at the intangible issue,sw.under statutes,the state acquires title to property through operation of law or a judicial proceeding.see ellis state,operation of law.b judicial proceeding.in contrast,statutes give the state only temporary custody over personal property until the state identifies a true owner.see travelers express minnesota,txo prod.oklahoma.comm n.escheat statutes,whether absolute or custodial,are constitutional if they give potential claimants notice after the state acquires the funds and an administrative and judicial hearing to adjudicate claims.see connecticut mut.life ins.moore.a state must also use reasonable diligence to discover the potential claimants to the property.see robinson state,paso,writ dism.
the court of appeals concluded that labor code sections a and c are constitutional because they permit the state to take custody of unclaimed property through an custodial taking procedure.at.the court of appeals determined that the challenged provisions are analogous to article of the insurance code,which,the court of appeals recognized,operates as a true statute.at.we disagree with this analysis.
article of the insurance code does have characteristics.this provision requires the state to assume custody over unclaimed funds for future eligible claimants benefits,and it contains detailed notice provisions.see.however,labor code sections and do not share these characteristics.these provisions underlying purpose is not for the state to return unclaimed or abandoned property to any rightful claimant at any time,as a true statute requires.see travelers express.at.instead,these provisions purpose is to provide a means for financing the fund so that lifetime benefits to workers with multiple injuries are available but individual employers do not have to bear this cost.additionally,unlike a statute that requires the state to maintain custody for an eventual rightful owner,the labor code presumes that no legal beneficiaries of the death benefits exist after one year.compare travelers express.at,with.c,and industrial accident bd.texas employers ins.ass n.for all practical purposes,the state acquires title to unclaimed death benefits after one year and is not a temporary custodian for a future eligible claimant.
accordingly,we conclude that the challenged provisions are not analogous to a statute.therefore,we disagree with the court of appeals conclusion that the provisions are constitutional on this ground.
iv.article iii,section a 
the risk pool argues that labor code sections a and c require it to grant public money to the fund,which is an individual,association,or corporation.therefore,the risk pool contends,the provisions violate article iii,section a of our constitution.furthermore,the risk pool contends that the challenged provisions also violate this section because the fund is not required to pay the risk pool member cities the same benefits as the cities must contribute to the fund.see city of tyler texas employers ins.ass n.comm app,judgm t adopted.the risk pool asserts that the fund is constitutional only if the public money is spent for the benefit of the specific locality from which the funds originated.
in response,the twcc argues that the fund is a special account and not an individual,association,or corporation within section a meaning.see martinez second injury fund.furthermore,the twcc argues that the risk pool contributions to the fund are not gratuitous grants of public money,because the risk pool member cities receive a return benefit whenever their employees qualify for benefits from the fund.
applicable law 
article iii,section a provides 
t he legislature shall have no power to authorize any county,city,town or other political corporation or subdivision of the state to lend its credit or to grant public money or thing of value in aid of,or to any individual,association or corporation whatsoever 
const.art.iii,a.
we have held that section a prohibiting the legislature from authorizing a political subdivision to grant public money means that the legislature can not require gratuitous payments to individuals,associations,or corporations.see,edgewood indep.sch.dist.meno,edgewood iv bexar county hosp.dist.crosby,davis city of lubbock,byrd city of dallas.a political subdivision paying public money is not gratuitous if the political subdivision receives return consideration.key commissioners of marion county,no writ.
moreover,we have determined that section a does not prohibit payments to individuals,corporations,or associations so long as the statute requiring such payments serves a legitimate public purpose and affords a clear public benefit received in return.see edgewood iv,at bullock calvert,citing davis city of lubbock,brazos river auth.carr,byrd,at.a test determines if a statute accomplishes a public purpose consistent with section a.specifically,the legislature must ensure that the statute predominant purpose is to accomplish a public purpose,not to benefit private parties retain public control over the funds to ensure that the public purpose is accomplished and to protect the public investment and ensure that the political subdivision receives a return benefit.see atkinson city of dallas,writ ref gillham city of dallas,writ ref.see generally mike willatt,constitutional restrictions on use of public money and public credit.
under article iii,section a,the legislature may not authorize a county,city,town or political subdivision of the state to lend credit or grant public funds.by its terms,section a scope includes each risk pool member city,and the twcc does not dispute that risk pool itself qualifies as a political subdivision within section a meaning.
for labor code sections a and c to violate section a,these provisions must require the risk pool to grant public money to individuals,associations,or corporations.we agree with the twcc that neither the fund nor the twcc qualify as an individual,association or corporation under section a.the fund is not an association it is an account in the state treasury.see martinez,at.and,while section a prohibits granting public money to private individuals or commercial enterprises,it does not prohibit transfers to a state agency like the twcc.see edgewood iv,at citing byrd,at.
although the fund and twcc are not individuals,associations,or corporations,the challenged provisions require the risk pool to indirectly transfer public funds to individuals.specifically,the risk pool must transfer unclaimed death benefits to the fund,which then pays lifetime benefits to eligible individuals.the money does not flow to a general account,and the state comptroller does not administer the account or treat these funds as general revenue.rather,the twcc executive director appoints the fund administrator.c.thus,under this scheme,the fund is a conduit through which the risk pool transfers public funds to claimants.accordingly,we conclude that sections a and c require the risk pool to pay public money to individuals within section a meaning.
however,we can not conclude that the challenged provisions require the risk pool to gratuitously transfer public funds as section a prohibits.because the risk pool receives consideration for its unclaimed death benefits payments to the fund,that consideration renders the provisions constitutional because the payments are nongratuitous.see edgewood iv,at.the risk pool reads key commissioners court of marion county to require that its member cities receive equal consideration for the unclaimed death benefits they pay to the fund.at.but key requires only consideration to render a political subdivision paying public funds constitutional.at.here,we conclude the risk pool receives enough consideration for its member cities paying unclaimed death benefits to the fund.specifically,the twcc statutory obligation to pay lifetime benefits from the fund to any risk pool member city employee who suffers a subsequent injury and qualifies for these benefits is consideration.consequently,the risk pool member cities unclaimed death benefits payments to the fund are not gratuitous.
additionally,paying unclaimed death benefits to the fund accomplishes a legitimate public purpose.see edgewood iv,at bullock,at.in determining that the fund accomplishes a legitimate public purpose,we apply the test.see atkinson,at gillham,at.see generally willatt.at.first,the challenged provisions predominant purpose is to provide lifetime workers compensation benefits for texas employees with subsequent compensable injuries.thus,employers would not have to pay higher workers compensation rates for hiring disabled employees and would not be discouraged from hiring such employees.miears,at.second,the twcc retains exclusive control over the unclaimed death benefits to fulfill the fund objectives.see.third,as we already concluded,the risk pool member cities receive a direct reciprocal benefit from the fund.
paying unclaimed death benefits to the fund also provides a clear public benefit.see edgewood iv,at bullock,at.the fund ensures that employers do not deny employment to individuals with preexisting injuries because they fear that later injuries will expose them to greater liability.see miears,at.the expanding texas workforce,placing disabled workers on a more equal plane as compared to other workers,and lowering workers compensation the public as a whole,and not merely a particular private interest.therefore,we conclude that labor code sections a and c accomplish a legitimate public purpose with a clear public benefit received in return.
we disagree with the risk pool argument that the fund is analogous to mutual assessable insurance programs that the attorney general has opined,and a texas court has held,to be unconstitutional under section a.see city of tyler,at op.no.in ag opinion,the attorney general discussed whether proposed legislation creating an association that would pay workers compensation claims for political subdivisions was constitutional.op.no.at.because political subdivisions membership would be mandatory,and the association would derive its funding through assessments imposed on its members,the attorney general concluded that the proposed association would violate section a.op.no.at.
in reaching this conclusion,the attorney general noted that the proposed association would operate like a mutual assessable insurance program in which subscribers contribute payments for all subscribers losses and expenses.op.no.at.such programs do not calculate payments based on each subscriber actual expense and loss experience,because each subscriber acts as both an insured and insurer for the other subscribers.op.no.at.the attorney general suggested that if the proposed association calculated payments based on the subscribers actual claims history,the association would have characteristics and,therefore,would be constitutional under section a.op.no.at.
in city of tyler,the court considered whether a statute that authorized public employers to subscribe to the texas employers insurance association was constitutional.at.the court concluded that the teia was a mutual assessable insurance program,because every teia subscriber had to pay a proportionate part of any assessment the teia levied to finance all the subscribers losses and expenses.city of tyler,at.the court held that this scheme was unconstitutional as applied to political subdivisions because their obligation to pay assessments to cover the teia losses required them to lend their credit within section a meaning.city of tyler,at.moreover,the court held that the teia unconstitutionally required political subdivisions to become stockholders in a corporation,association,or company,which section a also prohibits.city of tyler,at.
both ag opinion dm and city of tyler determined that the insurance programs in those cases operated as mutual assessable insurance programs.essentially,these programs require their subscribers to pay assessments to the association to insure other subscribers losses,while at the same time,the subscribers can make claims against the association funds for their own losses.see also.hutchins mut.ins.hazen,couch on insurance,at.each subscriber is charged the same assessment for insurance coverage thus,each subscriber policy is to some extent a coverage contract with every other subscriber.see johnson central mut.ins.ass n.moreover,each subscriber participates equally in the association profits and losses.see ohio farmers indem.commissioner,cir equitable life assurance soc.bowers,cir.
here,unlike mutual assessable insurance programs,the fund is an account under the twcc control financed with unclaimed death benefits.the fund does not impose assessments on the risk pool member cities.op.no.at.the member cities do not pay a proportional share of the fund losses and expenses,and they do not have to make equal payments to the fund under an insurance policy.city of tyler,at.indeed,if a member city has no unclaimed death benefits in a particular year,it contributes no money whatsoever to the fund.moreover,the fund is not a company or association and does not enroll policyholders.ohio farmers,at equitable life,at.in fact,the fund has no members at all.therefore,we conclude that the fund is not an unconstitutional mutual assessable insurance program.
we conclude that the challenged provisions do not require the risk pool to gratuitously grant public money,because the risk pool member cities receive consideration from the fund,and the provisions serve a legitimate public purpose with a clear public benefit.see edgewood iv,at.accordingly,we hold that labor code sections a and c,as applied to the risk pool,do not violate article iii,section a.
article viii,section 
the risk pool argues that labor code sections a and c violate the texas constitution,article viii,section,because the provisions effectively levy a ad valorem tax on this case unclaimed death benefits.the risk pool also argues that the challenged provisions unconstitutionally authorize the state to recapture local tax dollars and redistribute them statewide.
the twcc,on the other hand,contends that the payments to the fund are not taxes at all.thus,the twcc argues,the challenged provisions do not authorize the state to levy ad valorem taxes within section meaning.moreover,the twcc contends that the challenged provisions do not require the state to unconstitutionally recapture local ad valorem tax revenues for statewide use.
applicable law 
the texas constitution generally authorizes taxes on property in proportion to the property value.const.art.viii,b.however,our constitution prohibits the state from levying an ad valorem tax on any property within the state.const.art.viii.the legislature defines a state tax as a tax,fee,assessment,charge,or other amount that the comptroller is authorized to administer.tax code see also conlen grain mercantile,texas grain sorghum producers,a tax is a burden or charge imposed by the legislative power of the state upon persons or property to raise money for public purposes.the risk pool alleges that the twcc,through the subsequent injury fund,imposes a state tax.
moreover,an ad valorem tax is a tax on property at a certain rate based on the property value.see generally d state local taxation.an ad valorem tax is a prohibited tax under section when the state directly imposes it,or when a political subdivision imposes it but the state indirectly controls the tax revenues levy,assessment,and disbursement so that the political subdivision lacks any meaningful discretion over these factors.see branch indep.sch.dist.edgewood indep.sch,edgewood iii.
we agree with the risk pool argument that the unclaimed death benefits are property under article viii,section.the tax code defines property as any matter or thing capable of private ownership.tax code.additionally,intangible personal property means a claim,right,or interest that has value but can not be measured or perceived by the senses and includes an insurance policy,annuity,or pension.tax code.here,the unclaimed death benefits are capable of private ownership,because there may be beneficiaries who can claim title to the funds.see.tax code.furthermore,the tax code expressly includes an insurance policy,annuity or pension as intangible personal property.tax code see also brown lee.workers compensation death benefits are analogous to proceeds,because an employee beneficiaries receive those benefits upon an employee compensable death.compare,with supreme council of am.legion of honor larmour,life insurance beneficiaries receive money upon the destruction or injury of something in which the assured has an interest.therefore,the unclaimed death benefits are property within section meaning.
however,the challenged provisions are not a tax on the unclaimed death benefits.first,the challenged provisions are not a state tax as the tax code defines that term,because they do not authorize the comptroller to impose a fee,assessment,or charge.tax code.second,the challenged provisions do not mandate that the risk pool or its member cities collect charges from to generate revenue.see conlen grain,at holding that the statute at issue imposed a tax because it mandated that grain sorghum processors collect fees from producers for every ton of grain produced.rather,the challenged provisions only transfer unclaimed benefits that the risk pool member cities have already committed to paying workers compensation claims.see.
finally,the challenged provisions do not permit the state to indirectly control the levy,assessment,and disbursement of the risk pool member cities tax revenues.edgewood iii,at.indeed,the challenged provisions do not enable the state to participate in any way in the cities local taxing decisions.therefore,we conclude that the state does not impose a tax to subsidize the fund.
because we conclude that the challenged provisions do not authorize a tax,article viii,section is not implicated.consequently,we hold that the challenged provisions,as applied to the risk pool,do not violate article viii,section.
vi.conclusion 
we hold that labor code sections a and c,and the twcc regulations implementing these provisions,are not analogous to statutes.we further hold that these provisions,as applied to the risk pool,do not violate article iii,section a,or article viii,section of the texas constitution.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
this is a suit by the texas municipal league intergovernmental risk pool,which is comprised of approximately cities and other political subdivisions that have chosen to collectively to provide workers compensation insurance,against the texas workers compensation commission and the subsequent injury fund.the municipal risk pool contends that two sections of the texas labor code and certain administrative rules that implement those code sections are unconstitutional as applied to political subdivisions.the challenged code provisions deal with the payment of death benefits when there is no legal beneficiary,a claim for death benefits is not timely made,or all legal beneficiaries cease to be eligible before weeks of benefits have been paid.the code provisions require all workers compensation insurance carriers,including the municipal risk pool,to pay these death benefits to the workers compensation commission for deposit into the subsequent injury fund the fund then distributes these funds to workers across the state who receive a second injury that,combined with the effects of a prior injury,entitles the employee to lifetime benefits and to compensate insurance carriers that were required by the commission to pay benefits when it is later determined that those benefits were not owed in the absence of these code provisions,insurance carriers,including the municipal risk pool,would retain the funds when there is no legal beneficiary to receive death benefits.
the municipal risk pool contends,and the trial court held,that these code provisions violate article iii,section a of the texas constitution as applied to political subdivisions.this section of the constitution provides in relevant part 
t he legislature shall have no power to authorize any county,city,town or other political corporation or subdivision of the state to lend its credit or to grant public money or thing of value in aid of,or to any individual,association or corporation whatsoever,or to become a stockholder in such corporation,association or company.however,this section does not prohibit the use of public funds or credit for the payment of premiums on nonassessable property and casualty,life,health,or accident insurance policies and annuity contracts issued by a mutual insurance company authorized to do business in this state 
the court of appeals reversed the trial court,and the court today affirms that judgment,although on different grounds.because i agree with the trial court that the challenged code provisions and administrative regulations violate article iii,section a,i respectfully dissent.the payment of the death benefits to the commission is not actuarially based.the fact that payments could be made from the subsequent injury fund to employees of a political subdivision does not save the current scheme.this court has held repeatedly that article iii,section a prohibits the legislature from directing a political subdivision to make any payment to an individual or private corporation unless that governmental entity has an independent legal obligation to make that payment.the code sections at issue in this case require political subdivisions of the state to grant public money to individuals workers for injuries for which the political subdivision has no responsibility or liability,and the code requires political subdivisions to compensate private corporations insurance carriers for losses that have no relation whatsoever to the political subdivisions.even though the subsequent injury fund serves legitimate needs and indirectly benefits the public,article iii,section prohibits the legislature from directing political subdivisions to contribute to that fund.
this case is governed by the decision in city of tyler texas employers insurance association the question in that case was whether a city could become a subscriber under the former workmen compensation act.the answer was that it could not because under that act,an employee would be compensated for an injury even though there was no negligence or other culpability on the part of the government employer.the court in city of tyler explained that the purpose of article iii,section of the texas constitution is to prevent the gratuitous appropriation of public money or property.it continued,a grant in aid of or to any individual,association,or corporation whatsoever is not one of these purposes,but is expressly forbidden.it did not matter that the premiums a city paid would also cover injuries caused by its own negligence for which it would be legally liable under the common law or statutes.the fact that under the act,employees would also be compensated for injuries for which a city had no legal liability was enough to render participation by a city in the workmen compensation scheme unconstitutional 
when the workmen compensation law is analyzed and fully understood,it is clear that to permit a municipal corporation to become a subscriber to the insurance association therein provided authorizes it to grant public money by way of premiums for insurance in aid of its employés to whom it is under no legal liability to pay.as already pointed out,the act contemplates compensation in the absence of any legal liability other than the acceptance of the plan.cities and towns have no power to appropriate the tax money of its citizens to such a purpo
