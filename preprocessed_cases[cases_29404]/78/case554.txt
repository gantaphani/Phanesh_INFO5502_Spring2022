shelly gee gee petitions this court by a writ of review challenging the decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab.the wcab weighed the relevant medical evidence without applying the treating physician presumption of correctness under labor code section because the parties failed to raise the presumption as an issue by the time of trial.we find the presumption operative as a matter of law whenever the underlying facts meet the presumption conditions.we therefore conclude the wcab erred by not applying the presumption and remand the case for reconsideration.
factual and procedural history 
gee worked as a supermarket clerk for lucky stores,lucky when she filed three separate workers compensation claims alleging injuries to her head,neck,shoulders,wrists,and upper extremities.gee claims included a cumulative injury through november,a specific injury on february,and a cumulative injury through february,
gee initially sought treatment for her upper extremity and wrist injuries with sharon nichols in december.nichols diagnosed gee with right carpal tunnel syndrome and declared her permanent and stationary on january.however,gee condition deteriorated over the next month and nichols recommended she visit a workers compensation qualified medical evaluator qme to determine whether her new symptoms were industrially related.
following the procedures established for injured workers unrepresented by counsel,gee selected patrick rhoades,as her qme from a panel of three physicians offered by the industrial medical council imc,subd.d,subd.b.rhoades april,qme report concluded gee was not yet permanent and stationary and that she required additional medical attention.over the next two years,gee continued treatment with rhoades and she apparently designated him as her treating physician.
gee subsequently retained counsel to represent her in her disability claims.in november,at lucky request,a worker compensation administrative law judge wcj ordered gee to attend a medical examination with graham bray.after examining gee and reviewing her medical records,bray prepared a february,qme report concluding gee suffered a cumulative trauma injury to her wrists through november,and a second mild cumulative trauma injury to her neck and shoulders through february.bray found no indication gee sustained a specific february,injury.
the parties were unable to resolve gee disability claims on their own therefore,in june and august,lucky filed declarations of readiness to proceed with the wcab requesting findings regarding gee level of permanent disability,future medical treatment,apportionment,and whether her headaches arose out of and in the course of employment.the declarations did not list as an issue the treating physician presumption of correctness under section.
in september,the wcj conducted a mandatory settlement conference msc where the parties set forth the relevant issues in a pretrial conference statement.the statement did not refer to the treating physician presumption,but indicated the primary treating physician is disputed.applicant claims rhoades.lucky also objected to admitting rhoades medical reports,claiming he inappropriately treated gee after first serving as her qme.
the matter proceeded to trial in november.according to the wcj,the parties never referred to the treating physician presumption or to section.however,the wcj summary of trial evidence again states the t he identity of the primary treating physician is disputed,applicant claiming rhoades.at the conclusion of trial,the wcj allowed the parties to submit posttrial briefs addressing whether rhoades could legally perform the duties of both a qme and a primary treating physician and whether his medical reports constituted substantial evidence.
in march,the wcj found gee properly exercised her right to select rhoades as her primary treating physician,despite his former designation as her qme.without referring to the treating physician presumption of correctness,the wcj concluded lucky qme,bray,was more credible,reasonable,and persuasive than rhoades.accordingly,the wcj adopted bray conclusion that gee only suffered two cumulative injuries to her wrists,neck,and shoulders that her headaches were non industrial and that she became permanent and stationary on may.the wcj awarded gee compensation and penalties related to the two cumulative injuries and nothing for her alleged specific injury.
gee petitioned the wcab for reconsideration because the wcj failed to apply the treating physician presumption of correctness to rhoades medical conclusions.the wcj explained in a report and recommendation to the wcab that he did not apply the presumption because section had not been raised as an express issue either at the msc or at trial,but suggested he might have reached different findings of fact had he applied the presumption.the wcab adopted the wcj reasoning as its own and denied reconsideration.
discussion 
in reviewing an order,decision,or award of the wcab,an appellate court must determine whether,in view of the entire record,substantial evidence supports the wcab findings.braewood convalescent hospital workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.this court will not accept the wcab factual findings if determined to be unreasonable,illogical,improbable,or inequitable when viewed in light of the overall statutory scheme.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.furthermore,this court is not bound by the wcab conclusions on questions of law.where the award rests on an erroneous interpretation of law it will be annulled.barns workers comp.appeals bd.d.questions of statutory interpretation are,of course,for this court to decide.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.
prior to,disability claims were determined solely by a preponderance of the evidence.in july,the legislature enacted major reforms to the workers compensation system.among the changes was legislation regarding the process of evaluations and the determination of permanent disability and other medical issues.minniear san antonio community college dist,petn.for reconsideration and writ den.cal.comp.cases.section,which created a presumption of correctness applicable to the medical diagnosis of the employee treating physician,provides 
in cases where an additional comprehensive medical evaluation is obtained under section or disputes concerning the employee level of disability or permanent and stationary status,the findings of the treating physician are presumed to be correct.this presumption is rebuttable and may be controverted by a preponderance of medical opinion indicating an sic different level of impairment.however,this presumption shall not apply where both parties select qualified medical examiners.
on september,one day after the msc but nearly two months before trial,the wcab en banc decision in davis interim healthcare cal.comp.cases,wl no writ filed addressed the timing of raising the treating physician presumption under section.in davis,a wcj refused to apply the treating physician presumption raised for the first time at trial.id.at.on reconsideration,the injured employee argued she timely raised the presumption,and moreover,that as a statutory provision,the presumption need never be raised as a separate issue.id.at.the wcab found the presumption may be properly raised up to the time of trial and remanded the matter to the wcj to reconsider the issue in light of the presumption.id.at.the wcab also concluded that in the interest of judicial economy,the section presumption must be raised as a separate issue.id.at.the wcab found its conclusion consistent with the purpose of section d,that issues be set forth and resolved as expeditiously as possible.ibid.
according to the wcab,gee mentioned the treating physician presumption only as a brief reference in her posttrial brief and did not set forth the presumption as a separate issue until petitioning for reconsideration.the wcab concluded that under davis,the treating physician presumption did not apply to rhoades medical diagnosis because gee untimely raised the presumption as a separate issue.however,we disagree with the davis decision and therefore reject
