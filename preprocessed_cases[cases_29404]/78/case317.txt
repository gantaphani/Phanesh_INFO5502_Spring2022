gerald shane stuart appeals from the district court dismissal of his negligence claim against defendant appellee colorado interstate gas company cig.the district court jurisdiction was based on.we have jurisdiction under and we affirm.
background 
cig,a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in colorado,owns property in weld county,colorado,used for the production and development of natural gas.cig contracted with northwinds of wyoming,northwinds,a construction company based in wyoming,to install pulsation bottles on natural gas pipelines at the weld county facility the facility.although a wyoming resident,stuart went directly to the facility in colorado and sought employment.the project superintendent,a northwinds employee,hired stuart just for the work to be performed at the facility in colorado,but northwinds issued stuart paychecks from its office in wyoming.the contract with cig required northwinds to carry workers compensation insurance for all of its employees.as part of this contractual requirement,northwinds named cig as an insured on its workers compensation policy which covered all of its employees,including stuart.
an explosion occurred at the facility,resulting in second and third degree burns to stuart,as well as a broken hip and pelvis.after applying for and receiving workers compensation benefits from wyoming,stuart filed this cause of action,alleging negligence and gross negligence on the part of cig.
cig responded with a motion to dismiss stuart claim under.b,providing affidavits to support its argument that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain stuart complaint.cig argued that colorado law applied in this case,under which cig qualified as a statutory employer.under colorado law,the exclusive remedy against statutory employers is workers compensation insurance.see.stuart argued that wyoming law applied under which there exists no exclusive workers compensation remedy to a third party such as cig.see.stat.ann.a michie.the district court granted cig motion,determining that colorado law applied and,as a result,that cig was immune from the action brought by stuart.stuart.interstate gas,d.
appropriateness of b dismissal and standard of review 
the district court dismissed the case under rule b,concluding that the immunity afforded cig under the colorado workers compensation act colorado act removed the court power to hear the case.generally,a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction when the minimal requirements of diversity are met,diversity of citizenship and a good faith claim for the requisite amount in controversy.see paul mercury indem.red cab.the essence of diversity jurisdiction,however,is that a federal court enforces state law and state policy.angel bullington.federal court sitting in diversity case could not grant deficiency judgment barred by north carolina statute.thus,there are cases where,even if diversity of citizenship exists,a federal court will not take jurisdiction unless the plaintiff has asserted a claim cognizable in the state courts.charles alan wright,arthur miller edward cooper,federal practice and procedure,at ed see also proctor schwartz,rollins,cir finding that south carolina statute deprived federal court of jurisdiction.in this case,both parties concede that if colorado exclusive remedy provision applies,stuart has no cause of action.aplt.br.at aplee.br.at.as such,the district court properly treated the issue as one falling under the province of a b dismissal,rather than a dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see.b.
rule b motions generally take one of two forms.first,a moving party may make a facial attack on the complaint allegations as to the existence of subject matter jurisdiction.holt united states,cir internal citation omitted.in reviewing a facial attack,the district court must accept the allegations in the complaint as true.id.second,a party may go beyond allegations contained in the complaint and challenge the facts upon which subject matter jurisdiction is based.id.at.cig chose the second form of attack,offering affidavits in support of its factual attack to subject matter jurisdiction.stuarte,d at.in reviewing a factual attack,a court has wide discretion to allow affidavits,other documents,and a limited evidentiary hearing to resolve disputed jurisdictional facts.holt,at.in the course of a factual attack under rule b,a court reference to evidence outside the pleadings does not convert the motion into a rule motion.id.we review de novo the district court dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to rule b,and review findings of jurisdictional facts for clear error.id.
discussion 
the primary issue in this case is the proper choice of applicable law.a federal court sitting in diversity must apply the choice of law rules of the forum in which it sits.klaxon stentor.although stuart cause of action is facially one sounding in tort,the fact that his injuries implicate the workers compensation acts of two different states changes the nature of the choice of law decision.we are thus presented with the problem of discerning if a wyoming court would apply wyoming law,colorado law,or perhaps a combination of the two.see garcia am.airlines,cir stating that more than one workers compensation statute can apply to a single injury,so long as each state has a interest in the case citing arthur larson,workmen compensation law,at.
extraterritorial application of the wyoming act 
the district court rested its decision that the colorado act applied in this case,and therefore its exclusive remedy provision,largely on its analysis of of the wyoming workers compensation act the wyoming act.see stuart,d at.section,in pertinent part,provides 
a the wyoming act applies to all injuries and deaths occurring in wyoming if the employment is principally localized in wyoming and to all injuries and deaths occurring outside of wyoming under the following conditions 
i the employment is principally localized in wyoming 
b for purposes of this section,employment is principally localized where 
i the employer has a principal place of business within the state established for legitimate purposes and 
ii the employee regularly works at or from that place of business.
stat.ann.michie.finding that stuart was hired in colorado and worked only in that state,the district court concluded that stuart employment with northwinds did not qualify as principally localized.stuart,d at.as a result,the district court determined that any conflict between the colorado act and the wyoming act was illusory,because evince d a strong legislative presumption against extraterritoriality as to the facts of this case.id.stuart challenges the district court application of the facts of this case to the statute in question,while,of course,cig asserts the district court properly interpreted the statute.
although there may be a question as to whether the wyoming legislature intended to determine the applicability of the wyoming act to a such as cig,see.sess.laws ch,amending terminology of relating to nonresident employers,it does express clearly the extraterritorial reach of the wyoming act.the plain language of demonstrates that the wyoming act reaches those claims where either the parties effected the employment contract in wyoming,see.stat.ann.a ii,iii michie,or where the employment itself is principally localized in wyoming.see id.a i.in this case,the parties effected the employment contract in colorado,so the only question is whether stuart employment was principally localized in wyoming.to make that determination,we look to the definition e mployment is principally localized where i the employer has a principal place of business within the state established for legitimate business purposes and ii the employee regularly works at or from that place of business.id.b emphasis added.
stuart asserts that because northwinds issued his paychecks and performed other administrative tasks related to his employment from its wyoming office,and further,because northwinds has no other place of business,he must have worked at or from northwinds wyoming office.in su
