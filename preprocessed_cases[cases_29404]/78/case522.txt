petitioner,martin gaytan,a gardener for respondent,los angeles unified school district lausd,injured his left foot during work and was referred for treatment to david heskiaoff,heskiaoff released gaytan back to work without restrictions,and from continuing medical care.gaytan objected pursuant to labor code sections and gaytan subsequently obtained a comprehensive medical evaluation from dennis ainbinder,as a qualified medical evaluator.ainbinder recommended treatment and gaytan selected ainbinder as the new primary treating physician 
after ainbinder released gaytan from care,the parties disputed treatment,disability,and whether heskiaoff or ainbinder was the primary treating physician entitled to the rebuttable presumption of correctness under section the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj determined that heskiaoff remained the primary treating physician with the presumption,and denied the treatment and disability recommended by ainbinder.the wcj also concluded that heskiaoff opinion was not rebutted because the report by ainbinder as qualified medical evaluator was inadmissible for the failure to review medical records,and ainbinder opinion was not substantial evidence.gaytan petitioned for reconsideration and the workers compensation appeals board wcab agreed that medical records can be addressed in supplemental reports,and ainbinder report as qualified medical evaluator was admissible.however,the wcab affirmed the decision because the primary treating physician does not change until the dispute is decided by the wcj under title,section,subdivision b 
gaytan petitions for writ of review and contends that he complied with sections and,which resolves the dispute under title,section,subdivision b,and he was entitled to select ainbinder as the primary treating physician with the presumption.even if the presumption remained with heskiaoff,gaytan argues further,the wcab should have remanded the matter for consideration of ainbinder newly admitted report.ainbinder opinion as a whole is substantial evidence,unlike the the opinion of heskiaoff which was rebutted.
lausd answers that gaytan selection of ainbinder as the primary treating physician was improper and waived.lausd also alleges that heskiaoff opinion is substantial evidence and presumed correct,and is not rebutted by the inconsistent opinion of ainbinder.
we agree with gaytan that after compliance with sections and,an injured worker may obtain valid treatment from the qualified medical evaluator as the newly selected primary treating physician.however,we also agree with the wcab that if treatment or the selection is disputed,the dispute must be resolved under title,section,subdivision b,in order to validate the treatment and apply the presumption under section to the opinion of the alleged newly selected primary treating physician.since we further conclude that the wcj findings regarding these issues were critical in this case,consistent with due process the matter should have been remanded for the wcj to consider ainbinder newly admitted report,his opinion as a whole and the entire record.accordingly,the wcab decision is annulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
martin gaytan,a gardener for lausd,injured his left foot when he tripped over a sprinkler at work on september.gaytan also alleges injury to the left ankle,but when he completed a workers compensation claim form only the left big toe was indicated.
lausd referred gaytan for treatment to southern california medical group.the first medical report indicated pain and tenderness from the left great toe to the left ankle,but no swelling or bruise.gaytan was provided medication and treatment,and taken off work.in an interim report,gaytan was stated to have full range of motion in the left ankle,with mild pain and no swelling.
on or about november,gaytan was referred to orthopedist david heskiaoff,heskiaoff diagnosed left foot sprain,left great toe contusion and plantar fascitis.gaytan was released to regular work,with recommendation of continued physical therapy,a left shoe insert and medication.
heskiaoff reexamined gaytan on december.in a report characterized as the final evaluation by the primary treating physician,gaytan was stated to be permanent and stationary the sprain,contusion and plantar fascitis being resolved,with no work restrictions.heskiaoff further recommended that,if he has a of symptoms,the use of medication,such as clinoril,is all that is prescribed for him.
meanwhile,gaytan retained counsel and objected to the conclusions of the treating physicians under sections and in a letter dated december.gaytan letter also offered several physicians as an agreed medical examiner to resolve the medical issues.gaytan advised there would be an evaluation by a qualified medical evaluator if there was no response within days.
apparently,lausd did not respond and in a letter dated february,gaytan advised of an examination scheduled with dennis ainbinder.in another letter,gaytan provided notice that he was selecting ainbinder as the primary treating doctor under section 
ainbinder issued a first report indicating the initial examination or treatment date was february.an ankle sprain was diagnosed,medication,therapy,and an mri were recommended,and gaytan was stated to be temporarily disabled from work.
on february,gaytan began physical therapy with steven danchik.the record indicates several treatments were paid by lausd.gaytan also received state disability benefits beginning on february.
in a report dated february,ainbinder characterized his role as a qualified medical evaluator.ainbinder described gaytan duties and treatment,and noted his complaints increased after returning to work.ainbinder diagnosed a sprained left ankle,prescribed medication,and recommended an mri and conservative treatment.ainbinder also reported work restrictions of no very heavy lifting and prolonged standing,walking,squatting,and ascending and descending stairs,although gaytan could continue working.ainbinder cautioned that he had not received or reviewed medical records,and his conclusions could change.ainbinder signed the report on march.
gaytan was reevaluated by heskiaoff on march,whose report referred to the examination as a comprehensive orthopedic evaluation.gaytan informed heskiaoff that his complaints had increased after working in the cold and rain,for which he received treatment and was placed on temporary disability by ainbinder.heskiaoff diagnosis was history of left foot plantar fascitis,a new shoe insert was recommended,and the discussion in the report concluded with,it is my opinion that gaytan did not suffer any new injury to his left foot in february of.the treatments he has been provided should be under the heading of the prior september,injury.heskiaoff also summarized records from southern california medical group in the report.
in a letter dated april,gaytan again gave notice that ainbinder was selected as the primary treating doctor.in a separate letter,gaytan advised there was an appointment scheduled for april.
ainbinder reported that he had originally examined gaytan as a qualified medical evaluator,and was now designated as the primary treating physician.ainbinder indicated gaytan condition had worsened,treatment and temporary disability should continue,and an mri was necessary.
ainbinder subsequently declared gaytan permanent and stationary in a report dated june.ainbinder noted that the mri revealed a sprain of the anterior talofibular ligament as well as a mild degree of fluid in the left ankle joint.in addition,ainbinder summarized prior medical records.ainbinder diagnosis remained a sprained left ankle,and in regards to permanent disability the report stated that,i would not change any of my work restrictions from that recommended in my report of february.
the parties proceeded to trial and the issues included temporary disability from february,through june,permanent disability,whether heskiaoff was the primary treating physician entitled to the presumption under section,treatment recommended by ainbinder and admissibility of his february,report.
gaytan testified that his pain continued and worsened after he returned to work and was released by heskiaoff.gaytan explained that he was told by lausd to wait days for treatment because he had been released.he then began receiving treatment through ainbinder,and state disability.gaytan claimed that after treatment with ainbinder and returning to work,he still had disability regarding his left foot,ankle,and great toe.
the wcj determined that heskiaoff continued as the primary treating physician and gaytan sustained industrial injury to the left foot,but not the ankle.the wcj denied the treatment recommended by ainbinder,and the temporary and permanent disability claimed.in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained that,in his report dated december,heskiaoff found applicant permanent and stationary without the present need for further medical treatment.ainbinder who saw applicant thereafter,was thus precluded from becoming the primary treating physician under the tenet case.see hospital medical center workers comp.appeals bd.th,d tenet.
in tenet,the employee sustained industrial injury to the knee,and two knee surgeries were performed by the primary treating physician.subsequently,the primary treating physician issued a permanent and stationary report without work restrictions.the report also indicated that the employee was released to home exercise and from further visits,with provision for future medical care when the need arose.the employee,who was unrepresented,objected and was provided with a panel pursuant to section.rather than select a qualified medical evaluator,the employee retained an attorney and began treatment with another physician five months later.the wcj and wcab concluded that the employee was not actually released from treatment and was entitled to change primary treating physicians.
the court of appeal agreed with the wcab that an injured worker has the right to change primary treating physicians until discharged.tenet,supra,th at,d.however,the court of appeal held that pursuant to title,section,subdivision b,the employee could not change primary treating physicians after discharge from ongoing treatment,even if future treatment is medically probable,without complying with the procedures set forth in section or.id.at,d.
the wcj also determined that the opinion of ainbinder did not rebut the presumption under section that heskiaoff was correct.the wcj found ainbinder february,report inadmissible because medical records had not been reviewed,and the june,report was dependent on the inadmissible report.
gaytan petitioned for reconsideration with the wcab.gaytan contended that he had complied with sections and,and tenet,when he was examined by ainbinder as a qualified medical evaluator.gaytan argued further that he was entitled to select ainbinder as the primary treating physician with the presumption,according to gee workers comp.appeals bd.th,d gee.
in gee,an unrepresented employee condition worsened after being found permanent and stationary by the primary treating physician,who recommended consultation with a qualified medical evaluator.the employee selected a qualified medical evaluator from a provided pursuant to sections and.the employee then designated the qualified medical evaluator,who recommended treatment,as the primary treating physician.the employee subsequently retained counsel and was examined by a qualified medical evaluator for the employer.at trial the parties disputed whether a qualified medical evaluator could properly become the primary treating physician,without specifically raising the presumption under section.
the wcj in gee concluded that the qualified medical evaluator could be properly selected as the primary treating physician,but the presumption was not raised at trial and the employer qualified medical evaluator was more persuasive and followed.the wcab affirmed based on davis interim healthcare davis presumption must be raised no later than trial,and added that the presumption never arose because both sides selected qualified medical evaluators.the court of appeal disagreed with the holding of davis and determined that the presumption under section arose when the operative facts were established by pleadings,stipulations,judicial notice or evidence.gee workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.in regards to the presumption being inapplicable under section because there were two qualified medical evaluators,the court of appeal noted that the official form sent to the employee advised of the right to treatment by the qualified medical evaluator,at,d.the court of appeal concluded that the presumption applied because selecting the qualified medical evaluator as the primary treating physician cancelled the former designation,and only the employer qualified medical evaluator remained.id.at,d.
gaytan also alleged in the petition for reconsideration that ainbinder february,report was admissible because prior medical records were summarized in a later report,which complies with section in addition,argued gaytan,ainbinder opinion rebutted the opinion of heskiaoff,which was not substantial evidence,because ainbinder addressed the medical records,mri and left ankle.
in the report on reconsideration,the wcj responded that gee did not control because the employee was unrepresented and the notice sent indicated the qualified medical evaluator could be chosen as the primary treating physician.even if gee is applicable,the wcj explained,the section presumption should not be applied to ainbinder because the february,report was inadmissible and the permanent disability remained unchanged after the medical records were reviewed.the wcj noted that heskiaoff reviewed prior medical records in a report dated august,however,the report was excluded from evidence for not being listed at the mandatory settlement conference regardless,heskiaoff conclusions are substantial evidence,explained the wcj,because the records from southern california medical group do not refer to the ankle which complaint arose only after ainbinder involvement,and there were no objective findings.
the wcab basically affirmed the wcj decision.the wcab agreed that tenet controlled because gaytan could not obtain a new primary treating physician entitled to the presumption until the issues that initiated the procedures under sections and were resolved by the wcj pursuant to title,section,subdivision b.the wcab distinguished gee,where the employer obtained a qualified medical evaluator after the change in primary treating physicians.and although the wcab admitted ainbinder report into evidence,because the lack of medical record review goes to weight rather than admissibility,the outcome was not affected since the presumption remained with heskiaoff until the wcj decided the issue.
gaytan petitions for writ of review.gaytan maintains that he complied with sections and and tenet,which satisfies title,section,subdivision b under gee,and ainbinder was validly selected as the primary treating physician entitled to the presumption.gaytan contends further that it was prejudicial error for the wcab to affirm without remanding for the wcj to consider ainbinder newly admitted report and his opinion as a whole.ainbinder whole opinion is substantial evidence and should be followed,unlike the opinion of heskiaoff which was rebutted,because ainbinder addressed the medical records,mri and ankle injury.
lausd answers that gaytan improperly selected ainbinder as the primary treating physician to gain the presumption under section.lausd argues that ainbinder was designated and acted as the primary treating physician when physical therapy began,which violated tenet.lausd claims that it never authorized or paid the therapy based on heskiaoff reports.lausd asserts further that gaytan failed to comply with title,section,subdivision b,and gee is distinguishable because a qualified medical evaluator was not obtained in response to ainbinder.moreover,gaytan never raised the presumption at trial and the issue was waived under davis.
lausd also contends that the wcab correctly affirmed the decision without remand because the wcj considered ainbinder february,report.the wcj found it was not substantial evidence which could rebut the presumption,because ainbinder failed to review medical records as the qualified medical evaluator.in addition,the wcj relied on the opinion of heskiaoff,which is substantial evidence because the left ankle did not arise until ainbinder involvement.
discussion 
standard of review 
on appeal the reviewing court is bound by the factual findings and decision of the wcab if supported by substantial evidence.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d western growers.substantial evidence is not shown by isolating evidence which supports the decision while ignoring other facts which rebut or explain that evidence.levesque workmen.bd.cal d,levesque rosas workers comp.appeals bd.th,d rosas.however,the reviewing court may not reweigh evidence or decide disputed facts.western growers,supra,th at,d.while workers compensation is liberally construed with the purpose of extending benefits to industrially injured workers arriaga county of alameda cal th,d,an appellate court is not bound to accept factual findings if unreasonable,illogical,arbitrary,improbable,or inequitable considering the entire record and overall statutory scheme.western growers,supra,th at,d bracken workers comp.appeals bd.d.bracken.
in contrast,interpretation of governing statutes is decided de novo by the appellate court,even though the wcab construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d boehm ralphs grocery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d ralphs grocery.when interpreting a statute,the legislature intent should be determined and given effect.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,moyer.the best indicator of legislative intent is the plain meaning of the statutory language,when clear and unambiguous.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,dubois moyer,supra,cal d at,boehm,supra,th at,d.finally,the statute should be interpreted consistently with its intended purpose,and harmonized within the statutory framework as a whole.dubois,supra,cal th at,d.
ii.tenet applies 
the wcj and wcab concluded that tenet applies because heskiaoff as the primary treating physician discharged gaytan from care prior to treatment prescribed by ainbinder.tenet,supra,th at,d.these findings are supported by substantial evidence and are not subject to review.western growers,supra,th at,d.in the report of december,heskiaoff indicated gaytan was permanent and stationary and released from further care except for medication due to.in addition,gaytan proceeded under sections and in his letter of december,when he objected to heskiaoff conclusions and offered an agreed medical examiner to resolve medical issues.
gaytan does not dispute tenet applies.on the contrary,gaytan maintains he complied with sections and,and tenet.lausd,however,alleges that gaytan manipulated the statutory procedures in order to gain the presumption under section.
gaytan complied with sections and and tenet 
lausd argues that gaytan actually designated ainbinder as the primary treating doctor in a letter before the initial examination,and began treatment with steven danchik,the day after the examination.if ainbinder designation as a qualified medical evaluator was simply a pretext for changing primary treating physicians and gaining the presumption under section,then there was no compliance with sections and and tenet.see ordorica workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
while there is conflicting evidence,the finding that ainbinder initial examination was as a qualified medical evaluator is supported by substantial evidence.western growers,supra,th at,d.gaytan objected to heskiaoff under sections and,and then gave notice of the qualified medical evaluation and the subsequent change in primary treating physicians based on the qualified medical evaluator recommendation.in addition,ainbinder report of february,refers to a qualified medical evaluation and addresses the issues raised under sections and.
iii.gee applies 
we first note that gee did not specifically address tenet or title,section,subdivision b.nevertheless,gee is consistent.in gee,the injured worker proceeded under sections and following discharge by the primary treating physician.in addition,the wcj resolved the dispute over which physician was the primary treating physician.gee,supra,th at,d.
gee applies even though gee employer chose a qualified medical evaluator 
in gee,the employer obtained a report by a qualified medical evaluator after the employee changed primary treating physicians.lausd,the wcj and the wcab distinguish gee because a report from a qualified medical evaluator was not obtained following gaytan change to ainbinder.this distinction is not determinative.in gee the additional report pertained to whether the presumption under the criteria of section applied to the newly selected primary treating physician that was confirmed by the wcj.gee,supra,th at,d.
before considering whether the presumption applies to the newly selected primary treating physician under section,the court must determine which physician is the primary treating physician pursuant to title,section,subdivision b.title,section,subdivision b states in part where the primary treating physician discharges the employee from further treatment and there is a dispute concerning the need for continuing treatment,no other primary treating physician shall be identified unless and until the dispute is resolved.application of title,section,subdivision b should be consistent with the plain language and statutory scheme.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,moyer,supra,cal d at,boehm,supra,th at,d.thus,the relevant findings of the discharging primary treating physician must be judged by the court before a newly selected primary treating physician is confirmed.the procedure to follow is set forth by sections,and.tenet,supra,th,d.therefore,the wcj was required to decide between the opinion of heskiaoff as the discharging primary treating physician with the presumption and ainbinder as gaytan qualified medical evaluator,before determining whether the presumption applied to ainbinder as the newly selected primary treating physician under the criteria of section.
otherwise the discharging primary treating physician could lose the presumption by sham characterizations or manipulation as recognized in gee.gee,supra,th at,d.we also find this interpretation more consistent with the legislature intent to promote reliance on treating physicians and reduce reporting and costs.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,moyer,supra,cal d at.
b.the presumption was timely raised and not waived under davis 
lausd contends further that gaytan failed to raise the presumption under section at trial and thus the issue which includes gee was waived under davis.however,whether heskiaoff was the primary treating physician entitled to the presumption was litigated at trial,and clearly included the claim that ainbinder was the primary treating physician entitled to the presumption.see gee,supra,th at,d.moreover,gee holds that the presumption arises when the operative facts are established and both sides agreed heskiaoff is the discharging primary treating physician and ainbinder was determined to be the qualified medical evaluator under sections and by the wcj and wcab.
compliance with sections and does not satisfy title,section 
gaytan contends that his compliance with sections and and tenet also satisfied title,section,subdivision b based on gee.we disagree.as we noted previously,gee did not specifically address tenet or title,section.in addition,the wcj in gee resolved the dispute over which physician was the primary treating physician as if proceeding under title,section,subdivision b,and the court of appeal relied on the wcj finding.gee,supra,th at,d.in any event,it is the court which resolves disputes,and not reporting physicians.
d.a qualified medical evaluator can be selected as the primary treating physician 
gee does indicate,however,that a qualified medical evaluator can be chosen as the primary treating physician that may be entitled to the presumption under section.we find nothing that precludes this conclusion in sections a
