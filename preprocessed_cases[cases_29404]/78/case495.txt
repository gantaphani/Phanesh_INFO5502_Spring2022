while maintaining fire roads in the klamath national forest,mark titus was struck and killed by machinery being operated by mark thomas defendant.titus and defendant,doing business as mark thomas logging,had been employed by a contractor awarded the job of maintaining the fire roads.after titus heirs and family plaintiffs recovered workers compensation benefits,they sued defendant for negligently causing titus death.the trial court entered summary judgment in defendant favor,ruling that he was a fellow employee and,therefore,workers compensation was the exclusive remedy.
on appeal,plaintiffs correctly contend the trial court erred in concluding defendant,who did not have a contractor license,was an employee as a matter of law pursuant to labor code section.among other things,this statute creates a rebuttable presumption that a worker performing services for which a contractors license is required is an employee rather than an independent contractor,and provides that a worker performing any activity for which such a license is required shall hold a valid contractors license as a condition of having independent contractor status,subd.c further section references are to the labor code unless otherwise specified.
as we will explain,business and professions code section exempts from the contractors license requirement any construction or maintenance work incidental to the clearing or other work upon the land in rural districts for fire prevention purposes here,undisputed evidence establishes that the work being performed by defendant was for fire prevention purposes in a rural district.consequently,he was not an employee as a matter of law instead,it is a question of fact,based upon relevant factors enumerated in section,whether he was an employee or an independent contractor.for this reason,defendant is not entitled to summary judgment.
the parties undisputed facts disclose that titus died in an accident on august,while employed by foster construction foster.the united states forest service had awarded foster,who was a licensed general contractor,a contract for maintenance of fire roads in klamath national forest the klamath forest.the contract included the clearing of forest,repair of culverts and drainage,and placement and compaction of aggregate.foster hired defendant,an unlicensed contractor,to work on the project.titus was killed when he was pinned against an embankment by an excavator operated by defendant.
plaintiffs recovered in workers compensation benefits from foster insurance carrier,the state compensation insurance fund scif.they also sued defendant for negligently causing titus death.scif filed a lien against any judgment or settlement rendered in favor of plaintiffs in the wrongful death action.
defendant moved for summary judgment,asserting that because he did not have a contractors license,he and titus were both employees of foster as a matter of law when the accident occurred for work requiring a contractors license,an unlicensed subcontractor is deemed to be a statutory employee of the general contractor and,therefore,plaintiffs action against defendant was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act.
plaintiffs opposed the motion,contending that defendant status as foster employee was not established as a matter of law because defendant failed to show indisputably that he was required to have a contractors license to perform the job for foster.according to plaintiffs,a contractors license was not required pursuant to relevant federal law thus,it was a question of fact whether defendant was an employee of foster or was an independent contractor,and if the latter status applied,plaintiffs action against defendant was not barred.
the trial court ruled that defendant was an employee of foster as a matter of law and that plaintiffs action against defendant was barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act.accordingly,the court granted the summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of defendant.
discussion 
prior to addressing the parties appellate contentions,it is helpful to discuss pertinent statutory provisions and principles of law.
section establishes the conditions under which an employer liability for compensation established by the workers compensation act is in lieu of any other liability of the employer to the employee for an injury suffered on the job.section provides in turn,with exceptions not relevant here,that when compensation is payable under section,the right to recover compensation is the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer a parallel,but not identical,exclusive remedy provision,section,prohibits actions against coemployees for injuries they cause when acting within the scope of their employment.hendy losse cal d,d,fn.omitted.
section,applicable in both workers compensation cases state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,and tort actions foss anthony industries d,sets forth a statutory presumption regarding whether a person or entity is an employee or independent contractor.there is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof that a worker performing services for which a license is required pursuant to the contractors state license law bus,et,or who is performing such services for a person who is required to obtain such a license is an employee rather than an independent contractor.
the statute enumerates various factors for rebutting the presumption and proving independent contractor status,but the penultimate paragraph of section states that any person performing any function or activity for which a license is required pursuant to the contractors state license law shall hold a valid contractors license as a condition of having independent contractor status.italics added.thus,p ursuant to the plain language of labor code section,an unlicensed subcontractor may not be an independent contractor but is instead deemed a statutory employee of the general contractor.hunt building bernick th,d,citing state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.
defendant contends it is undisputed that at the time of the accident,he was operating an is a digging machine used for this activity required a contractors license bus,hence,in accordance with sections and,defendant was foster made him the decedent plaintiffs could not sue him for wrongful death because their exclusive remedy was the recovery of workers compensation benefits.
plaintiffs assert a variety of reasons they believe defendant was not required to have a contractors license.claiming those reasons demonstrate that defendant was not performing any function or activity for which a license is required within the meaning of section,plaintiffs argue the unrebuttable presumption of employee status set forth in the penultimate paragraph of section does not apply rather,it is a question of fact whether defendant was foster employee or an independent contractor,using the pertinent factors enumerated in section.see fn,ante.according to plaintiffs,because factual issues remain,summary judgment was inappropriate and we must reverse and remand the matter for trial.
as we will explain,plaintiffs position prevails.
in the trial court,plaintiffs main argument in opposition to the summary judgment motion was that defendant did not need to have a contractors license because he was working on a federal project,and a california contractor license is not required for federal jobs on federal lands.
they reiterate this contention on appeal and also advance policy arguments why section should not be interpreted as allowing an unlicensed contractor to avoid tort liability under the particular circumstances of this case.
we need not address those contentions,however,because another argument raised by plaintiffs has merit.they correctly point out that under a state law exemption bus,a contractors license was not required for the fire road maintenance project performed by defendant.
business and professions code section sets forth a exception to the contractors license requirement.it exempts any construction and maintenance work
