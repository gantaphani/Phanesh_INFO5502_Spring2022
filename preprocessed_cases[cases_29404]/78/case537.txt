petitioner brenda martino sustained an admitted industrial back injury on april.on june,martino wrote her employer insurer,superior national insurance company superior requesting vr benefits.superior agreed,and the parties selected a rehabilitation consultant.martino injury prevented her from participating in the program,and she requested that rehabilitation services be interrupted or deferred the parties agreed to a extension,from july,to july.martino timely requested and superior granted two more extensions.each of the letters from superior agreeing to extensions contains the following notice please remember that the law states that you have no more than five years from your date of injury to request additional rehabilitation services.if you do not request services by the interruption end date shown above,your rights to rehabilitation will probably end.martino did request a further extension of the vr program beyond the last agreed extension date of february.
on february,the workers compensation judge wcj awarded martino percent permanent disability,further medical treatment and attorney fees.the order did not mention vr.
on april,superior filed an application with the ru requesting that liability for vr services be terminated.
on april,before the ru made a determination on superior request to terminate,martino filed a petition to reopen with the wcab alleging new and further disability and requesting that vr be reopened.
on may,the ru granted superior request to terminate vr services,finding that there are no current grounds for extending the interruption of the rehabilitation process pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section the ru determination also states the employee retains the right to reopen the rehabilitation process per labor code section must be made prior to,or within years from the date of injury.in view of the nature of the denial of vocational rehabilitation services,in order to reinstate the rehabilitation process,the employee will only be required to submit a written request for the same,albeit on a timely basis as previously stated.capitalization omitted.
on may,the wcj granted martino petition to reopen,finding new and further disability to her back and increasing her permanent disability rating to percent.the wcj opinion on decision states there seems to be little doubt that there is good cause to reopen.applicant back disability has changed and there has clearly been an additional period of temporary disability.the order does not mention vr.

discussion 
an employer is required to offer vr services to qualified injured workers,veilleux workers comp.appeals bd.d.section states in part nothing in this chapter shall bar the right of any injured worker to institute proceedings for the collection of compensation,including vocational rehabilitation services,within five years after the date of the injury upon the ground that the original injury has caused new and further disability or that the provision of vocational rehabilitation services has become feasible because the employee medical condition has improved or because of other factors not capable of determination at the time the employer liability for vocational rehabilitation services otherwise terminated.the jurisdiction of the appeals board in these cases shall be a continuing jurisdiction within this period.
the application of vr statutes of limitation to undisputed facts is a question of law subject to de novo review.martinez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.limitations provisions in the workmen compensation law must be liberally construed in favor of the employee unless otherwise compelled by the language of the statute,and such enactments should not be interpreted in a manner which will result in a loss of compensation.bland workmen.bd.cal d,see also bussear workers comp.appeals bd.d.t he legislative purpose in enacting section was to enable injured workers to participate in rehabilitation training to the fullest extent possible.
to invoke the wcab continuing jurisdiction under section,the workers compensation act act requires only that an appropriate pleading be filed with the wcab within five years from the date of injury.see generally,herlick,cal.workers compensation law ed.if an appropriate pleading is timely filed within the period,the power of the wcab to reopen and decide a matter extends beyond the period.bland workmen,supra,cal d at,fn,see also general foundry service workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,the board clearly has the power to continue its jurisdiction beyond the period when an application is made within that period.
the ru found that martino april,petition to reopen was not timely under section because the petition was chronologically out of sequence,given that subsequently the rehabilitation process was closed on.the wcj agreed,stating t o argue otherwise would be to state that one is attempting to reopen something before it has been decided which is certainly not acceptable.
these findings of untimeliness are not supported by the facts or the law.the petition to reopen was filed with the wcab,not the ru.the only issue before the ru was whether to grant superior april,petition to terminate liability for vr.the ru decision regarding superior request to terminate vr benefits had no effect on the wcab continuing jurisdiction to act on the timely filed petition to reopen containing the request to reinstate vr.a timely petition to reopen remains pending and is not affected by the statute of limitations where there has been no decision of any kind by the wcab on the specific form of benefits at issue.bland workmen,supra,cal d at.
moreover,neither the act nor case law requires an injured employee to adhere to a strict chronological sequence when filing documents in administrative proceedings.to the contrary,it is an principle that the act disfavors application of formalistic rules of procedure that would defeat an employee entitlement to rehabilitation benefits.see,rubio workers comp.appeals bd.d.the board procedural rules serve the convenience of the tribunal and the litigant s and facilitate the proceedings.they do not deprive the tribunal of the power to dispense with compliance when the purposes of justice require it,particularly when the violation is formal and does not substantially prejudice the other party.accordingly,this court has refused to
