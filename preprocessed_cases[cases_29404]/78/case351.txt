we granted contra costa county the county petition for a writ of review,which challenged a workers compensation appeal board the wcab decision awarding doreen dahl a permanent disability rating of percent the workers compensation judge the wcj initially found,and both parties agree,that dahl permanent disability rating as determined by the california permanent disability rating schedule the schedule is percent.dahl sought to rebut that rating,invoking ogilvie workers compensation appeals board th ogilvie.ogilvie held that there are only three ways in which the scheduled rating for an injured employee may permissibly be rebutted.dahl sought to invoke the second method approved in ogilvie the leboeuf method under which the employee shows she will have a greater loss of future earnings than reflected in a rating because,due to the industrial injury,the employee is not amenable to rehabilitation.ogilvie,th at.dahl rebuttal,however,included no evidence that the industrial injuries she sustained to her neck and shoulder rendered her incapable of rehabilitation.rather,her rebuttal consisted solely of a vocational expert opinion that his method for determining dahl diminished future earnings capacity produced a higher rating than that of the rating produced by the schedule and that his method more accurately measured dahl diminished future earnings.
dahl attempted rebuttal did not comport with any of the methods approved in ogilvie for rebutting the rating provided using the rating schedule and is therefore foreclosed by ogilvie.accordingly,we reverse the wcab decision,and annul the award.
background 
the extent of an injured workers compensation applicant permanent disability is assessed by reference to the statutorily defined schedule,subd.d.the schedule consists of four components the nature of the physical injury or disfigurement the occupation of the applicant the age of the applicant and the applicant diminished future earnings capacity,subd.a.the nature of the physical injury or impairment to be rated in the schedule is to be based upon the american medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment,and an employee diminished future earning capacity shall be a numeric formula based upon empirical data and findings prepared by the rand institute for civil justice,subd.b.the schedule is to promote consistency,uniformity,and objectivity,subd.d,and the scheduled rating is prima facie evidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered by the schedule,subd.c.ogilvie,supra,th at.
in ogilvie,division three of this court addressed whether,in light of the amendments to section enacted in senate bill in,it is permissible to depart from a scheduled rating on the basis of vocational expert opinion that an employee has a greater loss of future earning capacity than reflected in a scheduled rating.ogilvie,supra,th at.giving consideration to the purpose behind and the language of the amendments,the ogilvie court answered this question with a qualified yes.it held that there are three permissible methods by which the scheduled rating could be rebutted.
first,the court concluded that the legislature left unchanged the case law allowing the schedule to be rebutted when a party can show a factual error in the application of a formula or the preparation of the schedule.ogilvie,supra,th at.second,the legislature also left intact the cases,including leboeuf,recognizing that a scheduled rating has been effectively rebutted when the injury to the employee impairs his or her rehabilitation,and for that reason,the employee diminished future earning capacity is greater than reflected in the employee scheduled rating.ogilvie,supra,th at.the court interpreted leboeuf and its progeny as limited in application to cases where the employee diminished future earnings are directly attributable to the employee injury,and not due to nonindustrial factors.id.at pp.third and finally,the court held a scheduled rating may be rebutted when a claimant can demonstrate that the nature or severity of the claimant injury is not captured within the sampling of disabled workers that was used to compute the adjustment factor.id.at.
in ogilvie,ogilvie and her employer each submitted estimates of her diminished future earning capacity from vocational rehabilitation experts who compared her earnings before the injury with what she could be expected to earn after it.each expert considered his evaluation to be superior to the scheduled rating because he considered such things as ogilvie education,skills,motivation,local job market conditions,work history,and vocational testing in arriving at ogilvie loss of earning capacity.ogilvie,supra,th at.the wcj agreed that the scheduled rating did not sufficiently compensate her and set about devising his own methodologies.id.at pp.the wcab created yet another methodology that it considered consistent with section,and was intended to replicate the empirically based method used in the rand study that established the diminished future earning capacity adjustment in the rating schedule.id.at 
on writ review,this court rejected the wcab methodology,holding n othing in the senate bill authorizes or compels the calculation of an alternative diminished earning capacity adjustment factor as the wcab devised in order to resolve ogilvie claim.when it devised this new methodology,the wcab acted in excess of its authority.the means an employee may use to challenge a scheduled rating due to diminished earning capacity are described in the reported cases that predate senate bill.and although the parties vocational experts determined that ogilvie anticipated loss of future earnings will be greater than reflected in a permanent disability award based on the rating schedule,the court remanded for further proceedings because it could not determine on this record the degree to which the experts may have taken impermissible factors into account in reaching their conclusions.ogilvie,supra,th at.
factual and procedural history 
during a period that ended in march,dahl sustained a cumulative industrial injury to her neck and right shoulder while employed by the county as a medical records technician.the injuries resulted in surgeries and scarring.at the time of the injuries,she was years old and had worked for the county for over years.dahl has a bachelor degree from csu hayward and a felony conviction for possession and sale of methamphetamine.
the parties agreed medical examiner ame,mechel henry,found no basis for apportionment and the parties agreed that she correctly evaluated the whole person impairment wpi caused by dahl injury in accordance with the ama guides as required by statute.they also agreed that the wpi found by henry resulted in a rating of percent disability.however,dahl sought to rebut the scheduled rating through a vocational expert jeffrey malmuth,and the county sought to counter that with its own expert ira cohen.
it does not appear dahl sought to employ either the first rebuttal method approved in ogilvie factual error in application of a formula or preparation of the schedule or the third nature or severity of claimant injury not captured within sampling of disabled workers used to compute the adjustment factor.thus,the wcj found no evidence that dahl impairments or the disability ratings derived from them are either mathematically incorrect or medically deviant from the injuries enumerated in the guides or the rating schedule.rather,dahl sought to invoke the second ogilvie rebuttal method.as the wcj noted,dahl expert and the county produced reports and trial testimony offering various conflicting percentages of lost earning capacity,leading to various permanent disability ratings.
at the evidentiary hearing in march,malmuth testified that he relied on the medical opinions of henry that dahl has pain and cervical and upper extremity limitations but acknowledged that dahl has some earning capacity.he testified that her ability to get a job is affected by factors other than her injury.he opined that dahl can not compete successfully with uninjured job applicants,given the entire constellation of factors,despite having some earning capacity.
malmuth did his own calculations regarding dahl diminished future earning capacity.he attempted to establish a dfec diminished future earnings capacity based not on applicant individual assets and detriments but on those of a theoretical group of similarly situated employees.he compared the earning ability of employees against that of this employee.the jobs he studied were based on the conclusions reached by henry.the limitations involving dahl shoulder led to limitations in the labor market malmuth considered.malmuth testified that dahl was earning per hour at the time of her injury,which would be between the and percentile for employees in the category he considered similar.her earning capacity would be limited to the percentile of wages or below because of her medical condition,which caused him to use the average figure of per hour for her earning capacity.malmuth opined that the most accurate measure of dahl lost earning capacity was about percent.he considered dahl education,but opined that jobs that would use her education were precluded by her injury because of her limitations including her inability to use a computer.on,he testified that she would be helped by vocational rehabilitation,including voice recognition and other things.he acknowledged that dahl was a good rehabilitation candidate and could go to school and get a master degree.she could employ vocational rehabilitation to have access to more of the labor market,and if she did her earning capacity would rise.
the county vocational expert cohen agreed with malmuth that dahl would benefit from vocational rehabilitation,get a master degree and raise her earning capacity.he disagreed with malmuth calculation of dahl earning capacity.he criticized malmuth for treating plaintiff as unskilled,focusing on too few job areas,failing to account for her skills or aptitude and using too low a percentile regarding her potential wages.dahl could do more jobs than malmuth indicates.cohen used the code for a bachelor degree in evaluating her earning capacity.he reviewed her medical and other records,physical limitations,educational history,vocational history,ame evaluation,deposition,payroll records from the county,performed vocational testing and interviewed dahl.taking into account all of this information and her age,education,skills,aptitude,the general condition of the labor market and occupations compatible with her profile,he opined that her proportional earnings loss due to the injury was percent.according to malmuth,cohen earnings loss percentage would result in a disability rating of about percent.
the workers compensation judge wcj determined that dahl injury caused a permanent disability of percent pursuant to the schedule.the wcj held that,under ogilvie,dahl failed to rebut her diminished future earning capacity factor because she could not show her injury caused a total loss of future earning capacity or percent permanent disability.the wcj did not address whether she would have met her rebuttal burden if ogilvie permitted a loss of future earning capacity less than percent.
on appeal from this decision,the wcab agreed with the wcj that there was no evidence to support rebuttal under the first or third ogilvie methods.however,it rejected the wcj interpretation of ogilvie,and held that dahl could rebut the scheduled rating by showing the injury impaired her amenability to rehabilitation,even where there was less than total permanent disability.for this reason,it rescinded the wcj findings and award and return ed the case to the trial level for development of the record and a new decision on whether applicant rebuttal of the dfec supports a finding of permanent disability that is higher than calculated under the pdrs rating schedule.
on remand,the wcj heard additional testimony from the same two vocational experts on whether the diminished future earning capacity rating properly reflected dahl future earning capacity.malmuth again testified that dahl was a good rehabilitation candidate.nonetheless,he attempted to establish dahl future earning capacity based not on her individual assets and detriments,but on those of a theoretical group of similarly situated employees.according to malmuth,this approach precluded consideration of dahl education.he opined that the scheduled rating understated her loss of future earning capacity.
cohen again adopted a more individualized approach,though he declined to consider dahl felony conviction.he concluded that dahl scheduled rating actually overstated her loss of future earning capacity.
the wcj found cohen conclusions were now contrary to the law of the case.the judge reasoned the wcab had already ruled that dahl showed she had a greater diminished earning capacity than reflected in the scheduled rating.the wcj also found malmuth method more persuasive than cohen because it eliminated from the diminished future earning capacity calculation any impermissible factors not stemming from dahl industrial injury.the wcj assigned dahl right shoulder impairment a score of percent,and taking into account her other injuries,assigned dahl a total permanent disability of percent.in the belief that the wcab had already decided the issue,the wcj did not consider whether dahl had shown that her injury impaired her prospects for vocational rehabilitation,much less whether any such impairment caused her to suffer a greater loss of future earning capacity as required by ogilvie.ogilvie,supra,th at pp.
the county appealed to the wcab through a petition for reconsideration.the wcab affirmed.in doing so,it again concluded that complete lack of amenability to vocational rehabilitation is not necessary before a leboeuf analysis may be properly applied.the wcab also accepted malmuth method for determining dahl diminished future earning capacity accepted by the wcj of look ing at the effect such an injury as dahl would have upon the dfec of similarly situated workers as consistent with ogilvie.the wcab opinion does not discuss what evidence,if any,including malmuth computations,demonstrated that dahl injury impaired her amenability to rehabilitation,much less that such impairment was the cause of greater loss of earning capacity than the scheduled rating reflected.
the county subsequently petitioned for a writ of review,which we granted.
discussion 
the county argues the wcj and wcab erred by straying from the scheduled rating established by the schedule.the county concedes that,under ogilvie,dahl could rebut her scheduled rating by showing her injury precluded vocational rehabilitation but contends the wcab completely ignored evidence dahl was amenable to rehabilitation.the county and various amici also take issue with the manner in which the wcab calculated dahl diminished future earning capacity,as well as her revised rating.we agree that dahl failed to rebut her scheduled rating by showing her injury precluded vocational rehabilitation.accordingly,we need not and do not reach the other arguments raised by the county and amici.
our review is limited to determining whether the wcab acted without or in excess of its powers and whether its decision was unreasonable,not supported by substantial evidence or procured by fraud,subds.a d.we may also determine if findings of fact support the order,subd.e.the findings and conclusions of the appeals board on questions of fact are conclusive and final and are not subject to review.u nless clearly erroneous,the wcab interpretation of the workers compensation laws is entitled to great weight.genlyte,llc workers comp.appeals bd.th.nevertheless,issues of statutory interpretation and questions of law are subject to our independent review,and we need not defer to the wcab legal determinations where they are contrary to the plain meaning of the statute or prevailing case law.see ibid.
as all parties acknowledge,the resolution of this case turns on ogilvie.in that case,the wcab found a workers compensation applicant could rebut his diminished future earning capacity adjustment by proposing an alternative earning capacity,so long as the applicant used a numeric formula based on empirica
