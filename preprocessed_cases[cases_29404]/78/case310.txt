jennifer green appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants in her and action.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm in part and reverse in part.
green was employed at canadian county juvenile justice center as a technician and detention officer.her primary duties were in the drug lab.as part of her job,she performed tests,which the center makes available free of charge to county residents involved with the juvenile courts,child welfare,or substance abuse treatment programs.the individual defendants allegedly have supervisory authority over the center,gary miller as a canadian county associate district judge with administrative authority over the center and billie linum as the director of the center.
green became concerned that the center did not have a confirmation testing policy,and she raised her concerns with her direct supervisor,bill alexander,and with judge miller.neither appeared responsive to the issue,with judge miller allegedly stating that if clients did not like the results,they could go elsewhere to be tested.in the summer of,green suspected that a particular drug test had yielded a false positive,as the client repeatedly advised green that she was not taking drugs,positive results notwithstanding.without consulting her supervisors,green contacted the manufacturer of the equipment with questions about confirmation testing and arranged for a confirmation test by an outside hospital.she also spoke with representatives of the department of human services about the client and the confirmation test and arranged for a case worker to transport the sample to the hospital.the confirmation test indicated that the center initial test was a false positive.green communicated this information to alexander,and soon thereafter the center adopted a formal confirmation testing policy.
green alleges that,after this episode,her supervisors began treating her less favorably.in the fall of,the drug lab was divided into two areas because construction prevented clients from walking through the center to the drug lab.instead of having the clients come to the lab area in the rear of the building,employees collected samples in an area at the front of the center and then transported them to the drug lab.thus,green was required to walk through the detention center,opening and closing seven or eight heavy jail doors each way,to collect samples and bring them to the drug lab.she and alexander proposed two alternatives to save her and other employees having to make this trip.first,instead of walking,clients could drive around the building to the back of the center avoiding the construction and give samples near the testing area,as they did before construction started.second,the testing machine could be moved to the front of the center,to the area.to green understanding,linum rejected the first alternative,and judge miller rejected the second.
on february,green notified alexander that she had injured her shoulder from having to open and close the jail doors so many times every day.she made a worker compensation claim and was off work,on a medical release,from february through march.while green was off work,linum,with judge miller knowledge,instructed alexander to move her out of the lab and back to a detention officer position and replace her with another employee.the only available shifts for a detention officer,however,were a to shift left open by the replacement employee and a floating shift.green was not willing to accept these shifts because she needed to care for her children in the evenings.alexander knew that green would be unwilling to accept those shifts,because green previously had been employed by the center and quit because she could not work a to shift.
a few days before green was released for work,she spoke with alexander and told him that she could not work the proposed shifts because of her family situation.she also wrote two letters to linum,with copies to judge miller and alexander,explaining why she could not work the proposed shifts and asking why they would not implement the accommodations she had proposed.ultimately,green did not show up for the shift,and her employment was terminated.
green brought suit under,alleging that the county commissioners,judge miller,and linum had retaliated against her for her conduct and speech,in violation of her first amendment rights.she also asserted claims for retaliatory discharge under the oklahoma worker compensation statute.stat.tit,and for wrongful discharge in violation of oklahoma public policy.the district court granted summary judgment to defendants on green claims,and she appealed.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standard as the district court.montgomery city of ardmore,cir.summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.
green first appeals the grant of summary judgment to defendants on her claim of retaliation for exercise of her first amendment rights.the district court held that she had failed to show that her speech was a matter of public concern.
t he theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions,regardless of how unreasonable,has been uniformly rejected.pickering bd.of,d quoting keyishian bd.of regents,d.on the other hand,g overnment employers,like private employers,need a significant degree of control over their employees words and actions without it,there would be little chance for the efficient provision of public services.garcetti ceballos,d.the problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the employee,as a citizen,in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the state,as an employer,in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.pickering,at.thus,the initial inquiries for courts in first amendment cases are whether a public employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern.garcetti.at emphasis added see connick myers,d pickering,at.
in garcetti,which was decided after the district court decision in this case,the court evaluated the first amendment claims of a deputy district attorney ceballos.believing that a search warrant affidavit contained misrepresentations,ceballos wrote a memorandum recommending the dismissal of pending charges and then a second memorandum about the matter.id.at.he was later transferred from his calendar deputy position to a trial deputy position and assigned to work at another location.id.at.he sued under,alleging retaliation for his exercise of his first amendment rights.id.focusing on the citizen prong of the first amendment analysis,the court determined that ceballos wrote his disposition memo because that is part of what he,as a calendar deputy,was employed to do.id.at.his expression was pursuant to his official duties,and thus he was not speaking as a citizen for first amendment purposes.id.the court stated,r estricting speech that owes its existence to a public employee professional responsibilities does not infringe any liberties the employee might have enjoyed as a private citizen.it simply reflects the exercise of employer control over what the employer itself has commissioned or created.id.it continued 
refusing to recognize first amendment claims based on government employees work product does not prevent them from participating in public debate.the employees retain the prospect of constitutional protection for their contributions to the civic discourse.this prospect of protection,however,does not invest them with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.
id.in light of garcetti,the crux of our inquiry in this case is whether green activities in arranging for a confirmation test were pursuant to her duties as a drug lab technician 
in garcetti,the parties did not dispute that the deputy district attorney memorandum was part of his official duties.thus,the court had no occasion to articulate a comprehensive framework for defining the scope of an employee duties in cases where there is room for serious debate.at.the ninth,the eleventh,and the seventh circuits,however,have begun tackling this issue.
in the ninth circuit,freitag ayers,cir,involved a prison guard who was the target of inappropriate,sexually explicit inmate behavior.when she submitted disciplinary forms documenting the conduct,prison authorities ignored them or acted too slowly for the inmates to be disciplined.id.at.the guard wrote various memoranda and letters complaining of her supervisors undermining her authority and allowing the hostile environment and harassment.id.at.later,she filed a discrimination charge with a state agency and wrote two letters to her state senator.id.at.the senator requested that the california office of the inspector general ig investigate the situation the ig report substantiated the guard allegations.id.at.subsequently,her employment was terminated,and she brought suit.the ninth circuit held that she was acting as a citizen in her communications with her senator and the ig,but under garcetti her internal complaints with one potential exception,which it left open for the district court to consider were not protected because they were submitted pursuant to her duties as a correctional officer.id.at.
in the eleventh circuit,battle board of regents,cir per curiam,involved a university employee who reported to university officials improprieties in her supervisor handling and management of federal financial aid funds.id.at.the employee contract was not renewed,and she sued for retaliation.id.at.the court noted that the employee admitted she had a clear employment duty to ensure the accuracy and completeness of student files as well as to report any mismanagement or fraud she encountered in the student financial aid files,and that federal guidelines also required her to report suspected fraud.id.at.consequently,she acted pursuant to her official employment responsibilities,and her retaliation claim failed under garcetti.id.at.
finally,in the seventh circuit,mills city of evansville,cir,involved a police sergeant who criticized a proposal to reorganize the department.her remarks occurred during a gathering of senior police officers following an official meeting to discuss the plans,when she was on duty and in uniform.id.at.the seventh circuit held that the communications were made in her capacity as a public employee contributing to the formation and execution of official policy,not as a citizen.id.at.
as a starting point for our own analysis,we determine what speech and conduct is at issue.the district court determined that the speech at issue was 
communication with the client regarding how to obtain a confirmation test communication with the testing equipment manufacturer about a confirmation test communication with another individual to ensure chain of custody for the sample to be used in the confirmation test and communication with defendants regarding the confirmation test determination of a false positive.
aplt.app.vol.at.green argues on appeal that she also set forth other instances of speech that occurred prior to the obtaining of the confirmation test,including voicing concerns to her superiors about the lack of a confirmation policy,and she generally asserts that the district court approached the issue too narrowly.for purposes of our summary judgment review,we construe the record in the light most favorable to green,so we evaluate the speech identified by the district court in light of the other instances of speech and conduct upon which green relies,particularly her conversations with her supervisors prior to the confirmation test incident.
next,we examine green job description,keeping in mind that inclusion of a job duty in a formal job description is neither necessary nor sufficient to demonstrate that conducting the task is within the scope of the employee professional duties for first amendment purposes.garcetti.at.the written job description for a drug lab technician provides 
individual will collect and test urine samples as per the equipment manufacturer protocal sic.
individual will enter client data on edms computer program.
individual will calibrate and maintain the testing equipment as per manufacturers instruction.
individual will ensure that the supply inventory is sufficient to meet operational demands.
individual will maintain drug laboratory records to include client files,invoices,specimen reports,maintenance log of the testing machine,load list book,month end report for court,weekly subject report for local agencies.
individual will submit reports to the department of human services when requested.
individual will perform alcohol swabs when requested.
individual will relieve front desk receptionist one hour a week and perform any other duties that might be directed by the detention director program coordinators.
when not performing duties of drug lab technician,individual will assist in detention as a detention officer.
vol.at.appellees linum and the county commissioners add that green job duties required her to work closely with drug lab clients,the equipment manufacturer,and various governmental agencies.see id.at.they also state that it was part of her job to tell clients what to do if they did not like the results of the center test.see id.vol.at id.vol.at.
on the one hand,the speech and conduct at issue can be categorized as activities undertaken in the course of green job.she had the responsibility for collecting samples and testing them,and by extension,making sure the tests were as accurate as possible including the responsibility for ensuring that the testing machines were calibrated and operating correctly.she also had the responsibility for communicating with clients and with third parties regarding testing.under this view,by making arrangements for the confirmation test without consulting her supervisors,green decided to ignore her supervisors instructions that the center was not required to have a formal confirmation policy,and if clients were dissatisfied,they could have another test done elsewhere,and thereby properly should be subject to discipline.
on the other hand,one could argue that green was not a policymaker and her job responsibilities focused on the logistics of taking tests and keeping records,so she was not required to improve the center system by advocating for a confirmation policy or obtaining the confirmation test.under this view,by arranging for the confirmation test to underline the validity of her previously expressed concerns,green was not doing the job she was hired to do,but was acting outside her job responsibilities for the public good.
having considered the arguments pro and con,we conclude that this case is more similar to garcetti,battle,mills,and the activities in freitag than to activities undertaken by employees acting as citizens.green was not communicating with newspapers or her legislators or performing some similar activity afforded citizens rather,even if not explicitly required as part of her job responsibilities,her activities stemmed from and were the type of activities that she was paid to do.particularly,it was part of her job to ensure that the testing machines were working correctly,and it was part of her job to interact with her supervisors,clients,and third parties regarding testing policies and issues.her disagreement with her supervisors evaluation of the need for a formal testing policy,and her unauthorized obtaining of the confirmation test to prove her point,inescapably invoke garcetti admonishment that government employee first amendment rights do not invest them with a right to perform their jobs however they see fit.at.
the garcetti court sought to avoid judicial oversight of communications between and among government employees and their superiors in the course of official business and displacement of managerial discretion by judicial supervision.id.at.green conduct is inextricably intertwined with these types of concerns.further,garcetti speaks in terms of official communications that may cause consequences for government,and notes that s upervisors must ensure that their employees official communications are accurate,demonstrate sound judgment,and promote t
