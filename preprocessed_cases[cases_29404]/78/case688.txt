claimant michael falconi appeals from a judgment of the superior court upholding a decision of the industrial accident board in favor of coombs coombs,certified auto.the board determined that falconi was ineligible for workers compensation because he did not prove he was an employee of certified auto,rather than an independent contractor.falconi contends that the board factual findings are not supported by substantial evidence,and that the board did not apply the appropriate legal standard to determine whether he was an employee or an independent contractor.we find substantial evidence in the record to support the board factual findings.we hold,however,that the board erred in its application of the law to the facts of this case.applying the restatement second of agency section to the facts of this case,falconi was an employee eligible for worker compensation benefits.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the superior court.
background 
joseph coombs coombs and his wife carol coombs own certified auto,an automotive service station in wilmington,delaware.and coombs are both officers and salaried employees of the corporation.there are also two laborers who work for certified auto,the son of a friend and a.customers pay per hour regardless of who works on a car.
and coombs met falconi at a restaurant where he worked as a cook.the two men discussed falconi desire to change jobs and his recent experience in auto repair.coombs told falconi he would bring him into the business to see how he would work out during a test period,with the possibility of allowing him to take over the business.coombs kept records of payments made to falconi in a notebook under the heading subcontractor.falconi would receive cash for his time at work,but no pay when he was not at work due to illness,holidays,or vacation.
falconi began working at certified auto in september.certified auto listed falconi as contracted labor on its tax forms and sent falconi a form for however,certified auto also provided falconi a uniform with a logo for certified auto,just as it did for other employees.the sequence of falconi work on cars at certified auto was a function of when customers made their appointments.coombs assigned cars needing repair work to falconi,and trusted falconi judgment in the diagnosis of car problems.if falconi was unfamiliar with a specific car problem,coombs would advise him.coombs also would occasionally send falconi on errands for certified auto to get parts for repairs.the costs of these parts were passed on to the customer.falconi used his own tools to work on the cars,but it is undisputed that mechanics generally have their own tools as is the custom in the automotive repair business.
falconi alleged workplace related injury took place on january,after which he did not return to work at certified auto.falconi filed a petition to determine compensation due with the board and a hearing was held on june,during which coombs and falconi testified.
the board recited the evidence before it,but did not make express findings of fact except for those it found essential to its legal holding.to determine falconi eligibility for workers compensation,the board focused on the nature of falconi employment relationship with certified auto.the board recognized that only employees,not independent contractors,are eligible to receive workers compensation for injuries the burden of proof in a workers compensation case is upon the moving party generally,the quantum of proof for elements in a workers compensation case is a preponderance of the evidence 
in the board view,specific facts supported its ruling that falconi was an independent contractor.they were the notebook recording falconi wages was labeled subcontractor,certified auto did not withhold payroll taxes,certified auto sent a tax form to falconi,falconi usually did not need coombs to tell him exactly what was wrong with a car or how to fix it,falconi used his own tools and falconi had control over his own schedule because it did seem that coombs was requiring claimant to ask permission,merely that he wanted to know when claimant was not going to be available so as to make any necessary appointment scheduling adjustments.
the board also found other specific facts which would support a finding that falconi was an employee of certified auto.they were there was no written agreement or contract,falconi had no business license and failed to hold himself out as a business,certified auto did not hold a bid competition for any independent contractor,falconi wages were fixed by the days he worked rather than in accordance with work he completed,falconi wages were paid routinely,rather than as a lump sum,falconi never submitted an invoice or bill for his services,coombs told falconi the order in which to fix each car he assigned to him,coombs sent falconi to pick up parts,coombs advised falconi on automotive problems he did not know how to fix,and it is industry custom for an auto mechanic employee to use his own tools.
notwithstanding these specific findings,the board concluded that,under the totality of the circumstances,falconi had not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he was an employee of certified auto rather than an independent contractor.the board denied falconi petition for workers compensation benefits,the superior court affirmed,and this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review the legal conclusions of the board de novo whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor is a question of law that we review de novo we will accept the board findings of fact if there is substantial evidence to support them substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla,but less than a preponderance of the evidence substantial evidence is such relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion the appellate court does not weigh the evidence,determine questions of credibility,or makes its own factual findings 
a.there is substantial evidence to support the board factual findings.
we first examine whether there was substantial evidence to support the board findings of fact.it is the function of the board to determine the credibility of the witnesses before it.testimony was presented to support each finding of fact made by the board.we conclude that the factual findings of the board are supported by substantial evidence.
b.when a single business owner is an alleged employer,the board should apply restatement second of agency.
we next address the appropriate test to apply where the issue is whether the claimant is an employee or independent contractor of a single business.the appropriate legal standard is critical to a correct determination of workers compensation liability,because an employee must accept workers compensation as an exclusive remedy for personal injury suffered on the job employee is defined as every person in service of any corporation,association,firm or person,excepting those employees excluded by this subchapter,under any contract of hire,express or implied,oral or written,or performing services for a valuable consideration the workers compensation act further provides that no contractor or subcontractor shall receive compensation under this chapter 
in lester newton trucking neal,this court adopted four criteria to determine whether a worker is an employee for the purposes of workers compensation who hired the employee who may discharge the employee who pays the employee wages and who has the power to control.lester newton involved an appeal from the industrial accident board,but the question was which of two businesses was the employer at the time of the employee injury.in cases like this where there is only one alleged employer,the superior court has repeatedly recognized that the first two criteria of the lester newton test are not helpful whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee is determined by the facts and circumstances of each case,and the factor which has been given predominant consideration is the right to control an employer may not avoid liability for worker compensation simply by classifying his employee as an independent con
