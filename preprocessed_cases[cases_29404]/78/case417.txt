the question presented in this workers compensation proceeding is whether the disdainful reactions of a supervisor and to an employee mistreatment of them constitute actual events of employment for which the employee can obtain worker compensation benefits for the psychological stress that the employee experiences because of those disdainful reactions to her inappropriate conduct.
the answer requires an interpretation of section,subdivision b of the labor code,which states in order to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable,an employee shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were predominant as to all causes combined of the psychiatric injury.further section references are to the labor code unless otherwise specified.
the workers compensation appeals board the wcab concluded that rosemary verga was not entitled to compensation for psychiatric injury while employed by united airlines.according to verga,her psychiatric injury was the result of harassment and persecution by her supervisor and.however,the wcab found the true fact remains that verga was not actually subject to harassment or persecution,she instead brought upon herself the disdain of her because verga was a difficult person to get along with she was impolite,unpleasant,and never knew when she might get upset.the wcab held that disdain is not an actual event of employment within the meaning of the statute.
we issued a writ of review and shall now affirm the wcab order.as we will explain,substantial evidence supports the wcab factual findings that verga supervisor and did not persecute or harass her instead,it was verga who caused the stressful work environment by being rude,inflexible,easily upset,and demeaning toward other employees.that verga subjectively misperceived as harassment the disdainful reaction of her to verga mistreatment of them did not entitle her to worker compensation benefits for psychiatric injury.this is so because in enacting section,subdivision b,the legislature disapproved a ruling permitting such benefits based on an employee subjective misperception that the employment was stressful.in order to limit such claims for psychiatric injury,due to their proliferation and potential for abuse,the legislature establish ed a new and higher threshold of compensability for psychiatric injury,subd.c by requiring the claimant to demonstrate that actual events of employment were the predominant cause of the alleged psychiatric injury subd.b.this change in the statutory scheme constituted an intent to require the claimant to establish objective evidence of harassment,persecution,or other such basis for alleged psychiatric injury.verga failed to do so.rather,the evidence established that verga was the predominant cause of her psychiatric injury because her inappropriate conduct toward created their disdain toward her.although the workers compensation system generally provides benefits regardless of the fault of any party,there are limits when an employee intentionally causes his or her own injury.to allow an employee to harass and,when they respond unfavorably,to claim a injury to the employee psyche would increase,not reduce,workers compensation claims and create the potential for abuse of the system.this would be contrary to the purpose of section,subdivision b.in sum,the disdainful reactions of to verga abusive conduct toward them were neither actual events of employment nor the predominant cause of verga psychiatric injury within the meaning of the statute.the predominant cause of her injury was verga herself,through her intentional abuse of her.thus,she is not entitled to workers compensation benefits.
facts and procedural background 
verga applied to the wcab for adjudication of her worker compensation claim.she alleged she suffered an injury to her psyche in,as the result of abusive behavior by her supervisor while verga was employed as a staff representative for united airlines 
after lengthy procedural delays,a hearing before a workers compensation judge wcj began on december.
verga testified as follows 
she enjoyed her work in her prior position with united airlines as a customer service representative.her problems did not begin until she became a staff representative in human resources,working for bill allen.according to verga,allen did not treat her well.he would berate her in front of other employees and would delegate responsibilities to verga but not give her the authority to execute her responsibilities,which caused others in the department to resist her directives.
verga asked allen to conduct a meeting on january,to talk to the staff about their challenging behavior.her objective was to have allen let the others know the extent of her authority she expected him to be harsh and direct with the staff.
the meeting was far different than verga expected.allen distributed a document entitled rules of the road,which concerned employee interactions and included a topic on respect.when verga retrieved a dictionary to obtain a definition of the term,allen became upset.he was harsh with verga and allowed others to take jabs at her and make negative comments,such as calling her a perfectionist.he did not permit her to respond to the criticisms until the end of the meeting,which lasted several hours.at that point,she was unable to do so because she was overwhelmed and reduced to tears.
according to verga,her coworkers comments lacked merit and were just personal attacks.she described the meeting as the worst trial in the history of america where you can sit there and be on trial and not allowed to defend yourself and not have representation to do that for you.
after the meeting,verga began to experience frequent crying bouts and difficulty sleeping.according to her,she was demoted in march,after she reported allen to his boss.
in may,verga sought help from the employee assistance program and was treated by jensen at united airlines medical department.he initially authorized a medical leave,but then determined that verga could return to work in july.verga went to see her own physician,ho,who authorized a medical leave of absence.verga has not returned to work at united airlines since june.
other employees recalled the work environment and meeting differently than did verga.
allen,verga supervisor,testified as follows 
about three to four months after allen hired her,verga began to have problems meeting deadlines.she was rude to other employees and inflexible.allen advised her that this would interfere with her ability to meet her goals.
on january,allen called a regular staff meeting,which he expected to last longer than usual because he planned to set objectives for the year and to clear up any problems in the office.he began a discussion concerning united airlines rules of the road,and asked employees to comment on them.when some employees offered their definitions of the term respect,verga obtained a dictionary and demanded they look at the definition.allen finally had to ask verga to stop because she was not letting people respond in a respectful manner.at that point,allen had everyone take turns speaking to ensure that everyone had a chance to be heard.the employees aired concerns regarding verga and two men in the office.allen gave verga a chance to respond and did not yell at or berate her.
after the meeting,verga work declined and she refused to communicate with allen.in march,allen changed her work assignment,but this was not a demotion.he observed that while verga was on medical leave,those who filled in for her were able to meet the requisite deadlines and there was a noticeable improvement in the atmosphere of the department.after verga left the job,allen learned she had similar problems in her previous positions with united airlines.
employee pamela silvain testified.she confirmed that the office became less stressful after verga departure.silvain no longer felt like she was walking on eggshells.according to silvain,while the employees were trying to discuss the rules of the road document at the meeting on january,the only way they were able to speak was if they interrupted verga,who was agitated and just would stop yelling at them.
various employees testified that they had never seen verga mistreated by allen,who did as much as he could to support her,even though verga had mistreated them.for example,debra hilt stated that verga did not respect other employees.verga would tell them they were failures and give them degrading feedback.verga eventually isolated herself,and the other employees became the enemy.verga did not want to be a team player,as shown by the fact she did not assist the rest of the employees in preparing for an audit of the office.the work environment improved significantly after verga left.
employee ana maria pena stated that verga was not polite,not a team player,and not tactful,and that the office atmosphere was tense due to verga erratic and aggressive behavior.pena referred to the feeling in the office as doom and gloom when verga was present.pena tried to counsel verga about her lack of flexibility and tact,but the efforts were unsuccessful.at the meeting on january,employees tried to tell verga that she did not respect them but she was unwilling to listen to others points of view and implied that they were dumb.no one was trying to lynch verga they just wanted to alert her to the problem and obtain some relief.in fact,everyone stated they understood that verga had huge responsibilities,but they simply could not do their jobs if she did not carry through on her end of the bargain.according to pena,after verga went on medical leave,it was l ike a huge burden was lifted off our shoulders.
employee ron washington related that verga tried to make the department perfect and would yell at them when she could not get her work done.she was controlling,aggressive,required things done her way,created tension in the office,and had an attitude towards the staff.verga was angry that outside clients would call other staff representatives in the department for assistance because the clients had trouble working with her.washington recalled that during the meeting on january,allen asked verga how she thought the staff viewed her.verga in turn asked the staff,how do you guys view me,at which point the meeting took a negative turn because issues had been building up over a daily basis concerning her disrespectful method of communication.washington stated he should be the one out on a stress claim because of the way verga treated him.
perry segal,a qualified medical evaluator qme,opined that verga suffered from adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood,resulting from cumulative trauma caused by negative interactions with her and her supervisor,bill allen.segal opinion was based primarily on verga description of difficulties at work and her account of the meeting on january.verga told segal that allen allowed to berate her for approximately five hours,during which she felt scapegoated and beaten to tears.
another qme,edward duncan,diagnosed verga with an adjustment disorder and mild depressive symptoms,but opined she was not psychiatrically disabled from working as of october.duncan observed that verga adamantly believed her work stress stemmed from ill treatment she received from allen and.however,her viewed the situation differently.they described verga as very negative,rigid,stubborn,defensive,and abusive to the office staff.verga had received similar complaints in the past.her work records disclosed that since,she had problems with her relations with and customers.duncan observed there have been specific complaints regarding verga attitude on the job over the past years or so.these complaints have been from numerous and supervisors indicating that verga was not just targeted by selected individuals.
in duncan opinion,verga work conflicts were caused by her own inappropriate behaviors and actions and a substantial portion of the stress she experienced was due to personnel actions and decisions that presumably were made in good faith.therefore,duncan opined that verga did not meet the criteria necessary for an industrial etiology.
the wcj found that verga did not sustain an injury to her psyche arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.noting there was conflicting evidence regarding what had happened during verga employment,the wcj found that verga testimony was not as credible as was the evidence presented by other employees of united airlines.the wcj discounted verga version of what occurred at the meeting on january,and found that verga was hard to get along with and caused the job to be difficult and stressful.
the wcj concluded that false perceptions of the working environment do not constitute actual events of employment.hence,verga failed to establish an actual event of employment was the predominant cause of her injury within the meaning of section.
after verga filed a petition for reconsideration,the wcj submitted to the wcab a report and recommendation clarifying the basis for the wcj decision.it explained that verga believed she was entitled to compensation based on her honest perception of what happened at work,and on her doctor medical evaluation based on verga misperception of events.the wcj noted,however,that mental disabilities are compensable only when arising out of actual events of employment,not unfounded perceptions such as verga claim that she was harassed and persecuted.the wcj found that verga was not actually subject to harassment or persecution,she instead brought upon herself the disdain of her.that disdain is not an actual event of employment.accordingly,the wcj concluded that because verga did not sustain an injury to her psyche arising out of the course of her employment,it was unnecessary to reach the issue of whether her injury resulted from a good faith personnel action.
the wcab adopted the wcj decision and denied reconsideration.
discussion 
in assessing verga request for relief,we apply the following standards of review.the wcab findings on questions of fact are conclusive where supported by substantial evidence,department of rehabilitation workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,hereafter department of rehabilitation.however,the construction of labor statutes and their applicability to a given situation are matters of law subject to our independent review.department of rehabilitation,supra,cal th at,d,rex club workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.even so,the wcab statutory interpretation is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
substantial evidence supports the wcab factual findings that verga supervisor and did not persecute or harass her instead,it was verga who caused the conflict and then misperceived as harassment her disdainful response to her mistreatment of them.indeed,ample evidence showed verga was rude,inflexible and easily upset,and caused stress to,who at the staff meeting on january,advised verga of their dissatisfaction with her behavior.
thus,we turn to the wcab legal conclusion that verga was not entitled to workers compensation benefits for psychiatric injury because being the subject of her disdain in response to verga own inappropriate behavior was not an actual event of employment that predominately caused her psychiatric injury.
verga contends that it does not matter whether the events of her employment occurred as she recalls or as found by the wcab.either way,she argues,they were actual events of employment that caused her stress and resulting psychological injury.in her view,the wcab improperly introduced an element of fault into the workers compensation system by finding that verga can not recover compensation because the workplace events that caused her psychological trauma were in response to her own bad behavior.
for reasons that follow,we agree with the wcab that an employee can not recover workers compensation benefits under the circumstances of this case.
section,which governs workers compensation for psychiatric injuries,states in pertinent part in order to establish that a psychiatric injury is compensable,an employee shall demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that actual events of employment were predominant as to all causes combined of the psychiatric injury,s
