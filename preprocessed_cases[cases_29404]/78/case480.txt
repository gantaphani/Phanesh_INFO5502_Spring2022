plaintiff dean hartline hartline sued ann collins collins and her employer kaiser permanente for personal injuries following a car accident.after the trial court granted the motion of kaiser foundation hospitals sued as kaiser permanente,hereafter kaiser for summary adjudication of hartline vicarious liability cause of action,hartline dismissed his remaining premises liability cause of action against kaiser and judgment was entered in kaiser favor.kaiser filed a memorandum of costs including a request for expert witness fees based on plaintiff failure to accept its offer made pursuant to code of civil procedure section hartline filed a notice of appeal from the judgment and then a motion to tax kaiser costs for medical records and expert witness fees,claiming as to the expert witness fees kaiser section offer was not made in good faith.the trial court denied hartline objection that the section offer was not made in good faith and granted kaiser its postoffer expert witness fees of.hartline filed a second notice of appeal from the award of costs.
on appeal hartline contends the trial court erred in granting kaiser motion for summary adjudication on his vicarious liability claim because the premises line rule from the area of workers compensation law should apply to hartline respondeat superior claim,and finding kaiser section offer was made in good faith.we reject hartline claims and shall affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
collins was employed in august as a staff physical therapist in the orthopedics clinic at kaiser hospital on morse avenue in sacramento.collins left her home about on august,to drive to work.as she turned left off the street into the driveway to kaiser parking lot,she struck hartline and his dog as they were walking across the driveway.
kaiser does not pay for any of collins transportation costs or car insurance.collins regular work hours at the morse avenue facility were to,monday through friday.the accident occurred shortly before 
hartline filed a civil complaint alleging negligence against both collins and kaiser and premises liability against kaiser.
kaiser brought a motion for summary adjudication of the negligence cause of action,claiming there were no triable issues of fact as to kaiser because the application of the rule precluded it from being vicariously liable for collins actions.hartline opposed the motion for summary adjudication,contending a triable issue of material fact existed as to whether collins was acting in the scope of her employment at the time of the accident.hartline contended the premises line rule,recognized in workers compensation law for purposes of applying the rule,should be applied to this case involving respondeat superior.the trial court granted kaiser motion.hartline filed a motion for reconsideration and relief from excusable neglect under section,which kaiser opposed and the trial court denied.
approximately four months later,kaiser sent an offer to compromise pursuant to section to hartline.kaiser offered to waive costs in exchange for the entry of a request for dismissal with prejudice.
the following day,hartline sent kaiser a request for a stipulation allowing dismissal of the remaining cause of action against kaiser and entry of judgment in favor of kaiser for the purpose of allowing appeal of the summary adjudication decision.
hartline did not accept kaiser offer to compromise and kaiser did not sign hartline stipulation for dismissal and judgment.after hartline motion for dismissal of the remaining cause of action was denied by the trial court,hartline filed a request for dismissal of the cause of action for direct negligence against defendant kaiser permanente only.dismissal was entered.subsequently,judgment was entered for kaiser.
kaiser filed a memorandum of costs seeking a total of in costs,including in expert witness fees pursuant to section.hartline filed a motion to tax costs,arguing with regard to the claim for expert witness fees that the section offer was not made in good faith and there was no proof the requested fees were all incurred after the section offer was made.kaiser opposed the motion to tax its costs,although it reduced its claim for expert witness fees to.

we decide the question on appeal from summary adjudication using the same method as the trial court.a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication shall be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.in determining whether the papers show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact the court shall consider all of the evidence set forth in the papers,except that to which objections have been made and sustained by the court,and all inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence,subd.c.a defendant has met its burden of showing a cause of action has no merit if it has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established,or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.once the defendant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the plaintiff to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action or a defense thereto.the plaintiff may not rely upon the mere allegations or denials of its pleadings to show a triable issue of material fact exists but,instead,shall set forth the specific facts showing that a triable issue of material fact exists,subd.p.on review of an order granting or denying summary judgment or summary adjudication,we examine the facts presented to the trial court and determine their effect as a matter of law.parsons crown disposal cal th,d.

b.the trial court summary adjudication of hartline negligence cause of action against kaiser 
the rule of respondeat superior is familiar and simply stated an employer is vicariously liable for the torts of its employees committed within the scope of the employment.citation.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital cal th,d.the plaintiff has the burden of proof to demonstrate the negligent act of the employee was committed within the scope of employment.ducey argo sales cal d,yamaguchi harnsmut th,d.whether an act is within the scope of employment is a question of fact,unless the facts are undisputed and no conflicting inferences are possible,in which case the question is one of law.lisa henry mayo newhall memorial hospital,supra,at,d,john chaparral treatment center,th,d.
under the going and coming rule,an employee going to or coming home from work is ordinarily considered outside the scope of employment so that the employer is not liable for his torts.hinman westinghouse cal d,hinman.the going and coming rule is sometimes ascribed to the theory that the employment relationship is suspended from the time the employee leaves until he returns citation,or that in commuting he is not rendering service to his employer.citation.ibid.
kaiser claimed in its motion for summary adjudication it could not be vicariously held liable under the rule of respondeat superior based on the rule.according to kaiser,the undisputed evidence established collins was going to work from her home at the time of the accident.kaiser contended none of the established exceptions to the rule applied because collins was not on a special errand for kaiser,kaiser did not defray collins travel expenses and did not compensate her for her travel time,and kaiser did not require collins,as a condition of her employment,commute to work in her personal car.
hartline argued the rule did not preclude liability because a triable issue of material fact existed as to whether collins was acting within the scope of employment based on the premises rule as explained by the court in santa rosa junior college workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,santa rosa.
the trial court granted kaiser motion for summary adjudication based on hartline failure to demonstrate the existence of a triable issue of material fact after kaiser presented facts showing the applicability of the rule.the trial court stated even if the court were to apply the premises line rule here,a factual predicate is close proximity to the workplace,the parking lot used by employees.here,however,collins allegedly struck plaintiff just off the street,at the entrance to the parking lot,not in the parking lot itself the premises line rule,therefore,could not apply.
c.the premises line rule 
in santa rosa,supra,cal d,a college instructor was killed in an accident while driving his personal car home from work.the california supreme court applied the rule,reversing the workers compensation appeals board award of workers compensation death benefits to the instructor widow.the supreme court stated,the facts in this case do not fit convincingly into any of the established limitations or exceptions because the instructor accident occurred miles away from the college campus,exceptions to the premises line doctrine can not reasonably be invoked to render the going and coming rule inapplicable.id.at,fn.omitted.
although the premises line rule was not applicable,the california supreme court in santa rosa explained in a footnote the substance of the rule as it had been applied in workers compensation law.for purposes of applying the going and coming rule,the employment relationship begins when the employee enters the employer premises.santa rosa,supra,cal d at,fn.indeed,injuries sustained in close proximity to the employer premises may,in fact arise out of the employment,especially when the accident occurs in the parking lot used by employees or on public property immediately adjacent to the workplace.recognizing this,we have defined the course of employment to include a reasonable margin of time and space necessary to be used in passing to and from the place where the work is to be done.see lewis workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,see pacific indem.industrial acc.commission cal d.i 
hartline argues the premises line rule,as used in workers compensation law,should apply to this case involving respondeat superior,although no published case has previously so applied the rule.hartline argues this result should follow from the california supreme court statements that the test under workers compensation law for whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment,is closely related to the test for whether an employee is acting within the scope of employment under respondeat superior hinman,supra,cal d at,fn,and that i n the going and coming cases,the california courts often cite tort and workers compensation cases interchangeably.ducey argo sales,supra,cal d at.hartline contends public policy favors the adoption of the premises line rule for purposes of respondeat superior.finally,hartline contends the trial court incorrectly stated and applied the law regarding the premises line rule to this case.
we reject hartline contention that the premises line rule should apply in civil tort cases involving the rule for purposes of respondeat superior and,therefore,do not need to reach his last claim.
the california supreme court in hinman expressly noted the workers compensation test for whether an injury arises out of and in the course of employment is not identical,although it is closely related,to the test for whether an employee is acting within the scope of employment under respondeat superior.hinman,supra,cal d at,fn.a lthough worker compensation cases can be helpful in determining the employer vicarious liability for its employee torts citation,they are not controlling precedent when liability is predicated upon respondeat superior principles.perez van groningen sons,cal d,fn,see caldwell,d.
in fact,scope of employment for purposes of respondeat superior is more restrictive than arising out of and in the course of employment for workers compensation.saala mcfarland cal d,fn,employee injured by coworker in parking lot received workers compensation benefits as accident occurred on employer premises,but coworker was not acting within scope of employment for purposes of tort liability.that is,i f an injury is within the scope of employment,it will probably be arising out of and occurring in the course of employment however,the reverse is not true.church arko d.rejects argument that the scope of employment for purposes of respondeat superior begins and ends with the round trip to and from the place of employment where an employee finds it convenient or even essential to use a car to travel to and from work.
as the court of appeal in blackman great american first savings bank d,specifically cautioned workers compensation law takes a different approach to exceptions to the rule workers compensation and respondeat superior law are driven in opposite directions based on differing policy considerations.workers compensation has been defined as a type of social insurance designed to protect employees from occupational hazards,while respondeat superior imputes liability to an employer based on an employee fault because of the special relationship.citation.further,courts heed statutory admonitions for a liberal construction favoring coverage in workers compensation cases which are not present in respondeat superior law.id.at.accord,munyon ole d.workers compensation act is a shield protecting injured workers vicarious tort liability is a sword extending tort liability beyond those directly and immediately negligent anderson pacific gas electric th,d.
we conclude the premises line rule,developed in the context of the policies behind workers compensation,does not fit the policy justification for making employers vicariously liable for their employee torts.
the modern justification for respondeat superior is a deliberate policy allocation of risk.hinman,supra,cal d at.that is,an employer liability extends beyond his actual or possible control over the employees to include risks inherent in or created by the enterprise because he,rather than the innocent injured party,is best able to spread the risk through prices,rates or liability insurance.rodgers kemper constr.d.rodgers.a risk is inherent in or created by an enterprise when in the context of the particular enterprise an employee conduct is not so unusual or startling that it would seem unfair to include the loss resulting from it among other costs of the employer business.citations.in other words,where the question is one of vicarious liability,the inquiry should be whether the risk was one that may fairly be regarded as typical of or broadly incidental to the enterprise undertaken by the employer.citation.id.at.see perez van groningen sons,supra,cal d at.respondeat superior liability does not attach simply because employment brought the employee and victim together at a certain time and place.citation.the employee activities must be inherent in,typical of or created by the work so that it is a foreseeable risk of the particular employment.citations.tognazzini san luis coastal unified school dist.th,d,italics added.respondeat superior assigns responsibility to the employer for accidents which may fairly be said to be characteristic of its activities.rodgers,supra,at,quoting ira bushey sons,unites states cir.
