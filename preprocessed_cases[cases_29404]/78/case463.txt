background 
on september,chatman was injured when the logging truck he was driving tipped over.he refused treatment at the accident scene,but went to an emergency room later that day.the doctor at the emergency room diagnosed left scalp and thigh contusions and a right shoulder sprain.he gave chatman a prescription for ibuprofen and told him to follow up with his regular doctor.
beginning september,chatman saw lee kinney of placerville chiropractic sports clinic for treatment.kinney diagnosed cervical,thoracic myalgia,and left knee.he provided treatment every few days for several months.spi disputed the need for continuing treatment and provided chatman with the paperwork to select a medical examiner qme for evaluation pursuant to the provisions of labor code section.chatman filed an application for adjudication of his claim for workers compensation benefits.
to resolve the dispute over medical treatment,chatman selected qme la relle plubell,a chiropractor.plubell saw chatman on february.she concluded the chiropractic treatment provided by kinney up to that date was reasonable and necessary.plubell found no further treatment was necessary and any further treatment was chatman financial responsibility.
chatman and spi settled the dispute through a compromise and release for the payment of.kinney requested allowance of his lien for.
in december,stephen becker,a chiropractor,submitted a physician review letter.based on his review of the medical records,he opined that only the chiropractic care and physical therapy provided on nonconsecutive days through december,were reasonable and necessary to treat chatman minor symptoms.he found the clinical basis for much of kinney diagnosis and treatment to be lacking.becker relied upon the guidelines provided by the american college of occupational and environmental medicine acoem in reaching his conclusions.
trial was held before a workers compensation judge wcj on the lien of kinney in april.spi was granted permission to depose plubell.plubell was aware that the acoem guidelines did not recommend prolonged manipulation for longer than four weeks,so the treatment recommendations would be different under the acoem guidelines.she had no evidence showing why the guidelines should not be followed in this case.she did not apply the acoem guidelines in determining reasonable and necessary treatment because she understood they applied only to injuries occurring after january.
in findings and order dated may,the wcj found,per stipulation of the parties,that the cascaded bill for services by kinney from september,through february,was.the wcj further found the treatment was reasonable and necessary through february,the lien was allowed.
in an opinion on the decision,the wcj noted the acoem guidelines became the standard for treatment that was the subject of a utilization review process under labor code section,subdivision c,on january.effective april,the acoem guidelines became the standard for all treatment.since the treatment at issue was not pursuant to a utilization review process and occurred before april,the acoem guidelines were not applicable to the case.becker physician review letter was not done pursuant to the utilization review procedures of labor code section.since becker had not examined chatman,his letter did not constitute substantial evidence.
spi petitioned for reconsideration,arguing the acoem guidelines were the proper standard for determining the reasonableness of the treatment.
following the recommendation of the wcj,the wcab denied reconsideration.
spi petitioned this court for a writ of review.this court issued the writ.
initially,no response was filed.then,john mooney,dba placerville chiropractic sports clinic,moved to replace kinney with placerville chiropractic sports clinic pcsc as a named defendant and for leave to file a respondent brief.over the objection of spi,the motion was granted.the record supports the motion.all appearances at the lien trial for the lienholder were by pcsc.all correspondence by kinney about the case was on the letterhead of pcsc.spi own paperwork on benefits indicates the provider of services was pcsc.the patient information for chatman appears on pcsc letterhead.
amici briefs in support of the position of pcsc have been filed by west coast surgery centers management,llc,and california society of industrial medicine surgery.gibraltar electro medical services filed an amicus brief in support of spi.
discussion 
the wcab findings on questions of fact are conclusive.the construction of a statute and its applicability to a given case,however,are questions of law to be determined by courts.rex club workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.while the wcab interpretation of the provisions of the labor code is entitled to respect,if it is wrong,it is wrong,and we are not bound by it.stores,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.an erroneous interpretation or application of the law is grounds for annulment of the wcab decision.rex club workers comp.appeals,supra,at,d.
labor code section provides that the employer shall provide the medical,surgical,chiropractic,acupuncture,and hospital treatment that is reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured worker from the effects of his injury,subd.a all further undesignated section references are to the labor code.sb,a package of workers compensation reforms,amended section to add new subdivision b,which provides as used in this division and notwithstanding any other provision of law,medical treatment that is reasonably required to cure or relieve the injured worker from the effects of his or her injury means treatment that is based upon the guidelines adopted by the administrative director pursuant to section or,prior to the adoption of those guidelines,the updated american college of occupational and environmental medicine occupational medicine practice guidelines.stats,ch.
sb went into effect immediately on april,as an urgency measure to provide relief to the state from the effects of the current workers compensation crisis at the earliest possible time.stats,ch.
generally,statutes operate prospectively only.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.t he principle that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has timeless and universal appeal.id.at,d,quoting landgraf usi film products,d.
it is an established canon of interpretation that statutes are not to be given a retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the legislative intent.citations.aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d.a retrospective law is one which affects rights,obligations,acts,transactions and conditions which are performed or exist prior to the adoption of the statute.citations.id.at.where a law makes changes relating to remedies or modes of procedure,rather than substance,the law applies to existing causes of action and defenses without having retrospective effect.p rocedural statutes may become operative only when and if the procedure or remedy is invoked,and if the trial postdates the enactment,the statute operates in the future regardless of the time of occurrence of the events giving rise to the cause of action.citation.in such cases the statutory changes are said to apply not because they constitute an exception to the rule of statutory construction,but because they are not in fact retrospective.there is then no problem as to whether the legislature intended the changes to operate retroactively.id.at.
spi contends reimbursement for medical care is a procedural right amended section,subdivision b merely affects the calculation of what treatment will be paid.the california supreme court,however,has held a statute changing the measure or method of computing compensation for disability or death is a substantive change.aetna cas.surety.acc,supra,cal d at.in aetna,the high court considered whether a amendment that permitted both temporary and permanent disability payments in some cases,instead of only the greater,applied to injuries that occurred before enactment of the amended statute.the court held the amendment increased the amount of compensation above what was payable at the date of injury,and to that extent it enlarged the employee existing rights and the employer corresponding obligations.the amendment is therefore clearly substantive in character,and the commission,by applying it in the present proceedings,gave it a retrospective operation.id.at.
here,amended section,subdivision b provided new guidelines for determining necessary and reasonable medical treatment.the effect of these new guidelines in this case was to reduce the amount of chiropractic treatment that would be deemed necessary and reasonable and which must be paid for by the employer.thus,the change would affect the employee rights and the employer corresponding obligations.aetna cas.surety.acc,supra,cal d at.since the change in the law was substantive,we must consider whether the legislature intended it to have retrospective operation.
the operative effect of sb is set forth in an uncodified provision,section the amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award of the workers compensation appeals board.stats,ch,section.
spi contends this language requires that the provisions of sb be applied to all cases that are not final regardless of the date of injury.therefore,spi argues,the acoem guidelines should be applied in this case to determine whether the treatment kinney provided was reasonable and necessary.
spi relies on kleemann workers comp.appeals bd.th,d kleemann and rio linda union school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d rio linda,and contends those cases establish that the provisions of sb should be given retroactive effect to all pending cases.both cases addressed the application of the changes sb made to apportionment based on causation to pending workers compensation cases.sb repealed former section and added a new section and a new section,which among other things required apportionment of permanent disability based on causation.stats,ch.in finding the new statutory scheme of apportionment applied to pending cases,both kleemann and rio linda relied in part on the rule that a repeal of a statutory right is subject to different rules than the traditional law governing prospective or retroactive application of a statute.when new legislation repeals existing law,statutory rights normally end with repeal unless the rights are vested pursuant to contract or common law.kleemann,supra,at,d accord rio linda,supra,at,d.
the rule relating to repeal of statutes was applicable because the legislature by sb repealed the purely statutory right to workers compensation for any industrial injury resulting in permanent disability because of the aggravation of a prior nondisabling disease as may reasonably be attributed to the injury.rio linda,supra,th at,d see also kleemann,supra,th at,d.the use of the word prospectively in section did not change the analysis because the legislature was only trying to clarify and or emphasize that the changes of law contained in sb would apply to pending cases from the date of enactment forward.rio linda,supra,at,d.
amicus west coast surgery centers management contends kleemann and rio linda are distinguishable because they were based on the rule governing the repeal of statutes and here there was no repeal,only an amendment.the rule,however,may also include amendments.where,as here,the legislature has conferred a remedy and withdraws it by amendment or repeal of the remedial statute,the new statutory scheme may be applied to pending actions without triggering retrospectivity concerns citation as a general rule,a cause of action or remedy dependent on a statute falls with a repeal of a statute,even after the action thereon is pending,in the absence of a saving clause in the repealing statute.citations.the justification for this rule is that all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right at any time.citation.brenton metabolife internat.th,d.
the determination of whether the legislative action is a repeal turns on the substance of the legislation.zipperer county of santa clara th,d.the pivotal issue is whether the legislation constitutes a substantial reversal of legislative policy that represents the adoption of an entirely new philosophy the prior enactment.citation.id.at,d.while the changes to the rules of apportionment appear to reflect a new philosophy,we can not say the same as to the amendment that changed the standards for determining reasonable medical treatment.section still requires an employer to pay for medical treatment that is reasonably required to cure or relieve an industrial injury.the adoption of acoem guidelines appears to be only a recognition of changes in medical practice and procedures and the adoption of medicine.while in this case,the new guidelines result in less treatment being reasonable,spi has not provided the guidelines so we can not say that in all cases only less treatment will be presumed reasonable.the amendment to section did not abolish the right to recover.callet alioto cal.
distinguishing kleemann and rio linda on the basis that they involved a repeal and this case involves an amendment is not persuasive because section indicates the operative effect of sb is the same for repeals and amendments.the amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award of the workers compensation appeals board.stats,ch,section.
the usual rule is that the law in effect on the date of injury governs in workers compensation cases because the industrial injury is the basis for the award.aetna cas.surety.acc,supra,cal d at.section changes this usual rule by providing that sb applies regardless of the date of injury.instead,the provisions of sb apply prospectively from the date of enactment,but are not grounds to reopen,rescind,alter or amend an existing order.thus,we interpret section to require application of the acoem guidelines to determine reasonable medical treatment to all cases in which there is not an order as of the date of enactment of sb.
pcsc and amici contend that applying the acoem guidelines to medical treatment that wa
