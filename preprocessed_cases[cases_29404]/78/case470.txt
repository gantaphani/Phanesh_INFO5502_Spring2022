in this opinion we must determine the appropriate method of apportioning liability between two workers compensation injuries as conjured by the legislature in reforming the workers compensation laws by enacting senate bill.we conclude that where an employee sustains multiple disabling injuries while working for the same employer,the employee is entitled to compensation for the total disability above any percentage of permanent disability previously awarded.in this narrow context,we see no reason to treat an employee who has been injured twice differently from a similarly situated employee who is injured once with the same level of disability.our conclusion benefits employers by ensuring there can be no double recovery for the same disability it benefits the employee by providing equitable compensation under the exponentially progressive nature of the workers compensation system.this approach best meets the legislative goal of bringing stability to what had become an unworkable statutory scheme.
factual history 
david dykes injured his back while working as a winery worker for e j gallo winery gallo in september.as a result of the injury,a workers compensation administrative law judge wcj approved a stipulated agreement on march,to provide dykes with future medical care and a percent permanent disability award worth in compensation.dykes returned to work with gallo with a lighter duty and a medical restriction of lifting up to pounds.by january,his condition improved and his work restrictions were lifted.
on october,dykes again injured his back while working for gallo.following a november workers compensation hearing,a wcj determined that dykes was temporarily totally disabled between november,through march,when he became percent permanently disabled.adjusting for dykes age and occupation,a percent disability award translated to a weekly payment over weeks for a total sum of.from the award,the wcj subtracted the in compensation previously paid to settle dykes back injury,as well as percent in attorney fees.the wcj also awarded dykes future medical treatment as reasonably necessary to cure or relieve the injury.gallo was permissibly for purposes of workers compensation at the time of both injuries.see denny workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
gallo timely petitioned the workers compensation appeals board wcab for reconsideration,contending that the labor code mandated subtracting the percentage,not dollar amount,of the prior award from dykes disability award.the wcj advised the wcab in a report and recommendation by repeating her original analysis without addressing the calculation issue.on january,wcab commissioners frank brass,william,and janice jamison murray summarily denied reconsideration by adopting and incorporating the reasoning from the wcj report.
discussion 
the legislature enacted senate bill bill,effective april,as a comprehensive plan to reform the workers compensation system.among the reforms,the legislation amended the standards of apportionment,the process of segregating the residuals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries,or to nonindustrial factors,in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.marsh workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
before the enactment of bill,apportionment was concerned with the disability,not its cause or pathology.marsh workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.because the statutes focused on disability,an employer could be liable to the full extent an industrial injury accelerates,aggravates,or lights up a nondisabling preexisting disease,condition,or physical impairment.ibid.
establishing new apportionment provisions for specific injuries,bill repealed sections,and and enacted new sections and.stats,ch.sections and applied to antecedent injuries,while section applied to subsequent injuries.fresno unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.under the earlier section,the aggravation of a preexisting disease or compensable injury was allowed only for the proportion of the disability due to the aggravation of such prior disease which is reasonably attributed to the injury.former section prevented an industrially injured employee suffering from a previous permanent disability or physical impairment from receiving a workers compensation award greater than he or she would otherwise receive for the later injury alone and limited the employer liability to only that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.
now,apportionment is based on causation and the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment,subd.a,subd.a.the plain reading of causation in this context is causation of the permanent disability.escobedo marshalls,en banc,review den.examining physicians therefore must make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries,subd.c.the legislature also added a new conclusive presumption affecting the burden of proof that a prior permanent disability exists whenever an employee has received a prior permanent disability award,subd.b.in short,bill provides for apportionment based on either nonindustrial factors sufficiently described by the medical evidence,subd.c or as previously awarded to the employee under a prior workers compensation claim,subd.b.
after a rocky transition period,it is now well settled that,consistent with the legislature intent,the apportionment provisions of bill must be applied to all cases not yet final at the time of the legislative enactment on april,regardless of the earlier dates of injury and any interim decisions.marsh workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d see also rio linda union school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d review den,kleemann workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,review den.may.applying bill new apportionment provisions to dykes workers compensation claim,the wcab found apportionment was not warranted on any nonindustrial grounds,subd.c,but that his prior disability award must be taken into account,subd.b.the parties agree apportionment of the prior award is appropriate but disagree how to calculate the current award.
in petitioning us for review,gallo contends that instead of subtracting the dollar amount of the award from the dollar amount of dykes current level of disability,as the wcab did here,the wcab should have reduced dykes current percent level of permanent disability by the percent level of permanent disability from the stipulated award.gallo believes the clear,unambiguous,and plain wording of sections and requires that the percentage of permanent disability previously awarded must be deducted to arrive at the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the new injury.

ii.fuentes workers compensation appeals board 
in fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,the supreme court established under the former apportionment provisions the appropriate method of determining the extent of an employer liability for an employee industrial injury resulting in permanent disability in those cases in which a portion of the disability is attributable to a preexisting injury.fuentes addressed a amendment to the permanent disability schedule under section changing the method of computing the number of weeks an employee was entitled to workers compensation indemnity payments.before april,each percentage point of an industrially related permanent disability entitled the injured worker to four weeks of compensation at the employee applicable indemnity rate.fuentes workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.after the amendment,however,the number of weekly benefits increases exponentially in proportion to the percentage of the disability.ibid.the supreme court explained that the new exponentially progressive workers compensation system created a difficulty in apportioning out the nonindustrial portion of a disability and gave rise to three potential methods of computing the number of weekly benefits,which the supreme court named formulas a,b,and id.at.
under formula a,which gallo contends the wcab should have applied here and which was ultimately adopted by the supreme court in fuentes,the percentage of the nonindustrial permanent disability is subtracted from the percentage of the employee overall level of total disability to determine the compensable level of permanent disability.the resulting percentage is then converted to a dollar amount under the compensation schedules set forth under section.in the present case,this formula subtracts percent of permanent disability attributable to dykes settled award from his current percent permanent disability,resulting in a net percent permanent disability.for dykes,a percent permanent disability warrants weeks of benefits at per week,for a total award of.formula a percent total percent prior disability percent apportioned disability weeks x per week award.
formula b,rejected by fuentes,examines the overall disability and then determines the number of weeks it should be paid.this formula first looks to the number of weeks in which benefits are statutorily authorized under section for the total level of current disability and multiplies that number of weeks by the percentage of the injury that was industrially related.here,dykes percent level of overall disability warrants weeks of disability payments per the workers compensation tables.about percent of dykes present percent permanent disability was caused by the recent injury while working for gallo.percent percent percent.formula b multiplies weeks times percent,resulting in approximately weeks of payments amounting to in aggregate payments.formula b percent total disability weeks x percent relative disability weeks x per week award.
formula c,also rejected by fuentes,is the method the wcab applied in determining dykes award.this formula first determines the monetary value of the injured employee overall permanent disability and subtracts the monetary value of the percentage of permanent disability from the noncompensable disability.adopting the wcj reasoning,the wcab here calculated that dykes current disability of percent warranted weeks of weekly payments for an aggregate benefit of,and then subtracted the value of his percent disability established under the settlement,resulting in a current award.formula c value of total percent disability value of prior percent disability award.
dykes believes the wcj appropriately applied formula c to his award under the supreme court reasoning in fuentes.in that case,the supreme court adopted formula a,and rejected formulas b and c,as required by the express and unequivocal language of section fuentes workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.dykes argues that by repealing section,the legislature must have intended to compensate injured workers in an amount more closely related to the full extent of their disability without considering the former overriding policy of encouraging employers to hire an employee with a disability.repealed by bill,section previously provided 
an employee who is suffering from a previous permanent disability or physical impairment and sustains permanent injury thereafter shall not receive from the employer compensation for the later injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment.
the employer shall not be liable for compensation to such an employee for the combined disability,but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.
examining the legislative intent of section,the supreme court concluded 
t he purpose of that statute is to encourage employers to hire physically handicapped persons.the legislature recognized that employers might refrain from engaging the services of the handicapped if,upon subsequent injury,an employer was required to compensate the employee for an aggregate disability which included a previous injury.citations.in enacting section,the legislature has expressed a clear intent that the liability of one who employs a previously disabled worker shall,in the event of a subsequent injury,be limited to that percentage of the disability resulting from the later harm considered alone and as if it were the original injury.fuentes workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.
in fuentes,the supreme court dismissed consideration of formulas b and c because they resulted in awards too closely aligned with the amount of compensation the employee would receive without apportioning the award.this arithmetic leads to the inevitable conclusion that neither method b nor c can be reconciled with the mandate of section that the compensation for a subsequent injury be computed as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.fuentes workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.
iii.nabors piedmont lumber mill company 
after gallo petitioned this court for review,the wcab examined the appropriate method of calculating apportionment under bill in an en banc decision,nabors piedmont lumber mill company,review granted october.four of six wcab three from the panel who denied gallo petition for to new sections,subdivision c and,subdivision a,which both provide for apportionment as a percentage of permanent disability.carrying over the same supreme court public policy considerations set forth in fuentes,despite section repeal,the majority concluded that formula a provided the most appropriate method of apportionment.finding no evidence that the legislature intended to change the formula endorsed by the supreme court in fuentes,the wcab majority reasoned that part of the legislative intent in enacting new sections and was,as in enacting former section,to encourage employers to hire disabled workers.nabors piedmont lumber mill company,supra,at.
separately dissenting from the majority,however,merle rabine believes that the express language of bill requires the application of formula b while commissioner ronnie caplane believes the same express language requires the application of formula chairman rabine suggests section,subdivision a limitation on an employer liability to the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the industrial injury is best carried out through formula b ratio of the industrial injury to the overall disability,rather than formula a subtraction of the nonindustrial or previously awarded disability from the overall percentage of permanent disability.nabors piedmont lumber mill company,supra,at dis.opn.of commissioner rabine.he also points to the lack of any empirical evidence that formula a,over formulas b or c,has had any effect on the stated public policy of encouraging employers to hire the disabled over the nearly years since fuentes.ibid.meanwhile,commissioner caplane argues for adoption of formula c because the legislature must have intended a change by amending the statutes.she also finds it is manifestly unfair under the progressive workers compensation system to compensate an employee with apportioned multiple industrial injuries less than if the employee had suffered a single industrial injury resulting in the same level of permanent disability.id.at dis.opn.of commissioner caplane.
iv.fuentes is not controlling after bill 
we are unconvinced by the nabors majority that the reasons for adopting formula a are as compelling today as in when the supreme court addressed the issue in fuentes.fuentes repeatedly states its holding was required by the express and unequivocal language of section in fact,the supreme court went so far as to suggest that the repeal of section would create the opportunity to apply another apportionment formula.fuentes workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at,the application of either formula b or c would require us to discern an intent on the part of the legislature that the amendments to section function so as to effect a repeal or at least a partial repeal of section.the supreme court refused,however,to infer a repeal of section because it could harmonize that provision with the newly enacted exponentially progressive system under section.
a year after deciding fuentes,the supreme court confirmed in wilkinson workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,that its adoption of formula a rested exclusively on section 
fuentes interpreted section in such a way that the worker who incurs a single injury will usually receive greater benefits than one who incurred successive injuries resulting in the same total disability.our opinion in fuentes,however,did not rest upon any broad proposition that awards based upon a combined disability rating are inequitable,but upon the narrower proposition that such awards contravene the language and policy of section.
the legislature has now repealed section and its replacement,section,is notably distinct 
while both former section and new section address the broad issue of apportioning liability between multiple injuries,they invoke significantly different approaches of achieving that same goal.former section limited the employer liability for the injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to the previous disability or impairment and only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.the supreme court holding in fuentes expressly rested on this language in section that the level of permanent disability caused by a subsequent injury was to be determined without reference to or consideration of the employee prior condition.bill reversed that policy.now,a prior award is conclusively presumed to exist as a means of establishing the level of permanent disability directly caused by the subsequent injury,subd.b.evaluating physicians must also make similar apportionment percentage determinations,subd.c.the wcab may no longer apportion liability without considering a prior or other noncompensable disability.
we are also not persuaded by the nabors majority that the public policy of encouraging employers to hire the disabled dictates retaining fuentes formula a in calculating apportionment between multiple injuries.under bill,apportionment of liability remains a central tenet to the workers compensation system.because apportionment is now based on causation,and prior permanent disability awards are presumed to exist at the time of any subsequent injury,employers still have an incentive to hire the disabled under bill.as chairman rabine noted in his nabors dissent,there is no evidence in the record that any apportionment formula promotes hiring the disabled better than another.further,the reliance on apportionment alone as a means of encouraging employers to hire the disabled is not as necessary today as when the legislature first enacted section.during the years since fuentes,disability discrimination has been expressly outlawed by other statutory schemes.see,americans with disabilities act of et california fair employment and housing act,et prudence kay poppink act stats,ch.moreover,employers can now avoid costly job displacement benefits of to by retaining workers who sustain disabilities.
when the legislature deletes an express provision of a statute,it is presumed that it intended to effect a substantial change in the law.lockheed martin workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.even the wcab has recently noted there is no doubt that,in repealing former section and in enacting new section,the legislature intended to change the law relating to apportionment of permanent disability.sanchez county of los angeles,mon,wl en banc strong city county of san francisco,wl en banc see also escobedo marshalls,supra,at.although the wcab believes the legislature did not intend a change in policy,we conclude the legislature contemplated a variation in determining apportionment by repealing section and replacing it with different language in section for apportioning liability among multiple injuries.
applicable apportionment formula 
having found that neither the statutory language nor legislative intent necessarily requires the continued application of formula a,we must now determine the meaning of the new apportionment provision that t he employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment,subd.a.we limit our analysis to the present facts where the injured employee received a prior disability award while working for the same employer.
it is well established that we first look to the statutory language as the best evidence of the legislature intent.burden snowden cal th,d.the plain language of section,subdivision a,underscores its simplicity an employer is liable for the direct consequences of a injury,nothing more and nothing less.to determine the employer liability,noncompensable disability is either based on medical evidence,subd.c or conclusively presumed from a previous award,subd.b.moreover,the accumulation of permanent disability awards to any one region of the body may not exceed percent over the employee life except under certain enumerated circumstances,subd.c.as a result,section contemplates accumulating multiple disability awards rather than subtracting percentage levels of disability.
in fuentes,the supreme court considered three options offered by the parties as potential formulaic approaches to apportioning liability.since the supreme court decided fuentes,however,the workers compensation system has become even more progressive.see,ante,fn.now,in addition to permanent disability tables providing for exponentially progressive higher number of weeks of payments,the maximum weekly benefit payments also increase at specific levels of permanent disability.applicable during dykes injuries in september and october,the maximum weekly benefit payment levels were as follows 
at the time of both of dykes injuries,a percent level of disability translated to weekly payments of totaling a percent level of permanent disability warranted weekly payments of totaling and a percent level of permanent disability paid weekly payments of totaling.this expanded,exponentially progressive compensation system gives rise to another question not considered by the supreme court in fuentes should the maximum weekly benefit rate be determined before or after apportionment taking into consideration the higher maximum weekly benefit because dykes is,per the medical evidence adopted by the wcab,currently percent disabled,formulas a and b would result in awards of and under the current expanded,exponentially progressive nature of the workers compensation tables,we can therefore extract at least five possible interpretations of calculating apportionment among multiple final awards as varied as,and taking into account the same underlying facts that dykes became percent permanently disabled after having previously received a percent disability award.
determining the appropriate approach to calculating an apportioned award is further complicated by section,which authorizes a life pension of percent of the employee average weekly earnings for each percent of disability over percent once the permanent disability award payments cease i
