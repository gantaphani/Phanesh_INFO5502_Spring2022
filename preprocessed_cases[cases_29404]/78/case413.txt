swat handles situations for the bhpd,including riot control and serving warrants in potentially dangerous conditions.officers assigned to swat are on call hours a day,seven days a week.assignment to swat is voluntary.officers are required to pass a physical fitness test prior to joining swat and to pass an annual physical fitness test involving a run,climbing a wall,and dragging pounds.if an officer fails to qualify for swat,he or she is still eligible for employment as an officer with the bhpd.those officers not in swat do not have to pass such periodic physical fitness tests.officer tomlin testified that a member of swat recently was reprimanded for not being physically fit when the officer failed to climb a wall while on assignment.
the bhpd pays officer tomlin to train four days each month,and has sent him to train at camp pendleton and out of state.officer tomlin otherwise maintains his physical fitness by running,bicycle riding,and weight lifting with other swat team members outside of work.he is not paid for these outside workouts.officer tomlin has been running three or four times a week for the past years,and covers three to six miles per run.he normally runs while on vacation to maintain his fitness.
in november,a supervisor informed swat members that swat annual physical fitness test would be administered in january.officer tomlin began a course of fitness training to prepare for the test,and expected to continue training during a vacation he had scheduled from december,to january.officer tomlin was not directed by a supervisor to train during his vacation,and he did not inform his supervisors that he would continue training during vacation.he believed,however,that it was expected that he would continue to train for the physical fitness test during his vacation.
on december,while on vacation in jackson,wyoming,officer tomlin went for a run.near the end of the run,he slipped on a sidewalk when rounding a corner.his left foot struck the curb as he fell,and he broke his left ankle.although there was a reference to the sidewalk being slippery,there is no indication in the record that the injury resulted from the terrain or inclement conditions.the injury required surgery and kept officer tomlin out of work until march,when he was able to resume work with modified duties.he later resumed his full duties.he was unable to take the january physical fitness exam,but took and passed a subsequent test.

discussion 
standard of review 
when there is no real dispute as to the facts,the question of whether an injury was suffered in the course of employment is one of law,and a purported finding of fact on that question is not binding on an appellate court.citations.city of los angeles workers comp.appeals bd.th,d accord,dimmig workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.accordingly,whether it was objectively reasonable for an employee to believe that his or her employer expected participation in an recreational,social or athletic activity is a question of law that we determine independently.city of stockton workers comp.appeals bd.th,d city of stockton.
