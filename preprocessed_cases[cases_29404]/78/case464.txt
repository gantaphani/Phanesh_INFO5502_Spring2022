defendant glenn brodeur hired plaintiff ernesto mendoza,an unlicensed roofer,to replace his roof.after a few hours on the job,plaintiff fell from the roof and was injured.plaintiff contended that defendant did not provide workers compensation insurance.in plaintiff personal injury action,the trial court granted defendant motion for summary judgment on the ground that plaintiff was not an employee under workers compensation law and plaintiff had not come forward with evidence supporting a triable issue of fact for tort liability.
plaintiff contends that summary judgment is unwarranted.we agree.under labor code section and applicable case law,plaintiff is defendant employee for purposes of tort liability.in the summary judgment proceedings below,which involved only an issue of law,it was premature to require plaintiff to come forward with evidence of defendant negligence.accordingly,we reverse.
background 
factual background 
the facts,as set forth in defendant separate statement of material facts and plaintiff response thereto,are undisputed except where noted.
defendant,a school teacher,lives on avenue in oakland.he and plaintiff are neighbors.defendant needed roofing work done on his home.he either learned that plaintiff was a roofer by trade or,according to plaintiff,saw plaintiff working on another roof.plaintiff claims that defendant and his handyman,robert harris,approached plaintiff and asked him to work on defendant roof.in any case,the parties agree that defendant hired plaintiff to replace the roof on his house plaintiff agreed to do at least the bulk of the work for a set price.defendant did not agree to pay plaintiff for his time.
plaintiff and a group of individuals he had retained to assist him started work on defendant roof on july.the parties dispute who controlled the jobsite.in his separate statement and supporting declaration,defendant states that plaintiff at all times prior to his injury retained control of the work and the worksite,and had the right to control,and had discretion as to the manner of,the work.defendant claimed he did not control the worksite,had no authority over plaintiff assistants,did not provide plaintiff with tools,and did not tell him when to start and stop work.
plaintiff,in his response to defendant separate statement,states that harris,whom he describes as defendant employee,was in charge of and was supervising the job.plaintiff also presented excerpts from his deposition,in which he repeatedly testified that harris supervised the work or was in charge of the job.plaintiff also took the position that as an employer,defendant was in control of the worksite and the work as a matter of law.
on the same day that he started working on defendant roof,and after working no more than four hours,plaintiff fell off the roof and was injured.
statutory background 
this case involves the interplay of several statutes.insurance code section requires comprehensive personal liability insurance policies to include a provision for workers compensation for any person defined as an employee by subdivision d of section of the labor code.
section,which defines employee for purposes of workers compensation,provides in subdivision d that an employee is any person employed by the owner or occupant of a residential dwelling whose duties are incidental to the ownership,maintenance,or use of the dwelling,including the care and supervision of children,or whose duties are personal and not in the course of the trade,business,profession,or occupation of the owner or occupant.
section excludes certain persons from the section definitions of employee,and thus excludes them from workers compensation coverage.the exclusion pertinent here is section h,which excludes from the definition of employee a person defined by section d,but who was only employed less than hours in the calendar days prior to the injury 
section authorizes an employee who is not excluded from compensation coverage to sue his employer in tort if the employer does not have workers compensation insurance.the statute provides if any employer fails to secure the payment of workers compensation,any injured employee or his dependents may bring an action at law against such employer for damages,as if this division did not apply.the reference this division is to division of the labor code,which governs workers compensation.et.
finally,section creates a rebuttable presumption that a worker performing services for which a license is required is an employee and not an independent contractor.the statute also makes a valid license a condition of independent contractor status.the supreme court has interpreted this statute to provide that the person lacking the requisite license may not be an independent contractor.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,state fund see cedillo workers comp.appeals bd.th,d cedillo.accordingly,the presumption that the person who employs the unlicensed contractor is the employer is conclusive.citations.cedillo,supra,at,d.
section is not a part of the workers compensation law,but is contained in division of the labor deals with the relationship.but by its own terms the statute supplements,and applies to,workers compensation law.see state fund,supra,cal d at,cedillo,supra,th at,d.
procedural background 
using a form complaint,plaintiff sued defendant for general negligence,and sought general compensatory damages as well as lost wages and hospital and medical expenses.in his negligence cause of action,plaintiff alleged plaintiff was hired as an employee by defendant brodeur to do roofing work on defendant home.defendant failed to provide the proper safety protection,equipment,system or plan.as a proximate cause of such failure plaintiff fell from the roof to the ground,a fall of over feet,severely breaking his leg and ankle,and hitting his head.
plaintiff further alleged,on information and belief,that defendant does not hold workers compensation insurance and plaintiff is entitled to bring this action at law pursuant to section.
thus,plaintiff alleged that he was an employee of defendant,was injured while in defendant employ,and could sue defendant at law because defendant did not have workers compensation insurance.
defendant answered and alleged several affirmative defenses,including that plaintiff exclusive remedy was workers compensation.
defendant then moved for summary judgment.defendant presented evidence,which is undisputed,that at the time of the injury he did have workers compensation coverage as required by insurance code section.the sole legal ground for defendant motion was that labor code section h precluded a finding that plaintiff was defendant he worked less than hours.
defendant conceded for purposes of his motion that plaintiff was not a licensed roofer.defendant made a legal argument,based on two court of appeal decisions,that section did not make plaintiff his employee because that statute does not override the definitions of employee in section and the exclusions from that definition,including section h.
in the conclusion section of his memorandum of points and authorities in support of his motion,defendant briefly argued that he had shown he was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law,and thus the burden shifted to plaintiff to make a prima facie showing of a triable issue of material fact.see aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,aguilar.specifically,defendant argued his evidence and authority establish ed an absence of an employment relationship despite the legal,not evidentiary,focus of his motion,defendant also argued that t he evidence also establishes that no act or omission on the part of defendant caused plaintiff injury.as such,the burden now shifts to plaintiff to establish a triable issue of fact.
in opposing the motion,plaintiff admitted that he was not seeking workers compensation benefits because he was excluded from coverage by section h.plaintiff maintained that under applicable law the exclusion from workers compensation coverage gave him the right to pursue a tort action,and that section with defendant conce
