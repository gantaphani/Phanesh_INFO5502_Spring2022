we have for review the second district court of appeal decision in ets of new orleans,jones,so d dca,which expressly and directly conflicts with the opinion of this court in baughman aetna casualty surety,so d.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.because we conclude that the term court costs as used for purposes of calculating equitable distribution of workers compensation liens is not limited to taxable costs,we quash the second district decision.
brian jones,the claimant in this workers compensation case,was employed by ed smith steel erectors.while on the jobsite,jones had to walk along the top of a partially constructed concrete block wall,through which a segment of pvc pipe protruded.the pipe had been installed by lawhorn plumbing,which was another subcontractor on the project.as jones grabbed the pipe which was two inches in diameter to swing around it,the pipe broke and jones fell eighteen feet to the concrete floor below.as a result of this fall,jones suffered compression fractures and a broken ankle.his permanent injuries resulted in a whole person disability rating of percent.
at the time of jones accident,ets of new orleans ets provided the workers compensation insurance for jones employer.ets eventually paid jones in workers compensation benefits.later,however,jones filed a tort claim against lawhorn plumbing for damages allegedly resulting from its negligence.ets filed a workers compensation lien in that suit.jones and lawhorn plumbing ultimately settled for,and jones then filed a petition in circuit court for equitable distribution of the settlement proceeds in order to satisfy ets workers compensation lien.after an evidentiary hearing,the trial court awarded ets.
on appeal to the second district,ets asserted,among other things,that the trial court overstated the amount of costs that jones was entitled to subtract from his settlement before determining the pro rata share of the award that ets would receive see id.at.in particular,ets argued that the trial court improperly included in its final order of equitable distribution all costs incurred by jones rather than only taxable costs.the second district agreed with ets,concluding that the term court costs within the meaning of section a,florida statutes,means taxable costs instead of all costs.see ets,so d at.accordingly,the second district reversed and remanded on this issue.see id.at.
the question before us in this case is a narrow one whether under section a,the term court costs means taxable costs or whether that term means all costs incurred by the employee in preparing the claim against the third party,subject to the determination that the costs are reasonable.jones maintains that the second district erred in restricting costs to only taxable costs.
section a,florida statutes provides in pertinent part as follows 
upon suit being filed,the employer or the insurance carrier may file in the suit a notice of payment of compensation and medical benefits to the employee or his dependents,which notice shall constitute a lien upon any judgment or settlement recovered to the extent that the court may determine to be their pro rata share for compensation and medical benefits paid or to be paid under the provisions of this law,less their pro rata share of all court costs expended by the plaintiff in the prosecution of the suit including reasonable attorney fees for the plaintiff attorney.in determining the employer or carrier pro rata share of those costs and attorney fees,the employer or carrier shall have deducted from its recovery a percentage amount equal to the percentage of the judgment or settlement which is for costs and attorney fees.subject to this deduction,the employer or carrier shall recover from the judgment or settlement,after costs and attorney fees incurred by the employee or dependent in that suit have been deducted,percent of what it has paid and future benefits to be paid,except,if the employee or dependent can demonstrate to the court that he did not recover the full value of damages sustained,the employer or carrier shall recover from the judgment or settlement,after costs and attorney fees incurred by the employee or dependent in that suit have been deducted,a percentage of what it has paid and future benefits to be paid equal to the percentage that the employee net recovery is of the full value of the employee damages provided,the failure by the employer or carrier to comply with the duty to cooperate imposed by subsection may be taken into account by the trial court in determining the amount of the employer or carrier recovery,and such recovery may be reduced,as the court deems equitable and appropriate under the circumstances 
emphasis supplied.this portion of the statute has remained unchanged since.
because workers compensation benefits are a creature of statute,our analysis of the meaning of court costs must be based on statutory interpretation guided by this court prior case law interpreting the applicable statutes.city of hollywood lombardi,so d.a basic tenet of statutory interpretation is that a statute should be interpreted to give effect to every clause in it,and to accord meaning and harmony to all of its parts.acosta richter,so d.accordingly,statutory phrases are not to be read in isolation,but rather within the context of the entire section.id.at.in other words,j ust as a single word can not be read in isolation,nor can a single provision of a statute a provision that may seem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme.smith united states,d.
when all of the parts of section a are considered together,the construction that is most consistent with the statutory language is that the term all court costs means all costs,rather than merely taxable costs as the second district concluded.although court costs is not defined within section a,the term is used interchangeably within the same subsection with costs.in addition,the statute specifically refers to all court costs expended by the plaintiff and costs incurred by the employee.these expansive provisions for costs are consistent with the interpretation of the term meaning all costs.
the notion that costs,for the purposes of the equitable distribution formula,would be limited to taxable costs fails to take into account the limited nature of taxable costs.a prevailing party is entitled to recover from the losing party all his or her legal costs and charges which shall be included in the judgment,florida statutes.the general rule is that only taxable costs are to be included in any cost judgment.see kelly militana,so d,dca see also mitchell osceola farms,so d,dca 
on the other hand,for purposes of the determination of the equitable distribution formula,the starting point is the employee net recovery.see generally lombardi,so d at.net recovery represents the gross recovery less attorney fees and costs.if the term court costs were construed as limited to taxable costs,the employee would be responsible for nontaxable costs and therefore the amount that the employee would receive would be less than his or her net recovery in addition,the statute reference to judgment or settlement contemplates its applicability to settlements,whereas the term taxable costs refers to those items of costs that are recoverable against adverse parties after judgment.
our prior case law,in fact,directly refutes the notion that court costs under the equitable distribution scheme are limited to taxable costs.in baughman,the carrier brought an action for its pro rata share of the claimant recovery against a third party tortfeasor.so d at.the employee had secured a judgment against a third party tortfeasor that included taxable costs.the trial court,however,did not include court costs incurred but not taxed against the tortfeasor in assessing the carrier pro rata share of court costs.see id.like the present statute,the version of the statute that applied in baughman also used the term court costs.
the court specifically distinguished between court costs incurred by the employee versus taxable costs assessed against the losing party
