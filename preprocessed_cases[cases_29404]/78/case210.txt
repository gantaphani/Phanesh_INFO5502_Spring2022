townley engineering manufacturing company,townley is appealing the jury verdict in favor of william tullis concerning a retaliatory discharge claim under the illinois workers compensation act.for the reasons stated herein,we affirm.
background 
townley hired william tullis in february of at its eldorado,illinois plant for the position of sandblaster.the company manufactures and supplies products used in mining and power plants.after occupying the position of sandblaster for approximately months,tullis was assigned to the production job known as a jigger in the summer of.in this position,tullis assembled and manipulated objects of varying size and weight,preparing them for the application of a urethane lining.during the morning of january,tullis sustained a back injury while lifting a mold.he was taken to a hospital emergency room and was told not to return to work on that day or the next.the physician assistant also advised tullis to rest for hours and to make an appointment for that monday,january with his doctor.on that day,tullis went to see his family physician,cserny,and was given a work slip which said,patient advised to remain on light duty from to of and resume usual activities.tullis returned to work on january and was placed on light duty.the very same day,a accident report was prepared and filed with the state and townley workers compensation insurer to allow tullis to receive payment of his medical bills.during the months of february,march,and april tullis remained on light duty at various times as a result of his injury.because of continued back pain,cserny referred tullis to cannon,a neurosurgeon for an evaluation and possible treatment in june.cannon diagnosed tullis condition as musculosketal pain and recommended physical therapy.upon completion of physical therapy and an mri,cserny on july,gave tullis a physician work slip that said he was able to resume full duty.the day tullis received this work release,he gave it to virgil sanders,townley eldorado general manager,and it was agreed that tullis could return to his regular duties as a jigger with the instruction that he could do whatever made him feel comfortable.
less than six weeks later,on august,tullis called the company and said that he would not be at work because he was going to see his doctor concerning back pain.after a visit with cserny,tullis spoke with sanders and read him the contents of a work slip that cserny provided him that stated he could not return to his present job because of his back pain,but he could do lighter duty work.at this point,sanders and tullis versions of what transpired diverge.tullis claims that he read sanders the note from cserny,which said he probably needed to change jobs and do lighter duty work.in what tullis perceived as a firmer type response,sanders said,bill,we have nothing else lighter.the doctor says you ca do this and that and we really have nothing you can do except lay you off and let you draw unemployment.that way you would still have some type of income.sanders,however,qualified this statement by stating that he would call the main office in florida to see how it wanted to proceed and it was agreed that tullis would call sanders the following day about his situation.in hopes of not being terminated,tullis asked sanders if there was the possibility that he could be transferred to the rubber plant in harrisburg,illinois,stating that he wanted and was willing to work.as per their arrangement,tullis called sanders on august and sanders said that he had not found anything out yet from the florida office,but that all he could do was lay off tullis so that he could receive unemployment,ensuring that tullis would have some type of income.on august,tullis contends that he once again called sanders about his status and received basically the identical answer from sanders as he had gotten the day before.consequently,on august,he filed for unemployment benefits because he believed that he had been laid off.
sanders recalls the exchanges between himself and tullis differently.he remembers tullis saying that despite cserny finding nothing wrong with his back,he still experienced pain.he therefore wanted to know if there was a lighter duty job available.according to sanders,he instructed tullis to report to work the following day.nevertheless,sanders requested that tullis call him the next day,because he was going to the corporate offices in florida then,and would talk to toro townley,the president of the company,about finding tullis a lighter job in an area other than production.sanders denies ever having communicated to tullis that he would be laid off and could draw unemployment.as for the august conversation,sanders claims that he told tullis that he had not been able to talk with townley yet,but he agreed to call him if he could find a position available for him outside of the production area.according to sanders,he never spoke with tullis on august.
sanders stated that he finally spoke with toro townley on august about tullis situation.he informed him that tullis had a problem with his back and needed something lighter to do.sanders characterized tullis as a fairly good worker,but reported to toro townley that he had not heard from tullis since august.townley then stated,if he has reported in it sounds like he has quit.sanders inquired with townley about whether that was the approach he desired to take and toro townley said it was since it was tullis responsibility to call us.according to sanders,townley had in place a policy that an employee is considered to have quit if he or she is absent for three days without notifying the company.sanders dictated a memo that stated that tullis was dismissed as of august because he failed to report to work on more than three consecutive days.
tullis filed an application for adjustment of a workers compensation claim on september and sanders was informed of this adjustment request shortly after it was received by townley in early october during this same time period,on september,townley filed an objection to tullis unemployment insurance claim.in november of,tullis called sanders and advised him that he had obtained a full medical release and that he was ready to return to work.according to tullis,sanders said,the last time we heard from you was in august.the next thing we know we are getting a letter from a lawyer.you suing us.according to sanders,he told tullis that he did not have a position available for him.tullis claims that sanders said he would call him if a position became available.nonetheless,since tullis left in august of,the company had filled vacancies and other employees who had quit.tullis was never contacted about a job opening.
tullis brought an action against townley.in count i,he claimed that he was discriminated against in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada.in counts ii and iii,he argued that he was retaliated against for exercising his rights under illinois workers compensation act based upon supplemental jurisdiction and sought compensatory count ii and punitive count iii damages.tullis claims went to the jury.on his ada claim,the jury returned a verdict for the defendant.with regard to the retaliatory discharge claim count ii,the jury returned a verdict for tullis and awarded him in lost wages and as nonpecuniary damages for mental anguish and inconvenience.his claim for punitive damages count iii was dismissed as a matter of law.townley then made a motion for judgment as a matter of law,or in the alternative,a motion for a new trial,both of which the district court denied.townley now appeals seeking that we grant a new trial with regard to the retaliation claim.townley also requests that we grant a new trial or remittitur with regard to the judgment for nonpecuniary damages.
ii.discussion 
retaliatory discharge claim 
when considering a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence,we grant such a request only if the verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.see lowe consolidated freightways of,cir riemer illinois dep t of,cir.we review a district court application of this test in a deferential manner.lowe,at riemer,at.a district court denial of a motion for a new trial will be reversed only upon a showing that the court abused its discretion.id.we will not set aside a jury verdict if there exists a reasonable basis in the record to support the verdict.see jackson bunge,cir.
under illinois law,a valid retaliatory discharge claim requires a showing that an employee has been discharged in retaliation for the employee activities and that the discharge violates a clear mandate of public policy.see hartlein illinois power.more specifically,in a workers compensation situation,a plaintiff must show that he or she was the defendant employee before his or her injury exercised a right granted by the workers compensation act and was discharged from his or her employment with a causal connection to his or her filing a workers compensation claim.see kritzen flender,d.the element of causation is not met if the employer has a valid basis,which is not pretextual,for discharging the employee.hartlein,at.
townley argues that tullis has not proven that his discharge was causally linked to the exercise of his rights protected under the illinois workers compensation act.according to townley,tullis presented no direct evidence to support his retaliatory discharge claim.instead,he relied upon circumstantial evidence,such as that of david fox,tullis supervisor,who documented tullis departures from light duty restrictions failing to wear his back brace and swinging a sledgehammer because he thought the information may be relevant to a workers compensation claim that tullis might file in the future.although tullis believes this is evidence of townley animus toward a worker right to make a compensation claim,townley contends that there is no illinois law prohibiting an employer or its carrier from challenging the nature and severity of a worker claim of injury.moreover,tullis maintained that townley internal memoranda had variances regarding when tullis quit because he failed to report for work.the eldorado plant memorandum showed that tullis was terminated as of august,while townley florida home office records show tullis as having been terminated as of august.according to tullis,such a discrepancy reveals that the company reason for terminating tullis was pretextual and evidence of an illegal purpose.townley argues that the internal inconsistencies between the eldorado plant and the company home offices in florida about when tullis was terminated is a result of incomplete miscommunication between the two offices and not a scheme to harm tullis.additionally,townley claims there is no evidence that townley actually had a motive to punish tullis,and in august of,he had no pending workers compensation claim.townley asserts that tullis already was receiving benefits and had been since january of.according to townley,tullis does not dispute that he took no action in august of to suggest or inform townley that he intended to file an application for adjustment of his workers compensation claim.therefore,townley asserts that it had no reason to anticipate or expect in august that tullis would demand such an adjudication of his claim in the following month or any time in the near future.for the six months during which tullis was on light duty,townley allowed him,without any objection,paid time off to receive medical treatment.according to townley,no one ever said or discouraged tullis from seeking an adjustment of his workers compensation claim or that if he did he would suffer any consequences.townley further asserts that it is speculation on the part of tullis that he was being punished for filing workers compensation claims.
townley proposes that we should adopt the reasoning of horton miller chem,cir.in that case,a jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for a retaliatory discharge claim under the illinois workers compensation act,the district court refused to grant a judgment notwithstanding the verdict,and we reversed the trial court decision.in horton,the plaintiff claimed that he was referred to as a bad risk because the company believed that he might seek additional compensation under the act.id.at.this was perceived as rather scant evidence,especially when one considered the other evidence presented.id.townley argues that as was the case in horton,there was no evidence presented that any employees said anything to tullis about filing a workers compensation claim,townley did not oppose his pursuit of his rights under the act,and he was given time off of work to receive medical treatment.accordingly,townley contends that sanders statement about you suing us in and of itself can not lead to an inference that townley retaliated against tullis,as horton warns.
townley claims that miller jones,d,is another case that reveals that tullis retaliatory discharge case is not viable.miller too pursued a retaliatory discharge claim and at the close of presenting his case,the court ordered a directed verdict in favor of the defendant,which the appeals court upheld.despite miller claim that a supervisor told him that the company was trying to break him by assigning him to a particular job,the court remained unconvinced that this evidence showed an intent on the company part to interfere with miller rights under the workers compensation act.id.at.townley contends that sanders statement was mild and tangential compared to the one in miller.townley believes that the jury rested its decision on the disbelief of the denials of townley witnesses,and as a consequence,determined tullis was retaliated against for asserting his rights under the workers compensation act.see id.although a jury decides questions of credibility,a jury will not be allowed to rest a decision for plaintiff entirely on its disbelief of the denials made by defendant witnesses.townley,as discussed earlier,argues that it never interfered with tullis ability to pursue his benefits,which was also the case in miller,id.even the president of townley,toro townley,said that in the years of the company operation,it had never been sued with regard to a workers compensation claim.see id.the fact that defendant did not retaliate against other employees who had filed workers compensations claims should also be given weight.townley contends that miller supports its position that tullis has failed to successfully make out a retaliatory discharge case.
finally,townley would like us to consider hiatt rockwell int l,cir,in which we reversed the district court and granted a with regard to hiatt retaliatory discharge claim under the illinois workers compensation act.in that case,the court said that even if it assumed that hiatt supervisor harbored animosity toward his pending workers compensation claims,hiatt still bore the burden of proving that this animosity played a causal role in his termination.this he has not done.id.at.as a result,hiatt did not show that those in charge of his actual discharge possessed an impermissible ulterior motive.id.townley argues that tullis has not shown that it possessed an impermissible ulterior motive,when it terminated tullis and decided not to rehire him.tullis,without notifying the office,did not report to work for three days,and as per company policy,townley terminated him.tullis back injury played no role,according to sanders,in his decision not to rehire tullis.what was important to him was that he felt he had went above and beyond his call of duty by allowing tullis to come to work to do as little as he possibly could do and offering to talk with toro townley about finding another position for him outside the production area.what upset sanders was that tullis never called the office to say he would not be working and he never even called a week later or at that point brought in a doctor note.sanders decided not to rehire tullis because he expressed,i honest with my workers.i treat them with respect.i expect the same kind of treatment in return and that all i ask of my people.townley asserts that it provided a credible explanation for why it did not rehire tullis and he provided no evidence to counter townley witnesses testimony that the company was not motivated to terminate him in any way by his filing for an adjustment of his workers compensation benefits.
while townley raises several reasons as to why a new trial would be appropriate in this case,its position is not a prevailing one.this was,as the district court acknowledged during the trial,a very close case on the issue of retaliation.however,the retaliatory discharge claim was before the jury,it found in favor of tullis,and the district court denied townley request for a new trial on the issue.at this stage in the process,we have to assess whether there is a reasonable basis in the record to support the jury verdict.the record does provide us with evidence that the jury could have relied upon to determine that townley discharged tullis in retaliation for his workers compensation claim.we begin by reviewing the manner in which tullis came to no longer work at townley.townley stressed that it had in place a policy that an employee would be terminated if he or she failed to notify the office on more than three consecutive days that he or she would be absent and tullis allegedly violated said policy.the employee handbook states in contradiction that you will automatically be deemed to have quit,without notice,if you are absent more than one day without promptly reporting to the company an acceptable reason for the absence.toro townley explained that although the handbook may indicate that the company does not even allow for a absence without notice,that policy has been changed and is not in writing,but it well known throughout our company.david fox,a supervisor who had worked for townley since,said that he did not believe he was familiar with the policy that if you missed three consecutive days of work without calling in that you were terminated.fox testimony may have raised doubts about the legitimacy of the company termination policy and in turn its reliance upon this purported policy to terminate tullis.townley argues that it terminated tullis because he failed for more than three consecutive days to notify anyone that he would be absent from work.tullis argues that he did converse with sanders on august,and,but as of august tullis believed that he had been laid off.he said that he did not call the plant on august to say that he would be absent because he thought there was no need to do so considering he was laid off.once again,there is conflicting evidence concerning why tullis left his job at townley.indeed,sanders himself said that he had no idea whether tullis had quit or not,nor did he ever contact tullis to find out why he had not come to work on august,and beyond.he acted in this manner despite the fact he thought tullis was a good worker.tullis testified that no one ever contacted him to inform him that he was terminated.all of this testimony combined may have led the jury to be suspicious about why townley,without any apparent hesitation,decided to enforce its attendance policy against tullis.
other evidence was presented that may have further caused the jury to doubt townley motive.for instance,townley claimed that it had never discriminated against an employee for seeking workers compensation benefits.this statement may have seemed a bit hollow in light of the fact toro townley admitted that no other employee had ever filed an application for adjustment of a workers compensation claim.once more,toro townley was well aware when he was discussing with sanders terminating tullis because he had violated the company alleged attendance policy,that there was a possibility that tullis might file for adjustment of his workers compensation claim.david fox,the supervisor of the plastic shop,made the following notations about tullis behavior in may he had told tullis to put on his belt a back brace after he saw him rolling out molds without it,and during june he was told that tullis was observed swinging a sledge hammer and lifting heavy objects.fox acknowledged that he made these notes because he believed that tullis might file a workers compensation claim sometime in the future and he wanted to document his behavior in the event it was necessary to challenge him with such information.the jury may well have been left with the impression that townley was conscious of tullis right to file an adjustment of his workers compensation claim and that this motivated the company to either lay off or terminate him based upon its attendance policy.
as for townley failure to hire tullis in november of,there was also evidence in the record to support the proposition that the company based its decision upon tullis filing for an adjustment of his workers compensation benefits.when tullis told sanders that he could return to work,tullis claims that sanders said,t he last time we heard from you was back in august.the next thing we know we are getting a letter from a lawyer.you suing us.his tone according to tullis was angry and unfriendly.according to tullis,sanders said he would call him if a job opening became available and he never did so.sanders hired other people to fill vacancies and there was no evidence presented that the company did not have a vacancy suitable for tullis.the comment about tullis suing townley made by sanders along with his behavior after tullis inquired about a job reasonably could have led the jury to believe that townley did not rehire tullis because he filed a workers compensation claim.
this case is distinguishable from horton,miller,and hiatt.as evidenced by the preceding discussion,this case is not like horton or miller,in that it does not center around one particular comment with no supporting facts or completely fails to suggest an impermissible ulterior motive,as was the case in hiatt,at.during the trial,there was conflicting evidence presented about why tullis stopped working for townley.in addition,there was evidence that david fox was keeping notes about tullis work habits in case of a workers compensation claim and toro townley was well aware that tullis had the right to file for an adjustment of his claim when he decided to terminate him.in the end,the case centered largely around credibility determinations,and it is within the purview of the jury to make such determinations.the jury reasonably could have ascertained based on the record that townley terminated tullis in august when it had the chance to do so because it no longer wanted to deal with his recurrent back problems and attendant workers compensation claims.in addition,based on the evidence,the jury could have reasonably found that townley did not rehire tullis because it was upset that tullis pursued an adjustment of his claim.unlike in horton and miller,sanders comment more clearly referred to tullis adjustment claim and thus provided the jury with the opportunity to make the connection that tullis was not rehired because he pursued such a claim.furthermore,the jury could have taken into account the manner in which townley handled tullis absences in august and eventual termination as shedding light upon its decision not to rehire tullis.in this case,the jury based on the record reached a reasonable conclusion that townley terminated refused to rehire him in november of because he filed an adjustment claim for his workers compensation benefits therefore,we will not find that the district court abused its discretion when it allowed the jury verdict to stand.
compensatory damages 
townley contends that the nonpecuniary damages jury award for mental anguish and inconvenience was the product of passion and prejudice and so it requests a new trial or reduction of the damages through remittitur.townley is concerned about the massive and excessive size of the jury award.the district court reviewed townley request for a new trial based upon the nonpecuniary damage award and determined that the award should be upheld.we review the district court refusal to grant a new trial on the basis that the damages the jury awarded were excessive for an abuse of discretion.see riemer,at.
when we review a compensatory damages award,we employ the following test whether the award is monstrously excessive whether there is no rational connection between the award and the evidence and whether the award is rough
