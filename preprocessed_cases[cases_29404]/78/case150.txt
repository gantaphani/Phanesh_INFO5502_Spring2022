petitioner gartha conley seeks review of an order of the benefits review board review board dated november,which reversed an administrative law judge award of black lung benefits on a widow claim filed by conley under the black lung benefits act blba,after her husband dave conley died of metastatic lung cancer.respondents are the national mines corporation nmc,old republic insurance company,and director,office of workers compensation programs,united states department of labor.the sole issue presented in this appeal is whether the review board erred in reversing the alj decision on the grounds that the decedent treating physician opinion was insufficient to carry the widow burden of proof,based on the standard previously articulated by this court in eastover mining williams,cir.for the reasons set forth herein,we affirm.
dave conley,a heavy smoker for decades was diagnosed with lung cancer in,for which he underwent radiation and chemotherapy treatment.by the time it was discovered,however,the disease had already spread to his lymph nodes and was later found to have metastasized to his brain,pancreas and liver.he died on march.the immediate cause of his death,as noted on his death certificate,was c ardiorespiratory failure due to consequence of pulmonary malignancy with metastasis.appendix app.the death certificate,which was completed by his treating physician,ira potter,also identified the decedent history of cigarette smoking and coal mining as o ther significant conditions that contributed to death but did not result in the underlying cause.id.
petitioner gartha conley filed for benefits in june,nine years after her husband had died of lung cancer after the department of labor dol collected conley work and medical records,the claim proceeded to the office of administrative law judges for a hearing,which was conducted on may.administrative law judge alj larry merck presided over the hearing and issued a decision and order awarding benefits on january.the parties agreed that lung cancer was the principal cause of death and that the lung cancer was related to conley history of smoking rather than to coal mining.it was also undisputed that conley had clinical pneumoconiosis arising out of his coal mine employment.consequently,the only issue,in theory,that required resolution by the alj was whether conley clinical pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause or factor leading to his death.c.that was the question upon which nmc focused its arguments.the alj,in fact,credited the opinions of nmc experts who concluded that the decedent clinical pneumoconiosis did not cause or contribute to his death.
however,the alj devoted a substantial portion of his analysis to the question of whether the record supported a conclusion that conley had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd that was caused at least in part by his exposure to coal dust and therefore qualified as legal pneumoconiosis,separate and apart from the undisputed diagnosis of clinical pneumoconiosis.ultimately,the alj made an independent finding that conley had legal pneumoconiosis as well as clinical pneumoconiosis,and that the legal pneumoconiosis was a contributing cause of death 
pneumoconiosis,whether legal or clinical,is considered a substantially contributing cause of death if it hastens death.c.based on the opinion of conley treating physician,potter,who was not a pulmonary specialist,the alj concluded that conley death was hastened by legal pneumoconiosis copd and awarded benefits based upon that conclusion.specifically,potter testified as follows 
okay.do you believe that lung cancer would have killed conley irrespective of his lung disease 
do you have an opinion as to whether having the degree of copd that he had previously described as moderate substantially hastened his death 
a i,i am of the group that certainly believes that people with chronic lung disease have less respiratory reserve,less capacity to deal with these things,and that therefore it does make a difference.
could you explain to us from a physiological standpoint or an anatomical standpoint what damage copd causes and why it would make a person less likely to survive 
a copd destroys air cells.the,the condition leads to destruction of the alveolar sacs.and this decreases your respiratory reserve,your all have a respiratory reserve when we are walking around and we call upon it when we exert ourselves.i think that you lose a lot of that when you have copd or interstitial fibrosis either one,and that is part of our physical resistance.in other words,the healthier we are,the better we able to deal with serious problems.
can you there any way to tell how much longer conley might have survived had he not had legal pneumoconiosis 
because the alj found that potter opinion was based on objective medical evidence,as defined in to include medical testing and claimant medical and work histories app,and supported by his treatment and hospitalization notes,medical reports,deposition,and potter familiarity with conley condition due to his special relationship with him as his treating physician for years app,the alj deemed potter report to be and.app.on that basis,and in reliance upon his reading of d,the alj accorded potter opinion additional probative weight.app.
the alj also considered the opinions of bruce broudy and dahhan,both in internal and pulmonary medicine and.as indicated above,although he accepted those physicians opinions that clinical pneumoconiosis did not contribute to or hasten conley death,he discounted their opinions that legal pneumoconiosis did not contribute to or hasten his death.in fact,both broudy and dahhan found that conley had,at most,minor respiratory obstruction,and what little he had was wholly attributable to cigarette smoking rather than to coal mining.in other words,both physicians implicitly concluded that conley did not have legal pneumoconiosis at all,and therefore did not address the issue of whether legal pneumoconiosis hastened his death.dahhan did testify unequivocally,however,that conley metastatic lung cancer was neither related to nor hastened by inhalation of coal dust and that his death from lung cancer would have occurred at the same time and in the same manner regardless of whether he had ever worked as a coal miner.in a second supplemental report dated march,dahhan expressly disagreed with potter conclusion that conley weakened lung condition made him more susceptible to lung cancer,noting that conley was not able to undergo a complete surgical resection of his lung cancer because it had already metastasized to the hilar nodes.he also noted,based on the oncologist records,that conley tolerated radiation therapy well and concluded that there was no evidence in the record suggesting that conley would have done better in his fight against lung cancer if he had not also suffered from pneumoconiosis.
the alj nonetheless concluded that broudy and dahhan failed to offer any explanation for disregarding conley lengthy career as a possible cause for his chronic respiratory ailments and instead attributing them solely to his smoking.because he found these conclusory opinions regarding the diagnosis and etiology of the bronchitis not to be well reasoned or well documented,the alj accorded little probative weight to broudy and dahhan opinions in reaching a decision as to whether legal pneumoconiosis contributed to conley death.app.instead,he accorded more weight to potter report and concluded on the basis of that report that conley had established by a preponderance of the evidence that conley legal pneumoconiosis copd and chronic bronchitis caused or contributed to his death.he therefore awarded benefits under the blba.
nmc appealed that decision to the review board.the review board,applying sixth circuit law,held simply that the alj had erred in finding there was sufficient evidence in the record to establish that conley death was hastened by pneumoconiosis in light of the sixth circuit holding in eastover mining williams,cir.in that case,this court held that pneumoconiosis only hastens a death if it does so through a specifically defined process that reduces the miner
