introduction 
the question in these workers compensation cases is whether the legislature overhaul of the workers compensation statutes stats.reg.sess.ch,et was intended to alter the formula used to calculate a permanent disability award when the employee overall disability is subject to apportionment.we conclude that,notwithstanding the recent changes to the law,the calculation adopted by fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fuentes continues to be appropriate.in so concluding we disagree with e j gallo winery workers comp.appeals bd.dykes th,d dykes fifth dist.and nabors workers comp.appeals bd.th,d nabors first,div.two 
ii.factual and procedural background 
the facts may be briefly stated.in the first case case no,petitioner fortunata mary davis suffered a back injury that left her percent permanently disabled.davis had suffered a prior injury for which she received an award for permanent partial disability of percent.using the formula prescribed by the supreme court in fuentes,the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj deducted the percent disability from the overall disability of percent and awarded davis compensation for permanent partial disability of percent,which was.davis petitioned the workers compensation appeals board wcab for reconsideration arguing that the wcj should have used the formula later approved by the appellate court in dykes,supra,th,d.the dykes formula would have given her the full benefit allowed for percent disability less credit to her employer for the dollar value of the prior award.this calculation would have resulted in payments of approximately over davis remaining life expectancy.
in the second case case no,petitioner moises torres injured his back and his knees while working for respondent williams tank lines,leaving him with an overall disability rating of percent.he had previously received an award for permanent partial disability of percent as the result of a spinal injury.the wcj applied the fuentes calculation,which gave torres a permanent partial disability award of torres also petitioned the wcab for reconsideration,urging it to use the alternative calculation,which would have resulted in an award of.
in denying the petitions the wcab followed the en banc decision in nabors piedmont lumber mill,which held that the fuentes formula had not been affected by the changes to the apportionment statutes.dykes,supra,th,d later overruled nabors piedmont and shortly thereafter nabors piedmont was reversed by nabors,supra,th,d.we issued writs of review in the present cases and ordered the two cases considered together for purposes of oral argument and decision.
thirty years ago,fuentes set forth the formula to use when calculating permanent disability compensation in cases where the current disability is subject to apportionment for a preexisting disability.fuentes,supra,cal d.under auto equity sales,superior court cal d,we are bound to follow the decisions of the supreme court unless they are overruled,altered by statute,or can be validly distinguished.we can not rely upon cases decided under prior law to interpret a quite different code section.people valentine cal d.on the other hand,when the legislature enacts a statute,we presume that the legislature did not intend to overthrow principles of law unless such an intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied.people superior court zamudio cal th,d,see also fuentes,supra,cal d at,theodor superior court cal d.unless the legislature plainly intends to change a judicial result based upon an earlier version of a statute we are bound by the prior judicial result.people eastman th,d.
the statutory basis for the fuentes holding was former labor code section although the legislature repealed former section in,it also repealed two related sections pertaining to apportionment and recast the substance of all three provisions in new sections and.stats,ch,supra,at.the question before us,therefore,is whether these changes demonstrate that the legislature clearly intended to alter the fuentes rule.we begin by comparing the former law with the new sections pertaining to apportionment 
iv.prior law 
apportionment 
in workers compensation jargon,when permanent disability benefits are reduced based upon permissible factors,the employee overall disability is said to be apportioned to those factors.see,callahan workers comp.appeals bd.d.apportionment is the process employed by the wcab to segregate the residuals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries,or to nonindustrial factors,in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.fresno unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,fresno brackets in original,quoting ashley workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.whether or not apportionment is appropriate in a given case is a question of fact.it is the employer burden to establish the right to apportionment.fresno,supra,th at,d.
under former law apportionment focused upon the disability.it is disability resulting from,rather than the cause of,a disease which is the proper subject of apportionment pathology may not be apportioned.pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.former sections,and set forth the rules for apportionment.the general rule was that an employer takes the employee as he finds him at the time of employment and when subsequent injury lightens up or aggravates a previously existing condition rendering it disabling,liability for the full disability without proration is imposed upon the employer.colonial ins.industrial acc.com.cal d.zemke workmen.bd.cal d.an employer was entitled to apportionment only if the normal progress of the preexisting condition would have resulted in the disability in the absence of the industrial injury.and see former.apportionment was required,however,if the permanent disability was caused solely by a subsequent noncompensable injury.former.
apportionment was also required where an actual disability preexisted the industrial injury.edson industrial acc.com.cal.former section provided that an injured employee suffering from an existing disability or physical impairment could not be compensated based upon the combined disability,but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.apportionment depended upon the actual existence of the prior disability at the time of the second injury.a previous award for partial permanent disability did not necessarily require apportionment.an employee could become completely rehabilitated before suffering a new disabling injury and in such a case the employer would not be entitled to apportionment for the prior disability.robinson workers comp.appeals bd.d.
where a permanent disability is apportioned to a preexisting disability one may calculate the dollar amount due for the compensable portion in different ways.prior to it did not matter which way one calculated it,the result would be the same because the compensation schedule progressed arithmetically a permanently disabled employee was entitled to four weeks of benefits for every percentage point of permanent disability that was of industrial origin.fuentes,supra,cal d at,citing former.
in,the legislature changed the compensation schedules for permanent disability to make compensation increase exponentially with the severity of the disability.fuentes,supra,cal d at.for example,although is two times,the compensation allowed for a percentage of permanent disability of percent is more than two times the compensation allowed for a disability of percent.see.this type of schedule poses a problem when calculating compensation in cases where only a portion of the overall disability is compensable different methods of calculation yield different results.fuentes considered the question of how to calculate compensation for a permanent disability in light of the revised compensation scheme.fuentes discussed three methods,which it designated as formula a,formula b,and formula fuentes,supra,cal d at.
with formula a one begins with the overall percentage of permanent disability and subtracts the noncompensable percentage of permanent disability.thus,in fuentes the noncompensable percentage of permanent disability percent would be deducted from the overall percentage percent for a net compensable percentage of permanent disability of.an employee whose percentage of permanent disability was was entitled to an award of.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
formula c begins by converting the overall percentage of permanent disability into its monetary equivalent and subtracting from that the monetary equivalent of the percentage of permanent disability that is noncompensable.in the fuentes example a percentage of permanent disability of corresponded to an award of.less the dollar value of the noncompensable portion would have left the employee with,significantly more than he would have received under formula fuentes,supra,cal d at.
formula b yields a result in between the results of the other two formulas.with formula b one first determines the number of weeks of benefits authorized for the overall disability.the total number of weeks is then multiplied by the percentage of the disability that is industrially related.in fuentes that would have meant an award of.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
fuentes decided that formula a was the appropriate formula even though the employee would recover more under either of the other two formulas.fuentes concluded that the express and unequivocal language of former section compelled the conclusion that formula a was the appropriate method.fuentes,supra,cal d at.the plain language of former section prohibited the employee from receiving compensation for a subsequent injury in excess of the compensation allowed for such injury when considered by itself and limited the employer liability to that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.italics added.the employee level of disability,considered by itself,without reference to the preexisting disability,was percent of total.using either formula b or formula c would give the employee more than the amount specified for that level of disability considered by itself.this arithmetic leads to the inevitable conclusion that neither method b nor c can be reconciled with the mandate of former section that the compensation for a subsequent injury be computed as though no prior disability or impairment had existed.fuentes,supra,cal d at.
fuentes concluded that notwithstanding section,which provides that the workers compensation statutes shall be liberally construed in favor of injured employees,the policy underlying section can not supplant the intent of the legislature as expressed in a particular statute.fuentes,supra,cal d at.the legislative intent of former section was to encourage employers to hire or retain persons with physical disabilities.the legislature recognized that employers might refrain from engaging the services of the handicapped if,upon subsequent injury,an employer was required to compensate the employee for an aggregate disability which included a previous injury.fuentes,supra,cal d at.only formula a was consistent with this legislative intent in that it did not require the employer to provide more compensation than would have been called for if the employee had not suffered the prior impairment.
a year after fuentes was decided the supreme court confirmed that fuentes interpretation of former section rested upon the narrow proposition that awards based upon a combined disability rating contravene the language and policy of former section.wilkinson workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.where it applied,fuentes has provided the rule for the last years.
current law 
senate bill 
sb stats,ch,supra,et made broad substantive and procedural changes to the existing workers compensation system.among other things sb repealed former sections,and and replaced them with new sections and.stats,ch,supra.these changes were expressly intended to repeal and recast existing law with respect to apportionment of permanent disability.stats,ch,supra,at.
we have set out the former law and the two new code sections side by side in the appendix.as shown by that table,the legislature has completely rewritten the law.where former law allowed apportionment in only three circumstances former,new section,subdivision a now simply states apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation.a physician must make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of industrial injury and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries,subd.c.an employer is liable only for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the industrial injury,subd.a.where an injured employee has received a prior permanent disability award,it is conclusively presumed that the prior level of disability existed at the time of any subsequent injury,subd.b.the accumulation of all permanent disability awards issued with respect to any one region of the body may not exceed percent over the employee lifetime unless the employee is deemed totally disabled,subd.c.
the wcab has concluded that by permitting apportionment to other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury the legislature has enlarged the range of factors to which permanent disability may be apportioned.escobedo marshalls.the other factors now subject to apportionment would presumably include all disabilities that were apportionable prior to sb as well as pathology,asymptomatic prior conditions,and retroactive prophylactic work preclusions,provided there is substantial medical evidence establishing that these other factors have caused permanent disability.ibid.the conclusive presumption of section,subdivision b means that even if an employee is completely rehabilitated following an injury for which he or she received a permanent disability award,the employer is nevertheless entitled to apportionment based upon the prior disability.sanchez county of los angeles.
b.the dykes decision 
dykes concluded that,in light of sb,fuentes was no longer controlling.dykes,supra,th at,d.dykes held that where an employee sustains multiple disabling industrial injuries the employee is entitled to compensation for the total disability above any percentage of permanent disability previously awarded.id.at,d see also nabors,supra,th,d following dykes.that is,dykes found formula c to be the appropriate formula.although dykes expressly limited its holding to the case where the multiple injuries were suffered while working for the same employer dykes,supra,th at,d,nabors applied the dykes rationale in a broader context.nabors,supra,th at,d.
vi.discussion 
standard of review 
in order to decide whether the legislature clearly intended to alter the rule of fuentes we must interpret the pertinent provisions of sb.interpreting the law is a core judicial function mcclung employment development cal th,d,to which we apply the independent standard of review scott ciba vision th,d.we review the law keeping in mind the rules of statutory construction.our fundamental goal is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,we first look to the words of the statute,giving the language its usual,ordinary meaning,fair employment housing com.cal d.the specific provision should be construed in context so that the various elements of the overall scheme are harmonized.merrill department of motor vehicles cal d.where uncertainty exists,consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.both the legislative history and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.ibid.statutes are to be interpreted by assuming that the legislature was aware of the existing law at the time of the enactment.people mcguire th,d.lastly,in the workers compensation context,statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker.
b.the plain language of sections and 
like the old law,sections and contain no express instruction about how to calculate the apportioned award.we conclude,however,that such an instruction is implied by the plain language of section.
section,subdivision a states that the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury.percentage of permanent disability is the phrase used in section to describe the level of permanent disability for which a specified number of benefit weeks may be paid.see,subd.a,setting forth the number of benefit weeks allowed for each range of percentage of permanent disability incurred.where the same word or phrase is used in more than one place in a legislative enactment,we presume the same meaning was intended in each instance.castro sacramento county fire protection dist.th,d.thus,we presume that when the legislature stated that an employer liability is limited to a percentage of permanent disability the legislature was referring to the measure used to calculate the weekly benefit under section.formula a is the only calculation that yields a result in terms of a percentage of permanent disability.that is,with formula a one subtracts the preexisting percentage of permanent disability from the overall percentage of disability to determine the compensable percentage of permanent disability.one then simply consults the compensation schedule to determine the weekly benefit that corresponds to the calculated percentage of permanent disability.under formula c,where one calculates the benefit by converting the percentage of permanent disability to its dollar value the result of the calculation is not a percentage of permanent disability but is a dollar amount.with formula b,the result is stated as a number of weeks.thus,formula a is the only calculation that gives effect to the plain language of section,subdivision a,which states that the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury.
davis seems to argue that the phrase percentage of permanent disability,as used in section,does not mean the same thing as it means in section.she claims that in section the phrase refers to the percentage that takes the employee from the preexisting disability level to the resulting level.davis points out that if we must conclusively presume that a prior permanent disability exists,subd.b,it can not exist and then go down to zero,which,she argues,is the effect of using formula a.the result in dykes was reached with similar reasoning.
dykes is largely based upon two factors.the first factor is the legislature repeal of section,which stated that an employer shall not be liable for a combined disability,but only for that portion due to the later injury as though no prior disability or impairment had existed,italics added.dykes concluded that repeal of section shows that the legislature intended to overturn fuentes since fuentes cited the section express language as support for its choice of formula fuentes,supra,cal d at.the second factor is the enactment of the directive in section,subdivision b,stating that if an applicant received a prior disability award,the disability must be conclusively presumed to exist at the time of the subsequent injury.dykes concluded that the combined effect of these changes is that under current law the compensation calculation must take into account the preexisting disability.dykes,supra,th at,d.
we do not view the legislature elimination of the language contained in section as necessarily rejecting the fuentes rule.the legislature did not simply repeal this section it took the law as it existed under former sections,and and recast it to reflect a new way of looking at apportionment.where former section was concerned with preventing liability for a combined disability,the new law excludes from liability all causes of the employee overall disability other than the industrial injury under consideration.the new law is plainly intended to protect the employer from paying for that portion of a disability that is not the direct result of the industrial injury.fuentes was concerned with the same issue.but in light of the change to causation based apportionment,the new law could not import the language of section verbatim.it would be ambiguous and possibly inaccurate to instruct the wcab to compensate the employee for the injury considered by itself.and since the revised law requires the wcab to presume that a previously compensated industrial disability still exists at the time of a subsequent injury,including the phrase as though no prior disability or impairment had existed would make the entire scheme ambiguous.instead,section,subdivision a now states that the employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the industrial injury.in our view,the new language,like former section,continues to reflect the bedrock principle that industry is to be charged only for those injuries arising out of and in the course of employment and only for the result of that particular injury when considered by itself and not in conjunction with or in relation to a previous injury.gardner industrial acc.com.d.
furthermore,we are not convinced that section,subdivision b,which states that it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury,reflects a legislative intent to grant a employee the enhanced benefit allowed for more serious injuries.if the prior disability exists,the more recent industrial injury can not have caused that disability.therefore,the employee present disability must be apportioned to the prior disability,provided,of course,that the two overlap.sanchez county of los angeles,supra,at.if there is no overlap,the present disability will presumably be rated separately thus,the presumption that a prior disability exists at the time of the second injury does not relate to the calculation question at all it merely prevents an employee from recovering a second time for a previously compensated permanent disability.
dykes was also impressed by the provision stating that accumulation of all permanent disability awards shall not exceed percent,subd.c.according to the dykes court this means that the new law contemplates accumulating multiple disability awards rather than subtracting percentage levels of disability.dykes,supra,th at,d.but,again,we do not believe this subdivision relates to the manner of calculating the award.since independent disabilities are examined and rated separately,it was possible under prior law for an employee total disability to exceed percent if the separate disabilities were entirely unrelated.fresno,supra,th at,fn,d.the potential for accumulating awards of more than percent for the same region of the body was eliminated by section,subdivision c.the fact that the law presumes that some employees will accumulate more than one award for permanent disability does not,in our view,bear upon the calculation of the award.
we conclude that the plain language of sections and reflects the legislative intent to retain the rule of fuentes.we recognize,however,that the two code sections do not clearly subscribe to the rule.accordingly,we turn to the legislative history for additional insight.
legislative history of sb 
sb became effective on april,as urgency legislation.the bill states in order to provide relief to the state from the effects of the current workers compensation crisis at the earliest possible time,it is necessary for this act to take effect immediately.stats,ch,supra,at.the crisis to which the bill referred concerned the escalating costs of the workers compensation system.prior to the passage of sb,california had the highest workers compensation insurance premium rates in the country.rand institute for civil justice,an evaluation of california permanent disability rating system ch.the average benefits paid for permanent partial disability was also higher in california than in any other state.ibid.
in a memorandum to all the members of the legislature the california chamber of commerce urged passage of sb stating,workers compensation costs for employers have skyrocketed over the pas
