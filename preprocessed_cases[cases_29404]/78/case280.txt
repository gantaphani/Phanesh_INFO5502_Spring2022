background 
suffered a myocardial infarction on march,and began receiving permanent partial disability compensation pursuant to a compensation order issued on august.in,through his attorney began negotiations with the bunge corporation bunge,his former employer,for a settlement that would pay a lump sum in lieu of the biweekly payments he had been receiving.on september,bunge attorney,william tomlinson,forwarded to attorney,donald wilson,a proposed settlement in the form of an lhwca settlement application,detailing the settlement terms and providing for a payment to in settlement of all further liability for compensation and medical benefits.wilson requested minor language changes,and tomlinson subsequently sent a revised settlement application incorporating those changes.
according to wilson affidavit,had informed him by telephone that he would sign the application when he returned from a hunting trip.died on october,however,before signing the proposed settlement application.on october,wilson advised the district director of death and that he was substituting edward,raymond brother and the representative of his estate,as beneficiary of the settlement agreement.wilson submitted the settlement by edward the district director approval.tomlinson then informed the district director that bunge considered the settlement unenforceable because raymond had not signed the application.

standard of review 
we review de novo the brb interpretation of the lhwca.see metro.stevedore crescent wharf warehouse,cir.we grant no special deference to the brb construction of the lhwca but must respect the brb interpretation of the statute where such interpretation is reasonable and reflects the policy underlying the statute.gilliland bartells,cir quoting mcdonald,owcp,cir.
discussion 
the lhwca superimposes a statutory and regulatory regime over the contract law principles that would normally govern this agreement.typically,t he construction and enforcement of settlement agreements are governed by principles of local law which apply to interpretation of contracts generally.united commercial ins,paymaster,cir quoting jeff andrus,cir.in oregon,where the settlement negotiations occurred in this case,settlement agreements are enforceable once agreed upon,unless the parties intend their agreement to become enforceable only after it is reduced to writing.see hughes misar,app when parties agree on the essential terms of a contract and there is nothing left for future negotiations,the fact that they also intended there to be a future writing that expresses their agreement more formally does not affect the immediately binding nature of the agreement.see also id.at our holding is consistent with the general rule of contract law that parties may intend a writing simply as a memorial to express their already consummated contract.if they fail to agree on the writing the contract is still valid.citing arthur corbin,corbin on contracts,at joseph perillo ed samuel williston,williston on contracts,at ed.w here it was understood that the contract should be formally drawn up,and put in writing,the transaction is nevertheless complete and binding,absent a positive agreement that it should not be binding until so reduced to writing and formally executed.
thus,were the settlement between and bunge not subject to the lhwca,the lack of a signed document setting forth the parties agreement would not necessarily preclude enforcing their agreement.however,the regulations make clear that parties may not settle lhwca claims except in accordance with the this case,under i.see b.
section i main purpose clearly is protection of the claimants,and the public,interest in preserving them and their families from destitution and consequent reliance on the taxpaying public.oceanic butler,nordahl,cir.section i achieves its purpose through substantive and procedural safeguards.substantively,the deputy commissioner or administrative law judge shall approve the settlement within thirty days unless it is found to be inadequate or procured by duress.i.essentially,this provision assigns to the lhwca administrators the statutory responsibility of the claimant even when the claimant is represented by counsel and believes a settlement to be in his best interest.nordahl,at.
procedurally,w henever the parties agree to a settlement,they must submit the settlement to the deputy commissioner or an alj for approval.i.thus,i contemplates that lhwca settlements will be enforced only after the parties agree to a settlement,and an administrator approves that settlement.the statute and regulations refer to the document that is submitted as an application.a.an employer or insurance carrier liability is not discharged unless the application for settlement is approved by the deputy commissioner or administrative law judge.i.
the required contents of a complete application are set forth in regulations promulgated by the department of labor,however,rather than in the lhwca.a.they provide that the settlement application shall be in the form of a stipulation signed by all the parties.id.a emphasis added.further,it shall contain a brief summary of the facts of the case,and a variety of other information.see b the guiding principle for these requirements is that t he settlement application shall be a document which can be evaluated without further reference to the administrative file.id.a emphasis added both t he interest of the employee and administrative convenience are served by these paternalistic regulations.henry,at.
the regulations make a proper settlement application the trigger for administrative approval.henry,at.failure to submit a complete application shall toll the thirty day approval period set forth in i.a.further,the adjudicator will consider a settlement substantive fairness only after receiving a completed application.see f.thus,without a complete settlement application,t he adjudicator can do nothing to approve or disapprove settlements.henry,at.and absent approval of a settlement application,there is no enforceable settlement agreement.norfolk shipbuilding drydock nance,cir the terms of the i settlement agreement,in conjunction with the statutes and regulations that govern its effect,prohibit enforcement of any verbal agreement by the employee to leave his job not included in the settlement terms towe ingalls shipbuilding,wl,dep t of labor ben.bd the failure to provide a complete application prevents the district director or the administrative law judge from ruling on the application,b,and also prevents the application from being automatically approved days after its submission,a.
here,we must decide whether the regulatory requirement of a stipulation signed by all the parties is a prerequisite to the enforcement of a i settlement,even though oregon law does not normally condition enforcement of a settlement agreement on the existence of a signed document.
in henry,the only other circuit court case to address this issue,the information required under existed in the administrative files but had not been set forth in a single,signed document before henry death.henry held
