on denial of rehearing,all of the justices filed a statement that the case involved a substantial question warranting consideration by this court.we allowed united petition for leave to appeal.we granted the illinois trial lawyers association leave to file an amicus curiae brief in support of mahoney position.we now affirm the appellate court.
background 
the arbitrator findings of fact are undisputed.robert mahoney was hired by united airlines on january,to work as a ramp serviceman at international airport in chicago,illinois.he worked for united continuously in illinois until,when,following his divorce,he voluntarily applied for transfer to united facility at orlando international airport in orlando,florida.mahoney had the necessary seniority to choose among many locations throughout the united states.
there was no interruption between mahoney last day of work in chicago and the beginning of his work the next day in orlando.he has worked continuously in ramp service for united at orlando until the present time.
mahoney continues to reside in orlando,where he purchased a home in.he remarried in florida.he has a florida driver license,pays taxes in florida,and pays no taxes in illinois.although he has the right,he has never sought to relocate back to illinois or to any other state.
since his transfer,mahoney has returned to illinois approximately three times for training sessions and has also returned for family visits.when he returned to illinois,he stayed in local hotels.he has not been injured in illinois.
mahoney sustained compensable injuries in orlando,florida,on march,and january.he received temporary total disability benefits consistent with the florida workers compensation act,and medical treatment for his injuries was provided near his home in orlando.
mahoney filed applications for adjustment of his claims for both injuries in illinois.on mahoney motion,the cases were consolidated for hearing.the arbitrator found no illinois jurisdiction.the arbitrator noted that mahoney relied exclusively on the fact that he was initially hired in illinois as the basis for asserting illinois jurisdiction.rather than finding that fact solely determinative,the arbitrator also considered the continuity of employment between the time of contract and the time of injury whether the transfer was voluntary the length of time between the departure from illinois and the injury and the significance of mahoney contacts with illinois following his departure.
the arbitrator found mahoney had no employment relationship with united in illinois because neither the accident nor his resulting treatment occurred here and he voluntarily transferred to florida from illinois for personal reasons six years before the first accident.accordingly,the arbitrator found no persuasive reason for the commission to accept jurisdiction,and mahoney claims were denied.
the commission affirmed and adopted the arbitrator decision,finding the jurisdiction issue controlled by carroll industrial comm n,d,and united airlines industrial comm n,d,hereinafter,rankins.on judicial review,the circuit court confirmed the decision in a written order,finding it was not against the manifest weight of the evidence and not clearly erroneous.
the appellate court reversed.d.the court held the plain language of the act clearly states that site of the contract for hire is the exclusive test for determining the applicability of the act to persons whose employment is outside illinois where the contract of hire is made within illinois.emphasis in original.d at.the court noted that this court decision in youngstown sheet tube industrial comm n,established a rule for future courts.if the employment contract is made in illinois,a claimant injured in another state is covered under the act.conversely,if the contract of hire is not made in illinois,there is no coverage for injuries incurred outside the state.d at.
the appellate court reasoned united airlines,industrial comm n,hereinafter,walker,involving a fact situation nearly identical to the present case,is directly apposite.the appellate court noted that in light of walker,this court interpreted the act to provide jurisdiction when the contract of hire was made in illinois,even if the employee permanently transferred to another state and the injury occurred several years after the transfer.d at.therefore,the appellate court held that the situs of the contract is the sole determinate of jurisdiction under the act for a person whose employment is outside illinois where the contract of hire is made within illinois.d at.the court overruled carroll and rankins,the appellate precedent relied on by the commission,to the extent those cases deviated from its announced holding.d at.
section of the act imposes liability on employers for injuries to employees arising out of and in the course of employment.ilcs west.section b of the act defines employee as 
every person in the service of another under any contract of hire,express or implied,oral or written,including persons whose employment is outside of the state of illinois where the contract of hire is made within the state of illinois,persons whose employment results in fatal or injuries within the state of illinois where the contract of hire is made outside of the state of illinois,and persons whose employment is principally localized within the state of illinois,regardless of the place of the accident or the place where the contract of hire was made.ilcs b west.
section b of the act provides 
an employee or his dependents under this act who shall have a cause of action by reason of any injury,disablement or death arising out of and in the course of his employment may elect to pursue his remedy in the state where injured or disabled,or in the state where the contract of hire is made,or in the state where the employment is principally localized.ilcs b west.
resolution of the issue presented in this appeal presents a question of law dependent on construction of the preceding statutory language.questions of statutory construction are subject to de novo review.sylvester industrial comm n.
in construing a statute,we are guided by familiar principles.the best indication of legislative intent is the plain and ordinary meaning of the statutory language.illinois graphics nickum.when the language is clear and unambiguous,the court must apply it as written without reading into it exceptions,limitations or conditions not expressed by the legislature.davis toshiba machine,america.we presume the general assembly did not intend absurdity,inconvenience,or injustice.michigan avenue national bank county of cook.the workers compensation act is to be interpreted liberally citation to effectuate its main financial protection for interruption or termination of a worker earning power.sylvester,at.
in union bridge construction industrial comm n,this court considered the question of whether the act provided a remedy for the mother of a young construction worker hired in illinois who was killed while working in kentucky.the version of the act,then in effect,defined the term employee without the express extraterritorial application provisions contained in the present statute.as the statutory definition of employee was of no assistance in deciding the question of illinois jurisdiction,the court turned to the language of the act title,stating the express purpose of the act was to provide compensation for accidental injuries or deaths suffered in the course of employment within this state.emphasis added.union bridge,at,quoting,ch.based on this language,the court denied compensation.although acknowledging the remedial purpose of the act required a liberal construction,the court noted there was no provision authorizing compensation for an injury occurring outside this state.union bridge,at.
in,the legislature amended both the title to the act and the definition of employee,expressly providing for the act application to injuries occurring outside the state when the contract for hire is made within illinois.the constitutionality of the amendment was challenged in beall.supply industrial comm n.the amendment defined employee as 
every person in the service of another under any contract of hire,express or implied,oral or written,including persons whose employment is outside of the state of illinois where the contract of hire is made within the state of illinois.beall,at,quoting,ch,par.
this court upheld the statute,holding that when persons contract under the act,they are conclusively presumed to have accepted its provisions and to be bound thereby,and that a law effective in this state may create rights and liabilities arising from acts occurring outside of this state.citation.beall,at.accordingly,the court upheld an award of compensation to a traveling salesman based in denver,colorado,who was injured in colorado over a year after being hired in illinois.beall,at.
in,the legislature repealed the act of and reenacted it,restructuring sections of the previous act and incorporating the amendment providing for extraterritorial application when the contract of hire is made in illinois.the title of the act was 
an act to promote the general welfare of the people of this state by providing compensation for accidental injuries or death suffered in the course of employment within this state,and without this state where the contract of employment is made within this state providing for the enforcement and administering thereof,and a penalty for its violation,and repealing an act therein named.laws,eff.july.
in,the legislature again amended section b,broadening the definition of employment to include employment principally localized in illinois.the section has not since been amended.
almost three decades after its passage,this court construed the version of section b in youngstown sheet tube industrial comm n.in youngstown,the claimant was originally hired in illinois,laid off,and rehired at a different facility in indiana.a provision in the agreement between the united steelworker union and the company allowed the claimant to retain his seniority because he was rehired by the company within two years.the claimant was,however,required to serve a probationary period following his rehiring.after his injury in indiana,the claimant filed a workers compensation claim in illinois and received an award.on appeal,this court reversed.
the court applied the test,finding it apparent from a reading of section b that an injury falls within the act where the contract of employment was made in illinois.youngstown,at.the court concluded,however,that a new contract of employment was formed in indiana following the termination of the employment relationship in illinois,noting the claimant was interviewed for employment in indiana,underwent a preemployment physical examination in indiana,received a new employee identification number,joined a different local of the union,and was not placed in a position comparable to his illinois employment.youngstown,at.thus,the court held illinois lacked jurisdiction,observing that its jurisdictional finding was particularly appropriate where the employee has not even worked in the state in which he is seeking relief for over years.youngstown,at.we note that the court observation that the claimant had not worked in illinois for years was not dispositive.the decision was based solely on a determination that the claimant contract of hire in illinois was terminated,and a new contract of hire was then created in indiana.
in,this court upheld the constitutionality of the amendment in a case involving an employee hired in illinois who worked in several states and sustained injuries resulting in his death in michigan.goldblatt brothers,industrial comm n.the court rejected as without merit the employer argument that section b of the act denied it equal protection of the law under the united states constitution and the illinois constitution because the employee,if hired in michigan and injured under the same circumstances,would be subject to michigan law,and his survivors would receive much lower benefits.goldblatt brothers,at.the court noted that the claimant widow was authorized to bring the action in either forum,and the fortuitous circumstance that the illinois statute allowed a greater recovery did not defeat her right.goldblatt brothers,at.
in walker,the court upheld a commission decision finding jurisdiction of the claims of a worker hired in illinois in,who voluntarily transferred to a permanent position in united facility in san francisco,california,in february.nearly eight months later,he sustained the first of three injuries.eight months after that,he sustained another injury and was injured again approximately two years later.he received temporary total disability benefits and filed applications for permanent compensation in california.while those applications were pending,he also filed applications for adjustment of his claims in illinois.the commission found illinois jurisdiction,and united sought judicial review.the circuit court consolidated all three claims and reversed the commission,finding that the spirit of this court decision in youngstown required a conclusion that the commission lacked jurisdiction.walker,at.
this court reversed the decision,holding the circuit court reliance on youngstown misplaced,because youngstown is factually distinguishable.walker,at.the court noted that the youngstown claimant was permanently laid off from his position before learning,several months later,of an opening at his former employer indiana facility.he entered into a new contract of hire in indiana,and his new employment relationship was governed by that contract,rather than his former employment contract in illinois.walker,at.conversely,in walker,the claimant employment was continuous and uninterrupted at the time of his transfer to california.therefore,the commission finding that the employment contract existing at the time of his injuries was made in illinois was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.walker,at.
our court rejected united argument urging application of a theory of jurisdiction suggested in a learned treatise by professor larson.according to professor larson,jurisdiction over compensation issues is present only in the forum where the employment relationship is centered,and the status of the relationship should be determined by rules similar to those governing an individual domicile.see larson,workmen compensation,through.the court held application of that theory is inconsistent with the contractual basis of jurisdiction specified in the act,and any change would require a legislative mandate.walker,at.
the dissent in walker,authored by justice simon and joined by chief justice ryan,relied principally on professor larson theory.the dissent noted new hampshire,whose workers compensation statute has language nearly identical to the illinois provision in question,has adopted the employment relation standard advocated by professor larson.walker,at,simon,dissenting,joined by ryan.
subsequently,the walker majority holding was applied by our appellate court in trans world airlines industrial comm n,d.the court upheld compensation awards to two employees injured in missouri following transfer from their employer illinois facility.the court observed,our supreme court has carefully explained that any exclusive application of the theory of using an analysis similar to those governing questions concerning an individual domicile is not consistent
