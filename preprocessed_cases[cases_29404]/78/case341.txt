we address in this case two issues concerning the administration of the workers compensation scheme in this state that have escaped definitive resolution.first,when an employee who has suffered an industrial injury returns to work following a determination the injury has become permanent and stationary,is the employee entitled to temporary disability indemnity tdi to compensate him for time off from work while pursuing continuing medical treatment for that permanent injury second,does an employer discriminate against the injured employee within the meaning of labor code section if it requires the employee to use sick and vacation leave when away from the workplace seeking treatment for his permanent injury we answer both questions in the negative 
applicant ronald lauher had worked as a rehabilitation counselor for petitioner department of rehabilitation employer for years when he submitted a claim for workers compensation benefits based on stress and depression.donald houts submitted a report stating lauher suffered from gerstmann syndrome,a brain lesion causing lauher to experience learning disabilities,but that he had responded to a number of medications,and his condition was permanent and stationary.based on this medical report,lauher entered into a stipulation with his employer and the employer adjusting agency,state compensation insurance fund scif,concluding he had suffered a compensable industrial injury to his psyche causing temporary disability,and that this injury produced a permanent disability of percent,compensable at per week,to a total of.the stipulation further stated that t here is a need for medical treatment to cure or relieve from the effects of said injury.as specified in the report of donald houts,dated.
the workers compensation judge wcj thereafter accepted the stipulation and denied lauher additional claims for penalties under section based on allegations that his supervisor had made harassing telephone calls to lauher and his family,and that employer,before agreeing to the stipulation,had discriminated against lauher by requiring that he use accrued sick and vacation time for absences to attend medical appointments.the wcj denied a petition for reconsideration,as did the workers compensation appeals board wcab or the board.
after agreeing to the stipulation,lauher returned to work.he also continued to see houts for treatment.houts was available for appointments only during regular business hours.lauher journey from his office to houts office is miles.depending on the traffic,it took lauher between two and hours to four hours to drive to houts office,have a session with him,and return to lauher place of employment.employer informed lauher he would not be paid his full salary unless he took sick leave or vacation time for time spent away from his office seeing houts.lauher used close to hours of either sick leave or vacation time to cover his medical appointments with houts.
lauher then filed the petition that forms the basis of this case,seeking reimbursement for the sick and vacation leave his employer docked him for time he spent seeing houts for poststipulation treatment,as well as penalties for discrimination pursuant to section.scif responded and explained that it had paid lauher industrial disability leave and tdi for his period of temporary disability,but that he was not entitled to receive either benefit in the future because his industrial injury had become permanent and stationary.because,according to the stipulation,lauher was entitled to future medical treatment,scif alleged that employer continues to provide for such treatment and denied any discrimination employer has not discriminated against the applicant regarding of leave time.the employer policy in this regard is based on good faith business necessity and has been universally applied in industrial and injuries.
the wcj ruled that lauher established a nexus between his industrial injury and his employer conduct of requiring him to take sick leave to attend doctor appointments.specifically,citing section,the wcj ruled that lauher was entitled to workers compensation benefits in the form of medical treatment and that includes all reasonable expenses of transportation,meals and lodging and one day of temporary disability indemnity for each day of wages lost the worker permanent and stationary status has no bearing on his entitlement to receive treatment.labor code does not say that the worker will be considered temporarily disabled on the day that he goes for treatment,but it says that the worker will be entitled to receive temporary disability indemnity for each day of lost wages.if a worker goes for treatment and must miss time from work,the worker should not be assessed sick leave but,rather,should be paid at the temporary disability rate for the time lost.further,the wcj held employer had not established that a good faith business necessity justified docking lauher sick leave under these circumstances and concluded employer had unlawfully discriminated against lauher.accordingly,the wcj ordered employer to pay a penalty of percent of the cost of all past,present and future medical treatment in this case and also ordered employer to pay lauher for violating section.the wcj thereafter denied a petition for reconsideration the wcab,over one dissent,affirmed.
the court of appeal disagreed with the wcab,finding lauher had not met his burden of presenting a prima facie case of discrimination under section.accordingly,the appellate court annulled the wcab decision.we granted lauher petition for review.
discussion 
background 
more than years ago,our legislature was directed to create and enforce a liability on the part of all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by the said employees in the course of their employment irrespective of the fault of either party.cal,former art.xx,added.this language was modified by an amendment adopted on november,which is in the current state constitution,as renumbered,without substantive change.cal,art.xiv.the legislature complied with this directive by enacting various provisions of the labor code.this statutory scheme rest s on the underlying notion that the remedy for industrial injuries to workers,with the requirements of proof incident to that remedy,involves intolerable delay and great economic waste,gives inadequate relief for loss and suffering,operates unequally as between different individuals in like circumstances,and that,whether viewed from the standpoint of the employer or that of the employee,it is inequitable and unsuited to the conditions of modern industry.western indemnity pillsbury cal.t he theory of the workers compensation legislation is that the risk of injury to workmen in the industries governed by the law should be borne by the industries,rather than by the individual workman alone.as the ultimate result,the burden imposed in the first instance upon the employer,will,it is said,be distributed,as part of the cost of production,among the consuming public.id.at.
this system attempts to assure employees of an expeditious remedy both adequate and certain,independent of any fault on the part of employees and employers.at the same time,it provides the employer with a liability which is determinable within defined limits.it represents a philosophy that industry,as a cost of doing business,should provide for the care and rehabilitation of workers disabled by work injuries.in this way,society supports the program as a n integral element of commerce and industry,rather than through plans.herlick,cal.workers compensation law ed.
in creating and maintaining a system of workers compensation,the people of this state made an important public policy decision and transformed how we address workplace injuries.it should be remembered,however,that the purpose of an award under the workers compensation scheme is not to make the employee whole for the loss which he has suffered but to prevent him and his dependents from becoming public charges during the period of his disability in short the award transfers a portion of the loss suffered by the disabled employee from him and his dependents to the consuming public complete protection is not afforded the employee from disability because this would constitute an invitation to malinger or to be careless on the job as he would then lose nothing in assuming a disabled status.universal city studios,worker comp.appeals bd.d.

with this standard of review in mind,we turn to the first issue posed in this case was lauher entitled to tdi to reimburse him for wages lost while pursuing medical treatment for a permanent and stationary industrial injury 
entitlement to tdi to replace wages lost attending medical appointments for treatment of a permanent and stationary injury 
lauher contends that as a necessary means to the end of ensuring prompt medical treatment pursuant to section,an employee is entitled to temporary total disability indemnity for the time lost from work while attending necessary medical treatment.as we explain,because his industrial injury had become permanent and stationary,he was no longer entitled to receive tdi.
two of the types of benefits available to the worker injured on the job are temporary disability indemnity,or tdi,and permanent disability indemnity,or pdi.although both take the form of financial benefits,i t must be remembered that temporary disability indemnity and permanent disability indemnity were intended by the legislature to serve entirely different functions.temporary disability indemnity serves as wage replacement during the injured worker healing period for the industrial injury.citation.in contrast,permanent disability indemnity compensates for the residual handicap impairment of function after maximum recovery from the effects of the industrial injury have been attained.citation.permanent disability serves to assist the injured worker in his adjustment in returning to the labor market.citation.maples workers comp.appeals bd.d.see also nickelsberg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.
that tdi is intended as wage replacement is inferable from section,which requires temporary total disability be calculated as of the average weekly earnings during the period of such disability,consideration being given to the ability of the injured employee to compete in an open labor market.because t emporary disability indemnity is intended primarily to substitute for the worker lost wages,in order to maintain a steady stream of income thorp,workers comp.appeals bd.d.braewood convalescent hospital workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at,an employer obligation to pay tdi to an injured worker ceases when such replacement income is no longer needed.thus,the obligation to pay tdi ends when the injured employee either returns to work huston workers comp.appeals bd.d.see also or is deemed able to return to work bethlehem steel.acc.com.d,or when the employee medical condition achieves permanent and stationary status industrial indem.exch.acc.com.d,see generally kopitske workers comp.appeals bd.th,d ritchie workers comp.appeals bd.th,d hanna,cal.law of employee injuries and workers compensation,peterson et,hanna.
by contrast,section provides that the first permanent disability payment must be made by the employer within days after the date of the last payment of temporary disability indemnity.from this,we may infer the legislature anticipates an employer has no legal obligation to pay pdi until the obligation to pay tdi has ceased.accordingly,we held in leboeuf workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,that t he right to permanent disability compensation does not arise until the injured worker condition becomes permanent and stationary.id.at,fn.a disability is considered permanent after the employee has reached maximum medical improvement or his or her condition has been stationary for a reasonable period of time,tit,see gee workers comp.appeals bd.th,fn,d hanna,supra,to.
that lauher industrial injury was permanent and stationary is undisputed.lauher physician,houts,so reported,and lauher entered into a stipulation with scif to that effect.that lauher had returned to work is also undisputed.under these circumstances,we conclude he was not entitled to any further tdi payments to compensate him for wages lost due to his attending medical appointments during the workday.an injured employee can not be temporarily and permanently disabled at the same time thus,permanent disability payments do not begin until temporary disability payments cease.city of martinez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see also ritchie workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d same new amsterdam cas.acc.com.d,same hanna,supra,same.here,lauher had passed out of the healing period for which tdi serves as a wage replacement and had agreed to a stipulation compensating him for his diminished ability in the workplace due to a permanent and stationary injury.because lauher had begun collecting pdi,he was no longer entitled to tdi.
lauher counterarguments are not persuasive.as did the wcj,he first relies on section,which relates generally to medical and hospital treatment for an injured worker.that section provides in pertinent part that medical,surgical,chiropractic,acupuncture,and hospital treatment,including nursing,medicines,medical and surgical supplies,crutches,and apparatus,including orthotic and prosthetic devices and services,that is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of the injury shall be provided by the employer.he contends that section should be liberally construed to include replacement of lost wages occasioned by an employee medical treatment.although he is correct that t he legislature intended that section shall be liberally interpreted in favor of the employee right to obtain reimbursement mccoy industrial acc.com.cal d,rodriguez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,he is incorrect that even a liberal interpretation of section will extend so far as to authorize the payment of temporary disability indemnity to replace lost wages when an injury has become permanent and stationary.
lauher apparently would have us analogize the right to reimbursement for sick and vacation leave used for seeking continuing treatment for a permanent and stationary industrial injury to the right to reimbursement for transportation costs.citing avalon,supra,cal th,d,hutchinson workers comp.appeals bd.d,and bundock herndon and finnigan,lauher contends that because section has been construed liberally to compensate an injured worker for transportation costs associated with obtaining medical treatment,we similarly should conclude he is entitled to tdi to compensate him for wages lost while seeking treatment with houts.we disagree because the two situations are not comparable.in avalon,we observed that although section does not expressly refer to medical treatment transportation expenses as an aspect of medical treatment benefits,they have consistently been so regarded under the workers compensation laws.citations.avalon,supra,at,d.the board practice of awarding medical treatment transportation expenses,we observed,is of long standing,noting that such benefits have been paid a s early as.id.at,d.no comparable precedent exists for compensating an injured employee for his wage loss once his injury becomes permanent and stationary.
nor is lauher claim for tdi to offset the associated wage loss he would incur should he fail to use his sick and vacation leave during his appointments with houts supportable as a conceptual matter.lauher argues that i t necessarily follows that if an injured worker loses wages from attending necessary and mandated medical treatment,there is a resultant chilling effect on the injured worker ability to obtain medical treatment.italics added.we disagree and reiterate that although tdi is intended as a wage replacement while the injured worker is healing from his injury,once the injury becomes permanent and stationary the employee returns to work,any future benefits authorized by the workers compensation scheme are not intended as wage replacement.the worker is provided medical benefits,including reimbursement for transportation costs avalon,supra,cal th,d,during the healing period in order to enable him to return to productive employment and to prevent him from becoming a public charge.once he returns to work,in addition to the wages he earns,he is also compensated in the form of pdi for the permanent diminution of his abilities caused by his industrial injuries.the system of workers compensation is not intended to provide full and total recompense for any and all consequences of a worker injury,but instead represents a compromise between the interests of workers and those of employers.as the court of appeal reasoned below,quoting mead diamond international corporation,i n compensation practice day in and day out employees are totally uncompensated for wages lost while attending to medical treatment during their work day.it has long been considered that in exchange for that blanket coverage of compensation without regard to fault,the employee bears some of the burden.quoting the trial referee in mead.we agree 
although lauher relies on specific language in section mentioning reimbursement for transportation expenses,such language applies to a specific and discrete situation not present in this case.thus,the second paragraph of section provides in part where at the request of the employer,the employer insurer,the administrative director,the appeals board,or a workers compensation judge,the employee submits to examination by a physician,he or she shall be entitled to receive in addition to all other benefits herein provided all reasonable expenses of transportation,meals,and lodging incident to reporting for the examination,together with one day of temporary disability indemnity for each day of wages lost in submitting to the examination.italics added.contrary to the views of both lauher and the wcj below,this specific statutory benefit is not a broad obligation to pay tdi to replace an employee wages for time away from work while pursuing medical treatment for a permanent and stationary injury.rather,this benefit is in the nature of a benefit,reimbursing the employee for his time when requested to submit to a medical examination to resolve a compensation claim.lauher can not take advantage of this benefit,both because his treatment with houts is not undertaken at the request of one of the enumerated entities,such as his employer or scif,and because his appointments with houts are for continuing treatment,not for an examination connected with resolving an application for benefits.
finally,lauher argues the schedule of administrative penalties,administrative director rule a,which is codified in california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a hereafter rule,indicates the legislature intent that section be interpreted broadly enough to authorize payment of tdi to reimburse an employee for time away from work seeking medical treatment even though the employee injury has become permanent and stationary.the board accepted this argument as further support for awarding tdi to reimburse lauher for time spent out of the office seeking treatment with houts,but,with due respect to the board,we do not.
section,subdivision a provides in part to make certain that injured workers,and their dependents in the event of their death,receive promptly and accurately the full measure of compensation to which they are entitled,the administrative director shall audit insurers,employers,and administrators to determine if they have met their obligations under this code.in connection with this auditing procedure,section,subdivision a provides in pertinent part the administrative director may assess an administrative penalty against an insurer,employer,or administrator for enumerated failings.finally,section,subdivision b requires the administrative director to promulgate regulations establishing a schedule of violations and the amount of the administrative penalty to be imposed for each type of violation.
pursuant to this legislative delegation,the labor department administrative director promulgated rule a.that provision sets forth a schedule of graduated financial penalties for failures to pay enumerated benefits.in particular,rule a provides the penalty for each failure to pay mileage fees and bridge tolls when notifying the employee of a medical evaluation scheduled by the claims administrator,in accordance with labor code sections through or to pay mileage fees and bridge tolls within days of receiving notice of a medical evaluation scheduled by the administrative director or the appeals board or to object or pay the injured worker for any other transportation,temporary disability,meal or lodging expense incurred to obtain medical treatment or evaluation,within days of receiving a request,is for or less in expense for more than,to,in expense for more than,to,in expense for more than in expense.italics added.
lauher contends this administrative rule,with its specific mention of temporary disability,supports his view that the legislature intended section be interpreted to authorize the payment of tdi as a replacement for wages an employee loses while pursuing medical treatment for an industrial injury that has become permanent and stationary.no basis for such a conclusion exists.read as a whole,rule a addresses several distinct situations.for example,rule a addresses the failure to pay the penalty for a late indemnity payment pursuant to section,subdivision d.rule a addresses the failure to begin paying permanent disability indemnity in a timely fashion.rule a addresses the failure timely to reimburse a worker for medical treatment.
at issue here is rule a.that subsection addresses the failure to pay transportation and associated costs in certain enumerated situations.thus,it first prescribes an administrative penalty for failing to pay mileage and tolls when notifying the employee of a medical evaluation scheduled by the claims administrator.italics added.such an evaluation would typically occur during the healing period when a worker would claim entitlement to tdi,but it could also occur at other times,for example,when the employee ability to return to work is undisputed but disagreement exists over the degree of the permanent injury,in which case further medical evaluations may be necessary.nevertheless,although labor code section specifically provides for payment of transportation expenses and temporary disability when the evaluation is performed at the request of,for example,the employer or the employer insurer,neither this clause of rule a nor labor code section authorizes tdi or wage replacement where,as here,an employee seeks medical treatment for a p
