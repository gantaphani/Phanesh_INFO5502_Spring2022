under the going and coming rule an award of workers compensation benefits is generally not available for injuries suffered by an employee during a local commute to a fixed place of business at fixed hours,because the injury does not occur during the ordinary course of employment.however,the ordinary course of employment is deemed to commence when an employee enters the employer premises the premises line rule,and at that point,the going and coming rule does not bar workers compensation liability.we hold that the premises line rule applies to an employee injured in a traffic accident where the employee was a civilian working on a secure united states air force base not generally open to the public,the employee entered the base in his personal vehicle after passing a guard gate using a security pass issued by his employer with the approval of the air force,the employee had travelled one mile inside the base when the accident occurred,and the undisputed evidence established although the employee worked out of a fixed location,the employer had multiple locations on the air force base and the employee travelled sometimes in his own vehicle,as needed,throughout the base to perform work assigned by his employer.we therefore annul the decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab denying benefits under the going and coming rule.
procedural history 
petitioner craig schultz filed an application for workers compensation benefits after suffering injuries in a traffic accident while driving his personal vehicle on the premises of edwards air force base edwards,where he worked for respondent joint testing tactics and training.in his written brief before trial,schultz argued that the going and coming rule did not preclude workers compensation liability because use of schultz personal vehicle was an express or implied condition of employment,and an accommodation to,even if not a condition of employment.
filed an interim trial brief.argued the accident occurred before schultz had started work,and at a location inside edwards but seven miles from the building where schultz was employed at edwards.also attributed the accident to schultz diabetic condition.disputed that schultz was injured during the course of employment.
on the final day of trial testimony,the workers compensation judge wcj ordered the parties to file posttrial briefs by june.the case would be deemed submitted after briefing was complete.
filed its posttrial brief on june.argued the going and coming rule precluded workers compensation benefits because schultz injuries did not occur in the course of employment.contended it did not agree to allow schultz to use his private vehicle for work,and the accident occurred during schultz regular commute.schultz,as well as other employees,was not required to bring a personal vehicle to work,and there were government cars available for use by employees at edwards.schultz worked at a fixed location on the base,which is not where he was injured.in addition,the injuries did not arise out of employment,but were caused by schultz idiopathic condition diabetes.
schultz filed his posttrial brief on june.he argued that expressly and impliedly required schultz to make his personal vehicle available as an accommodation to the employer,which negates application of the going and coming rule.he further argued had not shown this accident was the result of an idiopathic condition.additionally,schultz devoted seven pages of his posttrial brief to the argument that the premises line rule applied in this case.he was on premises at the time of the injury,meaning as a matter of law the employment relationship had begun for the day.schultz noted that he was one mile onto the premises at edwards when injured,and he was only allowed on the base due to the security pass he received from in connection with his employment.
on september,the wcj ruled in favor of schultz.the wcj rejected reliance on the going and coming rule and idiopathic injury.the wcj credited evidence that schultz at times used his vehicle for the benefit of the employer,which precluded application of the going and coming rule.the wcj did not address schultz premises line rule argument.
sought reconsideration of the ruling of the wcj.the wcj filed a lengthy written opinion recommending against reconsideration.the wcab granted reconsideration and reversed the decision of the wcj,stating the problem with the wcj analysis is that it focuses on how the employer might possibly benefit by having applicant bring his car to work instead of considering why applicant was in his car on may,and what he was actually doing at the time he crashed.according to the wcab analysis,the undisputed evidence showed that schultz was driving his personal car outside of work hours when he crashed during his morning commute to work.there was no evidence that at the time of the injury schultz was performing a service growing out of and incidental to his employment,or that schultz was required to bring his car to work or that he was expected to run errands in it on a regular basis.occasional use of an employee car for work purposes does not render the employer liable for any injury the employee incurs in the course of commuting to work.rejecting the factual findings of the wcj,the wcab concluded had vehicles that were almost always available for use,and work could be postponed if no vehicle was available.the injury here occurred outside of work hours and not while schultz was on a special mission or errand for.the wcab ordered entry of new findings of denial of workers compensation benefits.the wcab opinion did not mention schultz premises line rule argument.
schultz petitioned for writ of review in this court,arguing that he was in the course of employment at the time of the accident and the going and coming rule did not bar liability because he used his personal vehicle at various times to accommodate,acting with express or implied agreement,and once he entered the secure area of edwards,he had arrived at work under the premises line rule.we granted schultz petition for writ review.we agree that the undisputed facts demonstrate that the premises line rule,rather than the going and coming rule,applies to the facts of this case.we therefore annul the decision of the wcab that schultz did not establish an exception to the going and coming rule.

discussion 
in his petition for writ of review,schultz argued,inter alia,that he is entitled to workers compensation benefits because his injury occurred on premises and thus he was injured in the course of his employment.schultz asserted it is undisputed that has multiple locations within edwards and employs more than people in multiple buildings across the base.has multiple clients,both civilian and military,situated throughout edwards.employees eat and have meetings on the base,and obtain supplies from a store at edwards.edwards is a restricted location that can only be entered with security clearance issued by an employer or the united states government.according to schultz,the entire base is premises.the accident happened one mile inside the north gate,meaning it occurred on premises,and not while schultz was commuting to its premises.the going and coming rule does not apply under these circumstances.

in his reply brief,schultz disputes contention that the issue of the premises line rule was never raised in the trial court.schultz points to the seven pages of argument in his posttrial brief specifically relying on the premises line rule to demonstrate the issue was raised before the wcj.
forfeiture 
is correct that issues not raised in the trial court are generally forfeited for purposes of appeal.issues presented on appeal must actually be litigated in the trial court not simply mentioned in passing.natkin california unemployment ins.appeals bd.th,see people valdez cal th,objections not raised in the trial court will not be addressed on appeal.however,the rule has no application in this case.
schultz clearly identified the premises line issue in his posttrial brief as a basis for liability.issues raised in posttrial briefs are preserved for review on appeal.american modern home ins.fahmian th,citing amerigraphics,mercury casualty th,and all west design,boozer d.
also contends that schultz waived his premises line rule contention by failing to file an opposition to reconsideration,citing to language in labor code section.this is incorrect.under labor code section,the petitioner for reconsideration shall be deemed to have finally waived all objections,irregularities,and illegalities concerning the matter upon which the reconsideration is sought other than those set forth in the petition for reconsideration.the petitioner for reconsideration in this case was,not schultz,and the waiver rule of labor code section does not under the plain language of the statute apply to schultz failure to file an opposition.the issue has not been forfeited by schultz.
