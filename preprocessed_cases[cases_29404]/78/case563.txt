plaintiff and respondent mike lenk lenk filed suit against his former employer,defendant and appellant,twi,for breach of contract and fraud.in a bifurcated trial,the jury found in favor of lenk and awarded him in compensatory damages,in emotional distress damages and million in punitive damages.
in the unpublished portion of this opinion,we reverse that part of the judgment awarding lenk in compensatory damages.we also reverse the punitive damages award,and remand the case for a new trial on those issues.in the published portion of this opinion,we determine the language in an employment agreement relating to a performance review after one year does not constitute a term of employment.we also find that emotional distress damages arising from a claim of fraud in inducing employment are not barred by the workers compensation exclusivity doctrine.
procedural and factual histories 
liability phase 
in,arb arb,a general contractor with several divisions in the construction industry,hired lenk as a purchasing agent in its bakersfield,california office.in september,arb moved its headquarters from bakersfield to paramount,california,and promoted lenk to corporate purchasing agent in the new office.lenk was provided with a salary increase from per year to per year,approximately of which represented compensation for the higher cost of living in the los angeles area.following his promotion,lenk continued to maintain his residence in bakersfield.he utilized arb corporate housing in la palma for the first four months while looking for housing in the los angeles area,but was unable to find any appealing or affordable housing.beginning in february,lenk commuted to work from bakersfield or stayed in a motel in los angeles at his expense.
twi,also headquartered in paramount,was in the business of industrial contracting.during,the company was actively searching for a purchasing agent.in may,george gray,a salesman for twi and a former coworker of lenk at arb,saw lenk at a social function.lenk informed gray of his new position at arb.he did not tell gray he was looking for a job.gray expressed to clarence edens,the vice president of twi bakersfield office,that he felt lenk was frustrated with having to travel between bakersfield and paramount and he believed there was an opportunity to recruit lenk for the purchasing agent position at twi.edens instructed gray to have lenk forward his resume.after two subsequent calls from gray,lenk eventually forwarded his resume to twi.
in a june,memorandum to donald grimes,the president of twi from through,edens advised 
when making my original budget projections for this year,i grossly under estimated the total effort that would be required to turn our financial position around.an existing extreme financial position,an extreme negative business and professional image and an almost sales effort was just the tip of the iceberg.add to these no employee morale and an aging decrepit equipment fleet and you begin to get an idea of the hole that we were in.
we will continue to revamp our purchasing department and its procedures this must become an automated computerized effort.our inventory by consignment effort for consumable and expendables is almost complete.detailed invoice review continues to clean up the system and eliminate costly errors.timely and accurate job cost tracking and reporting continues to be a significant problem.our tracking is accomplished and is a duplicative effort that is very tedious and expensive.our current corporate computer accounting system will not support us in this area and there should be a sense of urgency in correcting this problem.
on june,edens contacted lenk and requested an interview with him.lenk told edens he was not looking for a job,but edens replied,it never hurts to talk.lenk agreed to meet with edens the following day.according to lenk,he explained to edens he had a secure position at arb and had recently been promoted to the corporate level.in response,lenk testified edens represented that twi planned to move its corporate headquarters to bakersfield and lenk would be first in line for a corporate purchasing position with twi.edens provided lenk with information concerning twi benefits and told him to call if he was interested.the two men exchanged several more calls.on july,lenk telephoned edens after reading a newspaper article about twi that indicated it was a company and a subsidiary of a,conglomerate,bragg investment company.the article quoted edens.edens told lenk he intended to formulate a written offer and deliver it to him the following monday.
grimes estimated that in june,twi annual revenues were approximately million.grimes questioned edens about the july article,as he did not know the size of bragg investment company and believed edens would not have known the size either.grimes never received a satisfactory answer as to where edens obtained the revenue figures for twi or bragg investment company that were set forth in the article.grimes never inquired whether edens had communicated this information to any job applicants.
on july,edens delivered twi written employment offer to lenk.the offer stated,in pertinent part 
after meeting with and discussing the possibility of you becoming a part of the bakersfield twi team,i am excited about what you can contribute to our effort and the opportunities we can offer you.
as a key member of our staff you will have the opportunity to turn our purchasing activity into a well organized effort and implement some ideas that you have developed yet not had the opportunities to see bear fruit and bring results.and while this is a staff position in the bakersfield office i certainly think advancement to the corporate level is a distinct possibility.
i would like to propose the following to you 
on july,lenk submitted a letter of resignation to arb and accepted twi offer of employment.lenk testified that,in accepting the position with twi,he relied on the representations made to him by edens and the written employment offer.lenk entered into a written employment agreement with twi that provided,in relevant part 
the employment agreement,signed by lenk and edens,did not state that lenk employment was for any specific term.lenk testified that he understood the language regarding the performance review to give him a minimum term of employment.he believed he was committing his services for a minimum of months.however,he acknowledged that no one at twi ever told him so.in addition,no one at twi ever told lenk he could not be terminated except for good cause.lenk believed he could be terminated after one year.
in july,twi bakersfield office had a net loss of approximately.grimes estimated that during the fiscal year,that office suffered a net loss between million and million.
