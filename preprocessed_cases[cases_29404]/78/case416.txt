this court granted virginia brooks petition for writ of review from decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab to examine whether a year of industrial disability leave idl payable to state employees under government code sections falls within the ambit of the limitation on aggregate temporary disability payments in labor code section,subdivision c,enacted as part of the workers compensation reforms bill reg.sess.stats,ch.we agree with the wcab and conclude that under the current statutory scheme state employees are limited to a maximum of two years of combined temporary disability indemnity.
background 
the parties have stipulated to the relevant facts.on october,virginia brooks sustained an injury to her right shoulder and psyche arising out of and in the course of her employment as a correctional officer with the california department of corrections and rehabilitation cdcr.as a state agency,the cdcr was legally uninsured for workers compensation and contracted with the state compensation insurance fund scif to adjust its workers compensation claims.
brooks earned an average of per week as a correctional officer at the time of her injury.the scif determined that brooks would be paid per week of idl indemnity over one year and provided her with workers compensation temporary disability td of per week during the following year through october.while brooks thereafter remained totally temporarily disabled,scif stopped providing td payments after two years from the date of her injury.
in march,brooks brought the matter for a hearing before a workers compensation administrative law judge wcj contending she was entitled to another year of td because the limitation on those benefits established under section,subdivision c,as amended in,did not begin running until october,when her initial year of idl payments ceased.the wcj disagreed with brooks,reasoning idl is the functional equivalent of td and that the new statutory limit authorized only weeks of combined idl and td indemnity.
brooks petitioned the wcab for reconsideration,claiming idl is not td because idl payments are made under different rules,to a limited class of employees,at different rates,and for different periods.in a report and recommendation to the wcab,the wcj primarily relied on the statutory definition under government code section,subdivision a providing that idl means temporary disability as defined in the labor code workers compensation provisions.the wcab summarily denied reconsideration by adopting and incorporating the wcj reasoning.
discussion 
brooks contends the state idl and td programs are mutually exclusive and independent benefits payable to temporarily disabled state employees.while the parties agree brooks appropriately received an initial year of idl and at least one additional year of td,brooks argues she is entitled to a second year of td,for a total of three years of indemnity benefits,while she remained temporarily disabled.given the parties stipulations and lack of any dispute as to the underlying facts,brooks presents a pure question of law reviewable by this court de novo.department of rehabilitation workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,lauher signature fruit workers comp.appeals bd.th,d signature fruit.we nevertheless accord significant respect to the wcab interpretation of workers compensation statutes unless clearly erroneous.avalon bay foods workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.considering a seasonal worker ability to receive td during her regular unemployment season,this court summarized the appropriate standard of review in signature fruit

industrial disability leave 
originally enacted under government code section in stats,ch,as part of the berryhill total compensation act,government code section authorizes an idl benefit for state officers or employees who are temporarily disabled by illness or injury arising out of and in the course of their employment.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.d.except for certain public safety workers falling within a separate disability leave of absence program,idl applies to all compensated state officers and employees belonging to the public employees retirement system or the state teachers retirement system and all noncivil service employees of the legislature.
idl provides industrially injured state employees with up to weeks of indemnity benefits,subd.a.those benefits normally begin on the fourth day after a state employee leaves work due to the injury,but apply from the first day the employee leaves work if the injury causes disability in excess of days,if the employee requires hospitalization,or if the injury is the result of a criminal act of violence,subds.a and b.for the first days,the employee receives his or her full salary less the amount of the employee exemption withholdings for federal income,state income,and social security taxes as of the date of disability,subd.a.idl is mandatory for the first days of disability unless it would result in an amount less than that which would be provided by td,tit.the employee receives of his or her regular salary throughout the remainder of weeks,during which time the employee may also supplement idl payments with accrued leave time in an amount approximating the employee full net pay,subd.a,subd.b.an employee on idl is also entitled to continue receiving all employee benefits which he or she would have received had he or she not incurred disability,subd.a.if an injury results from particularly egregious circumstances not applicable here,some state employees are further eligible for enhanced idl providing the employee full net salary for the entire weeks,tit.
an employee first level of administrative remedy for complaints arising out of idl lies with the employing state department,tit.thereafter,complaints arising under the government code,such as those related to the payment of idl and leave administration,must be appealed to the department of personnel administration,tit,subd.b.
workers compensation temporary disability 
pursuant to state constitutional mandate,the california workers compensation act provides for a compulsory scheme of employer liability without fault for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment.service,workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.unlike idl,workers compensation benefits apply to any or all california workers and represents the social public policy of this state,binding upon all departments of the state government.cal,art.xiv.thus,the state and every state agency is expressly included within the definition of an employer under the workers compensation act,subd.a.
the labor code workers compensation provisions nowhere define the term temporary disability.see hanna,cal.law of employee injuries workers compensation ed.notwithstanding the lack of a statutory definition,appellate decisions interpreting the workers compensation laws have nevertheless established that a temporary disability is an impairment reasonably expected to be cured or materially improved with proper medical treatment.signature fruit,supra,th at,d,citing western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.td benefits provide a substitute for lost wages during a period of temporary incapacity from working.livitsanos superior court cal th,d.
a state employee may not receive td or accrued leave benefits while also receiving idl,tit.similar to idl,td benefits commence on the fourth day after the injured employee leaves work,but apply retroactively to the first day if the disability extends beyond days or the employee requires hospitalization.td payments are calculated at of the average weekly earnings during the period of such disability,consideration being given to the ability of the injured employee to compete in an open labor market.as with idl,an employee may elect to supplement td payments up to his or her full salary or wage with accrued leave time.unlike idl,however,the legislature has artificially restricted an injured worker average weekly earnings for purposes of calculating td to statutorily defined minimum and maximum levels during brooks injury in,maximum average earnings were limited to per week,subd.a.thus,although brooks stipulated weekly income as a correctional officer at the time of her injury slightly exceeded the statutory maximum average weekly earnings rate,she was entitled to only of,or,of td indemnity.
after first seeking a departmental administrative remedy,an industrially injured state employee may appeal to the wcab on matters within the jurisdiction of the worker compensation act of the labor code,tit,subd.a.such matters include but are not limited to determination of liability for provision of medical care,temporary disability payments,vocational rehabilitation,and related items.ibid.
senate bill limitation on workers compensation temporary disability 
government code section,subdivision a establishes that a state employee who continues to be temporarily disabled after exhausting idl is entitled to workers compensation benefits,which include td indemnity td payments generally end when the employee returns to work,is deemed able to return to work,or achieves permanent and stationary status and becomes eligible for permanent disability.lauher,supra,cal th at,d,signature fruit,supra,th at,d.the parties agree,however,that none of these traditional grounds existed for terminating brooks td applied in the present case.the wcab instead relied on section,subdivision c as amended in,which now provides 
aggregate disability payments for a single injury occurring on or after april,causing temporary disability shall not extend for more than compensable weeks within a period of two years from the date of commencement of temporary disability payment.
brooks contends that under revised section,subdivision c,she was entitled to weeks of td following her initial year of idl benefits.she argues the statutory scheme is clear that the legislature intended both benefit mechanisms to be distinct sources of indemnity for state employees because idl and td are set forth in different codes,idl is governed by the government code and td by the labor code,and because section limit on td benefits does not reference the term idl.she claims that if idl and td comprised the same benefit,there would be no need for government code section to provide that a state employee may not receive both idl and td concurrently or for government code section,subdivision a to state that an employee who has exhausted idl may subsequently obtain td.brooks further asks this court to rely on the lack of any reference in senate bill preamble suggesting a new limitation on state employee idl benefits and on section overriding mandate to construe workers compensation provisions liberally with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.
we agree that the statutory scheme is clear,but not with brooks conclusion that idl and td are distinct classes of benefits that do not overlap.despite brooks arguments to the contrary,the legislature has already answered her inquiry.located within the idl provisions,government code section,subdivision a expressly provides that idl means temporary disability.because idl is statutorily defined as the equivalent of td,then the limitation under section,subdivision c,necessarily must apply to both idl and td.furthermore,the limitation does not restrict itself only to td benefits payable under the workers compensation act or the labor code,as it more broadly applies to aggregate disability payments for a single injury,subd.c,italics added.finding the statutory scheme unambiguous,we need not resort to interpreting alternate statutory constructions or to section requirement to construe benefits liberally towards extending benefits.brodie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,section is a tool for resolving statutory ambiguity where it is not possible through other means to discern the legislature actual intent.
in reaching the same conclusion,the wcab,by adopting the wcj report and recommendation,found support in the fourth appellate district decision in state of california workers comp.appeals bd.th,d ellison,also involving the scif and a state correctional officer.following initial hearings before a wcj,the scif agreed to provide the employee with seven and a half months of idl.id.at,d.after the scif failed to provide the benefits as agreed,the employee petitioned the wcab demanding payment plus a percent penalty pursuant to former section ellison,supra,th at,d.the scif subsequently paid the idl,but the employee continued to seek the penalty award.id.at,d.largely agreeing with the employee,the wcab found no excuse for this delay in payment of temporary disability per government code section and awarded the percent penalty.ibid.departing from the employee position,the wcab calculated the penalty award on the amount of td that would have been due during the disability period rather than on the employee higher idl rate.ibid.
after analyzing the jurisdictional roles of the wcab and the department of personnel administration,the appellate court in ellison agreed with the wcab exercise of authority to impose the penalty based on td even though the employee actually received idl.ellison,supra,th at,d see also blankenship workers comp.appeals bd,writ den.acknowledging that the wcab maintained jurisdiction over td but not idl,the court based its decision in part on the legislature definition of idl as identical with temporary disability td under the labor code,subd.a ellison,supra,at,d,fn.omitted.
brooks claims ellison conclusion that idl is identical to td is mere dicta,and that the case instead supports her proposition that an employee is first entitled to a year of idl before receiving an additional two years of td.brooks relies on the ellison court description that state workers eligible for idl are entitled to this benefit,rather than td,until the idl is exhausted,at which point the employee who continues to be temporarily disabled is entitled to receive td.ellison,supra,th at,d.according to brooks,this language is,the employee gets the one,and then the employee gets the other.
although the court in ellison relied on multiple grounds for reaching the conclusion that the wcab could award penalties based on the employee td rate where the state did not provide any form of temporary disability indemnity to its injured worker,we find the court conclusion that idl constitutes temporary disability both necessary to the case and more significantly,expressly set forth by government code section,subdivision a.moreover,while idl constitutes a form of temporary disability,the benefits are not necessarily calculated at the same rate because idl is not limited by the artificial average weekly earnings rate and an employee receiving idl continues to receive his or her other state benefits.thus,the ellison court assertion that an employee first receives idl and subsequently receives td simply describes that an industrially injured state employee first receives temporary disability indemnity at the idl rate,including state benefits,and then at the td rate.
the wcab reached a similar conclusion to the present case in salmon workers comp.appeals bd.writ den.salmon.in salmon,a department of transportation employee received months of idl payments followed by td indemnity through two years from the date of injury.the parties disputed whether the limitation on td
