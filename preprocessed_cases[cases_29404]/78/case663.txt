we have for review fleetwood homes of florida,reeves,so d dca,in which the second district court of appeal certified the following questions of law to be of great public importance 
may a district court review a nonfinal order denying,as a matter of law,a motion for summary judgment on the issue of workers compensation immunity if it is clear that the trial court intends to submit the issue of gross negligence or intentional tort to the jury as a question of fact 
if an employer allows its employees to perform a negligent procedure repeatedly and for a long period,may the first incident in which the procedure results in injury or death be treated as an intentional tort under turner pcr,so d 
we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.because we answer the first certified question in the negative,and hold that the second district did not have jurisdiction to review the nonfinal order of the circuit court,we decline to address the second certified question.
allison reeves,the personal representative of the estate of dennis reeves,filed a wrongful death action against dennis reeves employer,fleetwood homes of florida hereinafter fleetwood,and two of fleetwood employees,marvin miller and mickie oliver.see fleetwood homes,so d at.the second district ably detailed the relevant facts of the accident that resulted in dennis reeves death 
dennis reeves was an employee of fleetwood,which manufactures homes in a factory.although he normally had another job assignment,on april,he was assigned to work at a table inside the factory.the table was adjacent to an aisle used by the forklift operators to move supplies into the factory.a structural column that supported the roof of the factory was across the aisle from this table.a pipe ran up the aisle side of this column.because of the layout of the factory near this column,for a distance of about feet,the aisle was narrower at ground level than the width of some of the supplies that were transported by the forklifts.as a result,the forklift operators had been instructed to raise wide loads to approximately feet in the air.
a common wide load that was transported by the forklifts was sheet metal used as roofing material for the manufactured homes.this sheet metal came in rolls that weighed about pounds and were about wide.the forklifts transported three rolls per trip.the roofing material was not strapped onto the forklifts.when the roofing material was raised feet in the air,the forklift operators did not have a clear view of the column and had only a few inches of clearance.they relied upon a painted stripe on the floor to properly position their forklifts to negotiate this narrow location.
when a forklift entered the factory,the operator honked its horn.this was a signal for nearby workers to move out of the way.affected workers were instructed to heed the warning provided by the horn,but workers did not always respond to the horn.the management at fleetwood had instructed the forklift operators to continue transporting their loads even if another worker did not move.they were expected to report such a problem to management at a later time.because reeves had never worked at this table prior to the day of the accident,it is unclear whether he had been instructed to heed the horn.
on the day of this accident,marvin miller was the forklift operator.he sounded the forklift horn as he entered this area with rolls of sheet metal.he did not know reeves.he observed that reeves was not leaving the table.he continued to transport the roofing material.as he was negotiating the narrow location by the column and the pipe,he was watching the painted marking on the floor for proper positioning.for some reason,the roofing material hit the pipe.the load was knocked off balance and a roll of the sheet metal slid off the driver left side of the forklift,striking reeves.he sustained severe injuries and died shortly after this accident.
the management at fleetwood knew that forklift operators had occasionally bumped this pipe when transporting wide loads.miller foreman,mickie oliver,also knew that forklift operators had struck this pipe.there is no evidence,however,that a roll of roofing or any other wide load had ever previously fallen from a forklift or that any worker had ever been injured as a result of this procedure.miller was a very experienced forklift operator.he had performed this maneuver on many occasions in the past.there is no evidence that he had any prior history of accidents,that he was driving too fast or recklessly at the time of this accident,or that he was under the influence of any unlawful substance.he simply misjudged the location of the pipe or the position of his load,and the accident happened.
osha investigated this accident.it declined to treat the accident as a willful violation of safety regulations.osha fined fleetwood and ordered certain corrective action.fleetwood is still allowed to raise wide loads into the air,but it now secures these elevated loads.it requires the forklift operators to clear employees from this area before transporting such loads.fleetwood is taking greater steps to make certain that all employees are aware of this danger.although it apparently was not required by osha,fleetwood has moved the table away from the location of this accident.
allison reeves second amended complaint contained six counts,only three of which are relevant to our review count four of the amended complaint alleged gross negligence against the forklift operator,marvin miller.similarly,count five alleged gross negligence against miller foreman,mickie oliver.finally,count six alleged that fleetwood had engaged in conduct substantially certain to result in dennis reeves injury or death,the complaint alleged that fleetwood had committed an intentional tort.the second district explained the substance of the counts 
the fourth count attempted to allege gross negligence as to the conduct of miller.it alleged that he knew,prior to this accident,that other workers had not been getting out of his way when he drove the elevated loads he knew reeves did not respond to his warning and remained in an area of danger at the time of this accident he knew he had poor visibility and a small margin of error in which to maneuver this elevated load he knew the load was not secured and he knew these procedures were dangerous and a violation of safety policies.this count included an allegation that miller had engaged in a course of conduct that a reasonably prudent person would know was probably and most likely to result in injury to persons.
the fifth count attempted to allege gross negligence against the foreman,oliver.it realleged the risks described in the count against miller and explained that oliver was an experienced forklift operator who worked essentially as a foreman with the responsibility to supervise miller work and to assure that it was performed safely.the complaint concluded that he too should have known that these circumstances were probably and most likely to result in injury to persons.
the sixth count attempted to allege an unspecified intentional tort against fleetwood.it realleged the conduct of miller and oliver.it alleged that management at fleetwood had knowledge of these circumstances.it alleged that fleetwood pressured its workers to maintain a high degree of productivity and did not provide adequate safety training or properly respond to the known safety issues created by the forklifts.it concluded that the course of conduct of the fleetwood employees was such that a reasonably prudent person would know that it was substantially certain to result in injury or death.
after the action had been pending for a number of years and the parties had engaged in extensive discovery,fleetwood and its employees requested the entry of a summary final judgment.see id.the respondents argued that they were entitled to immunity pursuant to the workers compensation act,section of the florida statutes supp.the trial court conducted a lengthy hearing and ultimately denied the respondents motion for summary judgment.see id.
with respect to counts four and five of the second amended complaint the claims of gross negligence against the forklift operator and his foreman,the trial court explained in its written order 
t he court finds that the occurrence of the subject incident was inevitable,given the violations alleged by plaintiff which are disputed by defendant but,which must be accepted as true on a motion for summary judgment.
the facts of this case and the allegations of the plaintiff,viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,create a factual basis for a composite of circumstances which,together,constituted an imminent or clear and present danger amounting to more than normal and usual peril,show a chargeable knowledge or awareness of the imminent danger,and evince a conscious disregard of consequences.these circumstances taken in combination presented a high risk of serious injury.
therefore,as to these counts,as a matter of law,the defendants motion should be denied.
citation omitted.regarding count six asserting that fleetwood committed an intentional tort,the trial court reasoned 
mickie oliver,as the agent of fleetwood,had knowledge of the violations alleged by plaintiff.
oliver knowledge is chargeable to fleetwood.
the acts complained of in the instant case were not as egregious as those present in the cases cited in the defendants motion,in which the courts found that the defendants conduct did not rise to the threshold necessary to overcome workers compensation immunity.nevertheless,the court finds that the occurrence of the subject incident was inevitable,given the violations alleged by plaintiff which are disputed by defendant but,which must be accepted as true on a motion for summary judgment.
the court finds that oliver committed intentional acts or that were substantially certain to result in injury or death to dennis reeves.

fleetwood,oliver,and miller filed a timely appeal seeking review of the nonfinal order denying their motion for summary judgment.see fleetwood homes,so d at.initially,the second district analyzed whether it had jurisdiction to review the nonfinal order of the trial court.the appellate court recognized that florida rule of appellate procedure a c v grants a district court jurisdiction to review a nonfinal order that determines,as a matter of law,that a party is not entitled to workers compensation immunity.see id.further,the second district cited this court decision in hastings demming,so d,noting that there,this court held,nonfinal orders denying summary judgment on a claim of workers compensation immunity are not appealable unless the trial court order specifically states that,as a matter of law,such a defense is not available to a party.fleetwood homes,so d at quoting hastings,so d at.however,the court explained that its jurisdictional dilemma is predicated on the fact that workers compensation immunity is not usually a defense at trial.id.
the lower court detailed the legal framework applied in an action in which a plaintiff seeks damages in tort and attempts to prove the type of claim that avoids the exclusive liability restrictions of the workers compensation act.the district court explained that an employee may sue an employer for an intentional tort,may sue a supervisor whose conduct rises to the level of culpable negligence,or sue a coemployee whose conduct rises to the level of gross negligence or willful and wanton conduct.see id.at citing.stat.supp.in such cases,the court stated,the defendant does not argue a workers compensation immunity defense,but instead argues that he is not liable under the particular standard of care asserted by the plaintiff.see id.the court then stated 
as a result of this legal framework,if a trial court decides to deny an employer or a fellow employee motion for summary judgment,the court will rarely state that it is deciding an issue as a matter of law.instead,the trial judge will usually conclude that a disputed issue of fact exists as to whether the employer or the fellow employee was liable under the applicable lower standard of care.for example,the truth may be that the trial court in this case actually decided that fleetwood and its employees were entitled to workers compensation immunity,but that immunity did not prevent this suit from going to trial on allegations of gross negligence or intentional tort.if the supreme court intends to prohibit appellate review of orders denying summary judgment in all cases where the trial court intends to allow the plaintiff to proceed to trial on an intentional tort or a claim of gross negligence or culpable negligence,then it might be simpler to eliminate rule a c v because the rule would then have virtually no application to any order that a defendant would wish to appeal.
under this interpretation,this jurisdictional rule would allow review only in the very rare case where the trial court determined,as a matter of law,that the undisputed facts established that the defendant was not the statutory employer or a coworker.so interpreted,the rule would allow for appeal only when the trial court was planning to proceed to trial on the issue of the defendant simple negligence because the trial court had rejected,as a matter of law,the claim that the defendant was an employer or fellow employee.
explaining that the legislative intent behind the workers compensation act was to provide employers and coemployees with immunity from suit except in extraordinary situations,the second district determined that i f the appellate courts are to monitor compliance with these legislative policies,the review must take place at the time the nonfinal order is entered,and not after lengthy and expensive litigation.id.at.based upon its analysis,the lower court concluded that it did have jurisdiction to review the order of the trial court.the second district noted 
we are convinced the supreme court understands these policy distinctions and intends for the district courts to have jurisdiction to review cases similar to this case.in this case,there are undoubtedly factual questions in dispute.however,because the standards of care applicable to gross negligence,culpable negligence,and intentional tort are very limited,the disputed facts in this case do not actually create disputes concerning the material issues.in other words,the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff are so crystallized that a court can determine,as a matter of law,that these facts do not rise to the heights of gross negligence,culpable negligence,or intentional tort.see hastings,so d at.thus,rule a c v should restrict us from examining cases where the record is not factually on the issue of workers compensation immunity,but it should not prevent us from enforcing the legislative policy of immunity when we can review a record to conclude that the plaintiff can not present prima facie evidence to establish the exceptional case of gross negligence,culpable negligence,or intentional tort in this context.
id.however,because the second district was not entirely satisfied that it did,in fact,have jurisdiction in the instant matter,the court certified the following question as a question of great public importance may a district court review a nonfinal order denying,as a matter of law,a motion for summary judgment on the issue of workers compensation immunity if it is clear that the trial court intends to submit the issue of gross negligence or intentional tort to the jury as a question of fact id.at.
although the district court determined that it did have jurisdiction pursuant to rule a c v,the second district additionally concluded that even if the court was without jurisdiction to review the trial court order pursuant to the rule,it could properly review the order under its certiorari jurisdiction.see id.at.the court explained that the trial court had departed from the essential requirements of the law by applying the concept of an inevitable accident as a method of establishing gross negligence and an intentional tort.see id.the district court concluded that the trial court departure from the essential requirements of the law deprived the respondents of a statutory right to immunity from suit,and the legal error could not be adequately remedied on dir
