petitioner juan rivera sustained an industrial injury and entered into a settlement agreement with his employer,respondent tower staffing solutions tower.the settlement included accrued and continuing periodic indemnity payments.rivera also requested commutation of future indemnity payments into a lump sum,which was approved by the workers compensation appeals board wcab.tower was late in paying the amounts due and included a percent increase under labor code section,subdivision d 
rivera alleged the payments were late and underpaid,and sought multiple percent increases for unreasonable delay under section the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj found there was late payment and a greater amount owed under section,and awarded two increases under section.
tower appealed.the wcab concluded in an en banc decision,that the timing provisions of section limited the statute to periodic indemnity payments,and that the statute did not apply to periodic indemnity payments reduced to a lump sum by reason of commutation or settlement.the wcab affirmed a single increase under section for the late payment of indemnity.
rivera petitions for writ of review.he contends the plain language of section,subdivision d is that the statute is applicable to any payment of indemnity.rivera further contends he is entitled to multiple increases under section.tower answers that the plain language of section supports the wcab interpretation,and the decision should be affirmed.
we conclude that section is applicable to payments of periodic and accrued temporary and permanent disability indemnity,but not to payments of future permanent disability indemnity commuted into a lump sum.accordingly,the decision of the wcab is annulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
juan rivera,a machine operator for tower,caught his left hand in a machine at work on march,and suffered a severe crush amputation through the joints of the fingers and a torn forearm muscle.on december,rivera and tower entered into stipulations with request for award stipulations,which was awarded by the wcj.the stipulations provided that all temporary disability indemnity was adequately compensated through april.it further provided that the injury caused percent permanent disability,which totaled in indemnity payable at per week beginning may.in addition,rivera would receive a life pension at the indemnity rate of per week after the payment of permanent disability indemnity the stipulations finally provided that in attorney fees would be commuted from the far end of the award,and no interest or penalties would be imposed if the award were paid within days.
at the same time,rivera petitioned for commutation into a lump sum all future indemnity payments,including the life pension the wcj ordered the commutation,subject to objection within days.tower did not object.
on or about january,tower paid the attorney fees and to rivera.an accompanying letter indicated that the payment was based on the stipulations.
on or about february,tower paid rivera.an accompanying letter set forth a series of calculations and indicated that the amount represented all future indemnity payments from february,including the life pension,which was commuted into the lump sum.also included in the amount was interest and,which was payment under section.
rivera claimed the amounts paid were incorrect and unreasonably delayed,and he was entitled to multiple increases or penalties under sections and.the parties proceeded to trial and submitted briefing.tower provided its calculations and denied liability for multiple increases or penalties under christian workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,christian erroneous decision not to pay benefit followed by demands for payment not separate and distinct acts of unreasonable delay or refusal that involve different classes of benefits,claims for medical or travel expense,delay following penalty award,or other legally significant event such as an admission of liability and california highway patrol workers comp.appeals bd.th,d california highway patrol only one section increase for failure to include required interest with unreasonably delayed payment.
the wcj found tower had unreasonably delayed payment and underpaid the amount owed under section,subdivision d.the wcj imposed two separate percent increases under section.
in its opinion,the wcj explained that tower counsel was personally served with the commutation order after it was approved,and since there was no objection within days,payment was due on january.however,the wcj viewed the two late payments as a single unreasonable delay under christian.the wcj further found that tower calculation of the commuted value of permanent disability indemnity was correct.because payment under section was short,a second increase under section was justified.
tower petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.tower conceded the late payment and a single increase under section.however,tower maintained that the calculation error under section was part of a single course of conduct under christian and california highway patrol.
the wcab granted reconsideration and issued an en banc decision the wcab noted the timing provisions of section and reasoned that,by its own wording,section applies to periodic payments of temporary and permanent disability indemnity.the wcab also cited cases that addressed section,such as gangwish workers comp.appeals bd.th,d gangwish the wcab concluded that periodic indemnity payments changed or commuted into a lump sum were no longer periodic and,consequently,the timed payment and penalty provisions of section were not applicable the wcab affirmed a single increase under section for the unreasonably delayed payment.
rivera petitions for writ of review.he contends section,subdivision d,applies to any indemnity payment as expressly stated by the statute.he also contends commuted future periodic permanent disability indemnity remains permanent disability indemnity when reduced to a lump sum under section,subdivision b rivera further argues commutation of indemnity is based on need under section,and the purpose of section is to ensure prompt payment of indemnity.finally,he asserts that the wcab decision is inconsistent with moulton workers comp.appeals bd.th,d moulton.
moulton involved an award of accrued temporary disability indemnity,which was paid partially and late,and without payment under section.the court of appeal determined that the amount of temporary disability indemnity awarded was due within days under section.moulton,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal imposed only one penalty under section for the temporary disability indemnity paid.otherwise,the employer who made a partial payment would be penalized more than the employer who made no payment.moulton,at,d.the court of appeal further concluded that the failure to pay under section was a separate and distinct unreasonable delay under section from the late and partial indemnity payment.moulton,at,d.
tower responds that the plain language and numerous references to timing in section establish that the statute is limited to periodic indemnity payments.thus,the wcab interpretation,which is entitled to great weight,should be affirmed since it is not clearly erroneous tower also distinguishes moulton as involving true accrued periodic indemnity payments,rather than future periodic indemnity payments that are commuted into a lump sum.
