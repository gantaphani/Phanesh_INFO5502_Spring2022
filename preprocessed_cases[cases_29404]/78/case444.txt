introduction 
labor code section,subdivision a b provides that when a worker without dependents suffers fatal injury during the course and scope of employment,the employer must pay to the deceased worker estate as a worker compensation death benefit.in this writ proceeding,we hold that section,subdivision a b,is unconstitutional because the constitutional enabling provision,article xiv,section of the california constitution article xiv,section does not identify estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits 
the former version of article xiv,section,which established the workers compensation system as originally implemented in identified two classes of beneficiaries of workers compensation benefits workers and dependents.
in and,the legislature enacted legislation to include the state as a third beneficiary of workers compensation benefits.in both instances,the legislature intended to establish a state fund to benefit workers in general.in yosemite industrial acc.com.cal,yosemite and commercial cas.ins.indus.acc.com.cal,commercial cas,the california supreme court declared the statutes unconstitutional.the court held that the legislature may not expand the classes of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation benefits beyond the list of beneficiaries identified in the california constitution.
in,to remedy this defect,the voters approved a constitutional amendment to designate the state as a beneficiary of workers compensation benefits.thus,at present,the constitutional enabling xiv,section three classes of beneficiaries of workers compensation benefits workers,dependents,and the state.
in section,subdivision a b,the legislature added deceased workers estates as a fourth class of beneficiaries of workers compensation benefits.however,because article xiv,section,does not identify such estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits,section,subdivision a b,is unconstitutional pursuant to yosemite,supra,cal,and commercial,supra,cal.a constitutional amendment to article xiv,section,adding deceased workers estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation benefits,is necessary before the legislature is empowered to promulgate a statute awarding workers compensation death benefits to a deceased worker estate.
in addition,awarding workers compensation death benefits to an estate conflicts with the underlying policy of the workers compensation scheme,which is to provide financial support to a worker and a worker dependents when the worker suffers injury or death.
for these reasons,we find section,subdivision a b,is unconstitutional.we therefore annul the award to the estate of the deceased employee.
procedural and factual background 
bantita rackchamroon,an operator hostess for six flags,sustained industrial injury and death on april.rackchamroon died with no dependents.
on june,the administrator of the estate of bantita rackchamroon the estate filed an application for adjudication of a worker compensation death benefit claim.the administrator alleged that an amusement park ride struck rackchamroon,who suffered fatal injury in the course and scope of her employment.
in the workers compensation proceedings,six flags insurer,petitioner pacific employers insurance,administered by esis,pacific,asserted that section,subdivision a b,was unconstitutional.the workers compensation judge,however,awarded to the estate,payable by pacific.pursuant to section,the workers compensation judge also awarded to the department of industrial relations,death without dependents unit.
pacific filed a petition for reconsideration.the workers compensation judge issued a report recommending that the workers compensation appeals board the board deny the petition for reconsideration.the judge explained that workers compensation judges do not have authority to rule on the constitutionality of statutes because article iii,section of the california constitution prohibits an administrative agency from declaring a statute unconstitutional.see also greener workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.
subsequently,the board issued an order denying pacific petition for reconsideration.pacific filed a petition for writ of review to contest the award to the estate.
issue presented 
the issue presented is whether section,subdivision a b,is unconstitutional because article xiv,section does not include deceased workers estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits.
discussion 
section,subdivision a b,is unconstitutional.article xiv,section,does not include estates as a beneficiary of workers compensation death benefits 
the constitutional enabling provision establishing the workers compensation scheme has remained the same since with two exceptions a amendment adding the state of california as a beneficiary entitled to workers compensation benefits in some cases and a amendment making the provision gender neutral,changing workmen to workers.
article xiv,section,provides in pertinent part the legislature is hereby expressly vested with plenary power,unlimited by any provision of this constitution,to create,and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,by appropriate legislation,and in that behalf to create and enforce a liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability,and their dependents for death incurred or sustained by the said workers in the course of their employment,irrespective of the fault of any party.italics added.
thus,at present,article xiv,section,does not include estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits.
the supreme court declared two prior statutes unconstitutional where the statutes went beyond the language of the constitution 
as approved by the voters in,the predecessor to article xiv,section,identified two classes of beneficiaries of workers compensation benefits workers and dependents.the california supreme court has twice declared statutes unconstitutional when the legislature attempted to expand the class of beneficiaries of workers compensation benefits beyond the two classes identified in the constitution.see yosemite,supra,cal,commercial,supra,cal.
the first case,yosemite,invalidated a workers compensation statute,enacted in,which created the state as a third beneficiary of workers compensation death benefits.the statute required employers to pay to the state when a worker suffered fatal injury in the course and scope of employment and the worker left no dependents to whom a death benefit could be paid.the money was to be used for the vocational rehabilitation of workers in general.yosemite,supra,cal.at.
in,the yosemite court declared this statute unconstitutional.because the predecessor to article xiv,section,did not identify the state as a beneficiary of workers compensation benefits,the court held that the legislature did not have constitutional authority to impose upon employers an obligation to contribute funds to a state fund to benefit workers in general.yosemite,supra,cal.at.
the yosemite court analyzed the statements in the pamphlet distributed to the voters when the legislature placed the predecessor to article xiv,section,on the ballot.as to consideration of voter pamphlets,the yosemite court explained it is to be assumed that the arguments prepared by the author of the amendment state fairly and with reasonable fullness the meaning of the amendment and the effect it is expected to produce.yosemite,supra,cal.at.based upon review of the pamphlet,the court concluded that the authors of the predecessor to article xiv,section,did not intend to impose upon employers an obligation to contribute funds to the state for the benefit of disabled workers in general.yosemite,at.
the second case,commercial,invalidated another workers compensation statute,enacted in,which again declared the state to be a beneficiary of workers compensation death benefits.commercial,supra,cal.at.the statute required employers to pay into a subsequent injuries fund when an employee died in the course and scope of employment and left no dependents to whom a death benefit could be paid.id.at.
the commercial cas.court declared the statute unconstitutional.like the statute,the statute attempted to expand the class of beneficiaries of workers compensation benefits to include the state.as discussed above,however,the constitutional enabling provision,the predecessor to article xiv,section,did not identify the state as a beneficiary entitled to workers compensation death benefits.commercial,supra,cal.at.
after summarizing the yosemite case,the commercial cas.court explained we can see no escape from the logic of the yosemite decision.that case is identical in principle with the proceeding before us.in each case the liability sought to be imposed upon the employer is not one in favor of his employee nor the dependents of any deceased employee.in each case the jurisdiction to determine this liability is attempted to be conferred upon the industrial accident commission.we feel bound by this authority not only by reason of the rule of stare decisis,but on account of the manifest soundness of the decision.commercial,supra,cal.at,italics in original.
in,the people amended the constitution to include the state as a beneficiary of workers compensation death benefits 
the predecessor to article xiv,section,remained unchanged until,when the voters approved a constitutional amendment to resolve the issue presented in yosemite and commercial cas.the constitutional amendment expressly authorized the legislature to require employers to pay workers compensation death benefits to the state.the amendment provided the legislature shall have power to provide for the payment of an award to the state in the case of the death,arising out of and in the course of the employment,of an employee without dependents,and such awards may be used for the payment of extra compensation for subsequent injuries beyond the liability of a single employer for awards to employees of the employer.
passage of this constitutional amendment gave the legislature constitutional authority to designate the state as a beneficiary of workers compensation death benefits.in,the legislature promulgated a corresponding statute to allow workers compensation death benefits to be awarded to the state.section provides in pertinent part a whenever any fatal injury is suffered by an employee under circumstances that would entitle the employee to compensation benefits,but for his or her death,and the employee does not leave surviving any person entitled to a dependency death benefit,the employer shall pay a sum to the department of industrial relations equal to the total dependency death benefit that would be payable to a surviving spouse with no dependent minor children.
the constitutional amendment is significant.it shows that the legislature recognized that it lacked constitutional authority to promulgate legislation to award workers compensation death benefits to the state absent an amendment to the constitution identifying the state as a beneficiary of such benefits.therefore,the legislature asked the people to amend the california constitution to designate the state as a beneficiary of workers compensation benefits.the court in travelers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.d.travelers,recognized this,stating escheat to the state of california of workers compensation death benefits required a specific amendment of article xx,section,of the constitution now art.xiv,the constitutional provision authorizing the workers compensation act.travelers,at.
travelers also explained that the ballot pamphlet distributed to voters recognized that a constitutional amendment was necessary before the legislature could promulgate a statute awarding workers compensation death benefits to the state.travelers,supra,d at.the court quoted the voter pamphlet the official title and summary in the voters pamphlet states workmen compensation.legislative constitutional amendment.gives legislature power to provide for payment of workmen compensation award to state on death,arising out of and in course of employment,of employee without dependents.permits such awards to be used for extra subsequent injury compensation the general analysis by the legislative counsel states a yes vote on this legislative constitutional amendment is a vote to grant the legislature the power to provide for the payment to the state of workmen compensation awards on the death of employees injured in the course of their employment who have no dependents,and to permit such awards to be used to pay extra compensation for subsequent injuries,which is now paid from the general fund.travelers,at,italics in original.
in,the legislature amended section to include workers estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits 
in,the legislature amended section as part of a general amendment of the labor code.the legislature added subdivision a to section,which originally provided that an employee estate was to receive a death benefit of for a fatal injury occurring on or after january,when the worker had no total or partial dependents.in,the legislature renumbered this subdivision as section,subdivision a b,and made it effective for injuries occurring on or after january,
the legislature promulgated subdivision a b of section without presenting to the voters an amendment to article xiv,section,to provide constitutional authority for the legislature to expand the classes of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits to include a deceased employee estate.article xiv,section,however,identifies only three classes of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits workers,dependents,and the state.because article xiv,section,does not identify estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits pursuant to yosemite and commercial,we hold that the legislature was not empowered to promulgate section,subdivision a b,which is therefore unconstitutional.
the estate responds that section,subdivision a b,is constitutional based upon the legislature plenary powers to regulate workers compensation,relying upon the following language in article xiv,section the legislature is hereby expressly vested with plenary power,unlimited by any provision of this constitution,to create,and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,by appropriate legislation.italics added.the estate concludes that because article xiv,section,gives the legislature plenary power to create a complete system of workers compensation,the constitution empowered the legislature to add estates by statute as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits.
based upon yosemite and commercial,we reject this argument.in yosemite,the supreme court explained that use of the word plenary in article xx,section the predecessor to art.xiv,did not authorize an award of workers compensation benefits to the state.the court stated nothing is added to the force of the provision by the use of the word plenary.if the l egislature has power to do a certain thing,its power to do it is always plenary.yosemite,supra,cal.at.
the commercial cas.court also rejected this argument.the court stated that the language of article xx,section,could not be read in isolation but must be considered as a whole.examining the language of the article xx,section,as a whole,the commercial cas.court explained w e think that the intent of the framers thereof is clear and unambiguous,and that they intended by article xx,section,to limit the power of the l egislature in enacting a workmen compensation act to provide for the compensation by the employers of their own employees,and that any legislation which exceeds these limits is beyond the power of the l egislature,and,therefore,void.commercial,supra,cal.at.
in atlantic richfield workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,the supreme court reiterated the principle that the plenary power clause of article xiv,section,can not be used to expand the legislature power beyond the purposes set forth in the other sections of article xiv,section,that is,to compensate workers or their dependents if the worker dies in the course and scope of employment.the court stated thus,there is precedent in this area for the proposition that the legislature may not go beyond the precise terms of the constitutional enabling,perhaps,that it may use its plenary or police powers to promote the overall purposes of the workers compensation scheme.atlantic richfield,at,italics in original.
based upon yosemite and commercial,we conclude that the legislature in the exercise of its plenary powers to establish a complete system of workers compensation did not have authority to expand by statute the classes of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits beyond the three beneficiary classes,workers,dependents,and the state,identified in article xiv,section.
the drafters of article xx,section the predecessor to art.xiv,did not intend to include estates within the definition of dependents 
in mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,mathews,the supreme court reviewed the history of the workers compensation constitutional enabling provision and corresponding statutes to determine whether former section,subdivision g,violated the constitution.mathews,at.former section,subdivision g,denied death benefits when an injury resulted from an altercation in which the injured employee was the aggressor.mathews,at.
in mathews,an employee widow argued that former section,subdivision g,was unconstitutional because article xx,section the predecessor to art.xiv,gave the legislature the power to create a system of workers compensation to provide benefits irrespective of the fault of any party.the widow argued the word fault included intentional as well as negligent acts.mathews,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court explained that the constitutional provision at issue,article xx,section now art.xiv,was added to the constitution for the sole purpose of removing all doubts as to the constitutionality of the then existing workmen compensation statutes.mathews,supra,cal d at.the mathews court concluded that the constitutional provision could not be read as invalidating basic features of those laws as they had existed since.id.at.thus,to ascertain the meaning of the phrase irrespective of the fault of any party,the mathews court examined the workers compensation statutes the constitutional enabling provision,then numbered as article xx,section.
specifically,the court examined the roseberry act of stats,ch,the boynton act of stats,ch,and workmen compensation,insurance and safety act of stats,ch.mathews,supra,cal d at.based upon a review of these statutes,the mathews court found that the phrase irrespective of the fault of any party was intended only to give the legislature power to grant benefits unhampered by common law tort concepts of negligence.id.at,italics omitted.the phrase was not included in article xx,section,to prohibit the legislature from preventing an award of workers compensation benefits based upon intentional wrongdoing.mathews,at.
engaging in the same historical analysis as the mathews court,we conclude that the statutes and contemporaneous with the passage of article xx,section now art.xiv,did not define the term dependents to include a deceased employee estate.section,subdivision of the roseberry act of section,subdivision a of the boynton act of and section,subdivisions a,b and c of the workmen compensation,insurance and safety act of each contained a definition of the term dependents.none of the statutory definitions included an employee estate.in addition,the present definitions of dependent in sections to,quoted below,do not include an employee estate.
notably,in harlan industrial acc.com.cal,the supreme court addressed the issue of who was the dependent of a minor employee who died while employed by a farming company.the court affirmed the award made by the industrial accident commission.the commission concluded that a maternal aunt,who had brought the minor child into her home and raised him as her own son,was the dependent entitled to an award of workers compensation death benefits.the court rejected the contention that the person entitled to receive the workers compensation death benefits should be determined according to the rules of succession as affecting illegitimates as they existed at common law or as since modified by the statute of this state.id.at.quoting from a tennessee opinion,the california supreme court explained the workmen compensation act is not a statute of descent or distribution.it was intended to relieve society of the burden of caring for injured workmen or the dependents of deceased workmen,and to place that burden upon the industry employing the workman.in case of the workm a n death,the lawmakers were concerned for the care of his dependents,and not about the devolution of the workman property.the dependency of the claimant is the true basis of his right to recover compensation rather than blood or marriage.relationship is really only evidence of dependency.ibid.
in addition,because the intent of the voters is relevant to determining the meaning of constitutional language travelers,supra,d at,we look to the voters pamphlet distributed in in support of amending the workers compensation constitutional provision,article xx,section.the voters pamphlet,quoted in mathews,supra,cal d at page,in footnote,gives no indication that the drafters of the article xx,section now art.xiv,intended the word dependents to include a deceased worker estate.
finally,constitutional language must receive a liberal and practical common sense construction.citations.further,it should be construed in accordance with the natural and ordinary meaning of its words.travelers,supra,d at.applying these rules of construction,we conclude that the term dependents in article xiv,section,does not include a deceased worker estate.
under present law,estates are not dependents 
at present,sections through define dependents.generally,there are two types of dependents presumed dependents minors,incapacitated adults and spouses earning or less in the year prior to the employee death and those persons who must establish dependency based upon the facts existing at the time of death in addition,to qualify as a dependent,an individual must stand in a specified relationship to the deceased 
an estate is defined in probate code section estate means a trust estate,a decedent estate,a guardianship or conservatorship estate,or other property that is the subject of a donative transfer.in tanner best d,the court explained the estate of a decedent is not an entity known to the law.it is neither a natural nor an artificial person.it is merely a name to indicate the sum total of the assets and liabilities of a decedent,or of an incompetent,or of a bankrupt.id.at.
in addition,a plain reading of the statute at issue in this case supports the conclusion that the legislature knew that an estate is not a dependent.section,subdivision a b,only grants the estate,heirs or devisees a worker compensation death benefit in the case of no total dependents and no partial dependents.
therefore,by definition,pursuant to section,payment of a death benefit to an estate does not constitute payment of a death benefit to a dependent.this further supports the conclusion that as used in article xiv,section,the term dependents does not include a deceased employee estate.
the policy underlying the workers compensation scheme supports the conclusion that section,subdivision a b,is unconstitutional 
the goal of workers compensation is to compensate injured workers and those dependent upon them.article xiv,section,provides in pertinent part a complete system of workers compensation includes adequate provisions for the comfort,health and safety and general welfare of any and all workers and those dependent upon them for support to the extent of relieving from the consequences of any injury or death incurred or sustained by workers in the course of their employment.see also zenith insurance workers comp.appeals bd.d.death benefit to serve humanitarian purpose of relieving an employee dependents of the financial consequences of his or her death in the course of employment and hofmeister workers comp.appeals bd.d.
in contrast,a probate estate may,by will,pass the estate res
