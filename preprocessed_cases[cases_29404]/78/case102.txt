the louisiana insurance guaranty association liga appeals the district court judgment enforcing a twenty percent additional sum for late payment of an award to an injured worker.it argues that it should not be assessed the additional amount because it paid promptly after getting delayed notice of the award.we find no reversible error and affirm.
cesar carillo was injured in the course of his employment.his injuries were covered under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca.liga is a guaranty fund created by state law that pays statutorily permitted claims when a private insurer becomes insolvent,as occurred here.see.ann.liga settled carillo claim.the parties submitted the settlement to the office of workers compensation programs owcp,a division of the department of labor.the district director of the new orleans owcp approved the settlement on february.according to liga,it received no notice of the approved claim until march.the day after liga alleges it received notice,it paid the claim.
by that time,carillo already had filed a request with the district director for twenty percent additional compensation that becomes due when more than a delay occurs in payment of a compensation order.liga disputed that the payment was late.the district director submitted the dispute to an administrative law judge for hearing,which was held on august.on april,that judge entered an order requiring liga to pay the additional amount.on june,rehearing was denied and the matter was returned to the district director.on july,the district director issued a supplemental order of default enforcing the decision.
in its brief,liga asserts that it timely appealed the order to the department of labor benefits review board.there is some record evidence that an appeal was taken on july,but we are not aware of whether it was pursued,and if so,its disposition.
carillo filed for enforcement in district court on august.enforcement was ordered.liga appeals to this court.
discussion 
we are presented with two arguments.first is that filing a compensation order with the district director,which starts the time period for payment,must include receipt of the order by the parties.second,liga argues that a state statute exempts it from paying the twenty percent additional amount.we separately examine each issue.
meaning of filing of compensation order 
the lhwca has a detailed set of rules for the processing of claims by injured workers.the reason for today dispute is a provision stating that if compensation that has been ordered is not paid within ten days from when it is due,a twenty percent additional amount must be paid 
if any compensation,payable under the terms of an award,is not paid within ten days after it becomes due,there shall be added to such unpaid compensation an amount equal to per centum thereof,which shall be paid at the same time as,but in addition to,such compensation,unless review of the compensation order making such award is had as provided in section of this title and an order staying payment has been issued by the board or court.
f.the obvious question is when does compensation become due.both parties have agreed that the following provision,which makes a compensation order effective upon its filing with the owcp district director establishes the date that begins the period 
a compensation order shall become effective when filed in the office of the district director as provided in section of this title,and,unless proceedings for the suspension or setting aside of such order are instituted as provided in subsection b of this section,shall become final at the expiration of the thirtieth day thereafter.
there are still the loose ends of an order becoming effective in section a and its becoming due for purposes of section f.tying them together was done long ago when we determined that the terms are equivalent.tidelands marine serv.patterson,cir.
the doubt liga finds remaining despite the settled questions concerns just when the order that approved carillo claim was effectively filed with the district director.the relevant statutory section provides for receipt by the district director and a mailing to the claimant and employer 
the order rejecting the claim or making the award referred to in this chapter as a compensation order shall be filed in the office of the district director,and a copy thereof shall be sent by registered mail or by certified mail to the claimant and to the employer at the last known address of each.
e.liga argues that the entirety of these statutory duties must be satisfied before a filing has occurred.specifically,it argues that some form of service on the parties must occur before filing is complete.thus,the deadline for paying an approved claim would not begin until liga received notice.once it received notice,liga asserts that it paid immediately.
the district court rejected this argument when,on october,it denied liga federal rule of civil procedure b motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.the court found that mailing the compensation order to the parties was not part of the requirement of filing.on february,the district court granted summary judgment and ordered enforcement.the court stated that liga did not claim that it had filed an appeal to the benefits review board.the court in that statement was responding to liga argument that it should never have accepted carillo original claim.certainly,though,the initial settlement of the claim for compensation was no longer a live issue.the district court appears to have been holding that it does not have jurisdiction to hear such an appeal,meaning of the initial compensation order,not of the supplemental one.the court in its october order had considered the merits of the argument about how to compute the ten days,and thus liga principal merits argument had earlier been analyzed and rejected by the district court.
it is agreed that no appeal to the benefits review board was taken of the initial compensation order.as to the supplemental order,we have already noted that liga alleges that it did appeal.there is scant,but not totally absent,record evidence of that.the one document we found was a july,notice by a department of labor claims examiner that a conference was cancelled because the had on july appealed to the benefits review board.as we will discuss,this factual question is of no importance to our resolution of the issues before us.
in beginning our review,we categorize the order that assessed a penalty on april,which the district court enforced.such an order is labeled a supplemental order of default.see in re comp.under the lhwca abbott.ins.gty.ass n,cir.in abbott,the underlying compensation order was still the subject of an appeal to the benefits review board its validity was not before the court for review.id.at.once the internal labor department appeal of the underlying order was concluded,there would have been a right to judicial review.c.that stage had not yet been reached.while the administrative appeal of that order continued,a supplemental order of default was entered by an administrative law judge and enforced by the district court.our judge,charles clark,wrote that supplemental orders of default were part of a quick and inexpensive mechanism for the prompt enforcement of unpaid compensation awards,and no administrative appeal from those orders was permitted.id.at.
we had in an earlier case similarly held that suits for payment of compensation due under either f or any other substantive section of the lhwca are to be brought in the district court and,only subsequent thereto,by appeal to the appropriate court of appeals.tidelands,at.it is not proper to appeal final orders under section f to the benefits review board.id.a district court is the initial venue for review of the supplemental orders.
we acknowledge that because the underlying compensation order had already been paid,the need for prompt enforcement of what was only twenty percent of the compensation was not as acute as in abbott.yet this additional amount is part of the overall compensation.therefore,we find no basis to bar immediate enforcement of even this supplemental order.
