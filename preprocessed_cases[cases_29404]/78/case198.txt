katherine blickenstaff primarily appeals from the district court determination that donnelley sons.short term disability plan plan did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating her short term disability benefits and then refusing to reinstate them on appeal.she also claims that the district court erred in limiting the evidence at trial and appeals the district court decision to sanction her attorneys under federal rule of civil procedure.for the reasons we discuss below,we affirm the district court treatment of trial evidence and its decision on the merits,but vacate,in part,the sanctions award.
short term disability claim denial 
donnelley sons employed blickenstaff as a material handler.beginning october,blickenstaff was covered by the employee benefit plan at issue here,which provided benefits for short term disability.the short term disability portion of the plan was by donnelley,which served as the plan administrator.a subsidiary of hartford life accident insurance served as the claims evaluator,and,under the terms of the plan,ha d full discretion and authority to determine benefits payable and to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the plan in connection with this determination.
blickenstaff,under a prior benefits plan,received short term disability benefits from april,to june,because of lower back pain.she returned to work on june,with the following restrictions no lifting more than ten pounds and no prolonged standing more than two hours,bending,stooping,crawling,or climbing.donnelley accommodated her restrictions and ultimately considered them,and her accommodated job,to be permanent.
despite donnelley accommodation,blickenstaff alleges that she continued to experience pain while working.she stopped work in october of and again applied for short term disability benefits.under the plan,she was entitled to receive short term disability benefits for weeks if she met the definition of total disability throughout the benefits period 
total disability or totally disabled means that you are prevented by 
accidental bodily injury 
mental illness 
substance abuse or 
from performing the essential duties of your occupation,or a reasonable alternative offered to you by the employer,and as a result,you are earning less than of your predisability weekly earnings.emphasis added.
the plan initially approved the short term disability benefits,but terminated them in a letter dated march,nineteen weeks into the benefits period.it based its decision on new medical evidence,in the form of a functional capacity evaluation,which indicated blickenstaff could perform her job as accommodated by donnelley.blickenstaff utilized the plan internal appeals process.when it refused to reinstate her benefits,she sued in state court,alleging violations of the employee retirement income security act erisa,et the case was properly removed to federal district court.
after denying,in part,the plan motion for summary judgment,see blickenstaff donnelley sons.disability plan,wl,s,dist.lexis,judge barker held a bench trial on march.the sole issue presented was whether the plan march termination of benefits was arbitrary and capricious.the court had previously found,in its summary judgment ruling,that the plan did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in denying blickenstaff second internal appeal following the initial decision to terminate her benefits 
at trial,blickenstaff argued,based on one word contained in the march,letter terminating her benefits,that the plan utilized the wrong standard in evaluating her claim.the letter stated on page three that t he plan provides that hartford would pay benefits if you were prevented by disability from doing the essential duties of any occupation on a full time basis.emphasis added.blickenstaff rightly pointed out that the definition of disability appearing in the plan documents defines total disability for short term disability purposes as being prevented from performing the essential duties of your occupation,not any occupation as appeared in the letter.yet,the letter accurately quoted the definition of total disability on its first page,and goes on to state,in the sentences immediately following the one containing the phrase any occupation 
y ou are capable of performing the essential duties of your occupation as a material handler as defined by your employer on january.therefore,we find that the medical documentation in your file does not support your inability to perform your occupation and no short term disability benefits are available beyond march.emphasis added.
in its ruling,the district court did not directly address blickenstaff claim that the plan used the wrong disability definition.rather,it focused on blickenstaff other arguments that the plan used the wrong job description in evaluating her ability to perform her position the medical evidence did not support the conclusion that she could perform the job described in the incorrect job description and even if the plan used the correct job description in evaluating her claim,the medical records still failed to support the finding that she could return to work.
evidence presented at trial showed that,on november,blickenstaff supervisor filled out a physical demands analysis form that was allegedly supposed to describe the current physical demands of her job november job description.the plan requested the november job description as part of its process with regard to covering blickenstaff claim.the november job description stated that as part of her job as material handler,blickenstaff was required to lift pounds constantly with constantly defined as to of the workday pounds frequently with frequently defined as to of the workday,and pounds occasionally with occasionally defined as of the workday.the supervisor also recorded that only of blickenstaff job included sedentary work,meaning lifting ten pounds maximum,and the other of her job was light work,defined as lifting twenty pounds maximum.blickenstaff correctly pointed out that the november job description did not comply with her permanent restrictions and argued at trial that to the extent the plan believed the job as represented in the november job description was her job and the job to which she would return,it was wrong.
blickenstaff next argued that the functional capacity evaluation,an exam performed by independence rehabilitation on february,at the plan request and upon which the plan heavily relied in terminating her benefits february exam,showed she could not perform her job as outlined in the november job description.specifically,the february exam results showed she could only lift pounds constantly,pounds frequently,and pounds occasionally.the november job description,blickenstaff noted,stated that she needed to lift in excess of those amounts on a daily basis.
blickenstaff also argued that even if the plan utilized the correct job accommodated job description in which she never lifted over ten february exam still did support that she could return to work.here,she pointed to the fact that the february exam reported she could only lift pounds constantly,not ten.the february exam noted,however,that based on the test results,blickenstaff could work an day in a position.significantly,the february exam also stated that during the testing,blickenstaff exhibited exaggeration behavior and that certain results suggest ed very poor effort or voluntary submaximal effort which is not necessarily related to pain,impairment or disability.
judge barker did not find any of blickenstaff arguments persuasive.the judge first determined that the plan made its decision based on the accommodated job description,not the november job description.donnelley clarified,in a letter to hartford dated january,that as of june,blickenstaff worked in an accommodated job with the following restrictions refrain from standing more than hours,lifting greater than,bending,stooping,climbing.the march,letter terminating blickenstaff benefits specifically cited the january letter and described blickenstaff job demands in terms of the restrictions listed therein.
the judge also confirmed that the accommodated job was the appropriate one for the plan to use in its evaluation of blickenstaff claim because it was the position she held at the time she sought disability benefits.the judge observed that when blickenstaff first appealed the determination terminating her benefits,she attached the nurse note establishing her june restrictions and acknowledged that she was working within those restrictions at the time she sought short term disability benefits in october of.at no time during the internal appeals process did blickenstaff argue that the plan used the wrong job description or that she was working outside of the restrictions set down in june of and described in the january,letter.
having found that the plan made its determination based on blickenstaff accommodated job,the judge determined that the plan did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in terminating benefits.the judge noted that the plan forwarded the february most recent medical information available to blickenstaff treating physician,williams,and asked him whether he agreed with the results.williams responded that he agreed blickenstaff was capable of light work for eight hours a day.the judge,equating blickenstaff accommodated job to a position,noted that the physician affirmance of the february exam results could reasonably be read to state that he agreed blickenstaff could perform the accommodated job.hence,judge barker determined that the plan reasonably found that blickenstaff could perform her occupation and was thus ineligible for any further short term disability benefits.
the district court granted sanctions against blickenstaff counsel based on two alleged rule violations that took place during the course of the litigation.
second amended complaint 
blickenstaff originally filed her complaint in state court,alleging erisa violations against three entities the plan,donnelley,and hartford.after the case was removed to federal district court,donnelley and hartford separately moved to dismiss the complaint against them under federal rule of civil procedure b.the plan also moved to strike portions of the complaint under rule f.
on its face,the complaint asserted only a a b claim for benefits,which generally is limited to a suit against the plan,not an employer like donnelley or the claims evaluator,hartford.see neuma,amp,cir we have continually noted that erisa permits suits to recover benefits only against the plan as an entity.quoting jass prudential health care plan,cir.blickenstaff did not dispute that the a b claim applied only to the plan,but argued that the complaint could be read to assert a a breach of fiduciary duty claim against donnelley and hartford.
the district court rejected this argument,found that the complaint stated only a a b claim against the plan,and dismissed the complaint against donnelley and hartford with prejudice.importantly,the court stated in a footnote that there is no reason to allow blickenstaff to amend her complaint to sufficiently allege a a breach of fiduciary duty claim against either donnelley or hartford.the court also granted,in part,the plan rule f motion to strike certain language contained in the complaint and ordered blickenstaff to revise the complaint as outlined in the ruling.
the entry granting the motions to dismiss and granting in part and denying in part the motion to strike was dated january.on that same day,allegedly before she had seen the court ruling,blickenstaff mailed to the court a motion to amend her complaint,with a proposed first amended complaint attached.the first amended complaint specifically alleged a breach of fiduciary duty claims against donnelley and hartford,in addition to the a b claim against the plan.the motion to amend was deemed filed with the court on february.
after receiving the district court order dismissing the complaint against donnelley and hartford with prejudice and striking portions of the complaint,blickenstaff moved to file a second amended complaint.the second amended complaint purported to remove the offending language stricken by the court,but did not remove the a breach of fiduciary duty claims asserted against donnelley and hartford in the first amended complaint.the district court never ruled on the submission of the first amended complaint,but did allow blickenstaff to file the second amended complaint,specifically noting that it was not passing on its sufficiency in so doing.
all three defendants again moved under rule b to dismiss the second amended complaint as to donnelley and hartford.they argued that blickenstaff impermissibly pled a breach of fiduciary duty claims against donnelley and hartford after the district court had dismissed them from the lawsuit with prejudice and after the court instructed blickenstaff that she did not have leave to amend the complaint to assert such claims.blickenstaff did not respond to the motion to dismiss,instead addressing the merits of the breach of fiduciary duty claims in her response to the defendants summary judgment motion,filed after the motion to dismiss.
the district court,in conjunction with its ruling on the summary judgment motion,granted the rule b motion on res judicata grounds.it stated 
here,the second amended complaint plainly realleges claims against hartford and donnelley that we dismissed with prejudice in the previous order.plaintiff has not responded to defendants motion to dismiss and offers no explanation in the response to motion for summary judgment as to why these dismissed claims should be revived.
blickenstaff,s,wl,dist.lexis,at.
in granting the plan motion for sanctions based on the above series of events,the district court agreed that blickenstaff attorneys had violated rule by amending her complaint to state claims against parties previously dismissed with prejudice.the court ordered blickenstaff attorneys to pay the plan attorneys fees and costs incurred to fend off the prohibited a claims in the second amended complaint.
utschig affidavit 
the case management plan established by the district court ordered the parties to disclose expert witnesses by may.on july,after the deadline had passed,blickenstaff attached the affidavit of a purported expert,leroy utschig,to her response to the plan motion for summary judgment.the plan moved to strike it,and the magistrate judge agreed.
the magistrate judge based her decision on several grounds that blickenstaff did not comply with the case management plan deadline for expert disclosures and provided no reason or excuse for this failure that if a trial should be held in the case,it would be limited to the administrative record,of which utschig affidavit was not a part and that the affidavit and accompanying report were insufficient in numerous regards,including their failure to provide any specific information about utschig professional and educational background from which the court could determine his qualifications as an expert.after the magistrate judge struck the affidavit on october,blickenstaff made no further attempts to utilize it in support of her case.
the district court granted sanctions,again in the form of the plan attorneys fees and costs,because it found,incorrectly,that blickenstaff had relied on the affidavit in its summary judgment response after the affidavit had been stricken from the record.
ii.analysis 
evidence at trial 
blickenstaff first argument on appeal,that evidence at trial was improperly limited to the administrative record,is baseless.in ruling on the plan motion to strike utschig expert affidavit offered as part of the summary judgment briefing,the magistrate judge offered several reasons for doing of which was that the evidence at trial,should there be one,would be limited to the administrative record.blickenstaff points to that ruling as limiting the evidence she was allowed to present at trial.
yet,contrary to what the magistrate judge indicated,judge barker,who presided over the bench trial,denied both the plan motion to limit evidence at trial to the administrative record at and its motion in limine,presented the day of trial,requesting the same at tr.at.indeed,judge barker specifically allowed blickenstaff to attempt to enter the one piece of evidence she offered that was outside the administrative summary plan description dated after the date of her the plaintiff own testimony at trial.after judge barker denied the document admission she asked blickenstaff if there was any further evidence outside of the administrative record she wished to offer.tr.at.her attorney responded that he would rest on the administrative record id,and he offered no additional documents or testimony.because the evidence at trial was not limited to the administrative record as blickenstaff inexplicably claims,we can move swiftly to our examination of the district judge determination on the merits 
benefit termination decision 
because this case was tried to a judge,not a jury,our standard of review is established by federal rule of civil procedure a,which provides,f indings of fact,whether based on oral or documentary evidence,shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous see cerros steel,cir.review under the clearly erroneous standard is significantly deferential,requiring a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.concrete pipe prods.of,constr.laborers pension tr.for,d,quoted in am.fire ins.yellow freight systems,cir.
we review the district court legal determinations de novo,am.fire ins,at cerros,at,applying the arbitrary and capricious standard of review to the plan benefit eligibility decisions.we use the arbitrary and capricious standard because the plan language provided that hartford,the claims evaluator acting on behalf of the plan,had full discretion and authority to determine benefits payable and to construe and interpret all terms and provisions of the plan in connection with this determination,which would include eligibility requirements.see dabertin hcr manor care,cir.where an erisa plan gives the plan administrator discretion to interpret the plan terms or determine benefits eligibility,a reviewing court employs the arbitrary and capricious standard.the arbitrary and capricious standard requires us to give great deference to the plan decision,which can not be overturned unless it downright unreasonable.id.at 
blickenstaff first makes the untenable argument that the district court applied the wrong disability definition,evaluating her short term disability claim under a standard that requires her to be unable to perform any occupation as opposed to her occupation to receive benefits.blickenstaff bases this argument solely on the court factual summary section of its ruling,which states,in pertinent part blickenstaff applied for,and received,short term disability std benefits.in february,she applied for long term disability ltd benefits.the plan denied her the requested benefits in a letter of march.blickenstaff reads the last sentence,when it refers to the requested benefits to mean long term disability benefits,and from there theorizes that the court fundamentally misunderstood the nature of the extensively litigated case before it to be about the denial of long term disability benefits under an any occupation standard as opposed to a short term disability benefits case under a your occupation standard.
the body of the court opinion,however,belies such a conclusion it is evident from the face of the ruling that the court applied the proper your occupation standard.although it never recites the short term disability definition,which looks for the employee inability to perform the essential duties of his or her specific occupation,the court concentrated on what job description the plan used in reaching its determination and evaluated whether blickenstaff accommodated job fell within her medical limitations as outlined by her healthcare providers.in doing so,the court obviously applied the your occupation standard and not the broader any occupation standard.
blickenstaff other arguments track those made to the district court at the plan utilized the wrong job description in making its decision and even if it did,the medical information shows that she could not perform her accommodated position.neither has merit.
the district court did not make a factual error in determining that the plan compared blickenstaff medical information with the accommodated job description and not the november job description.as noted by the district court,the letter terminating blickenstaff benefits specifically described her job as the accommodated position,not the november job description position.and,blickenstaff acknowledged in her internal appeal that the last job she performed at donnelley was the accommodated position,not the one described by the november job description.even though the march,termination letter references the november job description as part of blickenstaff file and internal notes reveal some confusion over which job november job description or the accommodated job,we agree with the district court that the march,letter exhibits a clear understanding of blickenstaff position as the accommodated one.
the district court also came to the proper legal conclusion that the plan had a reasonable basis for terminating blickenstaff benefits because the medical evidence indicated she could perform her accommodated position.comparing the results of the february exam,which stated blickenstaff could perform light work eight hours a day,lifting up to seven pounds constantly and up to fifteen pounds frequently,to her accommodated position,which prohibited lifting over ten pounds and other strenuous movement,the plan reasonably concluded that blickenstaff was capable of performing her job.
blickenstaff counters that because the february exam indicated she could only lift up to seven pounds constantly,she was incapable of performing the accommodated position,which maintained a lifting restriction.yet,there no evidence in the record that blickenstaff actually lifted ten pounds constantly during the workday,rather than the seven of which she was capable according to the february exam.and,blickenstaff wholly ignores that the plan decision was further supported by record evidence showing that her treating physician agreed that she could perform light work for eight hours a day and that he agreed with the results of the february exam.notably,the february exam indicates that blickenstaff did not put forth her best effort during testing,leading to a reasonable inference that she could perform even more work than that expressed by the february exam.leipzig aig life ins,cir noting that insurers must consider the possibility that applicants are exaggerating in an effort to win benefits or are sincere hypochondriacs not at serious medical risk.the record here leads firmly to the conclusion that the plan acted reasonably,and the judge did not commit reversible error in so finding.
appeal denial 
blickenstaff also makes an underdeveloped argument that the district court erred in finding,on summary judgment,that the plan acted reasonably in denying her second internal appeal contesting the termination decision.blickenstaff submitted two appeals.although she does not challenge the plan determination as to the first appeal,we recount it briefly to provide context for the second appeal.
blickenstaff first appeal consisted of a letter claiming she had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia,which she said would be confirmed by an examination of her medical records.the only evidence submitted with the letter was a copy of her june,note outlining her restrictions,which,as stated earlier,blickenstaff represented were in effect at the time she stopped working in october of.
in response to the letter,the plan spoke with blickenstaff physician,williams,about the fibromyalgia diagnosis.williams stated that he was unsure whether blickenstaff had fibromyalgia,noting that when he initially started treating her she just complained of chronic back pain.more recently,he observed,blickenstaff complained of all the textbook symptoms of fibromyalgia,but he could determine whether they were real or if she had just done a lot of research on the disease.he reiterated that he continued to agree with the results of the february exam and that he had no objective evidence for the plan in support of her fibromyalgia claim.t
