defendants boccardo law firm boccardo and one of its partners,john stein,bring this appeal from an order denying their motion under the law code civ,to strike three causes of action asserted against them by plaintiff old republic construction program group old republic.the question presented is whether the statute applies to claims alleging that defendants wrongfully withdrew settlement funds derived from a lawsuit,which they had deposited in their trust account pursuant to a stipulation requiring old republic consent to any withdrawal.in answering this question we apply two principles that have perhaps not been as clearly articulated in the case law as they should be in determining whether a cause of action arises from conduct protected by the law,the focus is on the wrongful,injurious acts or omissions identified in the complaint,and whether those acts or omissions come within the statute description of protected conduct and unless the wrongful conduct is communicative in character,it is protected by the statute only if it was undertaken in connection with an issue of public importance.because the withdrawal of funds underlying the causes of action at issue was neither communicative nor related to an issue of public interest,the trial court properly denied a motion to dismiss those causes of action.we will therefore affirm the order.
background 
a.the carabello action 
defendants boccardo and stein filed an action for damages in san joaquin superior court on behalf of albert carabello,alleging that he had been injured when his pickup collided with a vehicle operated by beverly casby,the defendant in that action casby was insured under a policy of automobile insurance with liability coverage of.
it is apparently undisputed that at the time of the collision,carabello was acting in the course and scope of his employment.plaintiff old republic was the workers compensation insurer for carabello employer.it provided benefits which it claims exceeded.it filed a complaint in intervention in the san joaquin action,asserting a right to reimbursement of these expenditures.
in answer to both carabello and old republic complaints,casby raised the affirmative defense of witt jackson cal d,which limits the ability of an employer,or its insurer,to obtain reimbursement out of an injured worker recovery against a third party where the employer own negligence contributed to the worker injuries.see witkin,summary of cal.law ed.workers compensation,levels growers ammonia supply d.
carabello and casby agreed to settle the case for her policy limits.old republic claim to reimbursement,however,remained unresolved.accordingly,casby insurer made the settlement check payable to carabello,boccardo,and old republic.stein and counsel for old republic therefore signed a written stipulation stating that the settlement money will be deposited into an interest bearing account and that s ignatures of both parties will be required to withdraw any money.it was apparently understood that the funds would be placed in defendants client trust account.the settlement check was duly endorsed and deposited.
on december,the same day he signed the stipulation counsel for old republic filed a motion for apportionment of settlement proceeds,to be heard on january.the motion asserted an entitlement to the entire settlement fund,but did not mention the issue of employer negligence.stein later asserted that he objected to the motion at a december case management conference,arguing that it was not well taken because,as part of the settlement agreement,we had agreed to litigate against the intervener and fully assert witt jackson cal d,as a defense to their lien.according to him,the court set august,for a t rial of that matter,to be preceded by a mandatory settlement conference on july.
after the december conference,old republic withdrew its motion for apportionment.about a month later,on january,counsel for old republic filed a notice of lien seeking to recover against any settlement of sic judgment in this action.at the same time,counsel filed a request to dismiss old republic complaint in intervention with prejudice.the record contains no explanation for this action.nor does it show that old republic notified boccardo or stein of the dismissal.about three weeks later,stein dismissed the carabello complaint with prejudice.the request recited that it was made a s to defendants beverly casby and gerald casby only and that plaintiff and intervenor have trial august,to resolve liens.however,the dismissal of the complaint meant that there was no longer any pleading before the court seeking affirmative relief.
the trial court apparently conducted a settlement conference on july.stein later asserted that it was during this conference,or shortly before it,that he became aware of old republic dismissal of the complaint in intervention.upon learning of it,he sought a hearing on shortened time for a motion authorizing release of the settlement funds to carabello.he argued that by dismissing its pleading,old republic had forfeited any right to litigate the issue of employer negligence,and thus to recover on its lien.the trial court,however,concluded that the dismissal of all affirmative pleadings had deprived it of any power to grant the requested relief.in a formal order the court wrote,this case has been dismissed in its entirety.this court has no further jurisdiction.it does not appear that either party sought relief from this order.
on july,stein wrote to counsel for old republic indicating that he intended to distribute the deposited funds he again asserted that by dismissing its complaint old republic had given up the right to seek reimbursement.he took issue with a prior assertion by opposing counsel that the matter can be litigated before the wcab workers compensation appeals board.he offered to forbear from withdrawal for one week to give you time to go to the wcab and get a restraining order prohibiting me from disbursing my settlement.old republic apparently did nothing.on july,stein wrote that having just received the court formal order disclaiming the power to grant relief,he was disbursing the funds to his client forthwith.
b.the workers compensation board petition 
on september,old republic petitioned the wcab to order disbursement of the settlement proceeds.stein filed a trial brief in which he conceded that the wcab had jurisdiction to determine old republic entitlement to credit against future benefits.he argued,however,that the superior court had exclusive jurisdiction to determine the witt jackson issues as they might affect the existing settlement proceeds,and that old republic had lost the opportunity to secure an adjudication of that issue by dismissing its complaint in intervention.
on february,a workers compensation judge denied old republic petition for disbursement.he found that the settlement funds had already been disbursed by applicant counsel.he also concluded that the wcab lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief sought by old republic.on april,the wcab granted reconsideration of that decision to further study the factual and legal issues in this case.the wcab apparently issued a decision on september,finding that it had jurisdiction over the issues presented,and remanding them for trial 
c.the present action 
old republic filed the complaint in this matter on june.although it names only boccardo and stein as defendants,it alleges that the stipulation of december,was a binding contract between plaintiff,albert carrabello sic,and the boccardo law firm.the first cause of action alleges that defendants,boccardo and stein breached this contract by disbursing the settlement proceeds without the signature consent of old republic.the second cause of action charges defendants with fraudulently inducing old republic to assent to the placement of funds in boccardo trust account by falsely promising not to distribute funds until both parties agreed in sic the distribution amount.the third cause of action characterizes defendants distribution of the funds as conversion.the fourth posits that defendants withdrawal of funds breached a fiduciary duty to old republic.the fifth alleges that defendants breached a duty of care to old republic by negligently and carelessly distribut ing the funds without old republic consent.the sixth cause of action seeks declaratory relief,in that old republic conten d s it is entitled to some or all of the settlement proceeds and defendants contend that plaintiff is not entitled to any and has sic in fact distributed the settlement proceeds.
on august,defendants demurred to all causes of action.the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend as to the third cause of action conversion and fourth cause of action breach of fiduciary duty on grounds of failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.the demurrer was otherwise overruled.old republic did not amend the complaint.
on november,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the remaining causes of action under the law.they prayed in the alternative to stay the matter pending disposition of the wcab proceeding.the court granted the motion to strike as to the second cause of action fraud,but denied it with respect the first contract,fifth negligence,and sixth declaratory relief causes of action.the court denied the motion to stay proceedings.defendants promptly filed a notice of appeal 
discussion 
procedural framework 
the law authorizes a defendant to bring a special motion to strike any cause of action arising from any act of the defendant in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue,subd.b.the statute goes on to enumerate four classes of conduct,described in greater detail below,that come within its protection.id.subd.e.any cause of action arising from protected conduct shall be stricken on the defendant motion,unless the plaintiff establishes a probability that he or she will prevail on the claim.id.subd.b.
the statute thus mandates a analysis.the first step is to determine whether the moving party has shown that the targeted cause of action arises from conduct protected by the statute.martinez metabolife international,th,d.if the answer is yes,the court considers whether the plaintiff has established the requisite probability of success.ibid.as to both questions,a reviewing court applies its independent judgment,without deference to the trial court ruling.cabral martins th,d.of course,there is no occasion to consider the likelihood of success unless the action arises from protected activity.
ii.for purposes of the anti slapp statute,the challenged causes of action arose from defendants withdrawal of funds,not from the parties stipulation 
we are concerned on this appeal with only three of old republic six original causes of action breach of contract,negligence,and declaratory relief.the question whether these causes of action arise from protected activity involves two subsidiary inquiries from what acts or omissions do these causes of action arise,for purposes of applying this statute and do those acts or omissions come within the statute definition of protected conduct with respect to the first question,defendants assert at one point in their brief that the targeted causes of action all aris e from the stipulation which resulted in the deposit of settlement funds in defendants trust account.if true this would bring these causes of action within the statute protection,because the stipulation was a writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body,subd.e.the function of the stipulation was to hold the settlement funds in stasis pending an adjudication of old republic right to reimbursement an issue that then was,as the court below noted,still under consideration by the san joaquin county superior court.in this regard the case appears materially identical to navellier sletten cal th,d,where the court stated that the defendant negotiation and execution of a release involved statement s or writing s made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a judicial body as protected under section,subdivision e.we see no reason to doubt that this same conclusion applies here.
however,this only establishes that any cause of action arising from the stipulation would be protected by the statute.it leaves unanswered the question whether the three causes of action before us arose from the stipulation,subd.b.the question whether a cause of action arises from specified conduct for purposes of the statute depends on the principal thrust or gravamen of the plaintiff cause of action.robles chalilpoyil th,d,quoting martinez metabolife international,supra,th,d see ramona unified school dist.tsiknas th,d in re episcopal church cases cal th,d,wang wal mart real estate business trust th,d applicability of statute depends on principal thrust or predominant nature of the complaint.it is not enough that the complaint refers to protected activity.w hen the allegations referring to arguably protected activity are only incidental to a cause of action based essentially on nonprotected activity,collateral allusions to protected activity should not subject the cause of action to the statute.robles chalilpoyil,supra,th at,d.
the concepts of principal thrust and gravamen,however,may be too indefinite and abstract to provide a clear rule with predictable results.see hydro mill,hayward,tilton and rolapp ins.associates,th,d test for determining applicable limitations period variously stated as the gravamen of the cause of action,t he nature of the right sued upon,and the primary interest invaded by defendant wrongful conduct vafi mccloskey th,d equating gravamen with principal purpose of the action cheong yu yee cheung th,d same black law dict.ed,defining gravamen as t he substantial point or essence of a claim,grievance,or complaint oxford english dict.ed.t he particular part of an accusation that bears most heavily on the person accused witkin,cal.procedure ed.actions,in limitations context,where contract may sound in both contract and tort,courts sometimes arbitrarily assign a gravamen to the suit,subjecting it to the shorter tort statute.
fortunately the cases suggest a more concrete test a cause of action arises from protected conduct if the wrongful,injurious act s alleged by the plaintiff constitute protected conduct.see coretronic cozen th,d determining the gravamen of the claims requires examination of the specific acts of alleged wrongdoing and not just the form of the plaintiff causes of action.ibid.court reviews record to determine what conduct is actually being challenged martinez metabolife international,supra,th,d protected speech,though mentioned in complaint,was not gravamen of claims it was largely unrelated to and entirely distinct from the wrongful,conduct on which claims rested id.at,d wrongful and conduct alleged by plaintiff was distinct from any engagement by defendant in expressive conduct id.at,d alleged wrongful injury producing conduct was manufacture and sale of defective product,not labeling and advertising of product scott metabolife,th,d although warranty and fraud causes of action would require proof of some speech,they did not arise out of protected activities the wrongful conduct on which these claims are based arises from the nature of the defective product gallimore state farm fire casualty ins.th,d slapp motion would not lie merely because charges of unlawful claims practices relied on insurer submissions to public agency insurer invocation of statute confuse d its allegedly wrongful acts with the evidence that plaintiff will need to prove such misconduct ibid.we thus conclude that the alleged wrongful acts of state farm were not done in furtherance of any claimed right of petition or free speech.city of cotati cashman cal th,d,some italics added for cause of action to aris e from protected activity,the defendant act underlying the plaintiff cause of action must itself have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free speech.citation.in the context,the critical point is whether the plaintiff cause of action was based on an act in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech.citations.navellier sletten,supra,cal th,d,second italics added statute definitional focus is not the form of the plaintiff cause of action but,rather,the defendant activity that gives rise to his or her asserted liability and whether that activity constitutes protected speech or petitioning.
we think the foregoing judicial authorities,and the statute itself,are best understood to mean that a cause of action can only be said to arise from protected conduct if it alleges at least one wrongful act conduct allegedly breaching a duty and thereby injuring the plaintiff that falls within the act definition of protected conduct.
the causes of action at issue here refer to,and may depend on,defendants having entered into the stipulation,which was itself protected conduct but they do not assert that there was anything wrongful about that conduct.in this regard the three causes of action now before us differ from the fraud cause of action,as to which the trial court granted the slapp motion.as the court recognized,that cause of action ar o s e from the stipulation.the underlying wrongful conduct was defendants alleged entry into the stipulation without the intention to be bound by it,thereby inducing old republic to do likewise and depriving it of control over the settlement funds.with respect to the remaining three claims,however,there was nothing wrongful about the stipulation itself entry into it is not the injurious conduct alleged.rather,under those three causes of action old republic injury arose from defendants withdrawal of the funds that were the subject matter of the stipulation.that is the conduct by which defendants allegedly breached the contract between the parties,violated a duty of care,and injured old republic.it is that conduct from which these causes of action must be held to arise.for purposes of the slapp statute,the stipulation must be viewed as incidental.navellier sletten,supra,cal th,d,recognizing distinction between formation and breach of settlement agreement,but holding that under facts there,both were protected conduct.
to hold otherwise would produce consequences the legislature can not have intended.if the protected status of an underlying agreement furnished sufficient ground to invoke the statute against a claim for breach of that agreement,it would follow that every suit to enforce a settlement agreement would be subject at the threshold to a slapp motion.such a regime would significantly diminish the utility of such agreements,reduce the incentive for parties to enter into them,and thereby magnify the workload on courts,with attendant delay and expense for those who must resort to them.it follows that merely citing a settlement agreement as the basis for a duty allegedly breached by the defendant is not enough,by itself,to bring a cause of action for the breach within the statute.the trial court correctly concluded that these three causes of action did not arise from the parties stipulation for purposes of the slapp act.it was the withdrawal of funds that was the wrongful conduct constituting the gravamen of these causes of action.
iii.the withdrawal of funds was not protected conduct because it was neither communicative nor connected with an issue of public interest 
given the foregoing conclusion,the question becomes whether the withdrawal of funds was itself protected by the statute.as noted above,section,subdivision b,describes the activity protected under the statute as any act of the defendant in furtherance of the defendant right of petition or free speech in connection with a public issue.italics added.section,subdivision e e,identifies four classes of activities that will be deemed to fall within this description any written or oral statement or writing made before a legislative,executive,or judicial proceeding,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,any written or oral statement or writing made in connection with an issue under consideration or review by a legislative,executive,or judicial body,or any other official proceeding authorized by law,any written or oral statement or writing made in a place open to the public or a public forum in connection with an issue of public interest,or any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.italics added.
defendants do not contend that the withdrawal of funds was a written or oral statement so as to fall within any of the first three numbered clauses of section e.nor do they contend that the withdrawal of funds was connected with a public issue so as to satisfy the concluding proviso of the fourth clause,subd.e e or clause.they contend,however,that the public issue proviso applies only to conduct involving the exercise of speech rights,and does not limit the statute application to conduct furthering the exercise of the right of petition.since the withdrawal of funds was done in furtherance of their client right of petition,to secure redress for a civil wrong they contend that it was protected by the statute,even though it had no connection with any issue of pubic moment 
defendants contend that clause is burdened with an ambiguity in that the final portion beginning with the words in connection with could either modify both constitutional rights or else modify only the second right of free speech.as they parse the clause,it affords slapp protection to any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.but this deconstruction of the clause can not withstand scrutiny.grammatically,clause is,in its entirety,an object of the verb includes.it is operated upon by the introductory phrase,as used in this section,act in furtherance of a person right or petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue includes,italics added.defendants parsing would thus produce the sentence,a ct includes the constitutional right of free speech e.this of course is nonsensical.the correct object of includes is conduct.that word in turn is modified by the two succeeding prepositional phrases,joined by an implied conjunction,such that a correct parsing of the statute yields the following a ct includes any other conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech and in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.e.
this reading is reinforced by the fact that both prepositional phrases describe the manner on which some action is taken.as a matter of grammar they can not be characterized as true adverbial phrases,because there is no verb for them to modify.but the noun conduct distinctly refers to action,and can be modified quite intelligibly by these two phrases that is,one can properly characterize conduct as undertaken in furtherance of the exercise of a right,and in connection with a public issue.under defendants reading,in contrast,the phrase in connection with a public issue would modify right of free speech,which describes a pure phenomenon a thing that can not sensibly be modified with what is in substance if not in strict grammatical form an adverbial phrase.it would therefore be infelicitous,at best,to speak of a right in connection with a public issue.the rights to speak and petition exist independently of any public issue with which they may or may not be connected in a given instance.the presence or absence of such an issue is a circumstance that may trigger,enlarge,or condition the right,or more precisely its exercise,but it can not properly be conceived as a characteristic of the right itself.if one speaks of a trip in the car on the highway in connection with grandmother birthday,there are three antecedent nouns to which the concluding phrase in connection with grandmother birthday might conceivably refer,but only one to which it can sensibly refer trip,which happens to be the farthest one away from the phrase.similarly,in connection with a public issue refers most sensibly to conduct,and least sensibly to right of free speech.
the foregoing analysis disposes of defendants invocation of the last antecedent rule,which declares that qualifying words and phrases and clauses are to be applied to the words or phrases immediately preceding and are not to be construed as extending to or including others more remote.white county of sacramento cal d,quoted in briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,d,briggs.the operation of that rule depends on the presence of multiple antecedents,and as already indicated the phrase at issue here is most reasonably parsed as having only one antecedent,conduct.
the strained character of defendants proposed reading of the statute is reflected in the fact that a number of decisions have addressed the limitation in section e,and none has even appeared to so much as notice a possibility that the limitation might be understood to apply only to activity,and not to petitioning activity.in briggs,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court read the limitation as applicable to all noncommunicative conduct.the plaintiffs there argued that by virtue of the introductory language of the statute,it did not apply to any kind of speech or petitioning activity unless it involved an issue of public significance.in rejecting this contention as to the first two categories of activity enumerated in section e,the court emphasized that those clauses lacked any reference to public issues whereas c lauses and,concerning statements made in public fora and other conduct implicating speech or petition rights,include an express issue of public interest limitation.briggs,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.the inclusion of this language in the last two clauses,and its omission from the first two,required the conclusion that the legislature intended different issue requirements to apply to motions brought under clauses and of subdivision e than to motions brought under clauses and.citation.ibid.italics added.were the plaintiffs proposed reading correct,the court continued,no purpose would be served by the legislature specification in clauses and that covered issues must be of public interest.id.at,d,italics added.
defendants acknowledge that the supreme court gloss on these provisions contradicts their proposed reading of the statute,but they invoke the rule that language contained in a judicial opinion is to be understood in the light of the facts and issue then before the court,and an opinion is not authority for a proposition not therein considered.people banks cal th,d.we ourselves have often acknowledged that principle.see,in re th,d.however when a court has treated statutory language as having one meaning,it is at least some evidence that a different meaning is not obvious.that inference becomes weightier as more courts address the same language and come away with the same impression of its meaning and breadth,without acknowledging a competing interpretation urged only later.
we ourselves have twice issued published decisions that are irreconcilable with defendants proposed reading not only in dicta,but in their results.in prediwave simpson thacher bartlett llp th,d,we considered the application of the law to claims arising from the conduct of a law firm in prior litigation,including noncommunicative activities such as stonewalling discovery id.at,d and representation of parties with an irreconcilable conflict of interest id.at,d.we rejected the contention that the statute did not requir e a public interest connection with respect to such claims o nly one of the four categories of protected activity covers noncommunicative conduct,subd.e and that type of protected activity must have taken place in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest.see briggs eden council for hope opportunity,supra,cal th at,d.id.at,d.we noted the absence of any showing that any of defendants allegedly wrongful conduct,not consisting of statements or writings,occurred in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.id.at,d.we concluded that the charged conduct fell outside the statute protection.
we reaffirmed that view the following year in robles chalilpoyil,supra,th,footnote,d,where we addressed a claim arising from conduct by an expert witness in a wrongful death action.among the instances of allegedly wrongful conduct was the expert failing to continue to act as an independent expert disrupting the prosecution of the previous case by entering into a business relationship impairing his utility as an expert.id.at,d.this conduct,we observed,was not a written or oral statement,nor was it conduct in connection with a public issue or an issue of public interest,subd.e.id.at,d.accordingly it was not within the statute protection.ibid.
other courts have likewise noted the public interest requirement without suggesting that it might apply only to conduct,as distinct from petitioning conduct.see blackburn brady th,d only if the defendant alleged acts or statements fall under the third or fourth categories of subdivision e of section,is the defendant required to independently demonstrate that the matter is a public issue within the statute meaning garretson post th,d if the alleged protected activity occurs in the context of a public or official proceeding,as stated above in or,there is no additional requirement that it be connected with an issue of public importance.martinez metabolife international,supra,th,d,italics added a defendant in an ordinary private dispute can not take advantage of the statute simply because the complaint contains some references to speech or petitioning activity by the defendant.
while none of these cases is binding authority on the question before us,their complete failure to even perceive the ambiguity asserted by defendants is a strong indication that defendants proposed interpretation is neither natural nor sound.
defendants contend,however,that whatever the supreme court might have said in dicta,its reasoning in briggs actually supports their position.they first allude to the doctrine of the last antecedent,which the court invoked there briggs,supra,cal th at,d,but which we have already found inapplicable here.they then invoke the principle that if the legislature uses different words or phrases where it might have used the same one,it will be supposed to have intended them to have different meanings.see id.at,d.they contend that this principle applies here because the statute elsewhere refers to the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition,subd.a,and to a person right of petition or free speech id.subd.b,which defendants contrast with section e reference to the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech.we can make nothing of this contrast,any more than we can make something of the statute initial reference to the right of petition for the redress of grievances,after which the quoted phrase does not appear again.defendants allude to other principles of statutory construction,but we find none of them persuasive.
defendants assert that o ne of the most compelling reasons for adopting their proposed reading of the statute is the existence of fundamental and crucial differences between speech and petition rights.as we understand the supporting discussion,the essential difference asserted by defendants is that all petitioning activity implicates the public interest to some degree because it is by its nature addressed or directed to some official or body,whereas a considerable proportion of activity is entirely private.this may be true in some sense,but it provides no reason to conclude that,allegedly wrongful conduct related to an entirely private dispute should acquire greater protection merely because the dispute has given rise to a lawsuit.suppose that one homeowner asserts,and a second homeowner denies,that the second owner tree encroaches on the first owner property.if the first owner trespasses upon the other land in order to post a written protest of the encroachment,the trespass constitutes conduct related to an exercise of speech rights,but the law can not be invoked in a resulting trespass suit because the conduct is noncommunicative,and unconnected with any
