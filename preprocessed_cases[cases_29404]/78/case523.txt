plaintiff canton poultry deli,canton poultry,and two of its officers,shiu lit kwan and cho wah kwan collectively with canton poultry,plaintiffs,appeal from an order of dismissal entered after a demurrer was sustained to their complaint without leave to amend.the dismissal was entered in favor of attorneys daniel ysabal and mark huang and the law firm that employs them,stockwell,harris,widom woolverton ysabal,huang,and collectively with the law firm defendant,stockwell.
this case has its beginnings in a workers compensation claim filed by plaintiffs employee,andrew duran.stockwell was retained by canton poultry workers compensation carrier,california indemnity insurance company california indemnity,to handle the claim 
according to the allegations in plaintiffs complaint,andrew duran duran also filed a civil suit against plaintiffs and was interested in a global settlement of his two actions.the complaint alleges that stockwell knew of the civil suit and duran desire for such a settlement,but failed to inform plaintiffs of these matters and thus no global settlement was ever reached.according to the complaint,the upshot was that plaintiffs were damaged when they had to expend more money on defending and settling the civil suit than they would have expended to simply settle it in conjunction with the workers compensation case.
the question presented by plaintiffs appeal is what duties,if any,did stockwell owe to canton poultry in conjunction with the information it had about duran civil suit and his desire for a global settlement stated another way,can stockwell be the legal cause of the alleged difference between what it would have cost plaintiffs to settle duran civil suit when his compensation claim was settled,and what it actually cost plaintiffs to defend and settle his civil suit 
the answer to the questions presented to us is found in labor code section,which operated to dismiss canton poultry from the workers compensation case when california indemnity assumed its liability.we hold that when canton poultry was dismissed from the workers compensation case by operation of law,whatever duties stockwell had to canton poultry ended at that point in time,absent facts to conclude otherwise here,no such extenuating facts were alleged in plaintiffs complaint.
background of the case 
allegations in the complaint 
plaintiffs alleged causes of action against stockwell for negligence,breach of fiduciary duty,and unfair trade practices.their complaint contains the following allegations against stockwell.
while duran workers compensation case was pending,defendants ysabal and huang learned that duran intended to file,or had already filed,a personal injury action against plaintiffs ysabal and huang were advised by duran attorney that duran was interested in negotiating a global settlement of the two cases.however,ysabal and huang told duran attorney that a personal injury action by duran against plaintiffs was none of their ysabal and huang concern.thereafter,neither stockwell nor california indemnity advised plaintiffs that california indemnity was negotiating to settle the compensation case,nor did they advise plaintiffs that duran was interested in a global settlement.
in july,duran would have settled his civil suit for if there had been a global settlement.on february,plaintiffs paid duran to settle that suit,a sum less than plaintiffs anticipated trial costs.plaintiffs also expended more than on costs and attorney fees in defending the suit.additionally,defending the civil suit required the kwan plaintiffs to spend time on the civil suit and deprived plaintiff canton poultry of their services.thus,canton poultry suffered damages in excess of because no global settlement was made.moreover,in july,plaintiffs defense of the civil suit was being covered by another insurance carrier,and such carrier would have contributed to a global settlement of the compensation case.
on february,duran attorney,andrew schwartz,confirmed for the record that when he represented duran in the compensation case,he advised ysabal and huang that duran intended to pursue a civil personal injury against plaintiffs,and that duran was interested in a global settlement.it was also on february,that duran and schwartz confirmed for the record that in july,duran would have agreed to a global settlement for an additional.but for these statements by duran and schwartz,plaintiffs would not have possessed sufficient evidence to justify filing the instant suit for breach of stockwell and california indemnity respective obligations to disclose material information to plaintiffs.
it was not until january,that stockwell asserted to plaintiffs that plaintiffs were not its client in the compensation case,but rather it represented only california indemnity.neither stockwell,nor california indemnity,had ever before advised plaintiffs that stockwell represented california indemnity rather than plaintiffs in the compensation case,nor that a conflict of interest might exist in stockwell service in the compensation case.plaintiffs were led to believe that stockwell was retained as their counsel,and that stockwell would advise them of material matters affecting their interests.further,neither stockwell nor california indemnity ever advised plaintiffs that plaintiffs might be entitled to employ independent counsel,at california indemnity expense,because of the civil personal injury suit duran intended to bring against plaintiffs.
if plaintiffs had been advised,prior to the july settlement of the compensation case,that such settlement negotiations were taking place,and that duran was interested in a global settlement,plaintiffs would have participated in the negotiations or otherwise sought to safeguard their interests,including contributing of their own funds to secure a global settlement of duran claims,while reserving any rights they may have against california indemnity.
because of its services in the compensation case and its knowledge of duran desire of a global settlement,plaintiffs allege that stockwell had a duty to notify plaintiffs of that development.at the very least,they allege,stockwell had a duty to advise plaintiffs that it represented california indemnity interests exclusively,and a duty to notify california indemnity of duran personal injury suit and his desire for a global settlement so that california indemnity could,in turn,honor its obligations to plaintiffs.stockwell owed and breached a fiduciary duty to plaintiffs,notwithstanding that its services were paid for by california indemnity,not plaintiffs,and that plaintiffs were relieved of liability as a matter of law under labor code section.stockwell also owed a duty to plaintiffs,under civil code section,to disclose potential conflicts of interest between california indemnity and plaintiffs 
plaintiffs also allege that stockwell views and actions constitute unfair trade practices,and stockwell and california indemnity should notify insured employers of those views and practices.stockwell has opposed plaintiffs efforts to secure a written opinion from the state bar of california respecting the propriety of its view respecting the duties owed to employers by attorneys who are retained by the employers insurance carriers in workers compensation cases.
procedural background 
this suit was filed on february.both stockwell and california indemnity generally demurred to the complaint.the trial court sustained stockwell demurrer without leave to amend,based on the court finding that defendants owed no duty to plaintiffs given the provisions in labor code section.an order dismissing defendants from the case was signed and filed on july.thereafter,plaintiffs filed this timely appeal 
issue presented by this appeal 
although stockwell asserted several grounds to support its general demurrer to canton poultry complaint,the trial court sustained the demurrer on the basis of just one of those grounds,labor code section.canton poultry focuses its appeal on the effect that statute has on its case against stockwell,and it requested time for additional briefing if we affirmed the order of dismissal on another ground.because we find that s
