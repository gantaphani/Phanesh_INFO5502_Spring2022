petitioners new haven terminal new haven terminal and its insurer,liberty mutual insurance,appeal from the judgment of the benefits review board of the united states department of labor brb that reversed in part the decision of the administrative law judge alj and granted workers compensation benefits to respondent richard lake.after the alj had approved a settlement between lake and new haven terminal successor,logistec of connecticut,logistec,to compensate lake for lost wages due to a injury,the alj reviewed lake claims against new haven terminal for lost wages due to a injury,which he claimed left him permanently partially disabled.
the alj found that new haven terminal owed lake compensation from to,but not after,because lake current disabilities are due to the injury he suffered in while working for logistec.to the extent that the injury may have aggravated the injury,the alj explained that under the aggravation rule,the employer at the time of the latter injury is liable for the entire resulting disability,and thus logistec,and not new haven terminal,was liable for any disability after the injury.
the brb reversed the alj decision to terminate new haven terminal liability after.we vacate the decisions below with respect to compensation and remand for the alj to review the settlement and to determine new haven terminal liability for lake disability.
background 
on february,lake injured his back while he was working for new haven terminal as a longshoreman.he returned to work on february,as a field checker and laborer with lower weekly earnings.sometime in,logistec assumed control of the operations of the new haven and bridgeport docks.on november,lake had a physical altercation with his supervisor marty romano during a argument and suffered a second back injury.the alj decision portrays romano as the aggressor,which neither party disputes.as of september,lake still was unable to work,and the record does not reveal when,if at all,he resumed working and at what wages.
lake claimed disability and medical benefits against new haven terminal and logistec under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca.on june,lake settled his claims with logistec for in compensation and for attorney fees and expenses.the settlement was premised upon a weekly wage of before lake injury.the alj approved the settlement on july.
on august,the alj found new haven terminal liable for lake lost earnings between and,but not thereafter.the parties had stipulated that lake had been earning per week before the injury,and the alj found that lake wage earning capacity was.there is no explanation in the record for the discrepancy between lake stipulated wage earning capacity of and the settlement premised weekly wage of before the injury.the difference between the stipulated weekly wage and the weekly wage was.under the lhwca,a claimant suffering a permanent partial disability is compensated at a rate of of the and difference,which in this case was correcting the alj math error.c h.the alj granted compensation for both lake temporary total and permanent total disability in the months after the injury,and his permanent partial disability from february,when he returned to work,to november,the date of the second injury.
the alj ruled that new haven terminal was not liable after november,because lake present disability is due solely to his november,physical altercation and confrontation with his supervisor.lake new haven terminal,owcp,at.the alj first explained that the altercation was an intervening cause which is attributable only to lake own subsequent conduct and which broke the chain of causality between lake injury and his present condition.id.at.this conclusion incorporated elements of fault and contributory negligence as a basis for rejecting lake claim.second,the alj found that lake had completely recovered from the injury when the injury occurred.id.at.third,the alj also found,somewhat inconsistently,that the second injury aggravated the first,and he ruled that under the aggravation rule,to the extent lake suffered an injury that aggravated a condition,lake may collect benefits for the total resulting injury only from the last employer,logistec.see id.at citing found.constructors,office of workers comp.programs,cir.thus the alj exonerated new haven terminal from any liability based upon the injury.
the brb reversed the alj holding to the extent that it exempted new haven terminal from liability after november,and extended that liability indefinitely for lake permanent partial disability.see lake new haven terminal,brb,at.first,the brb ruled that the defense of intervening cause applies only to events following an initial work injury,and that the lhwca specifically excludes the consideration of fault in assessing the cause of the injury.id.at citing b compensation shall be payable irrespective of fault as a cause for the injury.second,the brb found no evidence of record to support the alj finding that lake back injury had resolved before the injury or that the second injury permanently exacerbated the first,and thus held that new haven terminal continued to be liable for the effects of the first injury.id.at.third,the brb rejected the alj application of the aggravation rule to place liability on logistec,but did not address the question of whether a first employer may invoke the aggravation rule as a defense.id.at.new haven terminal appeals from the brb ruling.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,new haven terminal argues that the alj finding that lake had completely recovered from the injury was supported by substantial evidence under the aggravation rule,the last employer is liable for the entire disability and thus this liability falls on logistec and not new haven terminal and the logistec settlement adequately compensated lake for the entire disability resulting from the injury.
standard of review 
we review the brb decision de novo for errors of law,and we uphold an administrative law judge findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence.blanding,owcp,cir see also smith,hinchman and grylls,d.substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a factual conclusion.richardson perales,d.
evidence of recovery from the injury 
new haven terminal argues that the brb erred in rejecting the alj conclusion that lake had recovered completely from his back injury before the back injury,and that therefore new haven terminal was not liable for the effects of the latter injury.we agree with the brb that there was no substantial evidence supporting the alj finding of complete recovery.
the alj relied primarily on lake failure to seek further medical treatment for his back between and november.although this conduct may raise some doubt about the severity of lake disability,it does not disprove its continued existence.it is as plausible that lake simply adhered to his health restrictions in order to avoid pain and discomfort,and did not need further treatment.new haven terminal further argument,that lake was able to perform all of his assigned duties,is equally weak.when lake returned to work after the injury in,he switched from longshoreman,a position which required repeated heavy lifting,to field checker,a less demanding job that was tailored to accommodate his back problems.lake performance of these duties suggests no more than that the new position accommodated his disability,not that the disability resolved.
the alj findings drew heavily upon a medical evaluation by michael saffir,to whom lake was referred by signal mutual insurance,logistec insurer.that evaluation,however,offers no support for the claim that lake fully recovered from his back problems before.saffir noted lake significant history of back pain and left sciatica,and suggested that the incident could aggravate a lumbar strain and possibly subacute underlying radiculopathy.the alj points to saffir statement that lake recovered with rest and medication using motrin.in context,the word recovered referred to lake physical condition in and his recovery from the injury,not the injury.given that saffir found that lake was still disabled,the recovery plainly refers not to a full recovery of his back,but to an alleviation of pain in that permitted lake to function.the alj also mentions saffir statement that lake improved with conservative treatment after the injury,and that lake apparently did fairly well with regular activities before,but improvement does not equate with recovery.saffir reference to regular activities also does not indicate an ability to return to work as a longshoreman with its heavy lifting requirements.
in pressing its argument that the second employer is responsible for any aggravation of a prior injury,new haven terminal takes the somewhat inconsistent position that the injury exacerbated the injury,implicitly acknowledging that the injury was not resolved.new haven terminal cites saffir opinion that i t is possible that his injury could aggravate a lumbar strain and possible subacute underlying radiculopathy,which resulted from the injury.
new haven terminal also presents an economic argument that the injury did not cause lake disability.under the lhwca,the evaluation of disability is both medical and economic.see pietrunti,office of workers comp.programs,cir because disability under the act is an economic concept,the extent of disability can not be measured by medical condition alone.new haven terminal argues that lake was not disabled in economic terms because,when lake returned to work in,he switched positions from longshoreman to field checker,which had a higher hourly wage.however,this argument disregards that lake earlier position offered lucrative overtime pay,which accounted for his higher weekly wage despite a lower hourly wage.new haven terminal also contends that lake diminished earnings were due to logistec pay cuts,and not to the back injury.however,lake provided evidence of economic disability after in a comparative method that accounts for pay cuts.the wages of joseph russo,a comparable worker employed in the position lake would have held but for his injury,were greater than those of lake after.new haven terminal does not contend that this comparison with russo was,in any respect,unfair or misleading.
lake has demonstrated sufficiently that he was partially disabled in medical and economic terms,but one might argue,although new haven terminal did not do so,that lake stipulated weekly wage of does not accurately reflect what lake wages would be as time passed.first,although the wage cuts in probably would not have erased the difference between his pre and wages,they would have sharply reduced that difference.second,lake was approximately years old at the time of the injury as he aged,he probably would have cut back in overtime and might have opted to take advantage of his seniority to move into lighter work with slightly lower pay.
however,the lhwca forecloses this economic argument.the statute defines disability as incapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of the injury in the same or any other employment.the statute then fixes compensation for such disability at of the difference between the average weekly wages of the employee and the employee wage earning capacity thereafter.c.the lhwca determines compensation by calculating the average weekly wage at the time of the injury,and offers three different methods of calculation,each based on actual wages at the time of the injury.a c.the lhwca does allow an upward adjustment in the capacity figure if the actual earnings do not fairly or reasonably represent his wage earning capacity.h referring to the calculation under c,but it does not permit adjustments to wages.
we can speculate that the statute focuses on the actual wages because such a calculation is simpler and more efficient than creating actuarial tables,comparing similar workers over time,or factoring in wage cuts.in any event,the statute builds in a devaluation of the earnings by one third.c.whether this reduction undercompensates some workers and overcompensates others need not concern us.it is a legislative choice.
under this statutory framework,lake has demonstrated that in and again in he was disabled in physical and in economic terms due to injuries.however,it is not clear from the evidence to what extent the injury contributed to lake current disability,a matter we discuss infra.
c.the last employer rule 
the last employer rule is not a defense 
new haven terminal argues that logistec is solely responsible for lake disability benefits after the altercation on november,even for injuries that aggravated the injury.the aggravation rule,a branch of the last employer rule,assigns liability to the last employer in workers compensation cases where a disability results from cumulative or multiple injuries.we announced the last employer rule in travelers ins.cardillo,in recognition of the practical difficulties and delays in trying to apportion liability among several employers for cumulative disabilities.see,cir.
the last employer rule generally applies to occupational diseases,while the aggravation rule applies to multiple discrete and exacerbating injuries and is also known as the rule.see bath iron works,office of workers comp.programs,cir found.constructors,at.we have adopted the fifth circuit formulation of the aggravation rule w here an employment injury worsens or combines with a preexisting impairment to produce a disability greater than that which would have resulted from the employment injury alone,the entire resulting disability is compensable,office of workers comp.programs general dynamics krotsis,cir overruled,in part,on other grounds by,office of workers comp.programs general dynamics,cir citing strachan shipping nash,cir.
the aggravation rule is not a defense for first or earlier employers,but rather,an extension of liability that promotes administrative efficiency and guarantees full recovery for injured workers.as the fifth circuit elaborated in strachan 
the lhwca represents a compromise by which the employee receives a much smaller recovery than he might receive in a tort action.at the same time,this reduced recovery is intended to be immediate,secure,and less expensive for the employee to obtain 
this court has noted repeatedly that the lhwca is to be liberally construed in favor of injured employees and recovery by longshoremen.the aggravation rule,as applied by the brb together with the credit doctrine,rests on this same presumption of compensability grounded in the humanitarian nature of the lhwca.
id.at.permitting the prior employer to use the aggravation rule as a defense to limit full recovery would frustrate the statute goal of complete recovery for injuries.id.strachan rejected an argument that because a claimant could have or should have recovered compensation for a disability at an earlier time,he would be forever precluded from recovery for disability attributable to his initial injury.id.at.s uch limitations on employee recovery are not favored,absent statutory authority.courts have consistently rejected any attempt to construe the lhwca as requiring an employee to seek the maximum conceivable compensation from an employer or to forfeit thereafter recovery on a portion of his disability.id.at internal citation omitted.there is no statutory authority for a previous employer to use the aggravation rule as a shield from liability.
the aggravation rule was fashioned by courts to promote the goals of the lhwca,to provide workers compensation benefits which are easily,quickly,and routinely established.id.at.as the strachan court recognized,interpreting the lhwca to limit recovery,because recovery could have been obtained from another employer under the aggravation rule,would deter parties from settling claims under the lhwca.id.at.
our precedents on the aggravation rule do not detract from strachan interpretations of the lhwca.these cases formulate the aggravation rule as an extension of liability and do not suggest its availability as a defense or that it immunizes the previous employers.see krotsis,at t he entire resulting disability is compensable.citing strachan,at blanchette office of workers comp.programs,cir same see also,office of workers comp.programs lu
