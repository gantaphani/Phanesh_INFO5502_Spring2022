we hold the workers compensation appeals board the board may not allow joinder of a new party after the expiration of the statute of limitations for the filing of a serious and willful misconduct claim.accordingly,we annul the wcab order in this case that permitted joinder.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying facts are undisputed.kenneth peterson peterson suffered a fatal heart attack while working on a movie production in arizona on february.peterson was employed by both a general employer and a special employer.the general employer was entertainment partners entertainment,which handled payroll and regular workers compensation benefits.the special employer was the production company,mcgee street productions mcgee street.peterson wife,gabrielle,filed claims against entertainment for a specific and a cumulative trauma injury on behalf of her husband,herself and their two dependent children.entertainment settled those claims 
on february,within one year of the date of death,gabrielle peterson then filed a second petition,this time alleging serious and willful misconduct against only entertainment.the petition alleged entertainment employed peterson as a transportation captain.california and arizona occupational safety health administration regulations required medical personnel on the scene.the employer production manager on site was aware that,because of a traffic collision three days prior to peterson death involving the vehicle used by the medical personnel,the assigned medical equipment and supplies were unavailable.accordingly,entertainment was not able to render effective emergency care to peterson when he suffered his heart attack.the petition alleged that entertainment knowingly failed to comply with safety standards.
mcgee street was served by mail with a copy of the petition but was not named as a defendant.on april,more than one year after peterson death,an amended petition naming both mcgee street and entertainment was served on mcgee street.an order joining mcgee street productions issued on december.
on december,the attorney for mcgee street insurance carrier objected to the order of joinder because he had not received notice of the hearing on the serious and willful claim.mcgee street also contended that entertainment,not mcgee street,was the responsible party.the objection also referenced hallmark entertainment hallmark,the first mention of that entity in a document filed in the workers compensation proceedings.
meanwhile in october,entertainment filed a petition to dismiss based on its status as a general employer not involved in daily control or supervision over peterson duties,workplace or activities.on january,the workers compensation judge wcj dismissed entertainment following a settlement with the peterson family.on january,peterson filed and served a second amended serious and willful petition,including both mcgee street and hallmark.hallmark objected to the second amended petition,contending there was no employment relationship between it and peterson.
a bifurcated trial was set for june,on the sole issue of whether the serious and willful petitions against mcgee street and hallmark were barred by labor code section because they were filed more than one year from the date of death.
at trial,peterson argued that she had timely served entertainment and,because liability of general and special employers was joint and several,service of the petition on entertainment constituted timely service on mcgee street.peterson further contended that rubio workers comp.appeals bd.d,supported a rule that amendments adding new parties relate back to the original petition.this rule,she argued,was consistent with the principle that dismissals based on pleading technicalities are disfavored.see liberty mutual ins.workers comp.appeals bd.d.she also argued that mcgee street had made misrepresentations in which it denied the existence of an employment relationship and should,therefore,be estopped from raising the statute of limitations defense.peterson contended that previously mcgee street had denied employment,even though its attorneys were in possession of pleadings previously filed indicating the existence of either a general or special employment relationship.not until april,in its opposition to joinder did mcgee street for the first time admit entertainment was the general employer and mcgee street was the special employer.it was only then that mcgee street abandoned its no employment relationship defense in favor of the statute of limitations.if hallmark and mcgee street had initially raised the statute of limitations defense,peterson contended,she would not have agreed to dismiss entertainment.however,on the representation made by the attorney for hallmark street productions,specifically that their objection to the joinder was based on an employment relationship and relying upon the affidavit of kay kimmel,attached to the petition to dismiss,submitted by entertainment partners peterson agreed to a dismissal 
mcgee street and hallmark argued that neither was named as a defendant in the original petition for serious and willful misconduct.the first and second amended petitions were filed more than one year from the date of death,and there was no authority permitting amendments to add new defendants after the time prescribed in the statute of limitations.further,as in ordinary civil matters,an amendment that adds a new defendant does not relate back to the date of filing of the original complaint.mcgee street and hallmark also contended peterson was aware of her husband dual employment situation and,citing martin phillips petroleum d.disapproved on other grounds in kowalski shell oil cal d,fn,a serious and willful claim must be filed against the special employer if it was the special employer who engaged in conduct giving rise to the claim.finally,they claimed that denial of employment was only shorthand for their contention that they had no liability.
the wcj found peterson was unaware that mcgee street and hallmark were employers at the time she filed the serious and willful petition.based on rubio workers comp.appeals,supra,d at page,the wcj found that a serious and willful petition may be amended to add a new defendant.the wcj further concluded that mcgee street and hallmark had been served with the original petition against entertainment and could not demonstrate lack of timely warning or prejudice.the wcj rejected mcgee street and hallmark arguments based on the statute of limitations in the code of civil procedure as inapplicable to workers compensation proceedings,governed exclusively by the labor code.the wcj concluded that given the liberal construction of workers compensation laws see fruehauf workmen.bd.cal d,the statute of limitations did not bar the present claims against mcgee street or hallmark.
mcgee street and hallmark sought reconsideration.the board denied the petition and adopted the wcj report as its decision.this petition for review followed.
