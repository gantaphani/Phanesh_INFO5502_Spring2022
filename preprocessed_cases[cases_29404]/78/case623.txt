in this cause we interpret provisions of the texas workers compensation act the act governing when a workers compensation carrier must notify a claimant that the carrier is refusing to pay benefits.see.the district court granted summary judgment for the carrier on the basis that it had timely contested compensability even though it had not timely notified the claimant that it was refusing to pay benefits.the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment for the claimant,and remanded the issue of attorney fees.we conclude that under texas labor code and,a carrier that fails to begin benefit payments as required by the act or send a notice of refusal to pay within seven days after it receives written notice of injury has not met the statutory requisite to later contest compensability.we accordingly affirm the court of appeals judgment.
respondent mary ann downs timely filed a claim for workers compensation benefits after her husband fatal heart attack.petitioner continental casualty company provided workers compensation insurance to her husband employer.continental first notified downs that it disputed the compensability of her claim days after it received notice of the injury.the parties proceeded to a conference and then a hearing at the texas workers compensation commission.the hearing officer determined that downs husband heart attack was not compensable and that continental had timely contested compensability.an appeals panel affirmed that decision.having exhausted her administrative remedies,downs sought judicial review in the district court.the parties filed for summary judgment,and the court granted summary judgment for continental,affirming the commission decision.downs appealed,complaining only of the determination that continental had timely disputed compensability.the court of appeals reversed and rendered judgment in favor of downs,and it remanded downs claim for attorney fees to the district court.at.it held that because continental had not timely notified downs of its refusal to pay benefits,it could not contest compensability.id.
continental petitioned this court for review,contending that the court of appeals interpretation of labor code and deprives carriers of the statutory deadline to contest compensability and imposes an additional penalty not reflected in the statutory scheme for failure to meet the deadline.it further argues that the court of appeals interpretation is contrary to the commission interpretation and application of the statutes.downs responds that the commission interpretation is at odds with the language of sections and,and that to read those provisions as continental proposes would defeat the legislature express intent that workers receive either prompt payment or notice of denial of compensation claims.
as we are called upon to interpret what the parties agree are the controlling provisions of the labor code,we begin by reviewing the relevant principles of statutory construction.the goal of statutory construction is to give effect to legislative intent.kroger keng,texas water comm brushy creek mun.util,monsanto cornerstones mun.util.unless a statute is ambiguous,we discern that intent from the language of the statute itself.see fitzgerald advanced spine fixation,republicbank dallas interkal,see also.gov t code a words and phrases shall be read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.further,we consider a statute as a whole,not its provisions in isolation.helena chem.wilkins,fitzgerald,at.
labor code chapter sets out the procedures that employees,employers,and carriers must follow when an employee seeks workers compensation benefits after suffering an injury on the job.subchapter b,entitled payment of benefits,specifies what a carrier must do,and when,after it receives written notice of an injury.id.section a mandates that carriers must do one of two things within seven days after receiving written notice of paying benefits as required by the act or give written notice of refusal to pay benefits 
an insurance carrier shall initiate compensation under this subtitle promptly.not later than the seventh day after the date on which an insurance carrier receives written notice of an injury,the insurance carrier shall 
begin the payment of benefits as required by this subtitle or 
notify the commission and the employee in writing of its refusal to pay 
id.a.by directing that insurance carriers shall either begin payment as required by the act or send notice of refusal,the legislature imposed a duty on carriers to take one of those actions within seven days.see.gov t code generally,use of the word s hall imposes a duty see also albertson,sinclair,we generally construe the word shall as mandatory,unless legislative intent suggests otherwise.
section expands on what the notice of refusal must contain and what effect the notice has on further proceedings.section a explains that a carrier notice of refusal to pay benefits under section must specify the grounds for the refusal.id.a.the next subsection explains that except for newly discovered evidence,a carrier is bound by the grounds for refusal it specifies in the notice of refusal the grounds for the refusal specified in the notice constitute the only basis for the insurance carrier defense on the issue of compensability in a subsequent proceeding,unless the defense is based on newly discovered evidence that could not reasonably have been discovered at an earlier date.id.b.thus,if a carrier timely sends its notice of refusal it may continue to investigate,but absent newly discovered evidence,has limited its defenses on the issue of compensability to the grounds for refusal specified in the notice.id.
giving effect to all the language in both sections and,and keeping in mind the legislative goal of providing employees with either prompt payment or notice of denial of benefits,the following propositions are clear under section a,a carrier must initiate benefits as required by the act or file a notice of refusal under section c,a carrier who initiates benefits may take up to sixty days to investigate or deny compensability for any valid reason and under section b,a carrier who files a notice of refusal may investigate or deny compensability,but is limited to the grounds specified in the notice as bases for contesting compensability,except for newly discovered evidence.therefore,a carrier that has neither initiated benefits nor filed a notice of refusal has not complied with the statutory requisite,and has failed to trigger the period to investigate or deny compensability.
it is also clear that by mandating that carriers either initiate benefits as required by the act or send a notice of refusal within the short deadline,the legislature intended to provide employees with a prompt response to their benefit claims and to streamline the process to avoid early attorney involvement.see montford et,a guide to texas workers comp reform section significantly accelerates the processing time for carriers either to initiate benefit payments or to contest compensability.promptness of the initial comp payment was considered an important reform objective since delays in initiating benefits under the prior law at times resulted in hardship upon the employee and a need for early attorney involvement.the legislature further sought to encourage carriers to initiate benefit payments by providing an unfettered basis to deny compensability for up to sixty days if benefits are initiated,but limiting a carrier who refuses to pay to the ground specified in a notice of refusal,unless the carrier discovers new evidence it could not reasonably have discovered earlier.see.b see also id.c stating that carrier commits administrative violation if it does not have reasonable grounds for a refusal to pay benefits,stating that carrier commits administrative violation if it controverts a claim if the evidence clearly indicates liability.thus,interpreting the legislative scheme to require carriers to comply with the deadline to trigger the period to investigate or deny compensability gives meaning to all the provisions of both sections and,and strikes a balance between the injured employee interest in obtaining prompt payment of benefits or notice of refusal and the carrier interest in investigating valid grounds for refusal.
continental construction,by contrast,renders meaningless the deadline of section a the incentive of unlimited bases for denial of compensability for carriers who initiate payments as provided in the second sentence of section c and all the limitations regarding notices of refusal in section.that construction would permit carriers to do nothing,thereby delaying benefits and eliminating the statutory requirement of early notice of denial that gives employees certain protections,and permit carriers to take up to sixty days to investigate without paying benefits or risking being bound by an earlier ground for refusal.although the parties and the court of appeals label the consequence for failure to meet the deadline a waiver,that is not precisely what happens under the statutory scheme.we are presented not with a question of waiver,but of a deadline seven days to pay or dispute,and a consequence for failing to meet that deadline a carrier that does nothing fails to avail itself of the period to investigate or deny compensability.both the deadline and the consequence are clearly chosen and clearly expressed by the legislature.
continental urges that this interpretation of the statute creates a penalty in addition to the potential administrative penalty set out in section e,and that an administrative penalty is a sufficient incentive for carriers to comply with the notice requirement.yet continental was apparently not penalized in this case,and it has not cited any instance in which any carrier has been penalized for violating section a.nor has the texas workers compensation commission as amicus curiae represented that it does or has in fact penalized carriers for failing to comply with the deadline.the administrative penalty continental claims is a sufficient incentive is itself discretionary.the commission may assess an administrative penalty against a person who commits an administrative violation.the fact that the commission has the discretion to impose an administrative penalty does not make the legislature language imposing the rule any less mandatory,or the consequences of violating the rule any less clear.
moreover,that the commission agrees with continental construction of the statute does not make that construction any more persuasive.construction of a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement is entitled to serious consideration only if that construction is reasonable and does not contradict the statute plain language.tarrant appraisal dist.moore,stanford butler.the construction advanced by the commission is,we conclude,at odds with the statute mandatory language.that construction has the perverse effect of encouraging a carrier not to file a notice at carrier that does nothing may investigate for sixty days and then deny compensation for any reason.and that carrier,who has violated the statute language,is in the same position as a carrier who initiates benefits.but the carrier that fulfills its statutory duty to send a notice of refusal and puts the wrong reason in the notice can deny compensation for that reason only.see vanliner ins.ward,no writ.
the legislature has mandated that carriers must initiate benefits as required by the workers compensation act or notify a claimant that it refuses to pay within seven days of when the carrier receives notice of the injury.taking some action within seven days is what entitles the carrier to a period to investigate or deny compensability.because continental neither initiated benefits nor provided grounds for refusal within this statutory deadline,it may not now contest compensability.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgment.
the statute says if an insurance carrier does not contest the compensability of an injury on or before the day after the date on which the insurance carrier is notified of the injury,the insurance carrier waives its right to contest compensability.c the statute does not compel the carrier to meet that deadline but gives a dramatic of all rights to contest the it does not.continental avoided waiver by disputing the claim in writing before the sixtieth day.the court nevertheless holds that continental forfeited its rights to contest the claim because it neither began payment nor contested the claim within seven days after it received written notice of downs heart attack.at citing.a.
the concept of waiver is nowhere to be found in section a.instead,the statute imposes administrative penalties for noncompliance with the that,unlike the court forfeiture holding,are explicit in the statute itself.careful to avoid use of the term waiver,the court finds its equivalent in an aura of legislative intent encircling the statute.i believe it is more appropriate to locate legislative intent in the legislature words.the words,in this case,are not ambiguous.
the court reveals the weakness in its analysis when it considers whether the penalties are sufficient,or sufficiently enforced,to encourage carriers to meet the deadline.political questions such as those should not infect our analysis of the statute meaning.as we have often said,the wisdom or expediency of the law is the legislature prerogative,not ours.weiner wasson,quoting texas workers comp.comm garcia,smith davis.our only task here is to construe the legislature work.the court fails that task today.by finding forfeiture in a statute unwritten text when the written text imposes no more than an administrative penalty,the court appropriates a legislative function.i respectfully dissent.
the statute before us is not ambiguous.not later than the seventh day after receiving written notice of an employee injury,a carrier must either begin paying benefits or notify the commission and employee of its refusal to pay.a.section e describes the consequence of noncompliance an insurance carrier commits a violation if the insurance carrier does not initiate payments or file a notice of refusal within seven days after receiving written notice of an injury.the class b administrative violation is punishable by maximum fines of per day.no other consequence is mentioned in the statute.the only express waiver provision in section,found in subsection c,provides that the insurance carrier waives its right to contest compensability if it does not dispute the claim on or before the sixtieth day after receiving notice of the injury.all agree that continental contested compensability before the sixtieth day.we must determine,then,whether continental,having avoided the only waiver provision in the subsection,is permitted to litigate whether downs claim is compensable.
for more than a decade,the workers compensation commission has recognized that carriers in continental position have a legal right to litigate the claim compensability.in,the workers compensation commission construed former article to mean that a failure to comply with the deadline subjects carriers to administrative fines,but not waiver.see.workers comp.comm n,appeal,wl may.workers comp.comm n,appeal,wl,at.the commission has consistently construed section as it did article.see.workers comp.comm n,appeal,wl,at june.workers comp.comm n,appeal,wl,at july.under the commission view,
if a carrier fails to comply with section a,the carrier is not precluded from thereafter filing a notice of refusal however,when the carrier subsequently files its notice of refusal,the grounds for the refusal specified in the notice constitute the only basis for the carrier defense on the issue of compensability in a subsequent proceeding,unless the defense is based on newly discovered evidence,pursuant to section b.when the carrier refuses to pay benefits and fails to file its notice of refusal timely,within seven days,the carrier is subject to an administrative penalty but may still dispute compensability,but the commission will consider that notice of refusal under the same rules as the notice of refusal filed within seven days.
