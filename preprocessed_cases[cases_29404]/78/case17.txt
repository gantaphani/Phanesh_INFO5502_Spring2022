digregorio requests for her entire claim file

at this time i do not find digregorio totally disabled but only partially disabled.she should have no repetitive activities or repetitive use of the hands,but this would allow any type of sedentary occupation that was 
digregorio repeated her request for her entire claim file by letter from her counsel dated october.by letter of october,hartford responded that we can not release any documents contained in di g regorio claim file that are not pertinent to the denial of her claim.the documents that accompanied our september,letter are those that were used in making our determination.
digregorio made a third request for her entire claim file through counsel by letter dated october,stating,it is our position that you must have,and indeed should have,considered digregorio entire claim file in making a decision to terminate benefits on this claim we believe digregorio is deprived of a full and fair review of her claim absent the provision of these materials.hartford reply by letter dated october,stated 
while digregorio entire claim file has certainly been reviewed,the documents that pertain to the denial of her claim are the employability analysis report of and the evaluation by douglas howard.the most recent medical documentation we have on file indicates that digregorio is not totally disabled from any occupation,and,therefore,that is information used in making our determination to deny benefits.
digregorio appeal to hartford 
in her appeal letter to hartford through counsel on november,digregorio presented her arguments in support of her claim to benefits,including her challenges to the accuracy and reliability of howard recommendation and the results of the employability analysis report.digregorio also provided additional materials for hartford review,including a laboratory report from massachusetts general hospital showing the results of an electromyography emg test conducted on digregorio on november,a february,letter to digregorio from jupiter,a july,treatment note made by jupiter,and an october,letter to digregorio attorney from jupiter.
jupiter letter to digregorio of february,stated that electrical evaluation of your hand and wrist shows substantial and serious compression of the median nerves in the carpal tunnel i believe that the problem can affect your ability to function and that you have at least for the present an ongoing disability as a result of this.his treatment note of july,stated that an emg and nerve conduction study afforded a compressive neuropathy in the median nerve.this interferes with digregorio ability to function.she remains disabled because of this and will do so on a continued basis unless intervention proves successful her prognosis is guarded.jupiter letter to digregorio attorney of october,stated an emg and nerve conduction study confirm that digregorio still has dysfunction of her nerve.on the basis of this and her symptoms she continues to be disabled in her secretarial line of work and feels that she is unable to perform bimanual tasks in any form of work.
although digregorio did not request copies of any documents considered during hartford review of her appeal in her november,letter,she reiterated her position that hartford failure to provide her entire claim file in response to her request for copies of documents pertinent to the denial of her claim eviscerates her right to a full and fair review of this claim under erisa.

proceedings in district court

having obtained a copy of her entire claim file during litigation,digregorio moved for judgment on the administrative record on june.digregorio did not seek to introduce any evidence outside of the administrative record for consideration by the district court.as an alternate prayer for relief,however,digregorio sought a remand of her benefits claim to hartford for an opportunity to supplement the administrative record.hartford and the plan for summary judgment on june,during a hearing on august,the parties agreed to the court suggestion that it treat their for summary judgment as a case stated or trial on the record itself,thereby permitting the court to make findings of fact instead of granting inferences to each in turn.
the district court awarded judgment to hartford and the plan on digregorio claim of entitlement to benefits on august.in a written memorandum and order,the court reviewed de novo hartford decision to uphold its termination of digregorio benefits.digregorio,wl at,dist lexis,at.it held that given digregorio underlying failure to adduce any affirmative evidence supporting her contention that she was disabled as to any occupation,the opinions of howard and jupiter are fatal to her claim.accordingly,i conclude that hartford correctly determined that digregorio was not entitled to continued ltd benefits.id.wl at,dist lexis at.the court did not reach the question of whether digregorio was otherwise unentitled to benefits because she did not meet the plan requirement that she be under the regular care of a physician.id.wl at,dist lexis,at.
in a brief discussion at the end of its lengthy opinion,the court separately addressed digregorio argument that hartford and the plan had deprived her of a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of her claim in violation of erisa by failing to provide her with a copy of her entire claim file upon request.even assuming that digregorio is correct that she was entitled to her complete file under erisa,the court stated,she must additionally demonstrate that she was somehow prejudiced by hartford failure to provide the file,which digregorio had obtained during the litigation.id.wl at,dist lexis at.the court noted that digregorio contends that if she had received a copy of her entire claim file,she would have provided evidence that she was under the regular care of a physician,evidence that she suffered from pain and other psychological deficits associated with her condition,and some further vocational expertise as to available jobs.id.wl at,dist lexis at.the court concluded,however,that digregorio argument that she would have supplemented the administrative record with further evidence to support her claim if she had been able to review her entire claim file was 
post hoc rationalization.if digregorio had additional information that could have altered hartford decision,there was no reason she could not have submitted it along with the evidence she submitted during the appeals process i note she has not alluded to any evidence that she had or has additional information that would have changed hartford decision to deny her claim.thus,i conclude that she was not denied a full and fair review of her claim.

digregorio raises a narrow issue on appeal.she does not challenge the factual findings and legal conclusions set forth in the district court nearly opinion relating to the merits of her claim of entitlement to benefits based on the existing administrative record,reached upon de novo review of hartford final decision.nor does digregorio seek review of any decision by the court relating to the admission of evidence,having made no attempt to introduce any such evidence before the district court.digregorio argues only that the court,instead of granting judgment in favor of hartford and the plan,shoul
