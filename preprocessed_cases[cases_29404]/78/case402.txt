plaintiff antony padilla appeals summary judgment in favor of respondents pomona college and gordon williams general contractor,in his action for personal injury and premises liability arising from a worksite injury during the remodel of a dormitory at defendant pomona college.plaintiff argues that the trial court erred in finding defendants had delegated the task of making the worksite safe to others,and that they did not exercise any retained control in a manner that affirmatively contributed to plaintiff injuries regulations did not establish defendants negligence per se or impose a duty on defendants and that plaintiff expert testimony lacked foundation.we affirm.
factual background and procedural history 
defendant pomona college pomona hired gordon williams general contractor,gordon williams to remodel a dormitory on its college campus.defendants summary judgment motion asserted that gordon williams subcontracted with,plaintiff employer,for among other things,the demolition of water pipes in the basement of the dormitory.the water pressure to some of the pipes in the basement area was not shut off because the pipes were needed during the remodeling process.
during the demolition,plaintiff stood on a ladder to demolish an unpressurized metal pipe.a portion of that pipe came loose and fell,striking a pressurized pvc pipe and breaking it.plaintiff was knocked off his ladder by the gusher of water erupting from the broken pvc pipe and sustained serious physical injuries.the parties do not dispute that the pvc pipe was not to be demolished.
plaintiff complaint asserted two theories,negligence and premises liability.he alleged that defendants violated their common law and statutory duties to ensure that there was no water pressure in the pipes in the area plaintiff was working.
defendants pomona and gordon williams moved for summary judgment,contending they had no duty to plaintiff because they did not retain control over the details of the activities causing plaintiff injuries and engage in any affirmative act that contributed to plaintiff injuries.hooker department of transportation cal th,d,hooker.further,they contended that plaintiff claim was barred because his employer knew or should have known of the danger presented by the pvc pipe kinsman unocal cal th,d,kinsman.
defendants presented evidence that it was contractual duty to demolish pipes,asbestos,lead,and drywall,and agreed to protect items that remained in the employees work area.prior to the start of the project,gordon williams worked with to ensure that understood the scope of the demolition,including which pipes would remain and which would be demolished.specifically,the architect plans for the project showed that a pvc pipe would remain in the building during demolition,and would remain pressurized to provide water for work on the project.
gordon williams retained deel mechanical to prepare the plumbing system in the dormitory for demolition,and to ensure that the pipes that would not be demolished were cut and capped.deel marked the pipes to be removed,and redirected temporary piping on the outside of the building.the basement was barricaded to prevent access by deel and other subcontractors.
the trial court,in a separate summary judgment motion,found deel had no duty to prevent the injury that occurred to plaintiff.
at the time of the accident,plaintiff was using tools and equipment,and was directed in his work by his supervisor,armando takata,who according to defendant evidence,identified to plaintiff that the pvc pipe was one of the pipes that had been left pressurized.the moving papers provided evidence that takata expressly advised plaintiff to avoid damaging the pressurized pvc pipe.standard demolition procedures for the type of pipe that plaintiff demolished required plaintiff and a to use separate ladders,tie a rope around the midsection of the pipe to be demolished,break the pipe,and lower the pipe to the ground slowly.plaintiff was not following this procedure at the time of the accident.defendants,in particular gordon williams,did not supervise plaintiff.
plaintiff was covered by workers compensation insurance,and has received benefits from insurance carrier.
plaintiff opposed the motion,contending that gordon williams failure to depressurize the pipe constituted negligence per se,a breach of its contractual duties,and was contrary to custom and practice and gordon williams failure to depressurize the pipe affirmatively contributed to plaintiff injury.
plaintiff specifically contended that gordon williams failed to follow regulations,tit,subd.a which required utilities to be shut off,capped,or otherwise controlled during demolition,or protected if use was necessary.plaintiff also contended gordon williams contract with pomona college specified that gordon williams was responsible for initiating,maintaining and supervising all safety precautions and programs in connection with the performance of the contract and that gordon williams was to take reasonable precautions for safety of,and shall provide reasonable protection to prevent damage,injury or loss to employees on the work and other persons who may be affected thereby.in addition,gordon williams was to comply with applicable laws,ordinances,rules,regulations bearing on safety of persons or property or their protection from damage,injury or loss and designate a responsible person whose duty would be the prevention of accidents,in this case,gordon williams project supervisor,daniel williams.
plaintiff also argued that even under the rule of privette superior court cal th,d,privette,which limited a hirer liability to an independent contractor employees,hooker department of transportation,supra,cal th,d,provided the hirer could nonetheless be liable if its conduct affirmatively contributed to the injuries of the independent contractor employees.plaintiff argued that the defendants retained control over the worksite and failed to take necessary precautions by depressurizing the pipe,thereby contributing to his injuries.
in particular,plaintiff contended that did not have control of the water pressure in the pvc pipe,and therefore could not shut it off gordon williams could have shut the water off to the pvc pipe while the demolition was going on in the basement following the accident,gordon williams had difficulty shutting the water off,and after the accident placed a ball valve over the pipe to protect it the plans for the project only showed that the pipe was to remain,not that it would be pressurized plaintiff supervisor did not tell him how to do his job or that the pvc pipe would remain pressurized his supervisor only told him that pipes marked with red paint would not be demolished,not that they were pressurized,and the pipes in the area where he worked were not marked with red paint and he demolished the sewer pipe the way he had been trained to do.plaintiff proffered expert deposition testimony that the accident was the result of gordon williams failure to comply with custom and practice by shutting off the water before demolition began,and that damage to the pvc pipe was foreseeable.
the trial court granted defendants motion on the basis that defendants had fully delegated the task of providing a safe work environment to and they did not exercise any retained control in a manner that affirmatively contributed to plaintiff injuries.the court found regulation a did not impose a duty on defendants independent of the retained control theory of liability because plaintiff did not establish the regulation imposed a duty on defendants as opposed to,or that it was in fact necessary to relocate or shut off the pvc pipe under the circumstances.the court also sustained defendants objection to plaintiff expert deposition testimony on the grounds that no foundation had been laid either for the expert qualification as an expert or for his opinion 
discussion 
standard of review.
t he party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d.once the movant has met that burden,the burden shifts to the other party to show that a triable issue of one or more material facts exists as to that cause of action.code civ,subd.p aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.a triable issue of material fact exists where the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar,supra,cal th at,d.where summary judgment has been granted,we review the trial court decision de novo,considering all of the evidence the parties offered in connection with the motion except that which the trial court properly excluded and the uncontradicted inferences the evidence reasonably supports.merrill navegar,cal th,d.
ii.plaintiff can not establish that defendants retained control over the pvc pipe and affirmatively contributed to the accident.
plaintiff contends that defendants remained in sole control of the water pressure in the subject pipe before,during and after the accident,that this retained control affirmatively contributed to the accident,and that defendants were therefore liable.see hooker,supra,cal th,d.we disagree.
at common law,a person who hired an independent contractor generally was not liable to third parties for injuries caused by the contractor negligence in performing the work.privette,supra,cal th at,d.privette addressed one exception to the common law rule,the peculiar risk doctrine,under which the hirer of an independent contractor to perform inherently dangerous work could be liable for injury to others resulting from the contractor negligent performance of the work.id.at,d.privette held that the peculiar risk doctrine did not apply to employees of the independent contractor injured on the job because they could recover worker compensation for their injuries.id.at,d.i n the case of injury to an employee of an independent contractor,the worker scompensation system of recovery regardless of fault achieves the identical purposes that underlie recovery under the doctrine of peculiar risk.ibid.
subsequently,in toland sunland housing group,cal th,d,the court held that privette applies regardless of whether recovery is sought under the theory that the hirer failed to provide for special precautions in the contract rest d torts,or the hirer is liable for the contractor negligence in spite of providing in the contract that the contractor take special precautions rest d torts,in either situation,it would be unfair to impose liability on the hiring person when the liability of the contractor,the one primarily responsible for the worker injuries,is limited to providing worker compensation coverage.toland sunland housing group,supra,at,d.
in hooker,supra,cal th,d,the supreme court extended the rationale of privette to the doctrine of negligent exercise of retained control under restatement,torts,section following the rationale of privette that it would be unfair to impose liability on the hiring person when the contractor,the one primarily responsible for the worker injuries,is limited to providing worker compensation coverage,hooker concluded that the imposition of tort liability on a hirer should depend on whether the hirer exercised the control that was retained in a manner that affirmatively contributed to the injury of the contractor employee.hooker,supra,at,d.thus,although in the case before it,the plaintiff had established the defendant hirer retained control over safety conditions at the worksite,the plaintiff had not established that such retained control was exercised in a manner that affirmatively contributed to the plaintiff injuries.id.at,d.hooker pointed out that a hirer could be liable for omissions as well as affirmative conduct.there will be times when a hirer will be liable for its omissions.for example,if a hirer promises to undertake a particular safety measure,then the hirer negligent failure to do so should result in liability if such negligence leads to an employee injury.id.at,fn,d.
as noted in kinsman,a useful way to view the privette cases is in terms of delegation i n privette and its progeny,we have concluded that,principally because of the availability of worker compensation,the policy reasons for limiting do not apply to the hirer ability to delegate to an independent contractor the duty to provide the contractor employees with a safe working environment.kinsman,supra,cal th at,d.
here,plaintiff contends that defendants,who retained control over the pvc pipe,should have depressurized,rearranged,or relocated the pipe before the project began,or at least temporarily while demolition was taking place in the basement.in support of his arguments,plaintiff relies on ray silverado constructors th,d,in which the court found factual issues existed with respect to the issue of retained control.the plaintiff in ray was working on the construction of a bridge when high winds began to blow construction materials on the roadway,which had remained open.the plaintiff used his truck to block traffic while other workers helped him secure materials after clearing debris from traffic lanes,he was struck on the back of the head with a wood deck form and killed.id.at,d.his widow argued the general contractor should be liable because it retained control over the roadway,including the power to close it during construction,and failed to exercise that power.id.at,d.in particular,she pointed to contract provisions in which the general contractor agreed to take all necessary precautions to protect the traveling public from injuries.id.at,d.ray concluded this contractual provision constituted retained control.id.at,d.
on the issue of whether the general contractor failure to close the roadway affirmatively contributed to the decedent injuries,the ray court conducted a duty,breach and causation analysis.ray concluded that the general contractor had general duties to keep the roadway clear of hazards.however,issues of fact existed on breach and causation,namely whether the general contractor exercise of that retained control affirmatively contributed to the death of plaintiff decedent,including whether the general contractor knew of falling debris or whether high winds made falling debris foreseeable whether the general contractor had been requested by the subcontractor to barricade the street whether had the roadway been blocked,decedent would not have taken action in blocking it to make it safe for others.ray silverado constructors,supra,th at,d.
here,in contrast,plaintiff can not show defendants retention of control over the pvc pipe affirmatively contributed to his injuries although ultimately only defendants had the ability to physically turn off the pipe once the accident occurred,this control does not rise to the level of control necessary to impose liability under privette.under privette,defendants could and did delegate safety measures to.further,the evidence does not disclose that made any request to turn off the water which the defendants refused,or that defendants prevented from setting up an emergency valve on the pipe in the event of an accident.these facts distinguish this case from ray,where the general contractor retained complete control of the roadway.
iii.padilla can not establish triable issues of fact under regulation a.
plaintiff makes two arguments based upon regulation a.first,he contends that regulation a imposed a duty on defendants to depressurize the pvc pipe prior to demolition in the basement,and second,that defendants violation of regulation a established negligence per se.we conclude that under the circumstances,regulation a did not establish a duty on pomona or gordon williams,and that plaintiff can not establish negligence per se based upon the regulation.
plaintiff can not establish regulation a imposes a duty on defendants.
the duty doctrine addresses an affirmative duty imposed by reason of a person or entity relationship with others.such a duty can not be avoided by entrusting it to an independent contractor.felmlee falcon cable tv th,d.duties may arise when a statute provides specific safeguards or precautions to insure the safety of others.id.at,d see also rest d,torts,
