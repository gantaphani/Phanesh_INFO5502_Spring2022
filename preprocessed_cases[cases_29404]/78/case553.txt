introduction 
plaintiffs sued their employer for injuries they sustained from exposure to a hazardous chemical substance the employer gave them to clean a film processing lab.the trial court found that the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act wca barred plaintiffs independent civil action,and granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov.plaintiffs appeal.we affirm the grant of jnov.
we conclude that we are bound by products superior court cal d,hereafter,which holds that an employer concealment of known unsafe working conditions and violation of environmental safety regulations remain within the compensation bargain underlying the wca.therefore the wca provides the exclusive remedy for injuries caused by this employer conduct.we also conclude that the evidence does not support plaintiffs claim that a criminal battery occurred,because the employer did not use force or violence in employing plaintiffs to clean the film lab with hazardous chemicals.for the same reason,plaintiffs can not show the employer injured them by a willful physical assault.thus neither battery nor willful physical assault provides an exception to the wca exclusive remedy provision.we therefore affirm a judgment in favor of defendants.
we observe that the facts of this case reveal egregious misconduct by the employer,who failed to take steps to assure the safety of workers hired to use a dangerous chemical substance and concealed the danger from those employees.while we do not condone the employer misconduct,we feel constrained by,supra,cal d,whose holding we are required to follow.auto equity sales,superior court cal d.
ii.procedural history 
plaintiffs ross gunnell,james walters,and ronald cohen sued,among other defendants,metrocolor laboratories,metrocolor and warner brothers,time warner.their complaint included causes of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress,strict liability ultrahazardous activity,civil conspiracy,battery,and fraud.
the trial court granted various motions for summary judgment,summary adjudication,nonsuit,and directed verdict in favor of metrocolor and time warner.these rulings ended the case as to walters and cohen,and left battery as gunnell only cause of action to go to the jury.pursuant to instructions on the employer alleged willful physical assault,subd.b the court submitted this cause of action to the jury with directions to return a verdict on special issues.
the jury returned the following special verdict 
metrocolor specifically intended to injure gunnell.
gunnell did not consent to the contact with the harmful chemicals.
the contact with the chemicals caused injury to gunnell.
defendant willful physical assault caused gunnell in economic damages and in damages,for total damages of.
defendant was guilty of oppression,malice,and fraud in the conduct upon which the jury based its finding of liability for a willful physical assault.
punitive damages of should be assessed against metrocolor.
on gunnell motion,the court ruled that time warner had successor liability for his judgment against metrocolor.the trial court ordered judgment for in favor of gunnell and against metrocolor and time warner.metrocolor and time warner moved for jnov,arguing that the wca provided the exclusive remedy for gunnell injuries.based on,supra,cal d,the trial court found that the wca provided the exclusive remedy for toxic exposure injuries in the workplace,and granted jnov on the ground that section,subdivision a barred gunnell battery claim.
gunnell,walters,and cohen filed a timely notice of appeal.
although only gunnell case was submitted to the jury,the appeals of walters and cohen stem from the facts that underlie gunnell appeal.pursuant to the standard of review of a grant of a jnov see part v b of the discussion,post,the facts are as follows.
gunnell,walters,and cohen were unskilled laborers who belonged to local of the studio utility employees union.the union supplied laborers to film studios in the los angeles area.union laborers customarily performed work assisting carpenters as they built sets,dismantling sets after filming was completed,performing maintenance such as gardening and moving furniture,moving lumber,tools,and construction materials,and cleaning.in,gunnell,walters,and cohen worked for four and months at metrocolor laboratories,which owned a facility to process and develop television and movie film.the laborers assignment was to clean walls,pipes,and other parts of the interior of the film lab.gerald house,the safety and engineer project coordinator and program manager of metrocolor hazard communication program,generally supervised the cleaning of the metrocolor film lab,the project on which gunnell,walters,and cohen worked.david carrasco,metrocolor head of labor,directly supervised work done by gunnell,walters,cohen,and other union local workers.
metrocolor directed gunnell,walters,and cohen to clean the interior of the film lab with a substance they then believed to be cleaning soap.they filled mop buckets and sprayers with the solution from barrels.metrocolor provided no hazard training,posted no signs about chemical hazards,and never told the laborers what the barrels contained.none of the barrels of solution had labels warning of a chemical hazard or identifying the contents of the barrels.during delivery of the barrels of solution,gunnell observed his supervisor,carrasco,removing labels from each barrel before offloading them from a truck for use by gunnell and his in cleaning the facility.the barrels provided to the workers had no labels by the time the workers used them.at that time,gunnell believed the substance was harmless.charles bracey,who supervised gunnell work crew,testified that the substance in the barrels was referred to at metrocolor as green or blue strong soap.
cleaning the interior walls and ceiling of the metrocolor film lab exposed gunnell,walters,and cohen to the cleaning substance.gunnell transferred undiluted liquid from the barrels to buckets and sprayers.the workers sometimes did not dilute the substance before using it.gunnell sprayed the ceiling with the solution,causing dirt to bead.he then used a mop to remove the cleaner and dirt from the ceiling,usually repeating the procedure several times to clean each area.after cleaning the ceiling,he cleaned the walls,and finally cleaned floors and pipes.as he worked on the ceiling,the cleaning liquid rained down on him,making contact with his skin,running down his back and chest,and getting inside his gloves.pressing the mop against the ceiling and walls caused liquid to squeeze out of the mop and run down the handle into his sleeves,down his arms,and into his shirt.gunnell used several gallons of solution every day.after a day work,the solution soaked his clothing and feet.he remained wet until he arrived home.he worked in street clothes.metrocolor provided no protective gear except for rubber gloves,which disintegrated after about a of use,and a paper suit that did not protect gunnell from being soaked.
while working at metrocolor,gunnell did not recall ever being told what the cleaning substance was inside the barrels.no one told him about or required him to attend a safety program or a right to know program.no one trained him on how to handle chemicals.gunnell testified that on one occasion when he was working in clothing soaked with the substance,he saw house,carrasco,and fuhrmann director of facilities at metrocolor observe as he cleaned a room.gunnell asked if the substance was safe.house responded,yes,sir.yes,it is safe.walters foreman told him several times the cleaner was safe.
after finishing his work at metrocolor,gunnell learned that the substance provided for cleaning the lab was absorb,an organic.absorb contains sodium hydroxide and,known as.sodium hydroxide and appear on the osha director list of hazardous substances.is one of a class of chemicals known to cause brain and nervous system damage.absorbs readily through the skin and into the bloodstream.diluting causes it to absorb through skin more readily.once in the bloodstream,targets the liver,kidneys,respiratory tract,and central nervous system.its effects on the central nervous system include headaches,nausea,dizziness,confusion,loss of consciousness,and possible death.breathing vapor,combined with skin exposure,significantly increases exposure.workers using should avoid skin contact and wear gloves and possibly a respirator.
during four and months of using absorb,gunnell sustained injuries,which included a slowing of brain function anxiety and panic attacks concentration difficulties loss of cognitive functioning personality changes mood and temper problems respiratory problems and numbness.gunnell was classified as disabled from working as a laborer.plaintiffs toxicology and neuropsychology experts testified that exposure to at the metrocolor film lab,to a reasonable degree of medical probability,caused gunnell injuries.
the published portion of this opinion addresses several issues 
whether section,subdivision a provides the exclusive remedy for plaintiffs injuries and therefore bars this action 
whether the employer committed a criminal battery against plaintiffs and 
whether the employer committed a willful physical assault which entitles plaintiffs to claim the exception to the exclusive remedy provision in section,subdivision b.
the unpublished portion of this opinion addresses other issues.
discussion 
a.the trial court ruling granting jnov 
the defendants motion for jnov argued that the wca exclusive remedy provision in section,subdivision a barred gunnell civil action for damages.defendants more specifically contended that even if metrocolor intentionally exposed gunnell to a toxic substance and intentionally concealed its toxicity from gunnell,metrocolor conduct did not constitute a willful physical assault that would entitle gunnell to claim the exception to the exclusive remedy provision in section,subdivision b.we quote relevant parts of section,infra.
the trial court found that and related cases held that the wca provided the exclusive remedy for toxic exposure injuries in the workplace,and that gunnell battery claim did not come within the exception in section,subdivision b.therefore the trial court granted jnov.
b.the standard of review of the grant of a jnov 
on appeal from a judgment for the defendant notwithstanding the verdict,ordinarily an appellate court will use the same standard the trial court uses to rule on the motion.the court will determine whether the record,viewed most favorably to the party securing the verdict,contains any substantial evidence supporting the verdict.here,however,the issues presented deal solely with the application of a statute to the facts supporting the verdict.thus the issue before this court is a question of law whether,under the facts as determined by the jury verdict,the exclusive remedy provision of the wca does or does not bar gunnell action.we review this question of law de novo.see trujillo north county transit dist.th,d.
workers compensation provides the exclusive remedy for an employer concealment of known unsafe workplace conditions 
the exclusive remedy provision in section,subdivision a and the workers compensation bargain 
in determining whether a wca exclusivity provision bars a cause of action against an employer,the initial question is whether the alleged injury falls within the scope of the exclusive remedy provision.section,subdivision a sets forth the exclusive remedy provision applicable in this appeal.it states,in relevant part 
a where the conditions of compensation set forth in section concur,the right to recover such compensation is,except as specifically provided in this section and sections and,the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer.
thus section requires the conditions of compensation set forth in section to concur.section,subdivision a states,in part,that l iability for the compensation provided by this division,in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person except as otherwise specifically provided in sections,and,shall,without regard to negligence,exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur 
where,at the time of the injury,the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment.
where the injury is proximately caused by the employment,either with or without negligence.
thus a precondition for applying section,subdivision a is that the employee must sustain the injury arising out of and in the course of the employment,the injury must proximately cause the injury,and at the time of the injury the employee must be performing service growing out of and incidental to the employment and must be acting within the course of the employment.
section,subdivision a,reflects a compensation bargain that underlies this exclusive remedy provision of the wca.pursuant to this compensation bargain,the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.shoemaker myers cal d.the employee,without having to prove fault,receives relatively swift and certain benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury.in exchange,the employee gives up the wider range of civil tort damages potentially available.ibid.
plaintiffs briefing on appeal at times appears to define the compensation bargain with reference to the collective bargaining agreement between the plaintiffs union and metrocolor,or with reference to what gunnell and the other plaintiffs believed their employment with metrocolor would or would not include.such a definition mischaracterizes the compensation bargain.the compensation bargain does not refer to a particular employment or to the parties subjective expectations about particular employment.the compensation bargain is a presumed and theoretical bargain that forms the underlying premise behind this statutorily created system of workers compensation.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d.the compensation bargain defined in shoemaker myers,supra,cal d at page,is the one that has relevance in assessing whether section,subdivision a does or does not apply.
the question is whether gunnell injuries,caused by chemicals metrocolor supplied for the work he was hired to perform,resulted from employer conduct that remains inside,or falls outside,the compensation bargain.
controls this appeal 
the facts in this appeal closely parallel those in,supra,cal d.in,the employer mined,milled,manufactured,and packaged asbestos.working in a plant for years continually exposed plaintiff rudkin to asbestos,which caused him to develop pneumoconiosis,lung cancer,or other illnesses.since,had known that long exposure to or ingestion of asbestos was dangerous to health,but the company concealed this knowledge from rudkin.advised rudkin it was safe to work in close proximity to asbestos,failed to provide him with adequate protective devices,and did not operate the plant in accordance with state and federal regulations governing dust levels.also retained unqualified doctors to examine rudkin,did not provide the doctors with adequate information about the risk of asbestos exposure,and did not inform the doctors that exposure to asbestos while he worked at the plant caused rudkin pulmonary disease.finally,willfully failed to file a first report of occupational injury or illness with the state of california regarding rudkin injury as required by law.if had made this filing and revealed the danger from asbestos,rudkin would have been protected.performed these acts and omissions falsely and fraudulently,with intent to induce rudkin to continue to work in a dangerous environment.rudkin was ignorant of the risks involved,and would not have continued to work in such an environment if he had known the facts.rudkin complaint alleged causes of action for fraud and conspiracy with others to perpetrate these acts.answer alleged that the wca exclusive remedy provision barred the action,supra,cal d at.
concluded that the wca,in section was designed to penalize an employer intentional misconduct and to compensate injuries resulting from such acts,supra,cal d at.in this connection,held that workers compensation provided the exclusive remedy for injuries suffered because the employer made false representations about,or concealed dangers inherent in,a material employees were required to handle.id.at.workers compensation also provided the exclusive remedy for injuries caused by an employer malicious misconduct in allowing an employee to use a machine without proper instruction.ibid.where an employer knows a danger to an employee exists but fails to take corrective action or warn the employee of the risk,s uch conduct may be characterized as intentional or even deceitful.yet if an action at law were allowed as a remedy,many cases cognizable under workers compensation would also be prosecuted outside that system.the focus of the inquiry in a case involving injury would often be not whether the injury arose out of and in the course of employment,but the state of knowledge of the employer and the employee regarding the dangerous condition which caused the injury.such a result would undermine the underlying premise upon which the workers compensation system is based.id.at.
to permit an action at law for damages for any intentional misconduct by an employer would significantly disturb the compensation bargain upon which the wca is based.s ection is the sole remedy for additional compensation against an employer whose employee is injured in the first instance as the result of a deliberate failure to assure that the physical environment of the work place is safe.thus,if the complaint alleged only that plaintiff contracted the disease because defendant knew and concealed from him that his health was endangered by asbestos in the work environment,failed to supply adequate protective devices to avoid disease,and violated governmental regulations relating to dust levels at the plant,plaintiff only remedy would be to prosecute his claim under the workers compensation law,supra,cal d at.
this holding governs the case at bench.gunnell claims metrocolor deceived and defrauded him by not revealing that absorb was unsafe to use in the employment,assured gunnell that absorb was safe to use,did not provide adequate gloves,clothing,or other protective gear,did not provide training in using and handling of absorb,removed warning labels from absorb containers,and violated government safety regulations regarding use of absorb and warnings to employees about its toxic chemical properties.under,an injury to an employee caused by an employer deceit and concealment of hazardous substances used in the employment,failure to train,and failure to assure a safe workplace environment remains within the course of employment.thus confines gunnell remedies to those provided by the wca.
cases decided since affirm that where the employer conduct giving rise to the plaintiff claim arises out of and in the course of the employment,the wca remains the exclusive remedy,notwithstanding an employer knowing failure to assure that the workplace is safe vuillemainroy american rock asphalt,th,d williams international paper d.stalnaker boeing d.or the employer fraud,deceit,or concealment of a dangerous condition united states borax chemical superior court d.spratley winchell donut house,d.
it is true that williams,stalnaker,and spratley found that the employer did not specifically intend to injure the plaintiff.williams international paper,supra,d at.stalnaker boeing,supra,d at.spratley winchell donut house,supra,d at.in this appeal,the jury special verdict found that metrocolor specifically intended to injure gunnell.we conclude,however,that metrocolor intentional misconduct did not go beyond its failure to assure that the substances used by the employee or the physical environment were safe.there is no meaningful factual distinction between this case and the facts of.therefore the workers compensation act provides gunnell remedy,and he can not maintain a civil action against metrocolor,supra,cal d at.we conclude that requires affirmance of the grant of jnov.
no criminal battery occurred 
gunnell claims that metrocolor committed a criminal battery on the plaintiffs,and therefore argues,pursuant to fermino fedco,cal th,d,that section does not bar his independent civil suit for damages.
certain types of injurious employer misconduct remain outside the compensation bargain and thus beyond the coverage of the wca.fermino fedco,supra,cal th at,d.in some instances,even though an injury arises in the course of employment,an employer engaging in misconduct steps out of its proper role or engages in conduct of questionable relationship to the employment.ibid.fermino addressed the relationship between such intentional employer torts and workers compensation.
unlike many other states,in california workers compensation provides the exclusive remedy for at least some intentional torts committed by an employer.fermino fedco,supra,cal th at,d.fermino described a tripartite system for classifying injuries arising in the course of employment.first,there are injuries caused by employer negligence or without employer fault that are compensated at the normal rate under the workers compensation system.second,there are injuries caused by ordinary employer conduct that intentionally,knowingly or recklessly harms an employee,for which the employee may be entitled to extra compensation under section.third,there are certain types of intentional employer conduct which bring the employer beyond the boundaries of the compensation bargain,for which a civil action may be brought.cal th at,d.
gunnell argues that a criminal battery fits within the third fermino category of intentional employer misconduct and because criminal battery therefore falls outside the compensation bargain,section,subdivision a does not apply.thus the question is whether gunnell injuries,caused by chemicals metrocolor supplied for the work he was hired to perform,resulted from injurious employer misconduct that remains inside,or falls outside,the compensation bargain.
fermino held that the plaintiff stated a cause of action for false imprisonment and that false imprisonment committed by an employer against an employee was always outside the scope of the compensation bargain.fermino fedco,supra,cal th at,d.because the intentional tort of false imprisonment involves criminal conduct against the employee person,it is not a normal part of the employment relationship and lies outside the compensation bargain.id.at.fermino qualifies this statement,however,by saying that regulatory crimes,such as violations of health and safety standards or special orders,remain within the normal course of employment and within the wca.id.at,fn,d,citing,supra,cal d at.
in language relied on by gunnell,this part of the fermino opinion continues what we hold today,rather,is that those classes of intentional employer crimes against the employee person by means of violence and coercion,such as those crimes numerated in part,title of the penal code,violate the employee reasonable expectations and transgress the limits of the compensation bargain.fermino fedco,supra,cal th at,fn,d.
gunnell argues that metrocolor committed a criminal battery in violation of penal code section,a crime described in part,title of the penal code.gunnell cites the jury findings that metrocolor specifically intended to injure gunnell,who did not consent to contact with the harmful chemicals that caused his injuries,and that in committing a battery on gunnell,metrocolor acted with oppression,malice,and fraud.
penal code section states a battery is any willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.a battery can not be accomplished without a touching of the victim.people jackson th,d.the issue in this appeal,however,is not whether a touching occurred.it is whether the touching occurred through metrocolor use of force or violence.
although the force used need not be violent or severe and need not cause pain or bodily harm,some force or violence must be used for a battery to occur.people rocha cal d,fn.battery requires a vi
