introduction 
plaintiff and appellant,james mason mason,was rendered a paraplegic after he rode down a water slide and crashed into the dam at the end of the slide.the accident occurred at a water park owned and operated by mason employer,defendant and respondent,lake dolores group,llc ldg.shortly before the accident,mason reported to work,but did not clock in.at the time of the accident,the park was closed and the water slide was turned off,but mason instructed another employee to turn the water slide on.an insufficient amount of water pooled in the runout lane at the end of the slide,causing the accident and mason injuries.
mason sued ldg,alleging negligence.a jury found ldg negligent,and apportioned fault percent to ldg,percent to mason,and percent to unnamed others.the jury also found that mason was not acting in the course and scope of his employment when he was injured.thus,the jury rejected ldg claim that the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule barred mason negligence action.a judgment was entered in favor of mason and against ldg.after offsets,the amount of the judgment was.
ldg moved for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict jnov and,alternatively,a new trial,on the ground mason negligence action was barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule,ldg affirmative defense,subd.a.the trial court granted ldg motions solely on this ground,and entered judgment in favor of ldg.
in a statement of decision,the trial court noted that the pertinent facts were not in dispute.it also noted that the facts were quite similar to those in state comp.ins.fund workmen comp.app.bd.cardoza cal d,state comp.there,the court held that workers compensation benefits were payable to an employee under the personal comfort doctrine.id.at.based on state,the trial court ruled that mason negligence action was barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule therefore,it entered the jnov in favor of ldg.
mason appeals from the jnov and alternative order granting a new trial.he contends that in granting the motions,the trial court erroneously concluded that his negligence action against ldg was barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule,subd.a.we agree.
we conclude that substantial evidence supports the jury finding that mason was not acting in the course of his employment when he was injured.thus,the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule did not bar mason negligence action against ldg,subd.c.mason was not entitled to workers compensation benefits for his injuries,because his injuries did not arise out of nor occur in the course of his employment,subd.a.accordingly,we reverse the jnov and alternative order granting a new trial,and remand the matter with directions to reinstate the judgment previously entered in favor of mason.
facts and procedural history 
mason began working for ldg shortly after the park opened in.the park opened at mason usually worked from to as a pool tech for the park water rides.his duties included cleaning out leaves and grates,checking chlorine levels,turning on pumps,and similar tasks.he also performed general maintenance work,including raking leaves,disposing of garbage,cleaning restrooms,and cement work.
the accident occurred on may,when mason was years old.that day,mason reported to work at and was told he would be moving chairs and tables for a jet ski competition.he performed these tasks until noon.he was then told he could go home and return to work at to clean up after the jet ski competition and complete his shift.mason went home,and returned about with another employee,michael smith.at that time,the park was closed.
as mason and michael smith entered the park,the person in charge of security asked them to help others take down a flag.they did so,although they had not clocked in.it took seven to nine minutes to take down the flag.mason then went to the doo wop super drop water slide,and asked another employee,raymond smith,to turn the slide on.raymond smith did so.the slide had been turned off for about minutes.mason had still not clocked in.
mason was wearing a swimming suit under his clothes.at the bottom of the stairs to the slide,mason talked to michael smith and another employee as he removed his clothes,and told them he would meet them at the bottom of the slide to get his clothes.no other employees joined mason to ride the slide.there were no attendants at the top or bottom of the slide.it was to degrees outside.
mason climbed the or steps to the top of the slide.from there,he waited a minute or two to watch the water come out of the doo wop super drop and two other slides that operated from the same pump and platform.he saw water in the runout lane about feet below,and said the runout lane appeared to be full.he believed a sufficient amount of time had passed to allow the runout lane to fill with water,and he went down the slide.near the bottom of the slide,he realized he was not stopping as quickly as he should.he lifted his neck to see where he was going,and hit the dam at the end of the slide.afterward,he remembered saying something like his legs did not work.
michael smith said he saw mason fly down the slide.he said,you could hear his hands trying to stop himself,like skidding and then his feet barely made it over the lip and his tailbone just mashed it,and he flew in the air and landed right on his back.mason said he went down the doo wop super drop because i t was the fastest and it was my favorite.he also said he used the slide because it was hot,the slide was fun,and the slide was always crowded during park hours.
the park general manager,grant lloyd lloyd,saw mason lying on the concrete and thought it was a joke because it was unexpected that anyone would be riding the ride.another employee who was present when mason went down the slide thought mason request to turn the slide on was unusual because u sually employees did ride the slides especially without upper management permission 
mason did not have permission from any supervisor to go down the slide.raymond smith was either suspended or fired for turning the slide on for mason.according to one of the park managers,terry christensen christensen,that was policy.he raymond smith was gone.
christensen also testified that no one was to use the slides if they were turned off for the day.it was park policy that employees could use the slides only if they were off duty and the slides were open to the public.christensen testified,it costs a lot of money to turn on a slide.those pumps burn up a lot of electricity.you do turn them on to play with them.he said,it would be foolish to turn a ride on for one turn to take a ride down the hill.
the park director of operations,amy alexander,testified that pool technicians,including mason,did not have authority to turn the slides on after the park was closed.instead,pool technicians were authorized to turn the slides on before the park opened and turn them off when the park closed.
the employee manual said that employees were to immediately report any unsafe conditions to a supervisor.mason testified that if he noticed a safety problem with a slide,including an interruption in the flow of water on a slide,he would call his supervisor.lloyd testified that pool technicians were encouraged to ride or test the slides,before the park opened,if they saw a rooster tail or similar problem in the flow of water on a slide.
mason and ldg presented conflicting testimony on whether mason injury arose out of and occurred in the course of his employment,within the meaning of the workers compensation laws,subd.a.the park employee manual stated,neither lake dolores nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of worker compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee voluntary participation in any recreation,social or athletic activity sponsored by the lake dolores resort.
mason applied for workers compensation benefits.he signed an application stating that his injuries occurred while he was testing the water slide.the application was denied,and mason did not further pursue the matter.at trial,mason denied he was testing the slide when he was injured,and denied he told anyone he was testing the slide.he said he did not become aware of the wording on the application until about two months before trial.he also said he did not perform any pool technician work on the day he was injured.
before trial,ldg moved for summary judgment on the ground mason negligence action was barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule.mason opposed the motion on the ground there were triable issues of fact concerning whether he was acting within the course and scope of his employment at the time he was injured.the motion was denied.
ldg then petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing that its motion for summary judgment be granted.we denied the writ petition in lake dolores group,llc super.april,nonpub.opn.we said,this case is not appropriate for summary adjudication and the issue of whether the injury occurred during the course and scope of mason employment should be left to the jury.the petition for writ of mandate and request for stay is denied.
after mason rested his case,ldg moved for a nonsuit on workers compensation exclusivity grounds.in denying the motion,the trial court observed,the appellate court,when it sent it back said,t his is a fact that should be heard by the jury,unless conflicting evidence,and there is conflicting evidence about the policy that who believed he was in,who believed he was out.it all over the place.
the trial court later denied ldg motion for a directed verdict on the ground there were triable issues of fact for the jury to determine.after the jury found ldg negligent and percent at fault for mason injuries,the trial court granted ldg motion for jnov and,alternatively,a new trial,on the ground that mason negligence action was barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule.
discussion 
standard of review 
on an appeal from a jnov,we ordinarily use the same standard the trial court used in granting the jnov.we independently determine whether the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict,contains any substantial evidence to support the verdict.if substantial evidence supports the verdict,the trial court erred in granting the jnov and we reverse.paykar construction,spilat construction th,d begnal canfield associates,th,d.and,where the issue presented deals solely with the application of a statute to the facts supporting the jury verdict,it is a question of law which we review de novo.gunnell metrocolor laboratories,th,d.
the trial court granted the jnov solely on the ground that mason negligence action was barred by the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule,subd.a.in so ruling,the trial court reasoned that the relevant facts were undisputed,and that mason was acting in the course of his employment when he was injured,as a matter of law.whether an employee injury arose out of and in the course of his or her employment is generally a question of fact to be determined in light of the circumstances of the particular case.citations.however,where the facts are undisputed,resolution of the question becomes a matter of law.citations.wright beverly fabrics,th,d.
mason contends that substantial evidence supports the jury finding that he was not acting in the course of his employment when he was injured ldg contends that the trial court ruling was correct and that the relevant facts are undisputed.we agree with mason that substantial evidence supports the jury finding that he was not acting in the course of his employment when he was injured.we therefore conclude that the worker compensation exclusive remedy rule did not bar mason negligence action against ldg.
accordingly,the jnov must be reversed.the order granting a new trial must also be reversed,because it was based solely on the same ground as the order granting the jnov.in granting the motion for a new trial,the trial court reasoned that the verdict was contrary to law.where,as here,a trial court in granting a new trial based its order exclusively upon an erroneous concept of legal principles applicable to the cause,its order will be reversed.citation.maher saad th,d accord,treber superior court cal d,see also in re coordinated latex glove litigation th,d order granting alternative motion for new trial moot where based solely on same legal issue as order granting jnov.
because ldg has failed to file a protective,reinstatement of the judgment in favor of mason will automatically be final.bank of america cal d.this appeal is limited to the issue of whether the trial court erred in granting the jnov and alternative order for a new trial.we are not reviewing whether,for example,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that ldg was negligent.
b.the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule does not bar mason negligence action 
subject to statutory exceptions not applicable here,an injured employee sole and exclusive remedy against his employer is the right to recover workers compensation benefits,provided the conditions of compensation set forth in section concur,subd.a wright beverly fabrics,supra,th at,d.if any of these conditions do not exist,the employee may bring a civil action against the employer,subd.c lenk,th,d.
t he legal theory supporting the workers compensation exclusive remedy provisions is a presumed compensation bargain,pursuant to which the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.citations.the function of the exclusive remedy provisions is to give efficacy to the theoretical compensation bargain.shoemaker myers cal d.
section,subdivision a,sets forth the terms of the compensation bargain.it states,in relevant part 
a liability for the compensation provided by this division shall,without regard to negligence,exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur 
where,at the time of the injury,the employee is performing service growing out of and incidental to his or her employment and is acting within the course of his or her employment.
where the injury is proximately caused by the employment,either with or without negligence.
where the injury does not arise out of voluntary participation in any recreational,social,or athletic activity not constituting part of the employee duties,except where these activities are a reasonable expectancy of,or are expressly or impliedly required by,the employment,subd.a,italics added.
mason injuries did not arise out of nor occur in the course of his employment within the meaning of section,subdivision a 
our state supreme court has observed that t he requirement of section is twofold.on the one hand,the injury must occur in the course of the employment.this concept ordinarily refers to the time,place,and circumstances under which the injury occurs.citation.thus a n employee is in the course of his employment when he does those reasonable things which his contract with his employment expressly or impliedly permits him to do.citation.and,ipso facto,an employee acts within the course of his employment when performing a duty imposed upon him by his employer and one necessary to perform before the terms of the contract are mutually satisfied.citation.latourette workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,latourette.
on the other hand,the statute requires that an injury arise out of the employment it has long been settled that for an injury to arise out of the employment it must occur by reason of a condition or incident of the employment citation.that is,the employment and the injury must be linked in some causal fashion.citation.latourette,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.the phrase arise out of employment refers to a causal connection between the employment and the injury.atascadero unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,italics added.
the test for whether an injury arises out of the employment was long ago stated as follows if the particular act is reasonably contemplated by the employment,injuries received while performing it arise out of the employment,and are compensable.in determining whether a particular act is reasonably contemplated by the employment the nature of the act,the nature of the employment,the custom and usage of a particular employment,the terms of the contract of employment,and perhaps other factors should be considered.latourette,supra,cal th at,d,quoting pacific indem.acc.com.cal d,italics added.
section,subdivision a and essentially restate the arising out of and in the course of requirements of section,subdivision a.the performance of services or activities growing out of and incidental to the employment may be said to arise out of the employment,subd.a.additionally,the proximate cause requirement of section,subdivision a has been interpreted as merely elaborating on the general requirement that the injury arise out of the employment.maher workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,fn.
mason injury did not arise out of nor occur in the course of his employment.substantial evidence showed that he was not testing the water slides for ldg at the time he was injured.to the extent that pool technicians were called upon to test the slides,it was only in the morning before the park opened.at the time mason was injured,he was supposed to be helping other employees clean the park after the jet ski competition.the evidence also showed that ldg had expressly prohibited all of its employees,including mason,from using the water slides after the park was closed and the slides had been turned off for the day.
thus,the jury could have reasonably concluded mason use of the water slide was not reasonably contemplated by nor causally connected to his employment or his employment duties.he was not performing a service growing out of and incidental to his employment at the time he was injured,subd.a.nor was he doing any of those reasonable things which his contract with his employment expressly or impliedly permit ted him to do.latourette,supra,cal th at,d.
we are mindful of the statutory requirement that the workers compensation laws shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.this command governs all aspects of workers compensation it applies to factual as well as statutory construction.citations.thus,i f a provision in the workers compensation laws may be reasonably construed to provide coverage or payments,that construction should usually be adopted even if another reasonable construction is possible.citation.the rule of liberal construction is not altered because a plaintiff believes that he can establish negligence on the part of his employer and brings a civil suit for damages.citation.it requires that we liberally construe the laws in favor of awarding work ers compensation,not in permitting civil litigation.citation.citations.arriaga county of alameda cal th,d.
here,however,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that mason injuries did not occur in the course of his employment.accordingly,the conditions of the compensation bargain set forth in section,subdivision a,did not concur.it follows that the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule did not bar mason negligence action against ldg,subd.c.
ldg reliance on price workers comp.appeals.bd.cal d,is misplaced.there,an employee arrived early at work but was unable to gain access to his employer premises.as the employee waited,he was struck by a passing motorist while putting a quart of oil into his car.id.at.in view of the rule of liberal construction,the price court held that the employee was entitled to workers compensation benefits.id.at.it reasoned that the employee early arrival was a benefit to the employer,and that his waiting outside the employer premises was reasonably contemplated by the employment.id.at.here,however,mason use of the water slide was not beneficial to ldg.nor was it reasonably contemplated by his employment.
mason injuries were not a reasonable expectancy of his employment within the meaning of section,subdivision a 
section,subdivision a,excludes from the compensation bargain injuries that arise out of voluntary participation in any recreational,social,or athletic activity not constituting part of the employee duties,except where these activities are a reasonable expectancy of,or are expressly or impliedly required by,the employment,subd.a,italics added.
ldg argues that mason was not at the time he was injured,because the evidence showed he had reported to work and had helped other employees take down a flag shortly before he used the water slide.mason argues that he was participating in an recreational activity at the time he was injured,and that his use of the water slide was not a reasonable expectancy of,nor expressly or impliedly required by,his employment.
we conclude that regardless of whether mason was at the time he was injured,his use of the water slide was not a reasonable expectancy of his employment.nor was it an activity that was expressly or impliedly required by his employment.in fact,ldg had expressly prohibited mason use of the water slide at the time he was injured.
the reasonable expectancy requirement of section,subdivision a,is identical to the arising out of and in the course of requirements of subdivision a as one court has noted,the question of reasonable expectancy is but a subset of the ultimate the applicant injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.ezzy,supra,d at.
section,subdivision a,applies only to certain activities,recreational,social,or athletic activities,whereas subdivision a apply to all activities,including those covered by subdivision a.thus,the ultimate test for whether an injury is covered by the compensation bargain is not whether it occurred while the employee was,but whether it arose out of and in the course of the employment.
in applying section,subdivision a,courts have focused on whether the activity arose out of and in the course of the employment,or whether the activity was a reasonable expectancy of the employment,not whether the activity occurred.the ezzy court explained that an injury is not excluded from the compensation bargain under subdivision a if the employee subjectively believed that the employer expected the employee to participate in the recreational,social,or athletic activity,and the employee belief was objectively reasonable.ezzy,supra,d at.the effect of this test is to recognize only expectations which are objectively reasonable.ibid.
in ezzy,a law clerk sustained an injury while playing softball on her firm softball team.the ezzy court concluded that the injury was compensable,because the evidence showed that the employee reasonably believed her employer expected her to play on the team.ezzy,supra,d at.
similarly,in gonzalez workers comp.appeals bd.d,the court concluded that a police detective was entitled to workers compensation benefits for injuries he sustained while playing softball.id.at.the detective participated in the softball game with the consent of his supervisor and while he was on standby duty.while on standby duty,he was paid percent of his regular salary,was required to be available by telephone or radio,and was required to be in such mental and physical condition and in such proximity to his assigned vehicle as to be able to respond to a call within a reasonable time.ibid.the court thus concluded that the detective injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.the court reasoned that the employer substantially controlled the detective activities while he was on standby duty,and that there was therefore a causal connection between the detective injury and his employment.id.at.see also hughes aircraft workers comp.appeals bd.d,and fn.recreational injuries must be work related.
but in todd,the court concluded that an employee was not entitled to workers compensation benefits for injuries he sustained while playing basketball during his lunch break and on his employer premises,because the employee par
