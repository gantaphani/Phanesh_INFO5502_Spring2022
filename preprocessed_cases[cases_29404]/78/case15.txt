petitioners bath iron works corporation and onebeacon collectively,biw seek review of an unpublished decision and order of the united states department of labor benefits review board brb or board which upheld the determination of an administrative law judge alj that gertrude knight is entitled to workers compensation benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,for the death of her husband william due to cancer.biw insists that both the alj and the board erred when they concluded that knight claim for benefits had been timely presented.after a careful review of the record,we affirm the board decision and deny the petition for review.
william knight worked at biw shipyard in bath,maine,from september through january while william job responsibilities varied over the decades,his duties for much of his tenure included the cutting,handling,and installation of asbestos insulation.even when he was not directly working with asbestos,he labored in close proximity to other employees who were.in,however,he ceased working with products.seven years later,in,william retired from biw at the age of.
william enjoyed a normal retirement until ten years later when,in early,he fell ill with pain in his abdomen.in april of that year he went to see his family physician who documented william weight loss,loss of appetite,night sweats,and a questionable ct scan.the family physician,in turn,referred william to a surgeon for further evaluation and a series of tests.first,an mri of the liver uncovered a suspicious mass.next,an esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed nothing remarkable in the esophagus,stomach,or duodenum.a subsequent chest showed no abnormality of the lungs.a laparoscopy conducted on may,however,uncovered widespread carcinomatosis throughout the abdominal area.this untreatable cancer led to a rapid decline in william health,and he died less than three months later.his death certificate listed as the cause of death adenocarcinoma,primary unknown of mos.duration.
three years later,in october,william widow gertrude filed a claim for compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,the act.she sought death and funeral benefits,see id,as well as compensation for william unpaid medical expenses,see id.biw controverted the claim,and the matter was eventually referred to an alj for adjudication.a hearing was held in november,at which only gertrude testified.at the hearing and in written submissions to the alj,biw argued that gertrude claim was untimely since it was filed over three years after william death,in contravention of the statute of limitations for death benefits due to occupational disease.see id.b.gertrude responded by averring that she first learned of a causal link between william death,asbestos,and his employment in august therefore,she argued,she had complied with the statute of limitations.see id.indicating that claim is timely if filed within two years after the employee or claimant becomes aware,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice should have been aware,of the relationship between the employment,the disease,and the death or disability.
in may,the alj issued a detailed decision and order rejecting biw argument on the statute of limitations defense and awarding benefits to gertrude after reciting the facts as he found them,he concluded that gertrude had no reason to believe,much less suspect,that there existed a relationship between her husband disease,his death,and his employment until august.he also concluded that there was no basis for finding that gertrude should have been aware that her husband death was the result of his exposure to asbestos at the shipyard.he awarded death benefits to gertrude totaling per week,reimbursement for william funeral and unpaid medical expenses,interest,and attorneys fees.
on appeal,the brb affirmed.in its unpublished,per curiam decision,the board concluded that the alj had thoroughly weighed the evidence of record,and rationally relied on claimant credible testimony,in finding that she did not become aware of the relationship between her husband disease,death,and employment,until.it indicated that under the act,it is presumed that claimant notice of injury and claim for benefits were timely filed,and that the burden was on biw to demonstrate that the claim was untimely.see b.after briefly surveying the facts as found by the alj,the board concluded that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence,and therefore affirmed.this petition for review ensued.
the only issue in this appeal is the propriety of the alj application of the act relevant statute of limitations,which provides in pertinent part 
a claim for compensation for death or disability due to an occupational disease which does not immediately result in such death or disability shall be timely if filed within two years after the employee or claimant becomes aware,or in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice should have been aware,of the relationship between the employment,the disease,and the death or disability 
b.this subsection creates a discovery rule of accrual,deferring the commencement of the statute of limitations until an employee or claimant has or should have an awareness of the relationship between the employment,the disease,and the death or disability.id.
biw focuses on one phrase in the statute in the exercise of reasonable diligence or by reason of medical advice should have been aware biw concedes that the alj made sufficient factual findings to support his conclusion that gertrude could not have been aware by reason of medical advice of any relationship between william death and asbestos exposure.biw maintains,however,that the alj failed to make detailed factual findings concerning gertrude exercise of reasonable diligence.this failure,according to biw,constitutes legal error mandating reversal.moreover,biw insists that gertrude should have suspected enough about the of her husband death to have conducted an investigation and filed a claim shortly after his death.biw urges us to rule as a matter of law that no reasonable fact finder could have concluded otherwise,and that the board therefore erred when it affirmed the decision of the alj.see id.b the findings of fact in the decision under review by the board shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.
the scope of our review of the board affirmance is constrained by our precedent.we examine the record for material errors of law or for impermissible departure from the familiar substantial evidence rubric in connection with the board assessment of the hearing officer factual findings.barker of labor,cir see bath iron works brown,cir indicating that we review the brb decision on legal issues de novo and determine whether the board adhered to the substantial evidence standard when it reviewed the alj factual findings bath iron works white,cir see also sun shipbuilding dry dock mccabe,cir case law has established that this court is to review the decisions of the benefits review board for errors of law,and to make certain that the brb adhered to the substantial evidence provision of b.
the board held that the alj applied the correct legal standard in ruling on the statute of limitations question.this presents a pure question of law that we,like the board,will review de novo.see old ben coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir a failure by the alj to apply the correct legal standard presents a question of law which we review de novo.our review of the alj application of the correct standard is another matter.courts reviewing the application of subsection a of have indicated that it is a determination subject to deferential review for example,the fourth circuit in newport news shipbldg.dry dock parker,cir,affirmed the brb reversal of an alj finding that the claimant should have been aware of his latent disability.the fourth circuit held that there was no substantial evidence to support the alj decision.id.at.
other courts have also used the substantial evidence standard in reviewing a determinations.see,paducah marine ways thompso
