introduction 
plaintiff dwight green worked for defendant,the state of california,as a stationary engineer at a correctional facility for over years before he was placed on disability retirement.the jury found that,in failing to provide plaintiff with reasonable accommodation for his hepatitis c,defendant discriminated against plaintiff in violation of the fair employment and housing act the feha,et the jury awarded plaintiff in economic damages and in noneconomic damages,which the court reduced to.
in challenging the jury verdict,defendant raises the following claims the jury verdict was not supported by the evidence the decision of the workers compensation judge barred plaintiff disability discrimination claim the court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of the workers compensation appeals board the appeals board proceeding and the testimony of alvin markovitz,the qualified medical examiner for the administrative proceeding the court erred in instructing the jury on the elements of the prima facie case and the defenses and the award of in noneconomic damages was excessive.in his,plaintiff claims the trial court exceeded its authority in reducing the noneconomic damages and abused its discretion in denying the requested amount of attorneys fees.
defendant challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence and the instructions require that we decide whether the trial court correctly placed upon defendant the burden of establishing that plaintiff was incapable of performing his essential functions with reasonable accommodations,as required under section,subdivision a.we conclude that it was defendant burden to prove plaintiff incapacity as an affirmative defense and not plaintiff burden to prove his capacity to perform as part of his prima facie case.based on this conclusion,there was substantial evidence to support the jury finding of disability discrimination.
as to defendant evidentiary claims,we conclude that the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not apply because the workers compensation proceeding involved a disability discrimination claim under labor code section,instead of a discrimination claim under the feha.the court,therefore,properly excluded evidence of the administrative proceeding and markovitz testimony.for the reasons provided below,we reject defendant remaining claims.
in regards to plaintiff,we agree that the trial court had no sua sponte authority to grant the motion for new trial on excessive damages.we disagree,however,with plaintiff contention that the court abused its discretion in refusing to award in attorney fees.
we affirm the judgment,but reverse the trial court ruling on the motion for new trial.the trial court must reinstate the judgment following the jury verdict.
factual and procedural history 
plaintiff began working for the state of california in and specifically for the california institute of men the institute as a stationary engineer in a stationary engineer duties included the maintenance and repair of boilers,air conditioners,refrigerators,and other equipment and mechanical systems.in performing these duties,the stationary engineer supervised and worked with a crew of inmates.the stationary engineer also conducted searches and assisted the guards in preventing injury and escape.
plaintiff first discovered that he had hepatitis c in.plaintiff presumably contracted the disease while working on the sewer pipes at the institute.despite his condition,plaintiff continued performing his duties as a stationary engineer.
throughout his employment at the institute,there were no prior complaints concerning plaintiff work performance.instead,plaintiff received letters of commendation.george woods,who supervised plaintiff from to,found plaintiff to be one of his best stationary engineers,capable of performing all of his required job duties.
in,plaintiff physician,james wang,began to treat plaintiff with a drug called interferon or infergen,which is a specific type of interferon.a single course of treatment required injections three times a week for a period.as a result of the injections,plaintiff began to experience certain side effects,including fatigue,aches,and stress or agitation.because of these side effects,wang wrote a letter to defendant requesting that plaintiff be placed on light duty until about june of.
based on wang letter,woods accommodated plaintiff by allowing him to arrive late on the days that he received the infergen injections.woods at times assigned plaintiff to positions that did not require heavy labor,including the general shop.even under normal circumstances,stationary engineers often used inmates to do most of the heavy labor.woods observed that plaintiff was able to continue performing his duties.
in,plaintiff injured his back at work on two separate occasions.after the first injury in june,plaintiff was assigned to light duty,as recommended by his doctor.under defendant policy,an employee may be given a light duty assignment for a maximum of days,which included an initial period of days with one extension.after plaintiff reinjured his back in november,the days had expired and plaintiff was placed on disability leave.
at about the same time,plaintiff began a second course of infergen injections to treat his hepatitis c.the treatments began in april of and were scheduled to end in april of.wang wrote a second letter to defendant again recommending light duty based on the side effects from the infergen injections.
on july,plaintiff returned to work with a letter from his back doctor clearing him for full duty.aside from his physical therapy sessions for his back,plaintiff was at work performing his full duties.at the time,the coordinator at the institute,kristi hilliker,reviewed a doctor report,which was prepared in for plaintiff workers compensation claim,that required that plaintiff be limited to a minimum of physical activity after hilliker informed associate warden sheila tatum that plaintiff should not have been cleared for full duty,they decided to meet with plaintiff.
on the same day,july,plaintiff went to hilliker office because he felt fatigued because of his condition,which was aggravated by the heat of the day.hilliker and plaintiff went to tatum office.plaintiff complained of fatigue and asked to see his doctor.based on plaintiff work restrictions,hilliker and tatum decided that plaintiff was incapable of performing his duties.they discussed various options,but refused to allow plaintiff to return to his position as a stationary engineer.plaintiff initially selected the option of disability retirement.
after the meeting,there was some communication between plaintiff and hilliker concerning the options.in a letter dated october,hilliker informed plaintiff that unless he obtained a letter from markovitz clearing him for full duty,he could not return to his position as a stationary engineer.the letter also set forth other options,including vocational rehabilitation,medical leave,and disability retirement.plaintiff did not respond to hilliker letter.
instead,in november of,plaintiff went back to the institute and asked hilliker if he could return to work.hilliker denied his request based on the earlier findings of the workers compensation judge when plaintiff did not submit an application for disability retirement,hilliker completed the application on plaintiff behalf and tatum signed the application.
plaintiff filed a claim for disability discrimination with the department of fair employment and housing.
plaintiff subsequently filed his complaint for damages in superior court alleging that defendant discriminated against him based on his disability and failed to accommodate his disability in violation of the feha.the jury returned a general verdict for plaintiff and awarded him in economic damages and in noneconomic damages.
defendant moved for a new trial challenging the trial court decision to exclude markovitz testimony.during the hearing on defendant motion,the trial court noted that the evidence did not support the jury award of in noneconomic damages.thus,while the court rejected defendant arguments,it nevertheless ruled that the motion would be granted unless plaintiff accepted a remittitur.plaintiff filed a notice of acceptance.
defendant appealed from the court judgment and plaintiff appealed from the court conditional ruling granting defendant motion for new trial.
prima facie case under the feha 
plaintiff alleged two separate causes of action under the feha disability discrimination under section,subdivision a,and the failure to provide reasonable accommodation under section,subdivision m.
disability discrimination 
in regards to plaintiff cause of action for disability discrimination,the primary question is does plaintiff have to prove that he has the capacity to perform his essential duties as an element of his prima facie case or does defendant have to establish that plaintiff can not perform his duties with reasonable accommodation contrary to the decision in brundage hahn th,d,we hold that the burden lies with defendant.
we begin our analysis with the language of the statute.section provides,in part 
it shall be an unlawful employment practice,unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification,or,except where based upon applicable security regulations established by the united states or the state of california 
a for an employer,because of the physical disability,mental disability,medical condition of any person,to bar or to discharge the person from employment or from a training program leading to employment,or to discriminate against the person in compensation or in terms,conditions,or privileges of employment.
this part does not prohibit an employer from refusing to hire or discharging an employee with a physical or mental disability,where the employee,because of his or her physical or mental disability,is unable to perform his or her essential duties even with reasonable accommodations,or can not perform those duties in a manner that would not endanger his or her health or safety or the health or safety of others even with reasonable accommodations.
in brundage hahn,supra,th,d,the plaintiff alleged that her employer discriminated against her based on her mental disability as prohibited under the feha and the federal americans with disabilities act disabilities act.based on the similarities between state and federal antidiscrimination laws,the court considered the plaintiff state and federal claims together and relied on federal authority in its analysis.id.at,d.applying the elements of a prima facie case of discrimination under the disabilities act,the court required that the plaintiff show that plaintiff suffers from a disability plaintiff is a qualified individual and plaintiff was subjected to an adverse employment action because of the disability.id.at,d,citing morisky broward county cir.the brundage case turned on the first and third elements.the court had no occasion to discuss the second element and,as noted by the court,the precise nature of the prima facie case was not at issue.brundage,supra,at,fn,d.
nevertheless,courts have used the same elements for the prima facie case in a disability discrimination claim under the feha.see,hastings department of corrections th,d finegan county of los angeles th,d jensen wells fargo bank th,d quinn city of los angeles th,d deschene pinole point steel th,d see also le bourgeois fireplace manufacturers,th,fn,d.while some courts have recognized the brundage court reliance on federal authority see finegan,supra,at,d jensen,supra,at,fn,d quinn,supra,at,d,citing pensinger bowsmith,th,d,none of them have questioned whether the elements are consistent with the state statute.
despite wide acceptance of the brundage elements,there remains great confusion as to what constitutes a prima facie case for a claim under section,subdivision a.under baji,the plaintiff is not required to prove his ability to perform his essential duties.the judicial council of california civil jury instructions,on the other hand,includes the capacity to perform as one of the essential elements for a disability discrimination claim under section,subdivision a.caci january ed.the directions for use provide,however,that there appears a divergence in authority on whether the plaintiff is required to prove that he or she has the ability to perform the essential duties of the job.directions for use following caci,comparing brundage hahn,supra,th at,d with bagatti department of rehabilitation th,d.although the judicial council refers to the bagatti case,that case provides little guidance here because the plaintiff alleged a failure to accommodate and not discrimination.
in this case,the plaintiff relies on the following statement under the feha,the burden is on the employer to prove that the employee could not perform the job essential functions,with or without reasonable accommodation.chin et,cal.practice guide employment litigation the rutter group,citing.and ackerman western,cir.however,the same source,while acknowledging some disagreement,includes the requirement as an element of the prima facie case for a reasonable accommodation claim.chin,supra,at.
another source seems to teeter back and forth from the judicial council instructions,which include the capacity to perform,and the general description of a disability discrimination claim in the code of regulations,which contains no such language.wilcox,cal.employment law substantive requirements,c,fn,c,c.
this confusion began with brundage.as mentioned above,brundage involved a federal disabilities act claim and a feha claim.the court decided to rely on federal law because state and federal law contained similar provisions.brundage,supra,th at,d.
but were the laws sufficiently similar to adopt the federal standard without modification while one statute may have been fashioned after the other,the state statute appears to be broader in scope than its federal counterpart.on other subjects,courts have recognized that the state and federal provisions differ in significant respects.see colmenares braemar country club,cal th,d,definition of physical disability stevenson superior court cal th,fn,d,qualifying employers bagatti,supra,th at,d protected individuals jensen,supra,th at,fn,d definition of disability.
while the bagatti case involved only a reasonable accommodation claim under section,subdivision m,the court discussion of the federal statute and regulations is instructive.the court explained,t he operative principle is that a federal regulation may be useful to guide the construction of the feha where the state statute or an interpretive state regulation are modeled on the ada.citation.here,however,the interpretive statement of the eeoc is based upon ada provisions that differ in important material respects from the applicable feha provision bagatti,supra,th at,d.the bagatti court noted that the federal regulations repeatedly referred to a qualified individual with a disability.id.at,d.section,subdivision m,refers only to an applicant or employee.
similarly,section,subdivision a,applies to any person.granted,in a disability discrimination claim,the distinction between federal and state law is not as clear.yet the subtle difference is significant.
under the disabilities act,the general rule provides no covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.
in contrast to the disabilities act use of the term qualified individual,the general rule under the feha prohibits disability discrimination against any person without reference to employment qualifications,subdivision a.the california code of regulations provides disability discrimination is established by showing that an employment practice denies,in whole or in part,an employment benefit to an individual because he or she is an individual with a disability,tit.under the statute,the employee qualifications,or ability to perform his essential duties,is mentioned in subdivision a and,possibly as an exception to the rule or a defense to a claim of discrimination.accordingly,the administrative regulations include inability to perform in their list of potential defenses,tit.generally,when an administrative agency is authorized to adopt regulations and standards to administer a statute,the courts give deference to the agency interpretation so long as it is reasonable and consistent with the statutory language.see robinson city of yucaipa th,d.according to these regulations,the fair employment and housing commission the commission has placed the burden of proof on defendant.
as a practical consequence of the commission interpretation,a disabled plaintiff would have one less hurdle to contend with on his path to recovery.after the plaintiff shows that he was discriminated against because of his disability,if the defendant can not establish an inability to perform or any other defense,the plaintiff would be entitled to relief.
while the commission interpretation provides plaintiff with greater protection,we find it entirely consistent with the feha intent.the feha requires liberal construction of its provisions to accomplish its purposes,subd.a see also richards hill,cal th,d.after amending the feha in,the legislature made clear that its provisions must be construed to provide disabled persons with the greatest protection available under either state or federal law.specifically,the legislature declared its intent to strengthen california law in areas where it is weaker than the disabilities act and to retain california law when it provides more protection for individuals with disabilities than the disabilities act.stats,ch,see also colmenares,supra,cal th at,d.in,the legislature also declared although the federal act provided a floor of protection,this state law has always,even prior to passage of the federal act,afforded additional protections,subd.a.
the administrative agency,therefore,advances the feha purpose of affording plaintiffs greater protection by removing the burden of proving capacity to perform as an element of a prima facie case.as noted by the ninth circuit in ackerman western electric,the commission specifically amended its regulations in to clarify that inability to perform was an affirmative defense for which defendant bears the burden of proof.id.at.the only requirement remaining was that plaintiff show that she was handicapped and had been denied an employment benefit because of it.citation.in explaining its reasons for the change,the commission made it clear that it was simply acting to correct what it regarded as a misreading of its prior regulations.ibid.
based on language in section and the administrative regulations,we conclude that establishing a prima facie case requires proof of the following elements the plaintiff is a person with a disability or medical condition,and the defendant made an adverse employment decision because of plaintiff disability or medical condition.as in other employment discrimination cases,if the plaintiff satisfies his initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of discrimination,the burden shifts to the employer to provide a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.see caldwell paramount unified school dist.th,d,citing mcdonnell douglas green,d.in a disability discrimination case under the feha,the employer may show that its decision was based on plaintiff inability to perform the essential functions of his position,even with reasonable accommodation.if the employer successfully makes this showing,the burden shifts back to the plaintiff,who then may prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant reason is false and a mere pretext for discrimination.see perez county of santa clara th,d,citing texas of community affairs burdine,d.
the prima facie case for disability discrimination under section,subdivision a,therefore,does not require plaintiff to prove that he is a qualified individual.rather,the burden is on defendant to establish that plaintiff is incapable of performing his essential duties with reasonable accommodation.
reasonable accommodation 
based on the parties treatment of the two causes of action as a single claim,the initial question is whether a reasonable accommodation claim under section,subdivision m,is a separate cause of action.the court in bagatti,supra,th,d,held that it is.
as provided in section,subdivision m,i t shall be an unlawful employment practice,unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification,f or an employer or other entity covered by this part to fail to make reasonable accommodation for the known physical or mental disability of an applicant or employee.
in bagatti,the plaintiff worked as a supervising accounting clerk for the department of rehabilitation.although her job duties required mobility,the plaintiff had polio and was unable to walk long distances.she requested that her employer accommodate her with motorized transportation,but the employer refused.plaintiff subsequently suffered a injury and was unable to return to work.she sued her employer for failing to provide reasonable accommodation in violation of section,subdivision m.
the employer relied on the elements of a prima facie case for a reasonable accommodation claim under the disabilities act,which required that the plaintiff show that she was a qualified individual with a disability who suffered an adverse employment action because of her disability.bagatti,supra,th at,d.the court in bagatti found,however,that the provisions in the feha and the disabilities act are materially different.id.at,d.
as discussed above,the bagatti court observed that while the federal provision refers to the protected individual as a qualified individual with a disability,the state provision referred only to an applicant or employee.bagatti,supra,th at,d.to establish a prima facie case under the feha,the plaintiff therefore was not required to show that she was capable of performing her duties.id.at,fn,d but see jensen,supra,th at,d.
as also observed by the court in bagatti,another difference between the federal and state statutes was that section,subdivision m does not require a discriminatory act.under subdivision m,a disabled employee right to request reasonable accommodation is not contingent upon the employer conduct.id.at,d.the failure to provide an applicant or employee with reasonable accommodation in and of itself constitutes an unfair employment practice,for which the applicant or employee can bring suit under subdivision m.id.at,d see also smith international brotherhood of electrical workers th,d.
to establish a prima facie case for a reasonable accommodation claim under section,subdivision m,the plaintiff must show that she had a disability and that the employer did not make reasonable accommodation for her known disability.see bagatti,supra,th at,d.as with a claim under section,subdivision a,if the case involved a hiring or firing decision,the employer may defend its decision based on the plaintiff inability to perform his essential duties even with reasonable accommodation,subd.a watkins ameripride services cir.an employer,however,is not required to accommodate an applicant or employee if the accommodation would produce an undue hardship on the employer operation,subd.m prilliman united air lines,th,d.
as stated above,the plaintiff in this case alleged a cause of action for disability discrimination under section,subdivision a,and a separate cause of action for failing to provide reasonable accommodation under section,subdivision m.despite this second and entirely distinct claim,the parties focused solely on the discrimination claim.additionally,although the court instructed the jury on the second cause of action by giving baji,which is entitled,albeit inappropriately,disability accommodation,the plaintiff did not discuss the elements of a reasonable accommodation claim in his closing argument to the jury.under these circumstances,it is unlikely that the jury relied upon this alternative basis for recovery in reaching its verdict.in any event,as discussed in the following section,substantial evidence supported the jury verdict on the disability discrimination claim.
sufficient evidence of disability discrimination 
defendant claims that insufficient evidence supported the jury verdict.defendant primary contention is that plaintiff failed to establish that he was capable of performing his essential duties as a stationary engineer.based on our conclusion that inability to perform is an affirmative defense,we will address this contention and defendant other arguments in a manner consistent with the parties respective burdens of proof.
standard of review 
in determining whether sufficient evidence supports a judgment,a reviewing court must consider the whole record in a light most favorable to the prevailing party and resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the judgment.beck development southern pacific transportation th,d.we defer to the jury credibility determinations.id.at,d.a reviewing court does not substitute its judgment for that of the jury,but accepts the jury findings if supported by substantial evidence.id.at,d.
in arriving at its verdict,the jury necessarily found that plaintiff satisfied his burden of establishing a prima facie case.the jury also found that defendant failed to prove that a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason existed for its employment decision.we must accept these findings if supported by substantial evidence.
in addition to challenging the evidence supporting plaintiff prima facie case,defendant also argues that reversal is required because substantial evidence supports its defenses.the question,however,is not whether there is substantial evidence to support a defense,but whether there is substantial evidence to support the jury finding that defendant failed to establish a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for its decision.see california teachers governing board d.in other words,it is not enough for defendant to show that there was substantial evidence that plaintiff could not perform his essential duties.evidence in the record that contradicts the jury finding does not demand that we reverse the jury verdict for lack of sufficient evidence.see people valdez cal th,d.instead,if the record contains substantial evidence that plaintiff was capable of performing his duties,we must uphold the jury finding.
prima facie case 
as mentioned above,plaintiff was required to prove that he had a disability,defendant made an adverse employment decision,and defendant made the decision because of plaintiff disability.in challenging only the third element,defendant argues that plaintiff failed to show that his disability was a motivating factor in defendant decision to prevent him from returning to his position.defendant attempts to draw a distinction between plaintiff disability and the work restrictions for his disability.we find the distinction to be one without a difference.
defendant reliance on the jensen case is inapposite.the jensen court makes no distinction between an employee disability and his work restrictions.jensen,supra,th at,d.the court only discussed an employee inability to perform.ibid.a decision based on the plaintiff inability to perform is not inconsistent with the finding that disability was a motivating factor.a claim that a plaintiff can not perform his essential duties under section,subdivision a and,is in essence a claim that,while the decision was made because of the plaintiff disability,the employer was entitled to treat the plaintiff differently because the plaintiff can not perform the essential functions of his position.see,tit,b see also city of moorpark superior court cal th,d.reliance on plaintiff inability to perform can be construed,therefore,as an admission that disability was a motivating factor for defendant employment decision.
furthermore,physical disability,by definition,is a condition that limits a major life activity,subd.k b.disability usually results in some limitation or restriction.in an employment setting,the disability may be referred to in terms of the plaintiff work restrictions.see products workers comp.bd.d.discussing doctor depiction of disability in terms of work doctor coincidentally was alvin markovitz.although disability refers to the condition and work restrictions refer to the results of that condition,we conclude that a decision based on work restrictions is the same for all practical purposes as a decision based on disability.to conclude otherwise would allow employers to assert that their decisions are never based on disability,but rather on the effects directly resulting from the employee disability.
substantial evidence in the record showed that plaintiff disability or work restrictions were a motivating factor for defendant decision.both hilliker and tatum testified that they decided that plaintiff could not continue his employment as a stationary engineer because of his work restrictions.tatum also testified that her decision was based on the permanent condition that he could not perform his job and that was related to hepatitis the record provides sufficient evidence that defendant made an adverse employment decision because of plaintiff disability.
defendant claims that its decision was compelled by a business necessity or a bona fide occupational qualification.in addition to these defenses,it is fair to characterize defendant earlier argument concerning plaintiff inability to perform as another reason for its employment decision.as we will discuss below,the business necessity defense does not apply in the context of a disability discrimination claim under the feha.while the occupational qualification defense applies to such claims,defendant can not establish that all disabled persons are incapable of performing the duties of a stationary engineer.in regards to plaintiff capacity to perform,substantial evidence supports the jury finding that plaintiff was capable of performing the essential duties of his position.
we briefly explain why defendant reliance on the business necessity defense is misplaced.derived from federal antidiscrimination law,the business necessity defense applies only to disparate impact cases,where the protected class is disproportionately and adversely affected by an employer facially neutral employment practice.west bechtel th,d johnson controls,fair employment housing com.d.the defense has no application in a disparate treatment case,where an employee is treated differently because of his disability or other classification.west,supra,at,d see also hemmings tidyman cir,fn.morton united parcel services,cir.because this case falls into the latter category,defendant has no provides relying on the business necessity defense.see gonzalez state personnel bd.th,d claim without citation to legal authority is deemed to be waived.
in addition to its claim of business necessity,defendant also relies on the bona fide occupational qualification defense.section specifically provides that a discriminatory employment practice is unlawful unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.the bfoq defense,as required by the statute,when applied to justify overt disparate treatment,has two components first,the employer must demonstrate that the occupational qualification is reasonably necessary to the normal operation of the particular business.secondly,the employer must show that the categorical exclusion based on protected class characteristic is justified,that all or substantially all of the persons with the subject class characteristic fail to satisfy the occupational qualification.citations.johnson controls,supra,d at.emphasis omitted see also baji january ed.ordinarily,an employer asserts this defense to justify its categorical exclusion of all individuals having a particular class characteristic.this case,however,does not involve a categorical exclusion of all disabled persons.
even if the defense applied under these facts,defendant must show that all or substantially all disabled persons are unable to perform the job duties of a stationary engineer safely and efficiently.see sterling transit,fair employment practice com.d.rejecting argument to define the class in more precise terms,all persons with back problems.defendant neither made this assertion nor presented evidence to support it.
instead,the crux of defendant argument both below and on appeal is that p
