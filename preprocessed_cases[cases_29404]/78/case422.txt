on may,respondents filed a motion to dismiss star under section,on the ground star failed to prosecute the action within five years of the filing of de santiago underlying complaint on february.
star opposed the motion on the ground the period was tolled under section,subdivision c,based on impracticability arising from trial continuances due to court congestion.
on june,the court heard respondent motion to dismiss and noted during the hearing that if you got a case and you bumping up against the five years,you bring a motion.i telling you any time anybody has ever brought such a motion,i jam that case in,and you did do that.star attorney acknowledged he had not brought such a motion but argued that it was not required.the trial court took the matter under submission but permitted counsel to submit additional written argument on tolling the limitation period.

impracticability exception to the limitation period 
star argues the limitation period did not run because tolling during the trial continuances due to court congestion was automatic and star was not required to file a motion to advance the trial.
under section,an action must be brought to trial within five years after it is filed unless,under section,subdivision c,b ringing the action to trial was impossible,impracticable,or futile,subd.c.the time during which one of these three conditions exists is excluded from the period.tamburina combined ins.of america th,d tamburina.section,subdivision c must be liberally construed,consistent with the policy favoring trial on the merits.sanchez city of los angeles th,d sanchez chin meier d,d chin.
this exception is recognized because the purpose of the statute is to prevent avoidable delay,and the exception makes allowance for circumstances beyond the plaintiff control,in which moving the case to trial is impracticable for all practical purposes.tamburina,supra,th at,d.
the determination of whether prosecution of an action was impossible,impracticable,or futile during the limitation period is generally a matter within the trial court discretion.such determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.sanchez,supra,th at,d.
