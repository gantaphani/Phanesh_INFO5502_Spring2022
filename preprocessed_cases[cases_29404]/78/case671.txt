timothy merritt appeals from a superior court judgment affirming a decision of the industrial accident board the board to terminate disability benefits paid to merritt by his employer,united parcel service ups or employer.on appeal,merritt claims that the superior court erroneously upheld the board decision,which in turn was erroneous because the board failed to give conclusive effect to ups admission of liability and prospectively determined an issue not before the board,by finding that merritt partial disability would end on a specific future date.because we conclude that merritt first claim of error is meritorious and reverse on that ground,we do not reach merritt second claim.
on may,merritt,who worked as a laborer for ups,herniated a disc in his lower back while lifting boxes off a conveyor belt.merritt continued working at ups with physical restrictions until september,when his persistent pain and numbness became severe.as a consequence,ups agreed to pay merritt total disability benefits at a rate of per week.
on october,ali kalamchi performed surgery to repair merritt disc herniation.after the surgery,merritt reported a marked decrease in pain and numbness.kalamchi ordered complete bed rest for one month,followed by physical therapy and rehabilitation.by december,however,merritt encountered more back problems when one of his discs blew out while he was grocery shopping.merritt also lost bowel and bladder control.
on january,ups filed a petition to terminate benefits,claiming that merritt was no longer totally disabled and could return to work.two days later,on january,kalamchi performed a second surgery on merritt.according to kalamchi january,note,merritt was to take it easy and avoid heavy lifting.the note did not indicate merritt disability status,however on march,kalamchi reexamined merritt and noted additional improvement in back pain and left buttock pain,no limp,and no shooting pain or numbness down the leg.he prescribed therapy and weight reduction,and asked merritt to return for a visit on april.
on march,lanny edelsohn,who was retained by ups for that purpose,examined merritt independently.in his report,edelsohn opined that merritt was no longer totally disabled and could return to work in a sedentary position,with restrictions but not to his job at ups.edelsohn anticipated that merritt would reach maximum medical improvement in about days and should return to work starting out at four hours per day and gradually increas e his hours over a period of four to six weeks.edelsohn,both when he prepared his report and also on the date of his deposition,was unaware that kalamchi had placed merritt on total disability.the reason was that it was not until march,that kalamchi issued a disability slip retroactively placing merritt on total disability from january,until april.
on march,on his attorney advice,merritt met with steven grossinger for a second opinion.grossinger diagnosed merritt with lumbar radiculopathy.he concluded that merritt could not return to work for ups,because of continuing pain and because of abnormalities in his neurological examination.grossinger issued a disability slip placing merritt on total disability for three months beginning march,
on april,days before the scheduled board hearing,ups counsel sent a letter via facsimile to the board the letter,which stated 
please be advised that the 
admits a transient period of recurrence from january,the date of the second surgery to march,the date of the defense medical examination 
admits temporary partial disability benefits from march,to the present and at a rate of per week and 
it should be noted that the employer can not accommodate sedentary or light duty restrictions and it is therefore appropriate that the claimant seek alternative work 
following a may,hearing,the board granted ups petition to terminate benefits.in its june,order,the board held that a merritt total disability ended on april,and b merritt was entitled to partial disability benefits,but only for a closed period of six weeks from and after the end of the total disability period,from april,to june.
in finding that merritt total disability had ended,the board considered edelsohn report opining that,as of march,merritt could return to work kalamchi disability slip placing merritt on total disability until april,and grossinger disability slip placing merritt on total disability until june.because grossinger was not merritt treating physician,the board disregarded his opinion the board found that merritt was no longer totally disabled,because i kalamchi had noted improvement in merritt condition and ii edelsohn had opined that merritt could return to work in a sedentary position,albeit with restrictions.the board found that the effective end date of merritt total disability status was april,as per kalamchi disability slip,because merritt was permitted to rely on his treating doctor orders regardless of actual physical ability or condition.merritt does not dispute the board findings regarding total disability on this appeal.merritt disputes only the board decision with respect to partial disability.
as earlier noted in his march report,edelsohn opined that merritt could return to employment after a period of four to six weeks of work.based solely on edelsohn opinion,the board found that merritt was capable of returning to work in a sedentary capacity,beginning with part time hours and increasing to full time hours after six weeks.the board concluded that merritt was entitled to partial disability compensation at a rate of per week for a period of six weeks following the termination of total disability,until june,but was not eligible for partial disability compensation after the six week period has ended.
merritt appealed the board decision to the superior court.merritt claimed that the board erred in two respects a by finding that merritt was entitled to partial disability benefits for only six weeks,rather than giving conclusive effect to ups admission of in ups letter and reiterated at the board his partial disability was and b by finding that merritt would be able to return to employment six weeks after his total disability period ended,thereby terminating merritt partial disability benefits as of a future date.
addressing merritt first claim,the superior court found that the letter constituted an amendment to ups memorandum.the court then summarily concluded that the board did not abuse its discretion in its treatment and consideration of the letter,because by finding merritt entitled to partial disability payments for a closed period of six weeks,the board gave effect to ups recognition that it was responsible for partial disability benefits for a limited period of time.the superior court also rejected merritt second claim of error,holding that.permits the board to set a future date as the end date for partial disability compensation.this appeal followed.
on appeal merritt presents the same two claims of error.where the board decision is supported by substantial evidence and is free from legal error,this court will affirm this court does not,however,weigh evidence,decide questions of credibility,or make its own factual findings.it determines only if the evidence is legally adequate to support the board factual findings alleged errors of law,however,are subject to de novo review absent errors of law,we review the board decision for abuse of discretion 
preliminarily,ups argues that merritt first claim of error was not properly preserved for appeal,for two reasons.first,ups contends that the letter was never made an exhibit at the board hearing.that argument is not persuasive.although the letter was not formally introduced as an exhibit at the board hearing,the board referred to the letter in its decision and both parties were fully aware of its contents.moreover,during the board hearing ups counsel repeatedly referred to the letter and reiterated the admissions contained therein 
second,ups argues that merritt counsel remained silent when ups counsel described the letter as an amendment to ups memorandum,and never asked the board to give the letter conclusive,judicial effect.that argument m
