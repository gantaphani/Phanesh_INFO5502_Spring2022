we hold today that the benefits review board did not err in ruling that injuries suffered by an employee during foreseeable horseplay in a bar on johnston atoll arose out of a zone of special danger created by the isolation of the island and the limited recreational opportunities available there.
facts and procedural history 
johnston atoll is a united states possession,located about miles of hawaii in the pacific ocean it is only two miles long and mile wide.the united states military uses the atoll to store and dispose of chemical,nuclear,and other toxic weapons.certain standards govern the conduct of inhabitants at all times during their stay on the atoll.for example,gambling and fighting are prohibited.
the united states government contracted with kalama to provide operational and maintenance services on the atoll.in august,kalama hired michael ilaszczat to manage the self help store on the atoll.the store serves local residents with materials and tools for projects.in december,ilaszczat injured his left leg in a accident.as a result of this injury,ilaszczat had a total left knee replacement in december.
on july,ilaszczat injured his left hip.the hip injury is the subject of the instant claim.at about on july,after completing his work for the day,ilaszczat went to the tiki bar,which is one of several authorized social clubs on johnston atoll.at the tiki bar,ilaszczat consumed two mixed drinks and played pool.he stayed at the tiki bar until it closed at about on july.ilaszczat then went to the amvets,another social club on the atoll,where he had two more mixed drinks.
there are conflicting accounts of precisely what transpired at the amvets,but it is undisputed that ilaszczat fell and injured his hip there.according to ilaszczat,he approached a group of soldiers and bought them drinks.these soldiers included private clyde burum and private benjamin sanchez.ilaszczat offered to play the soldiers a game of pool for per game or per ball,but none of the soldiers was interested.ilaszczat then left the soldiers and played a game of pool by himself.
ilaszczat returned shortly thereafter.he described his second encounter with the soldiers as follows 
t here was a couple of the military guys sitting at the bar and somehow the subject got around to martial arts burum said he was really good at it and i said,well,you ca be that good at it,you know,because your hand all screwed up.i found out later he put it through a window h e said that he could take his leg and put it over my head without touching me i said,that impossible.i almost six foot tall.h e says,no,i can do that.i says,look,i not into that kind of crap.i took my card out and i showed him my card where i got the artificial knee and i rolled up my pants to show him the scar on my other leg and he says,no,i can do it without touching you.h e was pretty insistent upon showing me how he could lift my sic leg over my head without touching me so,i went to the back of the room where the pool table and that picnic table were and i put my drink down on the picnic table and when he went to kick me,his foot only came up to here and i blocked it and i turned around and i said,no,that it.bullshit.and i picked up my drink to walk away and the next thing i know i was on the ground and my hip was broken.
ilaszczat initially testified he had no interest in participating in the demonstration,but he later conceded he had bet burum that burum could not put his leg over ilaszczat head without touching him.in describing how he had fallen to the floor,ilaszczat testified that burum may have swept his foot out from under him,or kicked him.
burum and sanchez offered a different account.they testified that ilaszczat bragged he was too fast for anyone to knock him to the ground or kick him in the knee,even with his total left knee replacement.they claim that ilaszczat sustained his injury when he charged at burum immediately after the demonstration,lost his balance,and then fell to the ground.the alj found ilaszczat account to be more credible than that of burum and sanchez.
after the demonstration,paramedics and a police officer arrived on the scene ilaszczat was taken to the kalama services clinic,where he remained for two days,and was subsequently transferred to hawaii for hip surgery.while recovering from surgery,ilaszczat received a debarment order from the johnston atoll military commander.the order barred ilaszczat from the island and prohibited him from ever returning as a result of the physical altercation that took place on july.kalama terminated ilaszczat employment based on the debarment order.ilaszczat moved to honolulu,hawaii.
ilaszczat filed a claim for workers compensation benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,et lhwca,as extended by the defense base act dba,et.his claim proceeded to trial before an alj in honolulu.at trial,ilaszczat and kalama stipulated,among other things,that ilaszczat i was temporarily totally disabled from july,to january,ii attained maximum medical improvement on january,and iii has been permanently partially disabled since january.
the alj found that ilaszczat had established a sufficient causal relationship between his injury and his employment,and awarded him disability benefits.kalama appealed to the benefits review board,which affirmed the alj decision.kalama subsequently filed a timely petition for review in this court.we have jurisdiction under c.see edwards,office of workers comp.programs,cir.
standards of review 
we review brb decisions for errors of law and for adherence to the substantial evidence standard,which governs the board review of an alj factual determinations.sestich long beach container terminal,cir.the brb may not substitute its views for those of the administrative law judge or engage in a de novo review of the evidence.stevens,office of workers comp.programs,cir.rather,the board must accept the alj findings of fact unless they are contrary to the law,irrational,or unsupported by substantial evidence.sestich,at.
discussion 
congress passed the defense base act in order to provide workers compensation coverage for certain classes of employees working outside the continental united states.pearce,office of workers comp.programs,cir.rather than draft a new workers compensation scheme,congress used the dba to extend the lhwca to apply to the workers.id.the parties agree that the lhwca,as extended by the dba,applies in this case.
we apply the following proof scheme in lhwca cases.the claimant bears the initial burden of showing that a injury prevents him from performing his former job.see edwards,at.if the claimant makes this showing,the burden shifts to the employer to demonstrate that suitable alternative employment is available to the claimant.see id.an employer may satisfy this burden in two ways.see norfolk shipbuilding drydock hord,cir.the employer itself may make suitable alternative employment available to the injured employee.see id.alternatively,the employer may show that suitable alternative employment is available to the injured worker in the relevant labor market.see id.if the employer satisfies this burden,the claimant may rebut the employer evidence of suitable alternative employment with evidence showing a diligent but unsuccessful search for such employment.see edwards,at.if the employer does not satisfy its burden of showing available alternative employment,it must pay the claimant disability benefits.id.at.
in this case,kalama does not dispute that ilaszczat satisfied the burden of demonstrating that his injury prevented him from performing his former job.thus,the burden shifted to kalama to establish that suitable alternative employment was available to ilaszczat,either within kalama or in the relevant labor market.however,kalama contends that because ilaszczat own misconduct caused him to be barred from johnston atoll,it should be excused from having to make any showing of available alternative employment.
with these principles in mind,we now turn to kalama challenge to the brb decision.
zone of special danger 
kalama first argues that ilaszczat is not entitled to disability benefits under the longshore and
