in,robert opp opp filed a disability benefits claim against peabody coal company peabody under the black lung benefits act of.a.opp,a coal miner for nearly forty years,smoked for over fifty years.in the mid,opp began suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd.opp alleged that his copd arose out of his employment as a coal miner.when a claimant proves total disability due to either clinical pneumoconiosis or legal pneumoconiosis,the claimant is eligible for benefits under the black lung benefits act.see a.opp alleged that his condition constituted legal pneumoconiosis and that he was entitled to benefits under the act 
following a number of administrative hearings and reviews by the benefits review board,an administrative law judge alj ordered peabody to pay opp surviving spouse all the benefits to which opp was entitled to receive between january,and august.the benefits review board affirmed the alj decision and peabody coal petitions for review of that decision.we have jurisdiction to review peabody petition pursuant to c,and we deny the petition.
background 
factual.the statute and regulations 
the black lung benefits act awards benefits to coal miners suffering from pneumoconiosis,defined as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.b.a disease arises out of coal mine employment if it is significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by,dust exposure in coal mine employment.b.
before,the black lung benefits act regulations provided that coal miners suffering from clinical pneumoconiosis were eligible for benefits under the act.a.clinical pneumoconiosis refers to a cluster of typically chronic restrictive pulmonary diseases recognized by the medical community as fibrotic reactions to permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs.a.in,the regulations were amended to clarify that coal miners suffering from legal pneumoconiosis may also receive benefits under the act.legal pneumoconiosis refers to any chronic lung disease or impairment,including chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.a emphasis added.before opp death,he suffered from copd,which he alleged was a form of legal pneumoconiosis.
the regulatory preamble 
the preamble to the amendments that clarify the regulatory definition of pneumoconiosis explains that the amendments were intended to conform the regulatory definition to the statute,which defines pneumoconiosis broadly.at.the department of labor received both favorable and unfavorable comments on its proposed revision to the definition of pneumoconiosis.id.during the notice and comment period,several of the unfavorable comments referred to a review of the available medical literature on obstructive lung disease and pulmonary dysfunction in coal miners,written by gregory fino,a physician in pulmonary diseases,and barbara bahl,a doctor in nursing and biostatistics.id.at.fino and bahl review of the literature led them to conclude that virtually all of the articles they reviewed were flawed,and that there was no evidence of a clinically significant reduction in lung function resulting from coal mine dust exposure.id.
in the preamble,the department of labor observed that fino and bahl opinions were not in accord with the prevailing view of the medical community or the substantial weight of the medical and scientific literature.id.at.the preamble addressed several studies in the medical record that contain overwhelming scientific and medical evidence demonstrating that coal mine dust exposure can cause obstructive lung disease.id.at see id.at.
the preamble first evaluated the medical and scientific literature on chronic bronchitis.the oxman study,for instance,found a statistically significant association between cumulative dust exposure and decline in lung function.id.at citing oxman et,occupational dust exposure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a systematic overview of the evidence,am.respiratory disease.the oxman study likely underestimates the association between inhalation of coal mine dust and loss of lung function because unhealthy workers tend to exit the workforce.id.emphasis omitted.likewise,the marine study found that e ven in the absence of smoking,coal mine dust exposure is clearly associated with clinically significant airways obstruction and chronic bronchitis.id.at citing marine et,clinically important respiratory effects of dust exposure and smoking in british coal miners,am.respiratory disease.the marine study found that t he risk of airways obstruction resulting from coal mine dust exposure is additive with cigarette smoking.id.studies similar to the marine study,such as the attfield and hodous study,demonstrated a clear relationship between dust exposure and a decline in pulmonary function in coal miners of about to milliliters a year.id.citing attfield hodous,pulmonary function of coal miners related to dust exposure estimates,am.respiratory disease.according to attfield and hodous,the average decrement for smokers was only per of smoking.id.at quoting am.respiratory disease at.
the preamble next evaluated the medical and scientific literature on emphysema.the cockcroft study found that centrilobular emphysema was significantly more common among coal workers and related to the amount of dust in the lungs.id.citing cockcroft et,study of emphysema in coalworkers and non coalworkers,lancet.the leigh study found strong evidence that emphysema in coalworkers is causally related to lung coal content.id.at quoting leigh et,quantified pathology of emphysema,pneumoconiosis and chronic bronchitis in coal workers,brit.indus.med.the ruckley study also found evidence of a causal connection between coal dust exposure and emphysema.id.citing ruckley et,emphysema and dust exposure in a group of coal workers,am.respiratory disease.fino and bahl cited several sources supporting the contention that there is no causal connection between coal dust exposure and emphysema.the preamble noted that fino and bahl quoted a passage from a textbook on occupational lung disease to support their assertion that focal emphysema can not be equated with airways obstruction.id.citing occupational lung diseases keith morgan anthony seaton,ed.but the preamble also noted another passage from the same textbook that stated t he increased risk of centriacinar emphysema supports the hypothesis that coal dust exposure sufficient to cause alveolar inflammation and fibrosis also initiates centriacinar emphysema.id.quoting occupational lung diseases at.
the relevant testimony 
at his administrative hearing in,opp testified about his smoking history and coal mine employment.opp worked as a coal miner for years and smoked between and one and a half packs of cigarettes a day for around years.opp testified that a lot of times he quit smoking for six or seven months at a time.he said that he m ight have only smoked four months some of the years,while other years he may have smoked for eight months.
as a coal miner,opp worked on the surface of the mine.he operated an end loader during the last fifteen years of his coal mine employment.opp described his work environment as dusty to real bad.he said the dust saturated all the way through his clothing to his skin,and that within a half hour of starting work,his clean clothes would be dirty.
in,opp was forced to retire after he broke his back during a fall from the radiator of a haul truck.opp underwent surgery for this injury.he testified that his breathing problems were just starting when he injured his back.
two medical experts testified that opp respiratory impairment was attributable to his employment as a coal miner.in,the department of labor provided for an examination of opp by physician david james.opp testified that he told james that he had been short of breath since or.james diagnosed opp with coal workers legal pneumoconiosis,attributable to coal dust exposure copd,attributable to coal dust exposure and smoking and,desaturation of oxygen,attributable to pneumoconiosis and copd.james concluded that chron
