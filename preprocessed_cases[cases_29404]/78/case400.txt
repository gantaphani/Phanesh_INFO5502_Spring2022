an employee at an armored transportation company was the subject of an internal investigation into missing cash and knew he could be terminated depending on the outcome.during the investigation,he notified his employer for the first time that he was suffering from pain and numbness in his arms,fingers,shoulders,and feet he stated he had been experiencing those symptoms for a year or two he expressed his belief that they were work related and he filed claims for workers compensation.days later,he was terminated based on the results of the investigation.
the employee then filed this suit,alleging a claim under the fair employment and housing act feha or act,et for physical disability discrimination.he also alleged a claim for wrongful termination of employment in violation of public policy,contending he had been terminated in retaliation for filing workers compensation claims.see.the trial court granted summary judgment for the employer.
we conclude that the disability discrimination claim fails because the employee symptoms did not constitute a physical disability under the feha.specifically,the employee pain and numbness did not make it difficult for him to achieve the life activity of working.the employer also had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason for the of confidence in the confirmed by the investigation.similarly,the wrongful termination claim,alleging retaliation,fails because the employer lack of confidence in the employee constituted a legitimate,nonretaliatory reason for the termination.
for his part,the employee points out that he was terminated within days of disclosing his symptoms and filing his workers compensation claims,emphasizing the close timing of the events.although temporal proximity,by itself,may be sufficient to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation,it does not create a triable fact as to pretext once the employer has offered evidence of a legitimate,nonprohibited reason for its action.this is especially so where the employer raised questions about the employee performance before he engaged in protected activity,and the subsequent discharge was based on those performance issues.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
we accept as true the following facts and reasonable inferences supported by the parties undisputed evidence on the motion for summary judgment.see raghavan boeing th,d.
since,defendant brink,incorporated,has provided secure transportation of customers valuables,primarily money.brink uses armored vehicles,some weighing as much as tons,staffed by three armed,uniformed employees a driver,a guard,and a messenger.
the driver is responsible for following a predetermined route,which can be varied in a limited manner by the messenger during the run.the driver is stationed in a separate compartment from the messenger and the guard to ensure the safety of the public and the vehicle.
the guard,under the direction and control of the messenger,assists the messenger in carrying items to and from customer locations.the guard also protects against the accidental mishandling of valuables,which may result in a loss while on the street.brink operations involve the threat of armed attacks on the crew.
the messenger has the most critical job.he exercises immediate supervision over the vehicle and its crew.the messenger is responsible for making the actual delivery and pickup at customer locations,maintaining control of all shipments,and issuing and receiving a proper receipt at the delivery or pickup point.he accounts for and controls all valuables placed on the armored vehicle,including significant amounts of money on a daily basis.on atm runs,the messenger is responsible for removing old money from the atm residual cash,replenishing the machine with new money,and removing deposits.he is responsible for returning residual cash and deposits to the brink vault.
brink personnel handbook states that the messenger is in charge of the crew and that his primary duty is to employ the facilities provided for the safekeeping and security of shipments.
in august,brink hired plaintiff carlos arteaga as an armored vehicle driver at its los angeles branch.later,he became a guard and eventually a messenger.thereafter,he spent most of his time as a messenger.
in his first two years,arteaga was written up for missing a training class and being involved in two driving accidents.he was informed in writing that the failure to adhere to the requirements of his position would subject him to discipline,up to and including termination.
in early,arteaga was questioned about a shortage that occurred on a run while he was acting as a trainer for a new employee.raul ruiz,the manager of brink los angeles branch,questioned arteaga repeatedly about the missing money.after two months,arteaga was told to forget about it.
in august,arteaga had a medical examination to maintain his driver certification for brink.the examination report showed that he was in good health.arteaga completed part of the report,indicating he did not have any of several listed illnesses or health problems.in particular,he checked the no box beside a ny illness or injury in last years m issing or impaired hand,arm,foot,leg,finger,toe and muscular disease.
in november,arteaga was suspended for one day without pay because he failed to deliver a shipment to a bank and instead left it in the armored vehicle overnight.by written memo dated november,brink reminded arteaga that he was responsible for the shipments assigned to him.the memo concluded any further violations of brink policies,procedures or infractions of brink standards will result in further disciplinary action,up to and including termination of your employment.
the amount of money that brink collects from atm does not always match the bank records as to what should have been collected.brink does not learn immediately about bank deposit shortages or of which are called it takes time for individual bank customers to receive notice of their deposits and to notify the bank of an error.a variance may involve,for example,a missing deposit.the bank must first investigate whether the error occurred through an atm to determine whether it should be referred to brink for investigation.this process can sometimes take months.
on march,a shortage of was discovered in the cash that arteaga had removed from an atm in his capacity as a messenger.ruiz looked into the matter.he learned that in july and august,there had been eight shortages,totaling nearly,on runs where arteaga had been the guard or messenger.all of the shortages were due to missing deposits.ruiz became suspicious of arteaga.
ruiz also reviewed a variance tracking report covering october and november.eight more shortages,totaling approximately,appeared on runs where arteaga had been the messenger.according to ruiz,i took a look at the report.i started to sort of dissect it,come up with a common denominator,and arteaga name was associated with numerous shortages different guards,different drivers,and as the crew mixed,arteaga continually was somebody that was on the route with the shortage or variance.after reviewing the report,ruiz began a more formal investigation into the march,shortage.
the investigation included going to the atm from which the funds were missing,counting deposits,verifying the sequence numbers of missing deposits,and talking to the crew.ruiz also spoke to arteaga,letting him know that there was an ongoing investigation into the march,variance.arteaga could not explain the incident.ultimately,the investigation did not determine the cause of the shortage,although it was learned that the atm in question had numerous problems requiring that the machine be serviced.
on march,during the investigation,arteaga informed brink for the first time that he was feeling a combination of pain and numbness in his arms,fingers,shoulders,and feet.he also disclosed for the first time that he was undergoing a lot of stress.arteaga completed a personal statement form,indicating that i n the year,i was doing a particular run every single day.i was lifting at least one hundred boxes of coins on a light day with different weight each day.i started to feel some kind of pain in my arms and fingers,when waking up.i ca move and bend my fingers.arteaga explained,i never reported this because i thought the pain was going away but it did.today,in the morning,i was unloading coins and i started to feel the pain in my arms and fingers again.arteaga never exhibited any signs of his medical problems at work.nor did his supervisors ever see him suffering from any medical condition.
at his deposition,arteaga said he began experiencing these symptoms p robably a year before,two years before he reported them.he did not report them at first because brink had a policy of terminating employees for injuries if it was determined that the employee was at fault.but arteaga concluded that the policy did not apply to him because he was not to blame for his injuries.he testified he had no reason to be concerned about being discharged because of them.
on march,the day he reported his symptoms,arteaga was examined by a physician.one of arteaga supervisors,alfred zabala,accompanied him to the doctor office.the physician determined that arteaga was okay and sent him back to work with a full release.the physician completed a workers compensation form to that effect.zabala informed ruiz of the situation and gave him a copy of arteaga personal injury form.
the following day,march,arteaga asked ruiz to demote him to a guard position so he would no longer be responsible for any missing deposits.ruiz denied the request.later that day,arteaga completed another personal statement form,complaining about stress.he wrote since early,i have been accused over and over of stealing money.i have asked to be demoted to a guard position in the hopes that the blame would be lifted from me.i was denied this change.yet you still have no trust in me.this is very confusing.your words and actions have had some serious e ffects on my general health and emotional state of mind.i now get seriously sick just thinking about brink and going to work.my home life has been affected as well.i find myself yelling at my wife and kids over something that was said or done to me at work.the job itself is stressful enough without constantly being accused of wrongdoing.either trust me or do trust me.but stop going back and forth 
on the same day,arteaga handwrote a letter to raul management,repeating verbatim the contents of the personal statement form submitted that day.
on march,arteaga told zabala that he was suffering from a rash on his face and body and that he believed the rash was job related.arteaga asked to leave work to see a physician.zabala replied,i ca let you go.at his deposition,arteaga referred to the rash as an allergy and admitted he had previously broken out with the same type of rash after getting mad at his wife.
on march,arteaga approached zabala,complaining about the rash again.zabala told ruiz about arteaga rash and that they were going to the doctor office.there,the physician detected a barely seen redness on a small part of arteaga face and elbow.he determined the rash to be nonindustrial.the physician indicated that arteaga could return to work without any restrictions and completed a workers compensation form to that effect.
when they got back to work,zabala told arteaga that ruiz wanted to see him.arteaga went to ruiz office.ruiz said he did not trust arteaga anymore and handed him a letter dated that day,march.the letter stated 
after several weeks of research and investigation,it has been determined that since october,there have been several shortages totaling from atm machines that you serviced as a messenger.in each case it was determined that you were the only person to service the atm machine.while no one is accusing anyone of theft,the money was assigned to you and therefore your responsibility.
the handbook for brink personnel,section,custody of shipments,states the primary duty of the messenger is to call and receipt for all shipments assigned to the run and to employ the facilities provided for the safekeeping and security of shipment.the messenger will not relinquish control over a shipment until proper receipt is received.
on the basis of your overall performance while employed by brink,the management of brink has lost confidence in your ability to perform your duties at the standard required of a brink business partner.as a result of this loss of confidence the decision has been made to terminate you r employment effective immediately.
should you have any question after the date of termination you may contact me at the branch.
the decision to terminate arteaga had been made the day before,march.ruiz discussed the matter then with richard morris,brink employee relations director for the pacific region.ruiz recommended that arteaga be terminated and morris agreed.morris drafted the termination letter and sent it to ruiz on march.from march,arteaga first mentioned his march,day of his termination,arteaga did not display any difficulty in performing his duties.
during ruiz tenure as branch manager,there were employees at brink los angeles filed workers compensation claims.of the,one employee filed five claims two filed three claims each and eight filed two claims each.none of those employees was terminated.they either resigned or were still employed when arteaga was discharged.
after leaving brink,arteaga worked as an apartment manager from may to september.next,he performed security services at a restaurant.in january,he started working at sectran security,a company similar to brink.his duties were virtually identical at sectran he worked as the messenger on an armored vehicle,loading and unloading shipments.depending on the route,arteaga made up to stops a day.arteaga did not,however,work with atm.there was only a crew the driver and the messenger.and although arteaga was still handling money,there were fewer coins and more and bills.arteaga performed well at sectran and without difficulty.
at some point after his termination and before august,arteaga was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome.this condition limited him in only one respect he could no longer play soccer.he still suffered from pain in his arms and shoulders as well as numbness in his fingers and arms.he received chiropractic treatment.
on december,arteaga filed this action against brink,ruiz,and another supervisor.the complaint consisted of two causes of action.the first,under the feha,alleged that arteaga suffered physical disabilities in his hands,wrists,elbows,neck,and shoulders,all of which he had reported to brink on march.thereafter,brink purportedly engaged in acts of discrimination,harassment,and retaliation by failing to determine how to accommodate him,failing to engage in a good faith interactive process to determine effective reasonable accommodations,failing to move him into another position,and terminating him.the second cause of action,for wrongful termination in violation of public policy,alleged the same disability discrimination theory as the first cause of action,plus retaliation for filing workers compensation right protected by labor code section.arteaga did not claim discrimination based on mental disability.
on january,arteaga filed a first amended complaint complaint that was materially similar to the first one.brink and the individual defendants collectively brink filed answers,generally denying the allegations of the complaint.see code civ,subd.d.
on december,brink filed a motion for summary judgment or,in the alternative,summary adjudication as to each cause of action.brink argued that arteaga was not physically disabled and could not establish a prima facie case of disability discrimination brink had a legitimate,nondiscriminatory and nonretaliatory reason for discharging him and the individual defendants could not be held liable under the feha or on a claim for wrongful termination of employment in violation of public policy.arteaga filed opposition.
the trial court granted the summary judgment motion.judgment was entered accordingly.arteaga appealed.
discussion 
on appeal,arteaga argues that the trial court erred in summarily adjudicating the first cause of action,alleging physical disability discrimination under the feha,and the second cause of action,alleging wrongful termination based on a physical disability as well as retaliation for filing workers compensation claims.arteaga does not challenge the dismissal of the individual defendants.
we conclude that the feha claim and the wrongful termination claim alleging disability discrimination fail as a matter of law for two reasons.first,arteaga was not disabled given that his symptoms did not make it difficult for him to achieve the life activity of working.second,brink terminated arteaga employment for a legitimate,nondiscriminatory reason management lost confidence in him.the closeness in time between arteaga disclosure of his symptoms and his subsequent termination does not create a triable issue as to pretext,especially because his performance had been questioned before he disclosed his symptoms,and he was eventually terminated for those performance issues.
to the extent that the wrongful termination claim alleged retaliation for filing workers compensation claims,it,too,fails because of the same legitimate reason for the discharge.although arteaga was terminated within days of filing his workers compensation claims,such that the close proximity in time supports a prima facie case of retaliation,temporal proximity alone is not sufficient to create a triable issue as to pretext,particularly in light of brink statistical showing that the company does not discharge employees for filing workers compensation claims.
standard of review 
a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
a defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment,the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court we must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact t he moving party affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence.raghavan boeing,supra,th at,d.
physical disability discrimination under the feha 
as stated in the feha the law of this state contains broad definitions of physical disability,mental disability,and medical condition.it is the intent of the legislature that the definitions of physical disability and mental disability be construed so that applicants and employees are protected from discrimination due to an actual or perceived physical or mental impairment that is disabling,potentially disabling,or perceived as disabling or potentially disabling,subd.b all further section references are to the government code unless otherwise indicated.the provisions of the feha shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of its purposes,subd.a.
under a disparate treatment theory as opposed to a disparate impact approach,discrimination occurs when the employer treats some people less favorably than others because of their disability or other statutorily prohibited characteristic or trait.t he plaintiff must prove the ultimate fact that the defendant engaged in intentional discrimination an employer will be liable for intentional discrimination if it is shown that its employment decision was premised upon an illegitimate criterion.
federal and california courts have acknowledged the difficulty of proving intentional discrimination proving intentional discrimination can be difficult because t here will seldom be eyewitness testimony as to the employer mental processes.it is rare for a plaintiff to be able to produce direct evidence or smoking gun evidence of discrimination 
consequently,the united states supreme court has developed rules regarding the allocation of burdens and the order in which proof is presented to resolve the elusive factual question of intentional discrimination.texas of community affairs burdine,fn,d,see also mcdonnell douglas green,d mcdonnell douglas.p laintiffs may demonstrate via indirect or circumstantial evidence that they were the victims of discrimination.first,it is the plaintiff burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination.second,if the plaintiff proves the prima facie case,then the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision.third,if the defendant offers such a reason,then the plaintiff must have an opportunity to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons,but were a pretext for discrimination 
while the burden of production shifts to the defendant under the mcdonnell douglas framework once a prima facie case is made,the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant engaged in intentional discrimination remains at all times with the plaintiff.if the defendant succeeds in carrying its burden of production,the mcdonnell douglas presumption of discrimination drops from the case and the trier of fact determines the ultimate question of whether the plaintiff has shown intentional discrimination 
the burden of persuasion remains with plaintiff even in the face of evidence that the employer proffered reasons are pretextual the ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated,and proof that the employer proffered reason is unpersuasive,or even obviously contrived,does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff proffered reason is correct.in other words,i t is not enough to disbelieve the employer the factfinder must believe the plaintiff explanation of intentional discrimination.nevertheless,evidence that the employer proffered reasons are pretextual is significant thus,a plaintiff prima facie case,combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer asserted justification is false,may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.frank county of los angeles th,d,citations omitted,italics added accord,guz bechtel national,cal th,d,muzquiz city of emeryville th,fn,d.
the employee can not simply show that the employer decision was wrong or mistaken,since the factual dispute at issue is whether discriminatory animus motivated the employer,not whether the employer is wise,shrewd,prudent,or competent rather,the employee must demonstrate such weaknesses,implausibilities,inconsistencies,incoherencies,or contradictions in the employer proffered legitimate reasons for its action that a reasonable factfinder could rationally find them unworthy of credence,and hence infer that the employer did not act for the the asserted reasons.hersant department of social services th,d.
w e must keep in mind that the mcdonnell douglas test was originally developed for use at trial see guz bechtel national,supra,cal th at,d,not in summary judgment proceedings.in such pretrial motion proceedings,the trial court will be called upon to decide if the plaintiff has met his or her burden of establishing a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination.if the employer presents admissible evidence either that one or more of plaintiff prima facie elements is lacking,or that the adverse employment action was based on legitimate,nondiscriminatory factors,the employer will be entitled to summary judgment unless the plaintiff produces admissible evidence which raises a triable issue of fact material to the defendant showing.in short,by applying mcdonnell douglas shifting burdens of production in the context of a motion for summary judgment,the judge will determine whether the litigants have created an issue of fact to be decided by the jury.thus,a lthough the burden of proof in a discrimination action claiming an unjustifiable termination ultimately rests with the plaintiff,in the case of a motion for summary judgment or summary issue adjudication,the burden rests with the moving party to negate the plaintiff right to prevail on a particular issue in other words,the burden is reversed in the case of a summary issue adjudication or summary judgment motion sada robert kennedy medical center th,d.
the feha does not guarantee employees a working environment.wehunt page d.the act does not take away an employer right to interpret its rules as it chooses,and to make determinations as it sees fit under those rules.the feha addresses discrimination.it is not a shield against harsh treatment at the workplace.nor does the statute require the employer to have good cause for its decisions.the employer may fire an employee for a good reason,a bad reason,a reason based on erroneous facts,or for no reason at all,as long as its action is not for a discriminatory reason while an employer judgment or course of action may seem poor or erroneous to outsiders,the relevant question is whether the given reason was a pretext for illegal discrimination.the employer stated legitimate reason does not have to be a reason that the judge or jurors would act on or approve.nix wlcy communications cir,citations italics omitted see guz bechtel national,supra,cal th at,d,adamson multi community diversified services cir,mccollum bolger cir.
prima facie case of disability discrimination 
a prima facie case for discrimination on grounds of physical disability under the feha requires plaintiff to show he suffers from a disability he is otherwise qualified to do his job and,he was subjected to adverse employment action because of his disability.faust california portland cement th,d.we turn to the first prong of the prima facie case whether arteaga suffered from a disability.
under the feha,physical disability includes having a physiological disease,disorder,or condition that,by affecting the neurological or musculoskeletal body systems,special sense organs or skin,limits a major life activity,subd.k a,b.limits is synonymous with making the achievement of a major life activity difficult,subd.k b ii.major life activity is construed broadly and includes physical,mental,and social activities,and working,subd.k b iii.w orking is a major life activity,regardless of whether the actual or perceived working limitation implicates a particular employment or a class or broad range of employments,subd.c.whether a major life activity is limited shall be determined without regard to mitigating measures such as medications,assistive devices,prosthetics,or reasonable accommodations,unless the mitigating measure itself limits a major life activity,subd.k b i.
an actual or existing disability is not necessary.the feha defines disability to include h aving a record or history of a disease,disorder,condition,cosmetic disfigurement,anatomical loss,or health impairment that constitutes a physical disability,which is known to the employer b eing regarded or treated by the employer as having,or having had,any physical condition that makes achievement of a major life activity difficult or b eing regarded or treated by the employer as having,or having had,a disease,disorder,condition,cosmetic disfigurement,anatomical loss,or health impairment that has no present disabling effect but may become a physical disability,subd.k.
in a ninth circuit case holding that persons with monocular vision were disabled with respect to the major life activity of seeing,the court explained t he feha does not require that the disability result in utter inability or even substantial limitation on the individual ability to perform major life activities.a limitation is sufficient.dfeh cal.dep t of,wl,at.
in deciding whether the employees limitations make them disabled under feha,the proper comparative baseline is either the individual without the impairment in question or the average unimpaired person.for example,several fair employment and housing commission fehc decisions rely on medical evidence that demonstrates a limitation relative to the individual own unimpaired state.see,cal.dep t of,wl,at noting,among other things,a percent reduction of the complainant former capacity to lift dfeh albertson,wl,at noting,among other things,that the complainant had lost approximately of her preinjury capacity for manual tasks.in citing that evidence,neither decision asked whether the claimant preinjury capacity was average or above average.but implicit comparisons with the normal or average population also appear in the commission decisions.in citing evidence that the complainants had difficulty with tasks such as dressing and sleeping,the fehc implicitly presumes that most people can perform those tasks without difficulty.see,cal.dep t of,wl,at.and,in at least one decision,the fehc made explicit this inherent comparison with a normal or average baseline.in dfeh jefferson smurfit,wl,at,a limitation to a work week was held not to limit a major life activity because hours is considered a full work week in our culture.
by contrast,we have found no fehc decisions that assess whether the complainant limitations were worse than those of other impaired people.for instance,the fehc noted that a complainant bursitis and muscle strain interrupted her ability to sleep.cal.dep t of,wl,at.but the fehc did not contemplate that the complainant limitation would be minimized by the fact that many otherwise nondisabled people also suffer from conditions,such as jet lag or age related insomnia,that interrupt their ability to sleep.
u nder feha and its relevant interpretations,the district court erred by holding that the employees are not limited in the major life activity of seeing simply because other people with common vision impairments are also limited.the employees demonstrated that seeing,and a variety of tasks for which seeing is commonly used,are made difficult for them because of their monocularity and consequent inability to perform stereopsis.feha requires no more.united parcel service,cir,fn.omitted.
actual disability 
we conclude that arteaga did not have an actual disability while employed by brink see,subd.k because his symptoms did not make the performance of his job duties difficult as compared to his unimpaired state or to a normal or average baseline.see united parcel service,supra,at.
during his almost five years at brink,arteaga never exhibited any signs of a medical problem.nor did his supervisors ever see him suffering from any medical condition.arteaga spent much of the workday riding in the back of a vehicle with a coworker,but he does not contend he ever mentioned his pain or numbness to another member of the crew.arteaga said his symptoms limited only his ability to play soccer,which is not a major life activity.he waited at least a year to mention them to management because he thought they were going only after learning he was under investigation for cash shortages.on one occasion,arteaga asked ruiz for a job change a demotion to a guard position.his request,however,had nothing to do with a physical disability.rather,he no longer wanted to be held responsible for shortages.his symptoms,perhaps bothersome,did not make accomplishing his job difficult.
we do not mean to belittle the pain or numbness arteaga experienced.but those types of symptoms are often subjective,as they were here,and they did not create a problem for arteaga in performing his job duties.he did not say what kind of pain he experienced,for example,tingling,aching,burning,stinging,stabbing,or throbbing.nor did he use words indicating the degree of pain,such as minor,mild,moderate,severe,intense,extreme,or unbearable.he merely reported feeling some kind of pain,when waking up and t oday,in the morning,i was unloading coins and i started to feel the pain in my arms and fingers again.given the way in which arteaga disclosed his condition,a reasonable employer would conclude that arteaga pain was not disabling.
consistent with the insignificance of his symptoms,arteaga had a medical examination about seven months before he disclosed them to brink and was found to be in good health.at the time of the exam,he completed a portion of the medical form,indicating he had not had any illness or injury in the previous five years and did not suffer from an impaired hand,arm,foot,leg,finger,or toe.nor did he have any muscular disease.
when arteaga finally informed brink of his condition,a supervisor took him to a for the physical symptoms and later for the rash.both times the physician found nothing wrong with arteaga and sent him back to work without any restrictions.an employer does not have to accept an employee subjective belief that he is disabled and may rely on medical information in that respect.see,kennedy superior printing cir,tyler ispat inland,cir,fn.burns snow cir,timmons general motors.north america d,affd.cir brettler purdue university d,fn,fn.abdo university of vermont d,cameron navistar intern.transp.d,fns.
as a federal district court stated in granting summary judgment for an employer under the americans with disabilities act ada in her response to the employers motion for summary judgment,the employee failed to address which major life activity her carpal tunnel syndrome substantially limits.the court is unable to surmise any such limitation.in her deposition,the employee acknowledges that the carpal tunnel condition does not prevent her from participating in any activity and that she is fully able to do her job although she generally alleges that she suffers pain as a result of the condition,pain alone without some corresponding limitation on activity is insufficient to establish a disabling impairment.see penny united parcel,cir moderate pain does not rise to the level of disability ellison software spectrum,cir despite pain involved,ability to perform job precluded finding that work was substantially limited.the employee has failed to establish that her carpal tunnel syndrome substantially limits a major life activity.gearhart sears,roebuck,d,gearhart,italics added,affd.mem.cir.
we recognize that,while the feha states that the employee disease,disorder,or condition need only limit a major life activity see,subd.k b,k b ii,the ada requires that the limitation be substantial see a colmenares braemar country club,cal th,d.that difference aside,the point in gearhart is applicable here pain alone does not always constitute or establish a disability.see gearhart,supra,d at accord,berg norand cir,locklear nicholson,bones honeywell,d,affd.cir.an assessment must be made to determine how,if at all,the pain affects the specific employee.in this case,the pain and numbness did not make work difficult for arteaga.
similarly,as the united states supreme court has explained it is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status under the ada to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.instead,the ada requires those claiming the act protection to prove a disability by offering evidence concerning the extent of the limitation caused by their impairment in terms of their own experience that the act defines disability with respect to an individual,makes clear that congress intended the existence of a disability to be determined in such a manner the determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name or diagnosis of the impairment the person has,but rather on the effect of that impairment on the life of the individual.
an individualized assessment of the effect of an impairment is particularly necessary when the impairment is one whose symptoms vary widely from person to person.carpal tunnel syndrome,one of the plaintiff impairments,is just such a condition.while cases of severe carpal tunnel syndrome are characterized by muscle atrophy and extreme sensory deficits,mild cases generally do not have either of these effects and create only intermittent symptoms of numbness and tingling studies have further shown that,even without surgical treatment,one quarter of carpal tunnel cases resolve in one month,but that in percent of cases,symptoms last for eight years or longer given these large potential differences in the severity and duration of the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome,an individual carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis,on its own,does not indicate whether the individual has a disability within the meaning of the ada.toyota motor,williams,d,citations omitted.that arteaga was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome after leaving brink does not mean he had a physical disability while there or,for that matter,at any time.the evidence establishes he was not disabled before or during his employment at brink.
last,arteaga complains that brink discriminated against him by not transferring him to another position.but a n employee can not demand clairvoyance of his employer.king united parcel service,th,d.first,the employee has a duty to inform the employer that he has a disability.raine city of burbank th,d.a n employer is not ordinarily liable for failing to accommodate a disability of which it had no knowledge.king,at,d.brink had no knowledge of a disability because,as we have explained,arteaga did not have one.the company eventually learned that arteaga had pain and numbness,but those symptoms did not interfere with the performance of his job.nor did arteaga have an alleged disability that was obvious or visible,such as blindness or paralysis.see williamson international paper d,rogers hill,d.second,t he employee ca expect the employer to read his mind and know he secretly wanted a particular accommodation and sue the employer for not providing it it is an employee responsibility to understand his or her own physical or mental condition well enough to present the employer at the earliest opportunity with a concise list of restrictions which must be met to accommodate the employee.king,at,d,italics added,citation omitted.arteaga waited at least a year,possibly two,to notify brink of his alleged disability,and his request for a job demotion to a guard based on his desire to avoid responsibility for shortages,not on his physical condition.
record or history of disability 
given that arteaga did not have a disease,disorder,condition,cosmetic disfigurement,anatomical loss,or health impairment constituting a physical or during his employment at brink he could not have been the victim of discrimination for having a known record or history of that sort.see,subd.k.
perceived disability 
nor did brink regard or treat arteaga as if he had a physical condition,past or present,that made achievement of a major life activity difficult.see,subd.k.his medical august and march that arteaga was in good health.brink had no reason to believe otherwise.the company did not mistakenly conclude that arteaga had,or previously had,a condition that made working difficult,nor did it mistakenly believe that any nonlimiting condition made it difficult for him to work.see sutton united air lines,d.as far as brink was concerned,arteaga was simply complaining about pain and numbness that had been coming and going for a year or more,but which did not affect the achievement of his job duties.
potential disability 
brink did not regard or treat arteaga as having a disease,disorder,condition,or health impairment,past or present,that might become a physical disability.see,subd.k.arteaga never indicated that the number or severity of his symptoms had increased over time.to hear arteaga tell it,the same symptoms had been somewhat intermittent i thought the pain was going away and,when the pain and numbness resurfaced,their severity was unchanged.in short,there was no indication arteaga symptoms were getting,or might get,worse.he was still suffering from pain in his arms and shoulders as well as numbness in his fingers and arms when he accepted employment after he left brink.yet he took a virtually identical job at sectran,albeit one that involved shipments containing fewer coins and more paper.at sectran,arteaga performed well and had no difficulty.we can not say that brink took any action against arteaga based on a concern about a possible future disability.
arteaga discusses the feha prohibition against potential disability discrimination as if the existence of the statute alone were sufficient to prove liability.but facts are needed to show that the stat
