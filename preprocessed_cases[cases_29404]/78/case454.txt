ryan pettigrew filed a petition for a writ of review in this court pursuant to labor code section hereafter all statutory references are to the labor code to challenge a decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab denying his claim for workers compensation benefits et.we issued a writ of review directing the wcab to submit the administrative record for review by this court.
pettigrew contends he is entitled to workers compensation benefits for injuries he sustained when he stopped to help at an accident scene he came upon on his way to work as a correctional officer for the state of california,department of corrections and rehabilitation,california medical facility doc.
the workers compensation judge wcj and the wcab found that pettigrew was not acting as a peace officer at the time he stopped at the accident and that his job duties did not require him to stop and render aid and,therefore,pettigrew was not within the course and scope of his employment when he was injured.having reviewed the administrative record,we appreciate pettigrew efforts to give assistance to those involved in the accident,but we find no reason to disturb the findings and conclusions of the wcab.we affirm the order.
facts and proceedings 
on april,at approximately,pettigrew was driving to work on interstate,when he came upon and stopped to help at the place of a accident.while helping an injured person,pettigrew was near a parked truck,which was hit by an oncoming car.the impact drove the truck into pettigrew and he himself was injured.
pettigrew was and is employed as a state correctional officer in a prison.his job is safety and security of people in the prison fellow officers,inmates,medical staff.he has no job duties outside the prison but did take a general oath to protect and serve the public.his duty day begins when he drives onto the prison grounds,but he does not start getting paid until he signs in on a log sheet.his work shift that day was to start at 
as pettigrew drove to work on april,he was wearing his correctional officer uniform a green jumpsuit beneath a cover jacket that was customary for correctional officers to wear to hide the uniform for their own safety.at the accident scene,pettigrew removed his cover jacket,exposing his uniform,so people would know he was there to help.
pettigrew testified at the administrative hearing that he stopped at the accident scene because he saw several correctional officers persons wearing green jumpsuits standing on the side of the highway and thought someone might need help.he had learned first aid through his employment.he had received doc training regarding law enforcement ethics and correctional officer ethics.
the ethics cadet workbook contained a correctional worker code of ethics,stating in part,my primary concern is to serve mankind to be ever mindful of the responsibilities entrusted in me by my fellow citizens to protect the lives of those placed in my charge to safeguard the weak against oppression or intimidation,and the peaceful against violence or disorder.my private and official life will exemplify honesty,integrity,compassion,and 
the workbook also contained the law enforcement code of ethics,which said in part as a law enforcement officer,my fundamental duty is to serve mankind to safeguard lives and property the workbook stated as an objective you will be able to identify that law enforcement ethics govern the selection,training,and evaluation of correctional peace officers.
pettigrew also had taken an oath to protect and serve the public,as well as protect and serve correctional officers and inmates at the job.
pettigrew testified at the academy,i believe they told us that if you were ever a witness to a crime or there was,like,a real bad accident in front of you,that if you did stop and help,that the institution would give you institutional time off for that time that you have missed work.when asked what he meant by institutional time off,pettigrew said,they would not dock your pay.they would code it as,i believe,it institutional time off,ito that,basically,does come out of your sick time or vacation time.it,basically,like a credit from the department.
pettigrew did not introduce any evidence that he was paid with institutional time off for assisting at the accident.
as pettigrew approached the place of the accident,he did not speak with any officer.instead,pettigrew instructed a man with an injured eye to lie down in the back seat of his car until further assistance arrived.pettigrew then turned to assess the condition of a woman.he was shining his light on an unlit parked truck,into which another correctional officer mark hook was leaning in order to turn on its hazard lights.an approaching vehicle struck the truck,causing a vehicle to be pushed into pettigrew.he was projected into the air and landed on the other side of the freeway.
pettigrew later received a rotary club officer of the year award for his assistance at the accident scene.
officer hook testified he did not file a workers compensation claim and did not receive paid institutional time off for the seven days he missed from work due to the injuries he sustained at the accident scene.
correctional sergeant michael amaro testified that he could see where parts of correctional officer training lesson plans can be interpreted as obligating officers to stop at the scene of an accident,but when asked for specifics,he could not think of any specific parts of the lesson plans that would suggest that.
correctional lieutenant steven norris testified he worked at the same facility as pettigrew and,although they were told in training not to wear their uniforms offsite,the institution was aware and accepted that some employees commuted to and from work wearing their uniform under a cover jacket.norris said that,once he left the institution premises,he was no longer a correctional officer but was a private citizen.norris testified as follows 
okay.if an officer at your institution had stopped to render assistance at an accident on the freeway,such as these officers did on april,and that act made them late to work,would they be docked 
if,on their reporting to the institution,this happened to cause them to be late,no.
norris explained,upon us learning why they were late,because of an accident and assisting,they would not be per se docked.they would not,at that point,lose pay for reporting to work late.
norris said officers like him are paid hourly wages.docking is a process handled by the personnel department,and norris did not know that process.when asked if there was a policy for correctional officers to be compensated for time spent rendering assistance at an accident outside of the prison,norris said,not to my knowledge.he also said,it been my training that a correctional officer begins his performance of his duties when he enters institutional grounds,is that of a peace officer.when he leaves grounds,he has left it there.he goes back to being a citizen.
the wcj issued a written findings and order and opinion on decision,concluding pettigrew was not entitled to workers compensation benefits,because the injuries neither arose out of,nor occurred in the course of,his employment.
the opinion on decision said the applicant has no peace officer status outside the grounds of the institution unless he is on duty at the time.there is no evidence that he was on scheduled duty,and there is no argument that stopping at the accident scene had the effect of placing him on duty.the applicant does contend he is required to stop and render aid at an accident scene,and more specifically,render aid if an officer is in danger or has been injured.
the clear weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that the applicant had no duties at the accident scene.hoff testified that the applicant was a private citizen while off the grounds of the institution.norris agreed,but he did say a correctional officer would not lose pay if he or she were tardy because of stopping at an accident scene to render aid.amaro was unable to come up with anything which would lead him to believe that a correctional officer is required to stop and assist another correcti
