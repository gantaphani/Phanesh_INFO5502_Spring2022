in these consolidated cases,employees of nonsubscribers to workers compensation insurance under the texas workers compensation act voluntarily elected to participate in employer benefit plans that provide injured employees specified benefits in lieu of remedies.we must decide whether the workers compensation act prohibits voluntary agreements of this type and,if not,whether we should hold them void on public policy grounds because they undermine the legislature workers compensation scheme.in lawrence cdb services,we must also decide whether the waiver signed by the employee meets the and tests.
we discern no clear legislative intent to prohibit agreements such as those presented here.although the parties and various amici have raised numerous public policy considerations favoring both sides of the issue,we believe these policy choices are best resolved by the legislature.absent any clear indication of legislative intent to prohibit such agreements,we decline to hold them void on public policy grounds.finally,we hold that the waiver lawrence executed satisfies the and tests.accordingly,we affirm the court of appeals judgments upholding summary judgments in favor of the employers.
lawrence cdb services.
at all times relevant to these proceedings,cdb services was a nonsubscriber under the texas workers compensation act.instead of opting into the statutory workers compensation scheme,cdb adopted an employee benefit plan that provides medical disability,dismemberment,and death benefits for its eligible employees who choose to participate in the plan.on his first day of employment with cdb,gary lawrence signed an election to participate in the plan.that election provided 
by executing this document,i voluntarily elect to participate in the cdb services,employee benefit plan and trust the plan.according to the plan,i agree that by accepting benefits under the plan or executing this election form indicating an election to participate in the plan 
i agree to the plan terms.
i waive any right i may have to recover from cdb services,the employer,or any of its affiliated employers,directors,officers,shareholders,employees,and agents for injuries i sustain or for my death if they arise out of and within the course and scope of my employment with employer or any affiliated employers.
i acknowledge that,if i am injured or killed in the course and scope of my employment,my only relief against employer or any of its affiliated employers,directors,officers,shareholders,employees,and agents will be to receive the benefits provided by the plan.
i understand that by electing to participate in the plan,i will lose any right that i may have had to sue employer or any of its affiliated employers,directors,officers,shareholders,employees,and agents because of any injuries,illness,or death i sustain in my employment with employer or any of its affiliated employers resulting from their negligence or any other conduct actionable under the common law of the state of texas,the statutes of the state of texas,or under any otherwise available equitable relief.my only remedy will be to pursue benefits under the plan.executing this election involves the waiver and release of valuable legal rights.
in original.the election further recites that lawrence did not sign the election under duress,he received a summary plan description,no person made any representation to him on behalf of cdb or its affiliated employers that influenced him to sign the election,lawrence signed the election of his own free will,he had the option of seeking professional advice before executing the election and had consulted an attorney to the extent he deemed necessary,and he understood the language in the election.lawrence does not claim that he was forced to sign the election under duress or that his decision to participate in the plan was anything other than voluntary.
less than a month after signing the election,lawrence was injured on the job.he began receiving benefits under the cdb plan,and the record reflects that those benefits have continued.about seven months after he was injured,lawrence sued cdb alleging that his injury was caused by cdb negligence and negligence per se.cdb moved for summary judgment on the basis of waiver,election of remedies,release,and estoppel by acceptance of benefits.the trial court granted the motion,and the court of appeals affirmed,holding that the employee waiver did not violate any public policy expressed in the workers compensation act.at.
lambert affiliated foods.
affiliated foods,a nonsubscriber to the workers compensation insurance program,employed danny lee lambert in may.although affiliated did not have workers compensation coverage,it had an employee disability plan that provided certain medical,disability,and death benefits to injured employees who agreed to release and waive any claims against their employer.the waiver recited 
i understand that by execution of this document,i will lose the right to sue affiliated foods.and people employed by it in connection with injuries,illness or death sustained in my employment with affiliated food.as a result of its or their negligence or other actionable conduct.my only remedy will be to benefits under the plan.
execution of this document involves the waiver and release of valuable legal rights.
in original.the election also recites that lambert executed the document voluntarily and without duress,no representation by affiliated induced him to execute the document,he carefully read and understood the document,he signed the document of his own free will and with knowledge of the consequences,and he had consulted an attorney to the extent he deemed necessary.like lawrence,lambert does not claim that his election was in any way forced upon him or was not voluntary.
almost nine months after he signed the waiver,lambert was injured on the job.he received more than in benefits before suing affiliated for negligence and gross negligence.affiliated moved for summary judgment,arguing that lambert had waived and released his claims by signing the election he had ratified the waiver by accepting benefits under the plan and he was estopped from suing affiliated because he had accepted plan benefits.the trial court granted affiliated motion.the court of appeals affirmed,holding that the election was not void as against public policy.at.
c.other cases 
these two cases are not the only ones to present the issue before us today.recently,in wolfe,no pet,the fifth court of appeals held that voluntary participation by a nonsubscriber employee in an employer benefit plan in exchange for a waiver of the right to sue was neither prohibited by the workers compensation act nor contrary to public policy.on the other hand,in reyes storage processors,antonio,pet.denied,the fourth court of appeals held that an employee agreement to waive all claims for injuries in exchange for benefits was void on public policy grounds because the employer benefits were inferior to those provided under the workers compensation statute.the third court of appeals followed the reyes court reasoning in castellow swiftex,no pet,holding that the employee waiver of common law rights was unenforceable because the benefits offered under the employer plan were inferior to statutory workers compensation benefits.we granted these petitions to resolve this conflict among the courts of appeals.
no prohibition under the act 
petitioners argue that section of the workers compensation act prohibits their nonsubscribing employers from asserting waiver as a defense.that section provides 
a in an action against an employer who does not have workers compensation insurance coverage to recover damages for personal injuries or death sustained by an employee in the course and scope of the employment,it is not a defense that 
the employee was guilty of contributory negligence 
the employee assumed the risk of injury or death or 
the injury or death was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee.
b this section does not reinstate or otherwise affect the availability of defenses at common law,including the defenses described by subsection a.
c the employer may defend the action on the ground that the injury was caused 
by an act of the employee intended to bring about the injury or 
while the employee was in a state of intoxication.
d in an action described by subsection a against an employer who does not have workers compensation insurance coverage,the plaintiff must prove negligence of the employer or of an agent or servant of the employer acting within the general scope of the agent or servant employment.
petitioners contend that the act prohibits their employers from asserting waiver as a defense because section c contains an exclusive list of defenses available to nonsubscribers and does not mention waiver.by enforcing their waivers,petitioners contend,we would be adding a defense not allowed by the statute.alternatively,they argue that their waivers essentially require them to assume the risk of their own injuries and thus violate section a.petitioners cite a number of cases to support their positions,but none addresses the precise situation presented here.
for example,petitioners cite kroger keng,to support their argument that the act abolishes all defenses except those enumerated in section c.but our decision in kroger was not so broad we held that a nonsubscribing employer could not submit a issue because the issue necessarily required a threshold determination that the employee negligence was a contributing cause of the injury,which the legislature expressly prohibited.kroger,at.permitting submission of the employee comparative fault would be contrary to the legislature clear intent that an employee fault would neither defeat nor diminish his or her recovery.id.at.
in contrast,the statute reveals no clear legislative intent to preclude an employer from asserting the affirmative defense of waiver.there is,admittedly,some tension between the enumeration of prohibited defenses in section a and the list of available defenses identified in section c both lists can not be exclusive.that the employers also rely on section highlights this tension.they emphasize subsection a,which lists defenses that are not available to a nonsubscriber.because the defense of waiver is not specifically prohibited,they contend that our failure to allow this defense would be adding a prohibited defense to the statute.
we do not believe that the legislature purpose in enacting subsection c was to provide an exhaustive list of defenses available to nonsubscribers.instead,by enacting subsection c,the legislature clearly indicated that it did not intend subsection a,which lists defenses based on an employee or fellow employee fault that would otherwise defeat or diminish recovery,to protect employees injured as a result of their own intoxication or their own intent to bring about the injury but for the exceptions expressly identified in subsection c,subsection a prohibition of the contributory negligence defense might arguably prevent an employer from asserting as a defense its employee intoxication or intent to cause the injury.unlike the issue in kroger,the contractual waivers before us today do not implicate the employees fault and are therefore not clearly within section purview.if the legislature had intended section c defenses to be exclusive,or section a prohibited defenses to be broader,it could have easily said so.the waiver defense is simply not addressed in section,either as a prohibited or a permitted defense.
to support their contention that subsection c defenses are exclusive,petitioners rely in part on our statement in texas workers compensation commission garcia that the act abolish ed all the traditional common law defenses for subscribers,emphasis added.but that statement,albeit broad,must be read in context.it appears in our discussion of the act history,and follows a paragraph in which we identified the specific negligence,assumption of the risk,and fellow employers had routinely invoked to defeat injured employees claims before the act passage.see id.we discouraged reliance on this dicta in kroger,emphasizing that garcia dealt with an challenge to the act,not section scope or interpretation.at.we did not intend in garcia to suggest that section c eliminated every conceivable defense in suits against nonsubscribers.while the petitioners cite several courts of appeals decisions also broadly stating that a nonsubscribing employer only defense is to show that the employer was not negligent,those decisions generally involve attempts to submit defensive legal theories that were necessarily foreclosed as a result of the act express prohibitions,like the defense in kroger.see brookshire,wagnon,no writ potter garner,writ ref skelly oil carter,no writ sears,roebuck robinson,aff.
petitioners next argue that enforcing their waivers would be inconsistent with section a,which prohibits a nonsubscriber from asserting an defense,and with at least two of our decisions that prohibited an employer from shifting liability for injuries and safety to the employee,barnhart kansas city,mexico orient railway of texas,and clevenger burgess,writ ref.but section a does not speak to an employee voluntary agreement to waive claims against an employer in exchange for prescribed benefits.rather,it precludes an employer from asserting that an employee negligence claim is barred because the employee voluntarily exposed him or herself to a danger inherent in the work.see farley m m cattle.and in barnhart,we merely held that an employer may not require an employee to agree to assume the risk of an injury as a condition of employment.barnhart,at.clevenger is similarly inapposite.there,the nonsubscribing employer had paid his injured employee an extra dollar per day over his regular wages,which the employer contended was sufficient to allow the employee to insure himself against injuries.the employer claimed that,by accepting the additional pay,the employee assumed the risks ordinarily incident to the work he was doing and the employer had the right to plead all defenses available under the common law.clevenger,at.the record contained no evidence of the waiver agreement,if in fact there was one,because neither party disputed that any such agreement was inadmissible under the version of the act then in effect rather,the employer claimed the workers compensation act unduly interfered with his right to contract and was therefore unconstitutional.we upheld the act constitutionality,stating that t he constitutional right to contract is not infringed by forbidding contracts whereby employers relieve themselves of liability imposed by statute.id.at.once again,clevenger involved a unilateral action by the employer that appears to have been a condition of employment,and did not involve an employee voluntary election of benefits.id.hazelwood mandrell industries,another case petitioners cite,also involved an agreement that was a condition of an employment contract and is similarly distinguishable,dist,writ ref.
in this case,it is undisputed that neither lawrence nor lambert was required to release his claims as a condition of employment.they were free to decline their employers plans,retain their employment,and retain the right to sue for negligent injury,with the inherent risks and uncertainty that might involve.nor do the employers plans shift the risk of injuries to the employees they provide immediate and certain benefits the employers are not otherwise required to provide in exchange for a voluntary relinquishment of the right to sue.this distinction is significant.as one federal court,interpreting texas law,has stated 
the distinction between an employment contract that requires a prospective employee,as a condition to receipt or retention of employment,to agree to limit the employer liability,on one hand,and a voluntary occupational insurance plan,in which the employee has the option to enroll in consideration for agreeing that such plan constitutes the exclusive remedy for job related injuries,on the other,is decisive.
brito intex aviation.the court noted that,as here,the employee had a choice of whether to enroll in the plan,and his employment status would be unaffected by that choice.id.if he chose to enroll,the employee was not required to prove his employer negligence to receive benefits for injuries.id.if he chose not to enroll,he retained his right to recover from his employer without having to overcome his employer defenses.id.accordingly,the court concluded,the main purpose of the act,to protect and benefit the employee,is not contravened by the existence of the plan and its concomitant waiver.id.
in sum,we find the act itself does not expressly prohibit the elections signed by lawrence and lambert.thus,we must enforce them as we would any other contract unless they should be held void on public policy grounds because they contravene the workers compensation scheme.
public policy concerns 
petitioners argue that enforcing their elections would contravene the workers compensation scheme because their employers would then enjoy the benefits the act bestows upon subscribers without having to provide their employees equivalent statutory benefits.the courts of appeals in reyes and castellow agreed,holding that such waivers violate public policy when the benefits are more limited than those provided by workers compensation insurance.reyes,at castellow,at.those courts engaged in a substantive comparison of the respective benefits and concluded that the benefits were inferior to those provided under the act and were therefore void.
we believe that courts engaging in such a qualitative,evaluation is.first,such an analysis is premised on the questionable presumption that the various benefits can in fact be compared.in lambert affiliated foods,for example,the employer plan provides coverage for nonoccupational injuries,a benefit not conferred by the act and one that an employee might consider far more valuable than other statutory benefits.on the other hand,several amici argue that employers can never offer a combination of benefits and rights equivalent to what the act intends because employees of nonsubscribers are not protected from an employer or its insurer potential insolvency to the extent that employees receiving workers compensation benefits are.tex.and,they claim,such waivers generally purport to deprive an employee survivors of their right to seek exemplary damages for an employee death caused by an employer gross negligence,which is preserved under the act.see.these arguments highlight the difficulties inherent in quantifying and measuring such intangible benefits.indeed,the court of appeals in lambert concluded that the employer plan was not capable of comparison with the statutory workers compensation plan.at.
in addition,deciding whether one set of benefits is substantially equivalent to another presents a number of practical concerns.for instance,lambert employer claims its package of benefits in fact affords broader coverage than workers compensation insurance because,among other things,it covers nonoccupational injuries.lambert,on the other hand,contends that his employer plan does not provide benefits equal to those offered under the act because,among other things,it does not provide for lifetime medical benefits.assuming that different benefits such as these are even capable of comparison,should expert economic testimony regarding the relative equivalency of benefits be presented in each case and who should or jury hinging the validity of plans upon a analysis fosters unpredictability of outcome and undermines judicial economy.but more importantly,weighing the substantive equivalency of benefits involves competing policy considerations that courts are to address.because the act itself provides no clear guidance on this issue,we believe the balance must be drawn by the legislature.
petitioners argue that we should declare these waivers void because they undermine the act general scheme if employee waivers such as these are not prohibited,they argue,employers will have no incentive to subscribe to workers compensation insurance and the system established under the act will be crippled.it is true that the act discourages employers from choosing nonsubscriber status by abolishing their defenses of contributory negligence,assumption of the risk,and fellow servant.see kroger,at.on the other hand,from its inception,participation in the act has been voluntary.see tex.a middleton.power light.unlike workers compensation laws in every other state,the texas act allows employers to choose whether to become a subscriber.see tex.research and oversight council on workers compensation,controversy over the effect of waivers used by nonsubscribers,texas monitor,spring.employees,too,have a choice under our statutory scheme.employees of subscribing employers may choose to opt out of the system and retain their rights in the event they are injured on the job.b.thus,our legislature has decided to make participation in the workers compensation system voluntary and elective as to both employer and employee.see paradissis royal indem.allowing employees of nonsubscribers additional choices does not in itself violate the legislative scheme.
in addition to the policy concerns raised by petitioners,several amici have weighed in both supporting and opposing these waivers on numerous,competing public policy grounds those opposing the waivers argue that the waivers violate public policy by allowing employers to escape liability by offering benefits that are inherently inferior because benefits may be provided by entities that are unregulated and that may become insolvent.at the same time,they argue,these plans are not subject to the protective mechanisms that the act provides to ensure that claims disputes are fairly resolved,do not protect workers from being terminated for filing claims,and often do not allow injured employees to freely choose their treating physicians.they also contend that the waivers are not generally truly voluntary because workers feel compelled to sign them.
amici supporting waivers,on the other hand,raise a number of countervailing policy concerns.they contend that allowing waivers will result in increased benefits for injured employees,and that insurance from a number of financially strong companies is available to provide those superior benefits.they cite statistics suggesting that few subscribers will be influenced to leave the workers compensation system if the waivers are upheld,and contend that benefits currently offered under some plans will be reduced if the waivers are struck down.they claim that waivers such as these have been used by employers for years,and that invalidating them will upset the status quo.and,they argue,there is no evidence that waivers have been or will be used abusively.to the contrary,employees who decide to sign waivers are actually exercising an informed,intentional choice.these amici claim that traditional contract defenses,as well as the employee retirement income security act of,protect employees from employers using waivers abusively.
to these policy concerns,we add another we do not know how many injured employees in texas are currently receiving benefits provided by their employers under similar plans.several amici suggest that there are a significant number.were we to invalidate such plans on public policy grounds,these employees might lose their benefits yet no longer be able to assert claims because of limitations problems.
we recognize that the legislature designed the workers compensation scheme to encourage employer participation.see,kroger,at garcia,at.we also recognize that enforcing waivers like those presented today might discourage employer participation in the workers compensation system and present the problems articulated by some of the amici.but,while the legislature has created statutory incentives to encourage participation,participation remains voluntary.as a judicial body,we are to evaluate the likely consequences of invalidating the agreements before us.
undoubtedly,the issue we face raises critical and complex public policy issues.and the administration of the workers compensation system is heavily imbued with public policy concerns.see james vernon calhoun packing,quoting employers indem.woods.comm app,judgm t adopted.at the same time,we have long recognized a strong public policy in favor of preserving the freedom of contract.see wood motor nebel.courts must exercise judicial restraint in deciding whether to hold arm length contracts void on public policy grounds 
public policy,some courts have said,is a term of vague and uncertain meaning,which it pertains to the power to define,and courts are apt to encroach upon the domain of that branch of the government if they characterize a transaction as invalid because it is contrary to public policy,unless the transaction contravenes some positive statute or some rule of law.
sherrill union lumber,no writ quoting ruling case law,at.given the lack of any clear legislative intent to prohibit agreements like the ones before us,and absent any claim by the petitioners of fraud,duress,accident,mistake,or failure or inadequacy of consideration,we decline to declare them void on public policy grounds.we believe the,competing public policy concerns raised by the parties and by amici in these cases are not clearly resolved by the statute and are best resolved by the legislature,not the judiciary.
express notice 
lawrence additionally argues that his release of claims against cdb is unenforceable because it does not meet the or tests.lawrence release of claims against cdb for cdb own negligence can be enforced only if it meets two fair notice requirements.first,the parties intent that cdb was to be released from liability for cdb own future negligence must be expressed in unambiguous terms within the four corners of the release.see littlefield schaefer.second,the releasing language must be conspicuous.id.whether a release is conspicuous is a question of law.id.language that appears in contrasting type or in capitals satisfies the conspicuousness requirement.id.at.we agree with the court of appeals that cdb election meets both the and requirements.see id.at dresser,page petroleum,ethyl daniel constr.
conclusion 
the texas workers compensation act neither clearly prohibits nor clearly allows voluntary employee elections to participate in nonsubscribing employers benefit plans in lieu of exercising remedies.and whether or not such elections should be held void on the theory that they contravene the general statutory scheme and thus violate public policy is a decision that we believe,absent clear legislative guidance and in light of numerous competing public policy concerns,is better left to the legislature.accordingly,we decline to invalidate the petitioners elections on public policy grounds and affirm the court of appeals judgments.
for years workers compensation legislation has provided a compensation scheme to encourage employers participation in the workers compensation system and to ensure all injured employees adequate redress.today,by declining to invalidate the waivers at issue on public policy grounds,the court ignores the texas workers compensation act statutory scheme and its established underlying public policies.instead,the court elects to defer to the legislature to resolve what the court improperly calls competing public policy concerns.at.because the court choice is contrary to the decision the legislature has already made and embodied in the act,i dissent.
applicable lawa.the workers compensation act 
in,the texas legislature enacted workers compensation legislation to meet the needs of an increasingly industrialized society.texas workers comp.comm garcia.at the time,despite the rising number of workplace injuries,most employees were denied any recovery because it was difficult to establish workplace negligence and employers invoked complete defenses,such as contributory negligence,assumption of the risk,and fellow servant,to bar negligence claims.see garcia,at.consequently,the legislature passed the first workers compensation legislation with the general purpose of working an important change in the law in regard to the liability of employers for personal injuries to their employees,or for death resulting from such injuries,and the compensation afforded therefor to employees or their beneficiaries.middleton texas power light.
in,the legislature passed the texas workers compensation act to resolve problems with existing legislation.garcia,at.however,the provisions governing compensation for injured employees have remained largely unchanged since the early.see kroger keng,describing workers compensation legislation in garcia,at noting that the act carries forward the general scheme of the former act.under the act,an injured employee whose employer subscribes to workers compensation insurance may recover benefits without regard to the employer fault or the employee negligence.see tex,kroger,at.in exchange,the employee may not bring claims against the subscribing employer.see james vernon calhoun packing,stating that the act provides an exclusive remedy for those who accept its provisions.alternatively,an injured employee may retain the right to assert claims against a subscribing employer if the employee timely elected in writing to waive workers compensation insurance coverage.see tex.b.in those instances,the employer may raise all defenses.see tex.d.
the act also gives employers the option not to subscribe to workers compensation insurance.see tex.nonsubscribing employers employees retain the right to bring claims against their employers.see tex.in defending against such claims,however,a nonsubscribing employer loses all traditional defenses.tex.a kroger,at garcia,at.thus,the act encourages employers to subscribe and penalizes those who do not.kroger,at.
contracts and public policy 
on several occasions,we have held otherwise contracts void because they were contrary to public policy.see,juliette fowler homes,welch,unreasonable covenant not to compete desantis wackenhut,same puckett fire ins,policy allowing insurer to avoid plane crash liability due to insured technical breach crowell housing auth.of dallas,lease provision waiving landlord tort liability to tenant.in doing so,we recognized that the state expresses its public policy in its statutes.see national county mut.fire ins.johnson,holding insurance policy with exclusion void because it conflicts with public policy underlying texas motor vehicle act sabine pilot,hauck,holding employment termination for refusal to perform illegal act contrary to public policy expressed in state and federal criminal laws.thus,to determine whether a contract violates public policy,we consider the policies underlying any applicable statutes.
whether a contract violates public policy is a question of law,which we review de novo.barber colorado,insurance of am.easton.generally,if a contract violates public policy,it is void,not merely voidable.see,tom scott,mcilhany,holding agreement to redesignate opponent expert witnesses ineffective continental fire cas.ins.american,worth,writ ref explaining that it is the law that contracts prohibited by statute,either expressly or impliedly,are void.estoppel and ratification doctrines will not make a contract that violates public policy enforceable.see,continental fire cas.ins,at an illegal contract can not be ratified by either party.richmond printing port of houston,dist,no pet.as a general rule,void contracts can not be ratified.ex parte payne,no writ since the contract was void,neither party was bound thereby,and thus estoppel by contract could not arise in this case.
the act provides a comprehensive compensation system with two methods by which employers can handle workplace injuries an employer may elect to provide workers compensation insurance coverage,thereby barring an injured employee claims unless the employee timely elected to waive coverage or an employer may choose not to carry workers compensation insurance,remain subject to an injured employees claims,and waive traditional defenses.see tex.the legislature created the compensation system to encourage subscription and delineate explicitly the structure of an employee personal injury action against his or her nonsubscribing employer.kroger,at.
in garcia,this court considered the act compensation scheme critical in resolving constitutional challenges to the statute.at holding that the act does not violate texas open courts guarantee because it assures that injur
