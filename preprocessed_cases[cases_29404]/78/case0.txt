petitioner pacific operators offshore,llp pacific,operates two drilling platforms on the outer continental shelf ocs off the california coast and an onshore oil and gas processing facility.employee juan valladolid spent percent of his time working on an offshore platform,but he was killed in an accident while working at the onshore facility.his widow,a respondent here,sought benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,et,pursuant to the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla,which extends lhwca coverage to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the ocs for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the shelf,b.the administrative law judge dismissed her claim,reasoning that b did not cover valladolid fatal injury because his accident occurred on land,not on the ocs.the labor department benefits review board affirmed,but the ninth circuit reversed.rejecting tests used by the third and the fifth circuits,the ninth circuit concluded that a claimant seeking benefits under the ocsla must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf.
held the ocsla extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employer extractive operations on the ocs.
a the courts of appeals have offered competing interpretations of b scope.according to the third circuit,because congress intended lhwca coverage to be expansive,b extends to all injuries that would not have occurred but for operations on the ocs.thus,an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,but who died in a car accident on his way to board a helicopter to be flown to the rig,was eligible for benefits because he would not have been injured but for his traveling to the rig.in contrast,the fifth circuit has concluded that congress intended to establish a geographic boundary,extending b coverage only to employees whose injuries or death occurred on an ocs platform or the waters above the ocs.under its test,a welder injured on land while constructing an offshore oil platform was ineligible for b benefits.in the decision below,the ninth circuit held that b extends coverage to injured workers who can establish a substantial nexus between their injury and extractive operations on the ocs.the solicitor general offers a fourth interpretation,which would provide coverage for injuries only to those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the ocs and who perform work on the ocs itself that is substantial in both duration and nature.
b contrary to pacific position,the fifth circuit test is not the best interpretation of b.
nothing in the text of b suggests that an injury must occur on the ocs.the provision has only two requirements the extractive operations must be conducted on the ocs,and the employee injury must occur as the result of those operations.if,as pacific suggests,the purpose of b was to geographically limit the scope of ocsla coverage to injuries that occur on the ocs,congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting from b the words as the result of operations conducted.moreover,congress decision to specify situs limitations in other subsections,but not in b,indicates that it did not intend to so limit b.this conclusion is not foreclosed by herb welding,gray,or offshore logistics,tallentire,neither of which held that b coverage was limited to injuries.section b text also gives no indication that congress intended to exclude ocs workers who are eligible for state benefits from lhwca coverage.to the contrary,the lhwca scheme incorporated by the ocsla explicitly anticipates that injured employees might be eligible for both state and federal benefits.
also unpersuasive is pacific alternative argument that b imports the lhwca strict requirement,which provides benefits only for injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states,a.it is unlikely that congress intended to restrict the scope of the ocsla workers compensation scheme through a nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative acts.in addition,under pacific alternative theory,lhwca coverage would not be extended to the navigable waters above the shelf.thus,even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an ocs platform who are injured in a platform explosion would be excluded from b coverage.that view can not be squared with b language.
pacific policy concerns also can not justify an interpretation of b that is inconsistent with the ocsla text.
c neither the solicitor general inquiry nor the third circuit but for test are compatible with b.the solicitor general inquiry has no basis in the ocsla text,because b occurring as the result of operations language plainly suggests causation.and when taken to its logical conclusion,the third circuit test,though nominally based on causation,is essentially a inquiry because it would extend coverage to all employees of a business engaged in extracting natural resources from the ocs,no matter where those employees work or what they are doing at the time of injury.because lhwca coverage was extended only to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the ocs,b focus should be on injuries resulting from those operations.
d the ninth circuit test is more faithful to b text.this court understands that test to require the injured employee to establish a significant causal link between his injury and his employer extractive operations.the test may not be the easiest to administer,but administrative law judges and courts should be able to determine if an injured employee has established the required significant causal link.whether an employee injured while performing an task qualifies will depend on the circumstances of each case.it was thus proper for the ninth circuit to remand this case for the benefits review board to apply the test.
affirmed and remanded.

pacific operators offshore,llp,et,petitioners luisa valladolid et.
on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
justice thomas delivered the opinion of the court.
the outer continental shelf lands act ocsla extends the federal workers compensation scheme established in the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca,et,to injuries occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf for the purpose of extracting natural resources from the shelf.b.the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit determined that the ocsla extends coverage to an employee who can establish a substantial nexus between his injury and his employer extractive operations on the outer continental shelf.we affirm.
petitioner pacific operators offshore,llp pacific,operates two drilling platforms on the outer continental shelf off the coast of california and an onshore oil and gas processing facility in ventura county,california.pacific employed juan valladolid as a general manual laborer known in the trade as a roustabout in its oil exploration and extraction business.valladolid spent about percent of his time on one of pacific offshore drilling platforms performing maintenance duties,such as picking up litter,emptying trashcans,washing decks,painting,maintaining equipment,and helping to load and unload the platform crane.valladolid spent the remainder of his time working at pacific onshore processing facility,where he also performed maintenance duties,including painting,sandblasting,pulling weeds,cleaning drain,and operating a forklift.
while on duty at the onshore facility,valladolid died in a forklift accident.his widow,a respondent here,filed a claim for benefits under the lhwca pursuant to the extension of that act contained within the ocsla.the ocsla provides,in relevant part 
with respect to disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf for the purpose of exploring for,developing,removing,or transporting by pipeline the natural resources,or involving rights to the natural resources,of the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf,compensation shall be payable under the provisions of the lhwca.b.
after a hearing,an administrative law judge alj dismissed respondent claim.the alj reasoned that valladolid fatal injury was not covered under b because his accident occurred on land,rather than on the outer continental shelf.on appeal,the united states department of labor benefits review board affirmed,concluding that congress intended to limit the coverage provided by the ocsla to injuries suffered by employees within the geographical locale of the outer continental shelf.pacific operations offshore,llp,brbs,per curiam.
the ninth circuit reversed,holding that b neither contains a requirement,as the fifth circuit has held,nor imposes a but for causation requirement,as the third circuit has held.see,rejecting the holdings of mills director,office of workers compensation programs,en banc curtis schlumberger offshore service.instead,the ninth circuit concluded that the claimant must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and operations on the shelf to qualify for workers compensation benefits under the ocsla,at.we granted pacific petition for a writ of certiorari to resolve this conflict.
in,congress enacted the submerged lands act,stat,et,which extended the boundaries of coastal states three geographic miles into the atlantic and pacific oceans and three marine leagues into the gulf of mexico.at the same time,congress enacted the ocsla,affirming the federal government authority and control over the outer continental shelf,defined as the submerged lands subject to the jurisdiction and control of the united states lying seaward and outside of the submerged lands within the extended state.stat,a.as defined by the ocsla,the outer continental shelf includes the submerged lands beyond the extended state boundaries,a,but not the waters above those submerged lands or artificial islands or installations attached to the seabed.for simplicity sake,we refer to the entire geographical zone as the ocs.
section extends various provisions of state and federal law to certain aspects of the ocs.for example,a extends the constitution and federal laws of civil and political jurisdiction to the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf and to all artificial islands,and all installations and other devices permanently or temporarily attached to the seabed,for the purpose of extracting its natural resources.section a a makes the civil and criminal laws of each adjacent state applicable to that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf,and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon,which would be within the area of the state if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer continental shelf.section b,the provision involved in this case,makes lhwca workers compensation benefits available for the disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf for the purpose of extracting its natural resources.
the question before us is the scope of coverage under b.the parties agree that b covers employees,such as oil rig and drilling platform workers,who are injured while working directly on the ocs to extract its natural resources.they disagree,however,whether employees who are involved in extraction operations but who are injured beyond the ocs are also covered under the ocsla.this dispute focuses on the meaning of the phrase any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf in b.
the courts of appeals have offered competing interpretations.in curtis schlumberger offshore service,at,the third circuit held that,because congress intended lhwca coverage to be expansive,b extends to all injuries that would not have occurred but for operations on the ocs.the third circuit thus concluded that an employee who worked on a semisubmersible drill rig,but who was killed in a car accident on the way to the helicopter that was to fly him to that rig,was eligible for b benefits,at.as the third circuit summarized,but for curtis travelling to his drill rig for the purpose of conducting operations within b,employee curtis would not have sustained injuries in the automobile accident.at.
in mills director,supra,the fifth circuit,sitting en banc,adopted a narrower interpretation of b.the court concluded that congress intended to establish a geographic boundary for b coverage,and held that b extends coverage only to employees engaged in ocs extractive activities who suffer injury or death on an ocs platform or the waters above the ocs.at.applying its test,the fifth circuit held that a welder who was injured on land during the construction of an offshore oil platform was not eligible for b benefits,at.
in the case below,the ninth circuit rejected the fifth circuit requirement as unsupported by the text of b,and the third circuit but for test as too broad to be consistent with congress intent,at.instead,the ninth circuit adopted a third interpretation of b,holding that a claimant must establish a substantial nexus between the injury and extractive operations on the shelf to be eligible for b benefits,at.to meet the standard,the ninth circuit explained,the claimant must show that the work performed directly furthers outer continental shelf operations and is in the regular course of such operations.ibid.
the solicitor general suggests yet a fourth interpretation of b this interpretation would extend coverage to two categories of injuries all injuries suffered by employees of companies engaged in resource extraction on the ocs and the injuries of those employees who spend a substantial portion of their worktime on the ocs engaging in extractive operations.brief for federal respondent.according to the solicitor general,this test would provide b coverage for injuries only to those employees whose duties contribute to operations on the ocs and who perform work on the ocs itself that is substantial in both duration and nature,at.
pacific argues that the fifth circuit test presents the best interpretation of b.the crux of pacific argument is that injuries can not be the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf for purposes of b.pacific asserts that because valladolid was injured on dry land,his death did not occur as the result of extraction operations conducted on the ocs,and therefore respondent is ineligible for lhwca workers compensation benefits.we disagree.
the ocsla extends the provisions of the lhwca to the disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf.b.contrary to the view of pacific and the fifth circuit,nothing in that language suggests that the injury to the employee must occur on the ocs.section b states only two requirements the extractive operations must be conducted on the outer continental shelf,and the employee injury must occur as the result of those operations.
despite the lack of a textual requirement in b,pacific argues that it is logically impossible for an employee to be injured as the result of operations.pacific offers no basis for this assertion,and we find none.indeed,given that many ocs platforms are physically connected to onshore processing facilities via oil and gas pipelines,it is not difficult to imagine an accident occurring on an ocs platform that could injure employees located off the ocs.
moreover,if,as pacific suggests,the purpose of b was to geographically limit the extension of lhwca coverage to injuries that occurred on the ocs,congress could easily have achieved that goal by omitting the following six words in b text as the result of operations conducted.had congress done so,the statute would extend lhwca coverage to the disability or death of an employee resulting from any injury occurring on the outer continental shelf.but that is not the text of the statute congress enacted.
pacific also argues that,because all of b neighboring subsections contain specific situs limitations,we should infer that congress intended to include a requirement in b.see,a a adopting the civil and criminal laws of the adjacent state as federal law for that portion of the subsoil and seabed of the outer continental shelf,and artificial islands and fixed structures erected thereon,which would be within the area of the state if its boundaries were extended seaward to the outer margin of the outer continental shelf but our usual practice is to make the opposite inference.russello united states,where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.congress decision to specify,in scrupulous detail,exactly where the other subsections of apply,but to include no similar restriction on injuries in b,convinces us that congress did not intend b to apply only to injuries suffered on the ocs.rather,b extends lhwca workers compensation coverage to any employee injury,regardless of where it happens,as long as it occurs as the result of operations conducted on the outer continental shelf.
pacific argues that this conclusion is foreclosed by language in herb welding,gray,and offshore logistics,tallentire,but neither of those cases held that b extends only to injuries that occur on the ocs.in herb welding,this court considered whether an oil platform welder,who worked both within the territorial waters of louisiana and on the ocs,was covered under the lhwca after suffering an injury in the waters of louisiana,at.the court explicitly declined to address whether the employee was eligible for workers compensation benefits under b because that question was neither passed upon by the court of appeals nor fully briefed and argued before this court,at.although the court acknowledged that an employee might walk in and out of workers compensation coverage during his employment due to the explicit geographic limitation to the ocsla incorporation of the lhwca,at,the exact meaning of that statement is unclear.we can not ascertain whether the comment was a reference to b explicit requirement,as respondents suggest,or the recognition of an implicit requirement,as pacific argues.in any event,the ambiguous comment was made without analysis in dicta and does not control this case.
the same is true of the court opinion in offshore logistics.in that case,the court considered whether the widows of oil platform workers who were killed when their helicopter crashed into the high seas could file suits under louisiana law.in the court analysis of,it stated,congress determined that the general scope of ocsla coverage would be determined principally by locale,not by the status of the individual injured or killed.at citing the situs requirement in a a.in a footnote,the court commented only one provision of ocsla superimposes a status requirement on the otherwise determinative ocsla situs requirement b makes compensation for the death or injury of an ployee resulting from certain operations on the outer continental shelf payable under the lhwca.these comments about the scope of the ocsla coverage and its determinative situs requirement do not provide definitive evidence that b applies only to injuries that occur on the ocs.as in herb welding,it is unclear whether the statement in the offshore logistics footnote regarding b was referring to the explicit requirement or to an implicit requirement.moreover,the entire footnote is dictum because,as the court explicitly stated,b had no bearing on the case,at.
finally,pacific argues that including injuries within the scope of the workers compensation coverage created by b runs counter to congress intent in drafting the ocsla.according to pacific,congress intended to create a uniform ocs compensation scheme that both filled the jurisdictional voids and eliminated overlaps between existing state and federal.pacific points out that,without a requirement to narrow the scope of b,an worker could be eligible for both state and federal workers compensation coverage.
there is no indication in the text,however,that the ocsla excludes ocs workers from lhwca coverage when they are also eligible for state benefits.to the contrary,the lhwca workers compensation scheme incorporated by the ocsla explicitly anticipates that injured employees might be eligible for both state and federal benefits.an offsetting provision in the lhwca provides that any amounts paid to an employee for the same,disability,or death for which benefits are claimed under the lhwca pursuant to any other workers compensation law or the jones act shall be credited against any liability imposed by the lhwca.e.this provision,in addition to the lack of any textual support for pacific argument,convinces us that congress did not limit the scope of b coverage to only those geographic areas where state workers compensation schemes do not apply.
pacific also offers an alternative argument derived from the interaction of b and a provision of the lhwca.specifically,pacific argues that because the lhwca contains an explicit requirement,see a providing benefits only for injuries occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states,and because b extends the lhwca workers compensation scheme to the ocs,b incorporates the strict lhwca requirement from a.according to pacific,the words occurring as the result of operations in b impose a status requirement in addition to the imported lhwca requirement,with the result that employees who are injured on the ocs,but whose jobs are not related to extractive operations,are excluded from the workers compensation coverage created by b.thus,an accountant who is injured on a field trip to the drilling platform would be ineligible under b despite being an employee who is injured on the ocs.
although this alternative argument has the advantage of assigning some meaning to the words occurring as the result of operations in b,we still find it unpersuasive.first,it is unlikely that congress intended to impose a requirement in b through such a nonintuitive and convoluted combination of two separate legislative acts.as we have already noted,creating an express requirement in the text of b would have been simple.second,combining the b definition of united states with the lhwca requirement in a would result in an ocs workers compensation scheme that applies only to the seabed of the ocs and to any artificial islands and fixed structures thereon.see b stating that the term united states when used in a geographical sense includes the outer continental shelf and artificial islands and fixed structures thereon pacific concedes that this scheme would exclude the navigable waters above the shelf,including the waters immediately adjacent to any drilling platforms.consequently,under pacific view,even employees on a crew ship immediately adjacent to an ocs platform who are injured during a platform explosion would be excluded from b coverage.that view can not be squared with the text of the statute,which applies to any injury occurring as the result of operations conducted on the ocs.
pacific also makes several policy arguments in favor of a requirement,but policy concerns can not justify an interpretation of b that is inconsistent with the text of the ocsla.i f congress coverage decisions are mistaken as a matter of policy,it is for congress to change them.we should not legislate for them.herb welding,at.the language of b simply does not support a categorical exclusion of injuries that occur beyond the ocs.
the solicitor general urges us to adopt a inquiry that applies one test to injuries and a different test to injuries.speci
