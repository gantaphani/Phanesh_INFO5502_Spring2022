background 
the facts in this case are not disputed.john henry was severely injured in a car accident in december while driving a truck for his employer,bouyeafassetts,best foods.as the accident occurred within the scope of his employment,henry rightfully claimed workers compensation.travelers insurance company travelers,best foods workers compensation insurer,began paying henry workers compensation benefits.henry also sued kristy herrick,the driver of the second car,who was solely responsible for his accident.the suit settled for,the limit of herrick liability insurance.suits by an injured employee to enforce the liability of a third party such as herrick are specifically authorized by the vermont statute.stat.ann.tit,e.however,any recovery must first be applied to reimburse the workers compensation insurer for any amounts paid to the employee to the date of recovery,with any balance being treated as an advance to the employee of future workers compensation benefits id.this entitles the workers compensation insurer to first dollar reimbursement from proceeds.accordingly,after deducting costs including attorney fees,henry used the insurance proceeds paid by herrick insurer to reimburse travelers for past and future workers compensation payments.at the time of the accident,henry maintained a private underinsured motorist uim insurance policy with insurance.this insurance policy worth,covered henry if the maintained inadequate insurance coverage.additionally,best foods,on behalf of henry and the rest of its workers,maintained a uim policy with travelers.this policy was worth 
discussion 
travelers filed suit in the united states district court for the district of vermont seeking a declaratory judgment that travelers was entitled to first dollar reimbursement from any award made to henry under his uim policy,as well as his policy,as further reimbursement for workers compensation payments made to the date of any award as well as a credit toward any future benefits it might be required to pay.due to the unusual wording of section prior to,the vermont supreme court had held that a carrier was entitled to reimbursement from the proceeds of a uim policy that had been purchased by an employer,even though in most contexts a uim policy is considered a obligation.travelers liberty mut.ins.in apparent response to this decision,the vermont legislature amended section e in to exclude from reimbursement the proceeds of any uim policy purchased by an employee as well as any other insurance payments.specifically,the amendment added the following language 
reimbursement required under this subsection,except to prevent double recovery,shall not reduce the employee recovery of any benefit or payment provided by a plan or policy that was privately purchased by the injured employee,including insured motorist coverage,or any other first party insurance payments or benefits.
acts resolves codified as amended at.stat.ann.tit,e.
before the district court,travelers argued that the amendment to section e did not exempt from reimbursement the uim policy that had been purchased by best foods as this policy had not been privately purchased by the injured employee.the district court rejected this too narrow reading of the amendment.travelers ins.henry henry i,wl,at,dist.lexis.based on the plain language of the statute,as well as the legislative history of the amendment,the court concluded that,except as necessary to prevent double recovery,two types of recoveries were exempt from reimbursement payments from privately purchased plans including uim insurance,and payments from any other plan including uim insurance.id.at.
this left open the question of whether some portion of either the or uim policies should be recoverable by travelers in order to prevent double recovery,a limitation on the exemption explicitly provided for in the statute.stat.ann.tit,e.determination of this question turns on the meaning given to the term double recovery.as the leading treatise on workers compensation law points out,the term can have two meanings.arthur larson lex larson,larson workers compensation law,at hereinafter larson.it can mean recovering from two sources,here workers compensation and uim proceeds,in a combined amount that is greater than the employee total actual damages hereinafter actual double recovery.see id.assume,for example,that an injured employee total damages,both economic and noneconomic,are and he receives from workers compensation and from his uim insurer.all would agree that the employee has received an actual double recovery of.the term double recovery,however,has also been used to mean recovering insurance proceeds from two sources regardless of whether the combined amount exceeds an employee total damages hereinafter double source recovery.see id.assume again that an employee total damages are and that he receives in workers compensation payments and from his uim insurer.under the alternate definition of double recovery,having received funds from two sources,he would be required to reimburse the workers compensation insurer the entire.the result of applying different definitions of double recovery has a striking impact on the employee recovery.in the first example he recovers his total actual damages of,while in the second example his recovery is of his total damages,or.
while at first blush the second result may seem inequitable,double source recovery has generally been applied to any recovery by an employee of damages in a tort action against a negligent third party.in this paradigm,the workers compensation insurer is subrogated to the rights of the employee and,thereby,is entitled to first dollar reimbursement out of any damage award paid by the tortfeasor.as professor larson points out,however,the insurer subrogation rights in actions against responsible third parties are premised on the assumption that the third party will be liable for all the employee losses,and allowing the employee to keep both his workers compensation and his tort award would result in actual double recovery.see id.therefore,it is equitable to permit the workers compensation carrier to obtain first dollar reimbursement from a recovery as the employee,in theory,is still made whole.id 
this result is far from certain where the employee second source of recovery is not a action but rather the proceeds of a uim policy,which,because of low policy limits,is typically far below the employee actual total loss.id.requiring first dollar reimbursement from uim proceeds,then,will generally result in the employee not being made whole.indeed,in the example set forth above,the application of first dollar reimbursement to the proceeds of the uim policy results in the employee recovering only of his actual total losses.
predictably,travelers and henry chose different definitions of double recovery in presenting their arguments to the district court.the parties previously stipulated that henry total damages were total uim coverage and total travelers uim coverage plus any workers compensation already paid by travelers.thus,henry total damages were necessarily greater than his workers compensation recovery.travelers,however,argued that henry total damages were irrelevant and,as he indisputably received compensation from two sources,workers compensation and the uim policies,he had enjoyed double recovery in contravention of section e.therefore,travelers concluded,it was entitled to first dollar reimbursement from both of henry uim policies.henry countered that double recovery meant the recovery of more than his actual total damages and because,under the stipulation,his recoveries from workers compensation and the uim policies were equal to his actual damages there could be no prohibited double recovery.the district court did not explicitly consider which definition of double recovery to apply.nevertheless,based on its prior rulings and the subsequent entry of judgment for henry,it is clear that the court read section e to permit reimbursement from uim policies only where there has been an actual double recovery in excess of an employee total damages.
the judgment against travelers in henry i was appealed to this court.at the parties request,we certified to the vermont supreme court the question of whether section e,as amended,was intended to exclude from reimbursement uim policies purchased by employers as well as uim policies purchased directly by an employee the parties did not request certification as to the proper interpretation of double recovery,perhaps because that issue was already pending before the vermont supreme court as a result of certification of that question by this court in another workers compensation case.see travelers ins.carpenter carpenter i,cir.in that case,the district court again,murtha,decided that double recovery could only be determined in light of carpenter total award of damages,thus interpreting section e to require reimbursement only where the employee total recovery exceeded total actual damages.on appeal from the district court subsequent dismissal of travelers claim against carpenter,we certified to the vermont supreme court the following question,among others h ow is the prohibition on double recovery in e defined and,if relevant,how are an injured worker total damages determined id.at.the vermont supreme court initially accepted the certification proceeding,but it later dismissed the acceptance as improvidently granted.see travelers ins.carpenter carpenter ii,cir discussing travelers ins.carpenter,unpublished order.consequently,this court undertook to determine the meaning of double recovery and concluded,as had the district court,that the term refers to any recovery in excess of total damages sustained.see carpenter ii,at.put another way,the amended statute exempts uim insurance proceeds from first dollar reimbursement to the workers compensation insurer except to the extent that those proceeds compensate an injured worker for more than the maximum recoverable loss that the worker has sustained.id.at.thus we interpreted section e to limit reimbursement to cases of actual double recovery and rejected travelers contention that the statute required reimbursement in all cases of double source recovery.see id.
on june,four days after we issued carpenter ii,the vermont supreme court issued its opinion in response to the questions previously certified by the court in this appeal,which addresses whether the general exemption from reimbursement created by the amendment to section e extends to uim policies in addition to policies.see travelers ins.henry henry ii.slightly reformulating the certified questions,the vermont supreme court held that,except to prevent a double recovery,the plain language of the amendment to section e excluded from reimbursement the proceeds of uim policies,whether purchased by an employee or an employer.see id.at,at.specifically,the court concluded that the clause excluding reimbursement for uim coverage or any other first party insurance payments or benefits was clearly intended to exempt proceeds from uim policies purchased by the employer inasmuch as such policies provide direct,payments to the insured employee.see id.at,at.
double recovery revisited 
having thus responded to the certified questions,the vermont supreme court proceeded to address the meaning of the phrase except to prevent double recovery,the precise question that this court had just addressed in carpenter ii.apparently without having had the opportunity to consider this court interpretation of section e in carpenter ii,the henry ii court undertook its own reading of the statute,which differs,at least in application,from the reading adopted in carpenter ii.because federal courts must follow the holdings of the highest state court in applying state law,see levin tiber holding,cir,the discussion in henry ii supersedes carpenter ii as controlling precedent.it is worth noting,however,that on one important point,henry ii and carpenter ii do not differ both courts rejected travelers assertion that the statutory prohibition on double recovery meant that a workers compensation insurer is entitled to first dollar reimbursement from the injured employee uim recoveries.see carpenter ii,at travelers proposed reading would render the amendment of e,if not a nullity,at best a strangely worded restatement of the rule.henry ii,at,at we reject travelers interpretation because it would render the amendment a nullity.thus the vermont supreme court declined to adopt the second definition of double recovery identified by source would result in a first dollar reimbursement whether or not the aggregate recovery exceeds actual damages.larson,at.the vermont supreme court did this court in carpenter ii,at this interpretation of double recovery would contravene the intent of the vermont legislature to protect an employee uim recovery from a workers compensation carrier right to first dollar reimbursement.henry ii,at,at.
at this point,however,the opinions in henry ii and carpenter ii part company.the carpenter ii court construed double recovery to mean,simply,any recovery by an employee that exceeds his total damages,actual double recovery.carpenter ii.but the vermont supreme court in henry ii adopted a approach to reimbursement that may not always reach precisely the same result drawing on the distinction previously recognized in paul fire marine ins.surdam,henry ii instructs a trial court or the settling parties first to apportion any recovery under a uim policy between economic and noneconomic damages.henry ii,at,at.this apportionment of the uim award should reasonably reflect the injured party actual economic and noneconomic losses.id.at,at.because workers compensation compensates employees only for economic losses lost wages,medical expenses,and the like,id.at,at,there is no danger of a double recovery with regard to the noneconomic portion of the uim award such as pain and suffering,and,therefore,the insurer is not entitled to reimbursement from this portion of the uim award.id.at,at.
this leaves the question of whether and to what extent the workers compensation insurer is entitled to reimbursement from the economic portion of the uim award.on this question the vermont supreme court concluded 
if the employee recovers such economic damages and has already been compensated for these losses by the workers compensation insurer,the insurer is entitled to reimbursement to prevent a double recovery.
id.this language allows for some ambiguity.is the court saying that any award of economic damages from a uim policy is subject to reimbursement because the employee has already been compensated in part for these losses or is the court saying that reimbursement is appropriate only where the employee has already been compensated in whole for these losses 
travelers contends that this passage entitles it to reimbursement whenever an employee such as henry has recovered any economic damages under a uim policy,regardless of whether the combined amount of recovery workers compensation and the economic portion of a uim award exceeds the employee actual economic damages.to see how this would operate,assume that an employee has total economic damages of,has received as workers compensation,and thereafter receives from his uim carrier that the trial court apportions,for economic damages and for noneconomic damages.applying travelers definition of double recovery,the entire in economic damages received under the uim policy is paid to travelers,even though the employee will have recovered only of his actual economic damages.it can be seen,then,that this interpretation of double to double source in first dollar reimbursement from the economic damages portion of any uim award.
we accept that this is one possible interpretation of the solution to the double recovery problem achieved by the court in henry ii.however,readi
