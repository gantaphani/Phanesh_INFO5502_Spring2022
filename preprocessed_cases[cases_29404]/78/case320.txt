william gates was injured by forklifts twice while he was working at a del monte fresh produce plant.the first time,a forklift smashed into the back of the one he was driving,leaving him with injuries to his wrists and the palms of his hands.about eight months later,gates was walking out of a cooler when a forklift carrying a load of fruit ran him down and knocked him ten to fifteen feet across the floor.while he was still lying face down with his foot in a slot,a pallet with boxes of fruit on it was lowered onto gates heel.the accident left him with injuries to his neck,back,shoulder,and foot.after suffering those injuries,gates was no longer able to perform the duties of the forklift job he had held at del monte.he was given a lighter duty job until the plant closed about a year later.after it closed he eventually found a job as a security guard for sizemore security.
gates received compensation for his disability,including permanent partial disability benefits for his neck injury.those benefits were calculated according to the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,c,which entitled gates to of the difference between his wages at del monte and his capacity.after gates went to work for sizemore security his wages and hours there were among the factors used to calculate his capacity for purposes of determining the amount of disability payments del monte owed him.
sizemore initially assigned gates to the local base of the air national guard,where he made an hour.later sizemore transferred gates to a position at the savannah water plant,which paid him an hour.while gates was in that position,there was a period during which his usual work week was cut down to twenty hours.the reduction in wages and hours prompted gates to ask for an increase in his disability award from del monte on the theory that his capacity had been reduced.in a modification proceeding an administrative law judge granted gates request and increased the award.the department of labor benefits review board affirmed.this is del monte appeal 
the longshore and harbor workers compensation act provides compensation in respect of disability or death of an employee if the disability or death results from an injury occurring upon the navigable waters of the united states including any adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading,unloading,repairing,dismantling,or building a vessel.a.the compensation awarded under the act is not intended to redress the physical injury itself but instead is meant to compensate the worker for the decrease in his ability caused by the injury.see metro.stevedore rambo rambo ii,d.
to ensure that the compensation continues to fit the loss of capacity,the longshore workers act liberally permits modification of awards.id.at.at.section of the act allows for the modification of otherwise final disability awards on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact.see.and not just because of changes in the worker physical condition.as the supreme court has explained since the essence of capacity is economic,not physical,that capacity may be affected even without any change in the employee physical condition.rambo ii,at.at citations and quotation marks omitted.at the modification hearing this case largely turned on whether gates met his burden of showing a change in condition.
under the longshore workers act the board role in reviewing an alj decision is limited to ensuring that the decision is supported by substantial evidence and based on correct legal standards.see b.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.lollar,cir quotation marks omitted defining substantial evidence in the context of the board review of alj decisions under the black lung benefits act.as for our role,we have explained that this court only function is to correct errors of law and to determine if the board has adhered to its proper scope of review,has the board deferred to the alj or has it undertaken de novo review and substituted its views for the alj.avondale shipyards,vinson,cir where the board has upheld the alj decision,our limited review effectively cloaks the board decision with the same deference to which the alj is entitled.lollar,at.
del monte faults the board for accepting the alj finding that sizemore transfer of gates to the lower paying position did not result from his own misconduct.that finding is crucial because if misconduct were the cause of the loss of wages,then the effects of the injury could not be the cause.and a worker can not be compensated under the longshore workers act unless the injury caused the loss of wages.see brooks newport news shipbuilding dry dock,ben.bd.serv.mb,june,aff sub,brooks director,owcp,cir.gates acknowledges that rule but argues that substantial evidence supports the alj finding.
del monte presented the alj with three documents from gates personnel file at sizemore that showed reports of misconduct.two of those documents,however,were dated nine months before gates transfer and the other one was dated four months before the transfer.del monte also presented the testimony of beth swank,a sizemore employee working in payroll and human resources,who stated that because of insubordination gates had been transferred at the request of the air national guard,a sizemore client.however,there was nothing in the personnel records affirmatively indicating that the transfer was for that reason.most importantly,it was undisputed that gates was promoted within a week of the transfer.del monte has never offered any explanation for why gates would have been promoted that soon if the transfer had been for insubordination or other misconduct.
gates testified that insubordination was not the cause of his transfer.noting that there were no documents showing why gates was transferred,the alj decided not to credit swank testimony.c redibility determinations and the resolution of conflicting evidence are the prerogative of the,here the alj.atlantic marine,bruce,cir especially when the promotion is considered,there is enough evidence to support the alj finding that gates was not transferred because of misconduct or insubordination.see bianco.pac,cir this court,and the board,must uphold the factual determinations of the alj if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
allegations of misconduct aside,del monte also contends that gates never met his initial burden of proof requiring him to show a change in he failed to show an increased loss of capacity based on his disability.according to del monte,any reduction in wages and hours that gates suffered resulted from a business decision of his new employer,sizemore,or from gates failure to seek alternate employment.
we have no binding precedent to guide us on the question of how to define and allocate the burden of proof when an employee seeks a modification based on a change in condition.there is,however,the board earlier decision on that subject,which it followed in this case.in vasquez continental maritime of san francisco,ben.bd.serv.mb,the board held that a worker had the initial burden of demonstrating a change in condition.id.at.he could satisfy that burden by showing that he was laid off from the job which previously was found to constitute suitable alternate employment for reasons unrelated to any actions on his part and by demonstrating that he remains physically unable to perform his job.id.at.after the worker made those showings,the burden shifted to the employer to show the availability of a new suitable alternate job.id.finding the approach that the board announced in the vasquez decision logical and persuasive,we adopt it.
as for the requisite change in condition,gates showed not that he was laid off from his job as the claimant in vasquez had been,but that his wages and hours were reduced,which amounts to a lesser degree of the same thing in both cases actual wages decreased.the job gates had at sizemore when his wages and hours decreased was one that constituted suitable alternate employment.the al
