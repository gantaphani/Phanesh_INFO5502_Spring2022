beverly hilton hotel hotel petitioned for writ of review of the decision of the workers compensation appeals board board finding that respondent samson boganim boganim was entitled to vocational rehabilitation benefits under labor code section.effective january,however,labor code section was repealed.stats,ch.we hold that because the board decision was not a final determination of boganim right to vocational rehabilitation benefits and because section has been repealed,he is not entitled to those benefits.we therefore annul the board decision.
factual and procedural background 
boganim filed two claims for workers compensation benefits for an injury due to his employment as a security at hotel.boganim claimed a specific injury on september,and a cumulative trauma injury for the period of july,to november.
on december,the worker compensation judge wcj found both injuries compensable.on march,boganim requested vocational rehabilitation services pursuant to former section.hotel denied the request,and no services were offered.on february,boganim filed a request for a determination by the rehabilitation unit that he was entitled to vocational rehabilitation services and benefits.he based his request on the medical opinion of a psychiatrist,who had determined that boganim was a qualified injured worker for purposes of vocational rehabilitation services the rehabilitation unit denied the request on the basis that the psychiatric claim was not compensable.boganim made another request on december,for a determination from the rehabilitation unit of his entitlement to benefits,this time supported by another medical opinion reporting on boganim compensable injuries to his neck and back.thereafter,on july,the rehabilitation unit issued a determination that boganim was entitled to vocational rehabilitation benefits and services.
hotel appealed the determination of the rehabilitation unit.a trial de novo was held at the local appeals board,and the determination of the rehabilitation unit was upheld.in its january,findings and award,the wcj found that the medical report evidenced a prima facie showing that boganim was presumptively eligible for rehabilitation services as of july.the wcj also found that boganim was entitled to a vocational rehabilitation maintenance allowance at the temporary disability rate,pursuant to former section and former section,subdivision d,from july,or until boganim met with an agreed qualified rehabilitation representative.in awarding retroactive vocational rehabilitation maintenance allowance,the wcj concluded that hotel never issued a notice of potential eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services as required by former section.hotel filed a petition for reconsideration of the findings and award of january.after granting reconsideration,the board,on october,affirmed the january,findings and award of the wcj.
none of the parties raised before the board the issue of whether as of and after january,boganim had a valid award of vocational rehabilitation services or benefits.the rehabilitation unit determination,the findings and award by the wcj,and the decision by the board on reconsideration were all issued before january,the effective repeal date of section.thus,before the board,this issue was not ripe.on november,hotel filed a timely petition for review with this court.we requested that the parties brief the issue of the effect on the repeal of former section.on june,the board,in an en banc opinion in another case,held that the repeal of former section terminated any rights to vocational rehabilitation benefits of services provided for or by orders or awards that were not final before january.weiner ralphs,wl.
hotel contends the repeal of section ended all rights that would have derived from that statute,that there is no saving clause concerning the repealed statute,and that the law in effect at the time of this court decision must be applied.boganim contends that the repeal of section as of january,did not affect awards affirmed by the board before that date section,subdivision b is a saving clause and,based on public policy and the liberal construction of the labor code,as mandated by section,an employee must have a remedy to enforce a right when an employer was aware of an obligation to provide benefits and failed to comply with that obligation.
discussion 
vocational rehabilitation 
the california workers compensation law et is a statutory system enacted pursuant to a constitutional grant of power to the legislature to establish a workers compensation system.cal.const.art.xiv.the right to workers compensation benefits is wholly statutory.johnson workmens comp.appeals bd.cal d,ruiz industrial acc.com.cal d.as part of the workers compensation benefits,section was enacted in to provide for vocational rehabilitation programs in order to restore injured workers to suitable gainful employment for maximum after their industrial injury.webb workers comp.appeals bd.webb cal d,webb edgar workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.thereafter,the legislature enacted several changes to the vocational rehabilitation system of benefits.the system evolved from a voluntary program to one in which the employer had a statutory obligation to provide benefits to qualified workers.webb,supra,cal d at.as a result of legislation enacted in,section was made applicable only to injuries occurring before january,former,subd.k,stats,ch,and was to remain in effect until january,unless the legislature deleted or extended that date.former,subd.l,stats,ch,medrano workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the legislature did not delete or extend that date.
extinguishment of right to vocational rehabilitation benefits 
w hen a pending action rests solely on a statutory basis,and when no rights have vested under the statute,a repeal of such a statute without a saving clause will terminate all pending actions based thereon.governing board mann mann cal d.if final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it can not be granted afterwards,even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.the reviewing court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision is rendered.id.at,see southern service,los angeles cal d,krause rarity cal,a repeal of the statute conferring the right,prior to final judgment,would abolish the right and place the parties in the same position as if the statute never existed napa state hospital flaherty cal,it is a rule of almost universal application,that,where a right is created solely by a statute,and is dependent upon the statute alone,and such right is still inchoate,and not reduced to possession,or perfected by final judgment,the repeal of the statute destroys the remedy,unless the repealing statute contains a saving clause.
workers compensation awards may become null by subsequent legislation enacted prior to a final judgment.for example,in graczyk workers comp.appeals bd.graczyk d,a student filed a workers compensation claim as an employee because of an injury incurred in while playing varsity college football for california state university,fullerton.the wcj held that the applicant was an employee and that section,subdivision k,added in,which excluded student athletes from being deemed employees,could not be applied retroactively to deprive the applicant of his vested right to employee status under the law existing at the time of his injury.the board annulled the decision of the wcj and determined that the applicant was not an employee,concluding that the legislature amendment of section adding subdivision k that excluded student athletes as employees applied to any awards that were still pending.graczyk,supra,d at.the court of appeal affirmed,holding that the applicant rights to benefits were not vested because they had not been reduced to a final judgment before the amendment to section.according to the court,the applicant did not have a vested right to employee status at the time of the injury.id.at.the court also held that even if the statute was viewed as applying retroactively,such application was not unconstitutional.id.at.
the court stated that the applicant inchoate right to benefits under the workers compensation law is wholly statutory hence,applicant did not have a vested right.graczyk,supra,d at.the justification for the rule that a statutory right of action may be repealed is that all statutory remedies are pursued with the full realization that the legislature may abolish the right to recover at any time.id.at,fn.see callet alioto cal,all statutory remedies are pursued with full realization that the legislature may abolish the right to recover at any time willcox edwards cal,when the remedy provided by the statute is lost by an amendment taking it away in certain classes of cases,nothing further of benefit remains in those cases.
in kleemann workers comp.appeals bd.kleemann th,d,the court examined the legislative intent in the application of the then newly enacted sections and to pending cases for injuries that predated the enactment of those sections the employee had filed a claim of cumulative trauma for his period of employment from to april,as well as other claims of injuries in and.he also had a prior industrial injury from another employment for which he had received a stipulated settlement.issues of permanent disability and apportionment were submitted for decision before the wcj.on april,the legislature repealed section and enacted a new version of that section along with section stats,ch.although the case had been submitted for decision to the wcj prior to the enactment of the new provision,the wcj had not issued a decision before the effective date of the enactments.on april,the wcj vacated submission of the claim and scheduled a conference for the purpose of developing the record in order to address the new laws on apportionment.kleemann,supra,at,d.the applicant contended that his claim should be decided based on the statutes that existed at the time of his injuries.the court held the legislature intended that new sections and applied to pending cases id.at,d and reasoned that when new legislation repeals existing law,statutory rights end with the repeal even during litigation if the repeal of the statute authorizing the right occurs before final judgment.id.at,d.
when new legislation repeals existing law,statutory rights normally end with repeal unless the rights are vested pursuant to contract or common law.kleemann,supra,th at,d see strauss horton cal th,d,vested right includes marriage.the final relief necessary for a vested right occurs when the award is final and any appeals have been concluded by a final judgment.see mann,supra,cal d at.
similarly,in rio linda union school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d rio linda,the court held that the newly enacted sections and should have been applied to a case submitted to a wcj before the effective date of the statute,but on which the award and findings were not issued until four days after the effective date of those statutes.the court held that the unconditional repeal of a special remedial statute without a saving clause stops all pending actions where the repeal finds them.if final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect,such relief can not be granted afterwards,even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.the reviewing court must dispose of the case under the law in force when its decision is rendered.citations.citations.rio linda,supra,th at,d.the repeal of such statutory right to all pending cases,at whatever stage the repeal finds them,unless the legislature has expressed a contrary intent by an express saving clause or by implication from contemporaneous legislation.ibid.
the instant case involves the application of the traditional rule that statutory rights end during litigation with repeal of the statute,unless appeals were exhausted and there is a final judgment.kleemann,supra,th at,d see green workers comp.appeals bd.th,fn,d.thus,to this extent,the repeal applies to injuries and claims that occurred prior to the repeal.if as here,the right involved is inchoate,it can be said that the law or repeal of the law is not being applied retroactively.see kaiser foundation hospitals workers comp.appeals bd.d.
section provides for actions that can be taken by the board on reconsideration of an order.thereafter,a party may apply to an appellate court for a writ of review.the appellate court may deny review see kaiser foundation hospitals workers comp.appeals,supra,d at,but if the court grants a writ of review,then the court enters judgment either affirming or annulling the award,or the court may remand the matter back to the board.until judgment is entered and the appellate process or other proceedings are completed,the matter is not final,and there is no vested right.graczyk,supra,d at.county of san bernardino ranger ins.th,d statutory remedy does not vest until final judgment.awards are only final when the entire process,including appellate review,is concluded.in the instant case,hotel timely filed this petition for review,which was pending at the time of the effective date of the repeal of section.only in those cases in which the decision was final before the repeal would the parties be able to enforce or terminate the award.see.because this matter has been subject to review by this court after january,former section,can no longer can be applied or enforced in this case.
that an employer might have been able to delay finality of an award in order to take advantage of the repeal of section does not affect our ruling in this case.an applicant can seek to expedite the proceedings.and there is no showing in this case that hotel did anything to cause a delay in the proceedings in order to take advantage of the effective date of the repeal of the statute.
no saving clause 
when the legislature repeals a statute but intends to save the rights of litigants in pending actions,it may accomplish that purpose by including an express saving clause in the repealing act.bourquez superior court th,d see black law dictionary ed.a saving clause is generally used in a repealing act to preserve rights and claims that would otherwise be lost.it is not necessary that there be an express saving clause in order to save rights under a statute.it is sufficient if an intent to that effect appear by legislative provision at the session of the legislature effecting the repeal of the statute from which the rights are to be saved.county of alameda kuchel cal d,see traub edwards d,see also bourquez superior court,supra,th at,d.thus,the intention to save the rights of litigants in pending actions does not have to appear in the repealing act itself.traub edwards,supra,d at.
in reenacting section,the legislature added subdivision k,which stated,this section shall apply only to injuries occurring before january.it also added in subdivision l,this section shall remain in effect only until january,and as of that date is repealed,unless a later enacted statute,that is enacted before january,deletes or extends that date.stats,ch.there was no newly enacted statute,nor was the effective sunset date extended before january,or thereafter.the legislature,in effect,preserved or saved vocational rehabilitation claims for nearly five years,but did not save vocational rehabilitation rights as of or past january.as noted,although the legislature provided for the possibility of a later statute that deletes or extends that january,date,no such statute was ever enacted.
there is no indication,express or any legislation passed in the same session in which section was the legislature intended to save vocational rehabilitation rights or remedies from and after january,or indefinitely.section of the legislation stats,ch,states the amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award of the workers compensation appeals board.this provision is consistent with the final judgment rule.kleemann,supra,th at,d.reopening in workers compensation generally refers to reopening orders,decisions or awards for new and fur
