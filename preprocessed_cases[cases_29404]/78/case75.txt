benjamin reynolds appellant appeals the district court award of summary judgment in favor of the american national red cross and the american red cross greenbrier valley chapter collectively,appellees.the district court held that reynolds failed to submit sufficient evidence to meet his burden with regard to various americans with disabilities act ada claims.despite their victory below,appellees nonetheless on the ancillary issue of whether the number of employees of the national red cross and the greenbrier valley chapter can be aggregated for purposes of determining employer status under the ada.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the district court award of summary judgment to appellees,vacate the district court ruling that the greenbrier valley chapter is an employer under the ada,and dismiss the.
reynolds worked for the greenbrier valley chapter of the american red cross in lewisburg,west virginia the chapter.he began as a volunteer in and then worked as a per diem instructor beginning in,being paid for each,first aid,and cpr class he taught.he eventually became a employee in.for the entire time he was with the chapter,reynolds worked directly for walter lockhart,executive director reynolds and lockhart met some years previously when they both volunteered with the civil air patrol.they interacted socially every few days,and lockhart loaned reynolds around over the course of their friendship.
in,lockhart offered reynolds a job with the chapter as a manager of service delivery,a job description that lockhart drafted himself,and reynolds accepted.reynolds began work in that position on or about august.the job description provided,j ob is physically comfortable individual has discretion about walking,standing.it also required reynolds to t each training courses as necessary and recruit and retain volunteer instructors for community classes and mission related courses.id.at.the parties agree of reynolds job was to teach health and safety classes.however,he was also tasked with recruiting or soliciting training classes from the community.id.at.the salary was listed at annually with no benefits 
on or about august or,during the first week that reynolds worked as manager of service delivery,lockhart instructed reynolds to help move a baby grand piano from the home of a donor to lockhart personal residence.lockhart and robert clark,a member of the chapter executive committee,also helped.reynolds alleges that he experienced severe pain in both his neck and upper back when he started moving the piano.am.compl.clark testified,when we got into the process of moving the piano reynolds said,boy,my back really hurts.so we say,then do touch the piano.clark said he strongly advised reynolds not to help.id.reynolds alleges,however,that lockhart ignored his plea to stop moving the piano and required him to continue assisting in delivering and unloading the piano to his personal residence.am.compl.reynolds admitted that prior to this incident,his back was stiff and sore because he had previously moved mattresses for the chapter.
reynolds alleges that after the piano incident he went to the emergency room a few days later to seek relief from the persistent and severe pain in his neck and upper back.am.compl.he saw two physicians,boisverte and kribs,both in lewisburg,who eventually referred him to dilaawar mistry at the university of virginia health system in charlottesville.because reynolds car had been repossessed and he had no other way to get to the appointment,lockhart drove reynolds to charlottesville to see mistry on september.
mistry examined reynolds and noted he complain ed of persistent left arm pain.the physical examination showed,however,n ormal range of motion and strength in flexion,extension and axial rotation of the neck.normal range of motion and strength of both shoulders,elbows and wrists.there was mild sensory loss on the tip of the index finger of the left hand compared to the right.id.at.mistry also noted,in the history portion of the report,that reynolds showed intervertebral disk space narrowing with osteophytic change most pronounced at and and some foraminal encroachment secondary to osteophytes bilaterally.id.at.mistry scheduled an mri to be performed in charlottesville,made a appointment on september,and gave reynolds a note stating that he could return to work with restrictions that include lifting weights only up to pounds.id.mistry testified that due to reynolds 
normal range of motion and strength of his shoulders,elbows and wrists,and neck and,axial rotation,and his indication that he needs to return to work for the red cross,i felt as a clinician that up to pounds would be reasonable to let him continue his work 
after the examination,mistry said reynolds had no physical limitations as far as range of motion and he would not consider reynolds disabled.reynolds never returned to charlottesville for his appointment or mri.therefore,mistry had no occasion to determine if the lifting restriction that he imposed was still appropriate weeks later.
reynolds claims that after he returned to work,he was asked to lift things in excess of fifteen pounds,despite lockhart knowledge of mistry orders.upon their return to lewisburg,lockhart instructed reynolds to assist with moving boxes,mattresses,furniture and a file cabinet.reynolds estimated that he lifted items weighing more than fifteen pounds two to three times a week.notably,however,reynolds never refused lockhart instruction to lift any item while he was under the restriction and could recall only one conversation when he told lockhart that he believed that moving a loaded file cabinet would be too heavy for him.id.at.
after allegedly sustaining the back and neck injuries reynolds twice told lockhart he wanted to file a workers compensation claim.reynolds stated that lockhart told him that if he did so,he would be dismissed and that the red cross would fight the claim.id.at.lockhart also told him the chapter executive committee is going to let you do that,and a workers compensation claim would cost the chapter either one or percent rate increase hike and the chapter would stand for that.id.at.
at some point before the end of,the chapter determined that it no longer had the funds to pay reynolds,and reynolds was so advised.then,on or around january,lockhart verbally informed reynolds that he was terminated because the chapter did not have the funds to pay him.on january,reynolds received a termination letter from lockhart stating,d ue to budget restriction sic the board of director sic has asked me to termination sic your employment with this chapter as of today.the letter continued,
we are exercising our rights as an at will employer.as you know this had been the balance for the last ninety day sic,hoping you would generate enough income to cover your salary.this has not been done.also the single family files has sic not been entered into the cas system,since july.only about fifty percent of the instructor sic in health and safety has been upgraded.
as noted,there is some dispute as to whether reynolds was required to bring in enough money to cover his salary as a part of his employment.it is undisputed that reynolds did not receive any negative evaluations or reprimands related to his job performance prior to his termination.
after his termination from the chapter,reynolds applied for and was denied west virginia workers compensation benefits for his alleged back and neck injuries because his application was untimely.he then filed a disability discrimination charge against the chapter with the equal opportunity employment commission eeoc based on those alleged injuries.he claimed that he was harassed,retaliated against,treated differently from others,denied a reasonable accommodation,and unlawfully discharged based on his disability.
in march,reynolds obtained a teaching position in north carolina.he earned per year,plus full benefits.while at that job,reynolds moved books on a book cart down a ramp.he tried to push the cart in front of him,but it was extremely heavy,so he tried to get in front of the cart.the cart got away from him and basically ran him over.after that incident,reynolds filed for worker compensation benefits,and he has been receiving those benefits from the state of north carolina since august.
on december,the eeoc determined that the chapter was not an ada covered employer and dismissed reynolds eeoc claim.reynolds then filed this action in district court.
appellees filed a motion for summary judgment,arguing reynolds did not present sufficient evidence to prove he was disabled and,in any event,the chapter was not an employer under the ada.the district court ruled in favor of appellees as to the former but against appellees on the latter.it held that,even though the chapter employed fewer than fifteen people the threshold number of employees required to invoke the ada the chapter nonetheless was an agent of the american national red cross,a covered employer under the ada.see reynolds am.red cross,cv,ecf reynolds filed a timely appeal,and appellees filed a on the agency issue alone.
we review the district court summary judgment ruling de novo,applying the same standard applied by the district court.see henry purnell,cir med.waste assocs.mayor city council of baltimore,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact,and the moving party is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law.id.on a motion for summary judgment,facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party only if there is a genuine dispute as to those facts.ricci destefano,d internal quotation marks omitted.
the ada provides,n o covered entity shall discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures,the hiring,advancement,or discharge of employees,employee compensation,job training,and other terms,conditions,and privileges of employment.a.covered entity is defined as an employer,employment agency,labor organization,or joint committee.id.employer is defined as a person engaged in an industry affecting commerce who has or more employees,and any agent of such person.id.a.
a.the appeal 
reynolds appeals three ada claims on which the district court awarded summary judgment he was fired because of his alleged disability the primary ada claim he was retaliated against for engaging in protected activities under the ada the retaliation claim and his employer shared confidential medical information about his alleged disability the confidentiality claim.we address each in turn below.
the primary ada claim 
to survive summary judgment on the primary ada claim,reynolds was required to produce evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he was a qualified individual with a disability he was discharged he was fulfilling h is employer legitimate expectations at the time of discharge and the circumstances of h is discharge raise a reasonable inference of unlawful discrimination.rohan networks presentations llc,cir internal quotation marks omitted.evidence of all four of these elements is necessary to survive summary judgment.reynolds claim fails at step one.
reynolds was first required to produce evidence that he is disabled.rohan,at.the ada defines disability as any one of the following a a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities b a record of such an impairment or c being regarded as having such an impairment.see also rohan,at.as explained below,because reynolds does not produce sufficient evidence to satisfy this element of the claim,we need not go further.
given that reynolds alleged disability occurred in,in deciding whether reynolds produced sufficient evidence of a disability,we must first decide whether to apply retroactively the ada amendments act of the adaaa,which took effect january.see adaaa,stat.
in passing the adaaa,congress was concerned lower courts have incorrectly found in individual cases that people with a range of substantially limiting impairments are not people with disabilities.stat.at.congress believed that over time,ada case law eliminate d protection for many individuals whom congress intended to protect.id.
before the enactment of the adaaa,courts relied upon toyota motor manufacturing,kentucky,williams,d,and sutton united air lines,d,in determining whether a plaintiff was disabled.these cases defined the terms substantially and major,as used in the ada definition of disability,to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled.toyota,at.
the toyota court held,in order to qualify as disabled under the ada,an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people daily lives.the impairment impact must also be permanent or long term.at.the court continued,
it is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability status under this test to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of an impairment.instead,the ada requires those claiming the act protection to prove a disability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation caused by their impairment in terms of their own experience is substantial.
see also sutton,at a disability exists only where an impairment substantially limits a major life activity,not where it might,could,or would be substantially limiting if mitigating measures were not taken.
the district court decided as have eight circuits that the adaaa does not apply retroactively and instead,relied on toyota and sutton in ruling on reynolds claim.see carter pathfinder energy,cir declining to impose the adaaa retroactively nyrop indep.sch.dist,cir same becerril pima cnty.assessor office,cir same thornton united parcel,cir same fredricksen united parcel serv,cir same lytes water sewer,same millholland sumner cnty.bd.of,cir same eeoc agro distribution llc,cir same 
the supreme court has held,r etroactivity is not favored in the law.c ongressional enactments and administrative rules will not be construed to have retroactive effect unless their language requires this result.landgraf usi film.the adaaa itself provides t his act and the amendment made by this act shall become effective on january.stat.at.in cochran,this court concluded that the amendment evinces a prospective intent with its delayed effective date.app x at.we agree there is no language in the adaaa indicating that congress intended to make this law retroactive in fact,the indication is to the contrary.
reynolds nonetheless contends that although the adaaa was not in effect at the time the conduct giving rise to this case occurred,it was in full effect when the district court rendered its decision below october,and it should be applied for that reason.see landgraf,at i n many situations,a court should apply the law in effect at the time it renders its decision,even though that law was enacted after the events that gave rise to the suit.internal citations and quotation marks omitted.but landgraf resolved,
p rospectivity remains the appropriate default rule.because it accords with widely held intuitions about how statutes ordinarily operate,a presumption against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and public expectations.requiring clear intent assures that congress itself has affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive application and determined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the countervailing benefits.such a requirement allocates to congress responsibility for fundamental policy judgments concerning the proper temporal reach of statutes,and has the additional virtue of giving legislators a predictable background rule against which to legislate.
at see also carter,at declining to apply the adaaa retroactively because it went into effect after the allegedly discriminatory conduct in this case occurred thornton,at explaining that the adaaa does not apply retroactively to conduct occurring before the act became effective.
for these reasons,we join the majority of the circuits in deciding the adaaa does not apply retroactively.therefore,we will instead look to toyota,sutton,and their progeny.
we first consider whether reynolds provided evidence on the first ada definition of disability w
