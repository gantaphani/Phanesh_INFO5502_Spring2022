we shall affirm the judgment 
factual and procedural background 
in october,has had asthma all her working as institution iaf for the aic program at the california correctional center ccc in susanville.her duties included teaching some art classes,administering the program,hiring and supervising contract artists who taught classes,overseeing inmate workers assigned to assist with the classes,and purchasing,inventorying and securing the tools used in the program.she worked in the art studio located within a building that also contained the prison facility.a solid wall with a door divides the two facilities,which have separate air filtration systems.the art studio is a large room,within which there are a small separate computer room and the iaf office,the walls of which are made of transparent plexiglass.
in may,henning said a foul odor in the studio was making her dizzy.ccc concluded the odor came from a clogged sink trap and instructed henning to keep it clear by regularly pouring water down the sink,which she did.
in november,henning and two contract artists expressed to prison officials concern about the air quality in the studio.there was no evidence of response by cdc.
in december,perchloroethylene an organic solvent was spilled in the adjacent facility.the spill was cleaned up immediately,but henning complained the fumes triggered a serious asthma attack for which she required prednisone.
in january,henning filed a workers compensation claim.
henning asthma worsened,and her doctor,john dozier,excused her from work for several weeks beginning february.on march,dozier released her to return to work,on the condition she not work near the dry cleaning facility.
since henning could not work in the art studio,ccc temporarily reassigned her to the mailroom,but she did not like the assignment.
henning asked ccc to order a high efficiency particulate air filter hepa filter for her office,let her bring in her own filter in the interim,and switch her office with the computer room within the art studio.ccc granted her requests.ccc purchased a hepa filter in april,but it did not arrive until after henning left her job in may.as found by spb,there was no evidence henning ever switched her office with the computer room.
in connection with henning workers compensation claim,a certified industrial hygienist inspected the air quality in the art studio on march and.he made suggestions to improve the air quality,which were implemented by ccc.he issued a final report on april,attesting the air was considered safe by the california occupational safety and health act,et standards,and there was no reason why anyone should have problems with the air quality in the studio.
henning returned to work on may,but left on may,claiming she felt sick once again.she worked from home for a while.after being told she could no longer work from home,she never returned to work and ultimately retired in.
in june,cdc was forced to stop the aic program due to henning absence.shortly thereafter,officials performed a surprise inspection,which found the art studio was in compliance with air quality standards.
on july,cdc coordinator,cheryl gaither,sent henning an options letter,advising there were some options henning could elect,some options she could request,and some steps the employer was mandated to take regarding her employment.she could elect resignation,service retirement,disability retirement,or demotion.she could request leave or reasonable accommodation.the letter also stated that if henning was unable to work in her present classification,cdc would pursue a medical demotion to another position,and,you are encouraged to participate in this process.you will be provided with a list of currently vacant suitable job opportunities review sic.you may indicate which positions you are interested in,and,you will be given an opportunity to demonstrate your qualifications for those positions.cdc will make an effort to place you in the highest paying vacant position for which you are qualified,which is not promotional and which meets your medical restrictions.if you do not choose to participate in this medical demotion process,you will be assigned to a currently vacant position for which our records indicate you are minimally qualified which is closest to your current salary.the letter ended with,please notify cdc return to work coordinator of your decisions and preferences within ten days of receipt of this letter.
henning did not contact the coordinator concerning the options letter but did file a request for reasonable accommodation a week or two later as found by spb,in which she identified her limitation and the requested accommodation as follows may not work in an area where there is heavy dust chemicals.a satellite office would be a viable option or moving aic to the lassen unit.
cdc coordinator sent henning request to the main office and kept in touch with dozier,but did not contact henning or send her the vacancy list promised in the options letter.as stated in the spb decision,the coordinator felt henning had made her choice by submitting the request for reasonable accommodation and did not want to participate in the medical demotion process 
on april,cdc denied henning request for reasonable accommodation.the letter to henning stated ccc had received medical verification from her doctor that she can not work in the current location of the aic program.therefore,ccc has provided you with an opportunity to continue your employment with cdc in the position of a business services officer i bso i.the letter said cdc could not accommodate the modifications she requested because providing a satellite office would significantly limit the essential functions of her job as iaf ccc was not equipped with a space large enough to move the iaf office or use as a satellite office and an industrial hygienist had concluded henning work area was a safe and healthy work environment and a medical report stated her asthma was not of an industrial nature and her medical condition would exist regardless of where her work area was located.
before sending the april denial of the request for reasonable accommodation,cdc began processing the medical demotion referenced in its july options letter.in february,cdc return to work coordinator obtained a list of vacancies at ccc to determine an alternative position for henning.the coordinator obtained only a ccc vacancy list,because she assumed henning would not wish to move from the area.the coordinator reviewed the list without sending it to henning and ultimately chose to demote henning to the position of bso i,because it was the closest in salary.the iaf salary was about per month,including for supervising inmates.the bso i salary was per month.
on february,cdc served henning with a notice of medical demotion,demoting her to bso i,because your june injury precludes your continued employment as an institution artist facilitator.
on march,henning doctor informed cdc that henning was physically able to return to work on march in the administration building.henning did not return to work but instead submitted another letter from her doctor on april,explaining she was not physically able to work at all until july,and was excused as fully disabled until then.since then,there is no evidence that henning doctor has released her to work,or that she has attempted to return to work.since leaving ccc,henning has worked intermittently as a teacher in various schools.
henning pursued an administrative appeal from the medical demotion and denial of reasonable accommodation.
in may,following an administrative hearing,an administrative law judge alj issued a proposed decision to uphold cdc actions.
spb rejected the alj proposed decision and heard the matter itself.
in april,spb issued its decision,designated a precedential decision as authorized by section.in re henning,supra,spb.spb concluded henning was a qualified individual with a disability because her asthma limit ed her ability to participate in major life activities and was therefore entitled to reasonable accommodation.while she was not entitled to the two particular accommodations she requested,cdc was obligated to engage her in an interactive process.cdc initially engaged in an interactive process but ceased to communicate after henning filed her formal request for accommodation.spb said,had cdc contacted henning and explained in a timely manner why it would not be granting the reasonable accommodations she requested and fully explored remaining alternatives with her,it is possible that the parties would have been able to find a solution to meet both their needs.in a footnote,spb suggested alternatives such as filtering the air in the entire studio as opposed to her office only,transferring her to another position,or transferring her to a different institution.spb accordingly granted the appeal only to the extent that the parties are required to engage in an interactive process to determine whether henning can otherwise be reasonably accommodated.
as to henning appeal from the medical demotion,spb concluded section similarly requires that state agencies engage in an interactive process with an employee,regardless of the employee disability status,before invoking a medical demotion,transfer or termination.cdc failed to participate in such a process with henning before medically demoting her and,thus,we spb revoke the medical demotion.spb said,cdc promised henning it would send her a list of vacancies to solicit her input and failed to do so.therefore,cdc is estopped to deny that henning was not sic entitled to participate in the process of selecting an alternative position.if the return to work coordinator had sent henning a list of vacancies for her input and henning had failed to respond,the interactive process requirement would likely have been fulfilled.if the parties could not agree after engaging in an interactive process,cdc could still demote henning,and she could appeal.
in august,cdc filed in the trial court a petition for writ of administrative mandamus.
on june,the trial court issued a judgment granting the petition in part and denying it in part.the court concluded,in cdc favor,that spb used the wrong legal standard for determining whether henning qualified as disabled for reasonable accommodation purposes.spb erred in applying the current statute defining disability as limit ing a major life activity rather than the statute in effect at the time of cdc actions which defined disability as substantially limit ing a major life activity.the court also concluded spb erroneously failed to consider appropriate mitigation measures,medication devices,in determining whether henning qualified as disabled.the court directed spb upon remand to reassess the case under the appropriate standards.
the trial court nevertheless concluded spb did not abuse its discretion in finding cdc failed to engage adequately in the interactive process relative to the reasonable accommodation case.
finally,the judgment stated spb did not abuse its discretion in determining that the other pertinent information language in the medical demotion statute,section,requires the employer to engage the employee in an interactive process.
the judgment accordingly ordered issuance of a writ of mandamus remanding the case to spb to rewrite its decision applying the proper legal standard for disability and stated the writ petition was otherwise denied.
the writ was issued on june.
cdc filed a notice of appeal,stating it was appealing from the entire judgment,except that portion of the judgment granting its writ petition.
henning filed a notice of from the judgment.

ii.cdc appeal 
statutory construction other pertinent information 
cdc contends spb erred by writing into the medical demotion statute a requirement that the employer must engage in an interactive process with the employee.we shall conclude cdc appeal on this point lacks merit 
california constitution,article vii,section,subdivision a,provides the board spb shall enforce the civil service statutes and,by majority vote of all its members,shall prescribe probationary periods and classifications,adopt other rules authorized by statute,and review disciplinary actions.spb must necessarily interpret,enforce,and administer the scsa,section et sequitur.camarena state personnel,supra,th,d.
it is appropriate in this case to give great weight to spb interpretation of section,because spb is constitutionally empowered to enforce the civil service statutes cal,art.vii,subd.a spb has expertise and familiarity with satellite legal issues and this record reflects careful consideration of the issue by spb.yamaha,supra,cal th,d.
as indicated,section provides in part c when the appointing power,after considering the conclusions of the medical examination and other pertinent information,concludes that the employee is unable to perform the work of his or her present position,but is able to perform the work of another position including one of less than full time,the appointing power may demote or transfer the employee to such a position.italics added.
cdc argues spb impermissibly rewrote section to add an interactive process requirement.we disagree.
spb simply construed other pertinent information to include the employee thoughts about whether she should be reassigned and to what position she should be reassigned.spb construed the statute as affirmatively requiring the employer to seek out the employee views,as opposed to mere passive consideration of unsolicited input from the employee.the interactive process is simply the vehicle for obtaining this information.as stated by spb without seeking input from the affected employee as to his or her needs or desires,a department taking a medical action under section will not have the information necessary to consider the impact on the employee of the action contemplated.unlike an adverse action,a medical action under section is not disciplinary in nature.rather,it is a vehicle that allows departments to reassign employees to other positions when they are physically or mentally unable to perform the duties of their current position,until such time as they are once again able to perform the duties.as we stated in our decision in gerardo manriquez in re manriquez spb.manriquez,section must be construed as imposing an affirmative obligation on departments to attempt to minimize the impact of a medical disability on an employee job status.while the financial impact of a demotion may be paramount to most employees,for other employees financial impact may not be the only consideration.thus,we construe section to require departments to engage employees in the same interactive process already required for disabled employees in order to seek out other pertinent information that may be relevant to their process before invoking a medical action.
spb interpretation is reasonable.an obligation actively to solicit the employee views is within the scope of the statutory language that the employer may demote an employee only after considering the conclusions of the medical examination and other pertinent information,subd.c.
cdc argues spb erred in construing other pertinent information to include the employee thoughts.cdc invokes the maxim of ejusdem generis,that when general words follow the enumeration of particular things,the general words will be construed as applicable only to things of the same general nature as those enumerated.cdc cites nakamura superior court th,d,that the reasoning behind this rule is the legislature would not have mentioned the particular thing if it intended the general words to be used in an unrestricted sense,because that would render the particular item surplusage.according to cdc,the general words other pertinent information should only include items in the same general class as conclusions of the medical examination.however,the maxim of ejusdem generis,as indicated,applies where a general term follows an enumeration of particulars.for example,nakamura construed a statute prohibiting recovery of losses to compensate for pain,suffering,inconvenience,physical impairment,disfigurement,and other nonpecuniary damages.id.at,d,italics omitted.here,there is no enumeration,no list of particulars.there are just conclusions of the medical examination.moreover,even if the maxim applied here,cdc acknowledges other pertinent information would include statements by the employee relating to his or her ability to perform the job.thus,the employer would still be required to engage the employee in an interaction.
cdc gets caught up on the term interactive process.cdc argues the statute makes no express reference to interactive process.cdc further argues that,because the interactive process language is used in the fair employment and housing act feha,subd.n unlawful for employer to fail to engage in interactive process to determine reasonable accommodation,the omission of the words interactive process from the medical demotion statute means medical demotions do not require an interactive process.cdc criticizes spb statement that it makes little sense to engage employees in an interactive process for reasonable accommodation purposes but not for medical demotion purposes.cdc argues the legislature could not have intended other pertinent information to mandate an interactive process,because the words other pertinent information existed in the statute long before the term interactive process became a part of disability law.
we recognize the term interactive process may be a term of art in contexts such as the feha.however,insofar as the term generically expresses the principle of eliciting an employee views,it is not a patented concept.we need not decide whether the term interactive process must have identical meaning in all employment contexts.whatever the parameters of interactive process,the principle of engaging the employee was clearly violated here where cdc failed to fulfill its promise to give henning a list of vacant positions,to get her input before demoting her.
we disagree with cdc assertion that this case tracks our opinion in kuhn department of general services,supra,th,d,where we rejected spb interpretation of a different part of the medical demotion,subdivision h which accords reinstatement rights to demoted employees,subject to satisfactory completion of a new probationary period.we rejected spb interpretation that the phrase new probationary period in section,subdivision h,meant a medical probationary period entitling the employee to further reinstatement rights as opposed to a regular civil service probationary period.we said medical probation was not a term reflected in the statute.id.at,d.applying a respectful but nondeferential standard of review to spb interpretation of the statute,we said spb had no authority to fashion a hybrid civil service classification or to enlarge statutes in the guise of interpretation.id.at,d.kuhn does not help cdc because,in this case,spb has not overstepped its bounds.
cdc complains manriquez,supra,spb,at page the spb precedent cited by spb,merely declared,in discussing the medical demotion statute,that i n engaging in such a process,the department would,ideally,meet with the affected individual to determine all available positions within his or her medical limitations.italics added.cdc argues that,because manriquez said,ideally,the interactive process can not be mandatory.cdc says it could reasonably have relied upon manriquez.however,cdc does not say it did rely upon manriquez,nor does cdc cite any evidence in the record demonstrating such reliance.moreover,the manriquez quote cited by cdc did not say the interactive process was an ideal,but rather that the employer would ideally meet with the employee.
cdc next argues spb interpretation of section,subdivision c,is undermined by the absence of the words other pertinent information from section,subdivision e,which provides the appointing power may demote,transfer,or terminate an employee under this section without requiring the employee to submit to a medical examination when the appointing power relies upon a written statement submitted to the appointing power by the employee as to the employee condition or upon medical reports submitted to the appointing power by the employee.according to cdc,subdivision e creates a separate procedure for medical demotions based on medical reports produced by the employee as was the case here as opposed to medical examinations by doctors.we disagree.subdivision e merely allows an employer to use medical reports provided by the employee in lieu of requiring the employee to submit to a medical examination by a doctor designated by the employer as authorized by subdivision a of section.
we conclude cdc fails to show any reversible error with respect to spb statutory interpretation.
adequacy of cdc efforts 
iii.henning 
henning from the trial court determination that spb applied the wrong standard of disability with respect to her request for reasonable accommodation.whereas spb inquired under the current version of section whether henning had a medical condition that limit ed a major life activity,the trial court determined the proper test was under the former version of section in effect at the time of cdc actions whether her condition substantially limit ed a major life activity.henning argues spb correctly applied the current statute.she alternatively argues her condition does substantially limit a major life activity.
we shall conclude the trial court was correct.the proper standard is the statute in effect at the time of cdc actions.for reasons we explain post,we will not address henning alternative argument.
in our view,this issue does not require that we defer to spb decision.yamaha,supra,cal th,d.we are not reviewing spb construction of a statute but rather its decision as to which version of the statute to apply.this implicates general legal principles of application of statues.
at the time of cdc actions,the scsa defined disability as a substantial limitation on a major life activity.thus,former section provided,a as used in this article hiring of disabled persons,the following definitions apply individual with a disability means any individual who a has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of that individual major life activities an individual with a disability is substantially limited if he or she is likely to experience
