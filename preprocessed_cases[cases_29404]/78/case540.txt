plaintiff,an employee of a subcontractor on a construction project,was injured on the job and brought this action against the owner of the property,seeking damages for personal injuries.the property owner moved for summary judgment on the ground that it had not breached a duty to plaintiff.the trial court granted the motion.plaintiff has appealed.
we conclude that summary judgment was properly granted because this action is barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation act,and the property owner did not affirmatively contribute to the cause of plaintiff injuries.
background 
on october,development,cgm,a property owner,entered into a contract with dekkon development,a general contractor,to develop commercial property located at railroad street in the city of industry.the contract provided in part dekkon shall supervise and direct the work,using it best skill and attention.dekkon shall be solely responsible for and have control over construction means,methods,techniques,sequences and procedures and for coordinating all portions of the work under the contract,unless contract documents give other specific instructions concerning these matters.
dekkon entered into a subcontract with l e builders to frame the roof.l e work complied with the architectural plans drafted by the architect,john cataldo.the materials were supplied by dekkon with the exception of nails in accordance with the general contract,which stated unless otherwise provided in the contract documents,the contractor shall provide and pay for labor,materials,equipment,tools,construction equipment and machinery and other facilities and services necessary for proper execution and completion of the work 
george sanchez,the construction superintendent and an employee of dekkon,scheduled the work of the subcontractors and supervised their work.he also reviewed the plan details with the architect,engineers,city inspectors,and the owners of the building.sanchez wrote daily reports on the progress of the construction.once a week,he held a safety meeting with the workers.sanchez was the only construction superintendent on the site no one worked directly for him there was no foreman.
larry endresen,a partner in l e,supervised the employees on the roof.sanchez told endresen to provide his employees with safety ropes or similar equipment.on june,endresen brought his crew down from the roof until he could supply them with safety equipment,more specifically,harnesses.endresen told the employees that they were to wear the harnesses while working in designated areas on the roof.l e was a licensed contractor but did not have workers compensation insurance.in other words,l e was illegally uninsured.see,all further section references are to the labor code unless designated otherwise.
peichin cheng was a of cgm and represented the company with respect to the construction of the building.sanchez would contact her when he needed an owner decision,namely,anything that was not in the plans.he never said anything to her about the use of safety equipment or that there were any problems with the subcontractors.between january,and june,period of almost five visited the site about times,almost always to complain that the project was behind schedule.at no time did cheng supervise l e employees,nor did she ever tell them how to do their job.
one of l e employees was plaintiff blas lopez.on june,lopez was at his work station,standing on a wooden platform that was attached to the roof with a metal hanger.he was not wearing a harness or other safety equipment.the metal hanger failed to support the wooden platform,causing lopez to fall approximately feet onto the concrete floor below.he sustained serious injuries.
in this action,lopez sued cgm on a negligence theory,alleging that it had maintained dangerous working conditions at the jobsite and had not provided lopez with safety equipment.other parties were sued on various theories.several were filed.at some point,a second amended complaint was filed.
on august,cgm filed a motion for summary judgment.lopez and other parties filed opposition papers,contending that cgm was liable under the peculiar risk doctrine.the parties later filed supplemental papers.on february,the trial court granted the motion,explaining its decision in a order.judgment was entered in favor of cgm.lopez filed a timely appeal 
discussion 
based on the principles governing summary judgment motions and the substantive law applicable to lopez claim,we conclude that cgm was entitled to summary judgment.
summary judgment 
a motion for summary judgment must be granted if all the papers submitted show that there is no triable issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.code civ,subd.c.
a defendant seeking summary judgment has met the burden of showing that a cause of action has no merit if that party has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action can not be established or that there is a complete defense to that cause of action in reviewing the propriety of a summary judgment,the appellate court independently reviews the record that was before the trial court we must determine whether the facts as shown by the parties give rise to a triable issue of material fact t he moving party affidavits are strictly construed while those of the opposing party are liberally construed.we accept as undisputed facts only those portions of the moving party evidence that are not contradicted by the opposing party evidence in other words,the facts alleged in the evidence of the party opposing summary judgment and the reasonable inferences therefrom must be accepted as true.jackson county of los angeles th,d,citations omitted.
f rom commencement to conclusion,the party moving for summary judgment bears the burden of persuasion that there is no triable issue of material fact and that he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.that is because of the general principle that a party who seeks a court action in his favor bears the burden of persuasion thereon there is a triable issue of material fact if,and only if,the evidence would allow a reasonable trier of fact to find the underlying fact in favor of the party opposing the motion in accordance with the applicable standard of proof.aguilar atlantic richfield cal th,d,citation and fn.omitted.
t he party moving for summary judgment bears an initial burden of production to make a prima facie showing of the nonexistence of any triable issue of material fact if he carries his burden of production,he causes a shift,and the opposing party is then subjected to a burden of production of his own to make a prima facie showing of the existence of a triable issue of material fact aguilar atlantic richfield,supra,cal th at,d.
peculiar risk doctrine 
lopez contends that he can recover damages from cgm based on the peculiar risk doctrine.under that doctrine,a person who hires an independent contractor to perform work that is inherently dangerous can be held liable for tort damages when the contractor negligent performance of the work causes injuries to others.privette superior court cal th,d,privette.
in privette,a property owner hired an independent contractor to install a new roof on his duplex.while attempting to carry several buckets of hot tar up a ladder,one of the contractor employees fell to the ground and was burned by the tar.he filed suit against the property owner.the owner moved for summary judgment,which the trial court denied.the court of appeal summarily denied the owner writ petition.the supreme court granted review and reversed,explaining 
a critical inquiry in determining the applicability of the doctrine of peculiar risk is whether the work for which the contractor was hired involves a risk that is peculiar to the work to be done,arising either from the nature or the location of the work and against which a reasonable person would recognize the necessity of taking special precautions.the term peculiar risk means neither a risk that is abnormal to the type of work done,nor a risk that is abnormally great it simply means a special,recognizable danger arising out of the work itself.
under the workers compensation act hereafter the act,all employees are automatically entitled to recover benefits for injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment,subd.a the workers compensation system was created to provide,in the words of our state constitution,for the comfort,health and safety and general welfare of any and all workers and those dependent upon them for support to the extent of relieving from the consequences of any injury or death incurred or sustained by workers in the course of their employment 
when the conditions of compensation exist,recovery under the workers compensation scheme is the exclusive remedy against an employer for injury or death of an employee.
when an independent contractor causes injury to the contractor own employee,the act exclusive remedy provision shields the contractor from further liability for the injury.yet,under an expansive view of the peculiar risk doctrine,the person who hired the independent contractor can,for the same conduct of the contractor,be held liable in a tort action for the injuries to the contractor employee 
t he principal who hires an independent contractor should be subject to no greater liability than its independent contractor agent,whose exposure for injury to an employee is limited to providing workers compensation insurance.t he rule of workers compensation exclusivity,which shields an independent contractor who pays workers compensation insurance premiums from further liability to its employees for injuries,should equally protect the property owner who,in hiring the contractor,is indirectly paying for the cost of such coverage,which the contractor presumably has calculated into the contract price 
t o allow an independent contractor employees who incur injuries compensable under the workers compensation system to also seek damages under the doctrine of peculiar risk from the person who hired the contractor would give those employees an unwarranted windfall.t o permit such recovery would give these employees something that is denied to other workers the right to recover tort damages for industrial injuries caused by their employer failure to provide a safe working environment moreover,to impose vicarious liability for tort damages on a person who hires an independent contractor for specialized work would penalize those individuals who hire experts to perform dangerous work rather than assigning such activity to their own inexperienced employees.privette,supra,cal th at,d,citations and fn.omitted.
after privette,the supreme court revisited the peculiar risk doctrine in toland sunland housing group,cal th,d,toland.there,an employee of a framing subcontractor was injured when a framed wall fell on him.he sought benefits under the workers compensation act and also filed a civil action against the general contractor.the high court concluded that the general contractor was not liable,stating 
the doctrine of peculiar risk,as relevant here,is described in two sections of the restatement second of torts,section and section.under section,a person who hires an independent contractor to do inherently dangerous work,but who fails to provide in the contract or in some other manner that special precautions be taken to avert the peculiar risks of that work,can be liable if the contractor negligent performance of the work causes injury to others.under section,even if the hiring person has provided for special precautions in the contract or otherwise,the hiring person can nevertheless be liable if the contractor fails to exercise reasonable care to take such precautions and the contractor performance of the work causes injury to others 
the plaintiff asserts that privette,supra,cal th d,bars recovery by an employee of an independent contractor only in cases based on section of the restatement second of torts,which,the plaintiff observes,holds the hiring person vicariously liable for the independent contractor failure to take the special precautions provided for in the contract or otherwise.thus,the plaintiff contends,privette has no bearing on cases such as his that are premised on the theory of section of the restatement,which holds the hiring person directly liable for failing to provide in the contract or in some other manner for the taking of special precautions.the plaintiff argument rests on the distinction some courts and commentators have drawn between these two sections,characterizing the liability under section as direct liability,while describing the liability under section as vicarious liability.
c ontrary to plaintiff assertion,our decision in privette,supra,cal th d,bars employees of a hired contractor who are injured by the contractor negligence from seeking recovery against the hiring person,irrespective of whether recovery is sought under the theory of peculiar risk set forth in section or section of the restatement second of torts.in either situation,it would be unfair to impose liability on the hiring person when the liability of the contractor,the one primarily responsible for the worker injuries,is limited to providing workers compensation coverage.toland,supra,cal th at,d,fns.omitted,italics added and omitted.
in camargo tjaarda dairy cal th,d,camargo,the supreme court discussed the peculiar risk doctrine again.in that case,a dairy hired an independent contractor to scrape manure out of its corrals and haul it away.one of the contractor employees died when his tractor rolled over as he was driving on top of a large mound of manure.the employee wife filed suit against the dairy,alleging that it had been negligent in hiring the independent contractor the employee employer because the dairy had failed to determine if the employee could operate the tractor safely.the supreme court,relying on privette and toland,held that the dairy was not liable.as the court stated 
section of the restatement second of torts,entitled negligence in selection of contractor,provides an employer is subject to liability for physical harm to third persons caused by his failure to exercise reasonable care to employ a competent and careful contractor a to do work which will involve a risk of physical harm unless it is skillfully and carefully done,or b to perform any duty which the employer owes to third persons.rest d torts,at,italics added.
the dairy contends an employee of a contractor is not a third person for the purposes of section 
a s we explained in toland,the rationale of our decision in privette extends to cases where the hirer is directly negligent in the sense of having failed to take precautions against the peculiar risks involved in the work entrusted to the contractor.to repeat in toland,we rejected the plaintiff argument that privette did not bar recovery for direct liability under section,but only for vicarious liability under section.in either situation,it would be unfair to impose liability on the hiring person when the liability of the contractor,the one primarily responsible for the worker injuries,is limited to providing workers compensation coverage.
for the same reasons,an employee of a contractor should be barred from seeking recovery from the hirer under the theory of negligent hiring set forth in section camargo,supra,cal th at,d.
more recently,in hooker department of transportation cal th,d,hooker,the supreme court held that a hirer of an independent contractor is not liable to an employee of the contractor merely because the hirer retained control over safety conditions at a worksite,but that a hirer is liable to an employee of a contractor insofar as a hirer exercise of retained control affirmatively contributed to the employee injuries.id.at,d,italics in original.the court holding was based in part on section of the restatement second of torts,which states one who entrusts work to an independent contractor,but who retains the control of any part of the work,is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care,which is caused by his failure to exercise his control with reasonable care.rest d torts,quoted in hooker,supra,cal th at,d.
