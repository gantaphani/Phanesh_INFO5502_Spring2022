this maritime action stems from injuries sustained by fred freudensprung freudensprung while working as a barge leaderman on an offshore oil and gas project in nigerian waters.freudensprung appeals the district court orders staying litigation of his jones act and general maritime law claims pending arbitration and denying his alternative motions for entry of a separate judgment or clarification of the court orders.freudensprung also appeals the district court order dismissing defendant willbros west africa,for lack of personal jurisdiction.for the following reasons,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
freudensprung jones act and general maritime law action asserted that he sustained permanently disabling injuries while working as a leaderman aboard a derrick barge off the coast of lagos,nigeria.freudensprung had been assigned to work on the barge through the operation of two agreements pertinent to the instant dispute a consultant agreement between freudensprung and offshore technical services,otsi,a corporation,and an offshore personnel supply agreement personnel supply agreement between otsi and the barge owner and operator,willbros west africa,wwai,a panamanian corporation.otsi is an independent contractor that supplies experienced personnel,or consultants,to the offshore hydrocarbon industry to perform work on offshore platforms.to that end,on november,otsi entered into the consultant agreement with freudensprung,the stated purpose of which was to effect the purchase of professional services for,engineering,planning,inspection,and pipeline work in order to discharge otsi own contractual obligations to entities seeking such services.pursuant to the consultant agreement,freudensprung agreed that he was retained as an independent contractor,not an employee,and further stipulated that he was not a seaman and thus would not claim any benefit under the jones act.the consultant agreement contained a texas provision as well as an arbitration clause requiring the parties to submit any dispute arising from the agreement to binding arbitration in houston,texas.the agreement also expressly incorporated the terms of any work order issued to freudensprung for a particular assignment.
on may,otsi and wwai entered into the personnel supply agreement,pursuant to which otsi agreed to supply technical,supervisory,and craft personnel to wwai for the performance of wwai contracts in africa relating to offshore marine operations,fabrication,inspection,installation,and pipeline work.the personnel supply agreement contained an english provision and an arbitration clause requiring otsi and wwai to submit any dispute related to the agreement to binding arbitration in houston,texas.under the terms of the personnel supply agreement,wwai would pay otsi certain stipulated daily rates for each worker provided,but all personnel supplied by otsi would remain employees of otsi while assigned to wwai.wwai,however,would be fully responsible for the management and organization of the work performed on the offshore vessels to which otsi personnel are assigned.
shortly after retaining otsi,wwai contacted the company with a request for consultants for a wwai project in nigeria.ultimately,wwai selected freudensprung from among the candidates referred by otsi.by work order,dated june,otsi and freudensprung agreed that freudensprung would work for wwai as a barge leaderman in west africa.like their consultant agreement,work order contained a clause requiring binding arbitration of any contractual disagreements,claims or disputes of any nature that might arise between otsi and freudensprung.
on july,freudensprung departed for africa to begin his assignment aboard wwai seagoing derrick barge,the w b.the project involved the installation of a single point mooring system spm,a marine structure that facilitates the loading and offloading of oil tankers from onshore tanks.on july,freudensprung and other crew members were charged with securing the spm to the ocean floor with twelve large chains.this task required laying the chains over the side of the wb and gradually lowering them by winches and cables.the chains were several hundred feet in length and each chain link weighed in excess of two hundred pounds.as the crew lowered the second chain,the cable on the stern winch failed,releasing the heavy chain.the runaway chain struck freudensprung from behind,causing him severe and permanently disabling mental and physical injuries that rendered him unable to work.
on october,freudensprung filed this maritime action in federal district court against otsi and several alleged subsidiaries of willbros group,including willbros usa,willbros engineering,and foreign subsidiaries wwai and willbros international.in his complaint,freudensprung asserted claims under the jones act,app,and the general maritime law for negligence,vessel unseaworthiness,and maintenance and cure.on december,defendant wwai filed a motion to dismiss the suit for lack of personal jurisdiction and insufficient service of process.in response,freudensprung amended his complaint,adding willbros group,the alleged parent company of wwai,and modifying the place where service could be properly effected upon wwai.nonetheless,on february,the district court granted without prejudice wwai motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.otsi then moved the district court to stay freudensprung claims pending arbitration,citing the arbitration clause in its consultant agreement with freudensprung.freudensprung responded by arguing that the agreement was a seaman contract of employment and thus exempt from arbitration,and furthermore that arbitration was inappropriate under both federal and state law.in its order of august,the district court granted otsi motion without assigning reasons and ordered the case administratively closed.the order further granted leave to move to reinstate the case on the district court active docket within ten days from the date of a ruling by the court of appeals.
on august,freudensprung filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court also denied in an order entered on october.finding the language in the district court august order staying the case unclear,freudensprung filed a motion for entry of judgment or,alternatively,a motion for clarification,on november.in his motion,freudensprung requested that if the district court had intended to enter a final order from which he could appeal,that the district court enter a separate document setting forth the judgment as required under federal rule of civil procedure.if the court did not so intend,freudensprung asked that the district court clarify that the stay would extend only until after arbitration of his claims and not until after a decision by this court.in response,otsi argued that freudensprung motion was simply a second motion for reconsideration and that it should be denied because the august,order was a final appealable order.on january,the district court denied freudensprung motion for entry of judgment and refused to clarify its order staying freudensprung claims.on february,freudensprung filed notice of appeal from the district court orders staying his claims pending arbitration and administratively closing the case,denying entry of judgment or clarification of its stay,and dismissing wwai for lack of personal jurisdiction.
discussion 
on appeal,freudensprung advances several points of error regarding the district court order compelling arbitration and staying his claims and its dismissal of wwai for lack of jurisdiction.before addressing the merits of these assertions,however,we must first address the timeliness of freudensprung february,notice of appeal,which was filed more than five months after the district court august,order staying his claims pending arbitration and administratively closing the case 
whether freudensprung timely filed notice of appeal 
a timely filed notice of appeal is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appellate review.dison whitley,cir.federal rules of appellate procedure a a provides in pertinent part that except as provided in rules a b,a,and c,the notice of appeal must be filed with the district clerk within days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.emphasis added.rule a further provides that a judgment or order is deemed entered within the meaning of rule a when it is set forth on a separate document in compliance with federal rules of civil procedure a and entered on the district court civil docket as required by federal rules of civil procedure a.
in this case,the timeliness of freudensprung february,notice of appeal depends on the effect of the district court refusal to enter a separate document labeled a judgment for its august,order staying his claims pending arbitration and administratively closing the case.certain amendments,effective december,were made to federal rule of civil procedure and federal rule of appellate procedure a to resolve uncertainties concerning how rule a definition of when a judgment or order is deemed entered interacts with the requirement in rule that,to be effective,a judgment must be set forth on a separate document.notes of advisory committee on rules,amendments,following rule amended rule a requires,in pertinent part,that e very judgment and amended judgment be set forth on a separate document,but does not require a separate document for an order disposing of a motion d for a new trial,or to alter or amend the judgment,under rule.a.a separate document provides the basis for the entry of judgment and must be distinct from any opinion or memorandum.notes of advisory committee on rules,amendments,following rule.for cases in which rule requires that a judgment or order be set forth in a separate document but there was none,both rule a and rule have been amended to provide that such judgment or order is deemed the time period to file notice of appeal starts to expiration of days from the date of entry of the judgment or order on the civil docket see fed.a a ii.b.
otsi and wwai concede that the district court never entered a separate judgment document for its august,order staying freudensprung claims.the ruling itself is entitled order,and nowhere even mentions the words judgment or final judgment.otsi and wwai nonetheless argue that no such separate document was required in this case because the order became final and appealable,and thus immediately subject to the time limit for filing notice of appeal,on the august,docket entry date of that order.specifically,otsi asserts that the order constituted a final appealable order for which no separate document was required because the order administratively closed the case,authorized an immediate appeal to this court,and neither recited lengthy factual and legal conclusions nor indicated that a separate document would be issued.in support of its contention that the august,order was final and appealable,and thus not subject to the separate document requirement,wwai relies primarily on american heritage life ins.orr,cir,in which this court held that an order compelling arbitration,staying the underlying litigation,and administratively closing the case,constituted a final appealable decision.according to otsi and wwai,therefore,freudensprung notice of appeal was not timely because he failed to file it within days of the district court august,order staying his claims and administratively closing the case.we disagree.
that the august,order was final and otherwise appealable does not in itself excuse the district court from rule separate document requirement.as we have previously stated,f inality of a judgment,appealability of a judgment,and the separate document requirement are different concepts,but are often confused.theriot asw well serv,cir.it is true that in american heritage,we held that an order administratively closing the case was tantamount to an order dismissing the case,and thus satisfied the federal arbitration act requirement that the order compelling arbitration be final to be appealable.american heritage,at see a providing for immediate appeal of any final decision with respect to arbitration,regardless of whether such decision is favorable or hostile to arbitration.american heritage,however,concerned only whether the ruling at issue was interlocutory or final in nature,as the federal arbitration act does not permit interlocutory appeals from orders compelling arbitration.see american heritage,at.the separate document rule was not at issue in american heritage,presumably rule had been satisfied in that case.
moreover,our opinion in theriot forecloses extending american heritage to the proposition advanced by the,that the finality of an order administratively closing a case obviates rule separate document requirement.see theriot,at.in theriot,we held that a minute entry on the district court docket recording the grant of summary judgment can not constitute a separate document for the purposes of meeting the rule requirement,regardless of whether that judgment was otherwise appealable as a final order or as an interlocutory order.theriot,at accord,transit mgmt.of southeast,group ins,cir.applying former rule in theriot,we observed that the rule applied to e very judgment,with judgment defined as a decree or any order from which an appeal lies,and thus concluded that even otherwise final and appealable orders still had to comply with rules and a before an appeal could be taken.theriot,at.
the rules of appellate and civil procedure applicable in this case similarly contain no exemption of orders staying litigation of claims from the separate document requirement,even if such order is final.see theriot,at.to the contrary,amended rule requires that e very judgment and amended judgment except orders disposing of certain enumerated motions,including rule motions to alter or amend the judgment be set forth on a separate document.while we construe freudensprung august,motion for clarification of the district court august,order staying his claims as a rule motion,see burt,at,amended rule exemption from the separate document requirement of the district court october,order denying this motion does not excuse the district court failure to enter a required separate document for its august,order.as the notes of the advisory committee on the amendments to rule instruct,
many of the enumerated motions in rule a a e are frequently made before judgment is entered.the exemption of the order disposing of the enumerated motion from the separate document requirement does not excuse the obligation to set forth the judgment itself on a separate document.and if disposition of the motion results in an amended judgment,the amended judgment must be set forth on a separate document.
accordingly,because the august,order lacked a required separate document,under amended rules and b,the order was not deemed entered and the time to file notice of appeal did not begin to expiration of the period following the august docket entry date of that order.as noted above,rule a a provides that in civil cases such as this one,a notice of appeal is timely if filed within days from such entry of judgment.freudensprung february,notice of appeal,which was filed on the day after a judgment was deemed entered,was therefore timely filed.in sum,we have repeatedly recognized that rule should be interpreted to prevent loss of the right to appeal,not to facilitate loss,and see no reason to depart from this principle in this case.hammack baroid,cir quoting bankers trust mallis,d accord,theriot,at citing in re seiscom delta,cir.
ii.the propriety of the district court order compelling arbitration of the jones act and general maritime law claims against otsi 
having determined that freudensprung notice of appeal was timely,we now turn to freudensprung assertion that the district court erred by compelling arbitration of his jones act and general maritime law claims against otsi.we affirm.

scope and enforceability of the arbitration agreement 
freudensprung primarily contends that he is exempt from arbitrating his jones act and maritime law claims because his consultant agreement with otsi constitutes a seaman employment contract and,as such,is expressly excluded from coverage under the federal arbitration act faa or arbitration act by virtue of section of that statute.otsi counters that this statutory exemption does not apply to freudensprung,arguing that freudensprung is not a seaman for the purposes of the jones act or the faa,that he is an independent contractor,and that,consequently,the parties agreement is not a seaman contract of employment.both freudensprung and otsi advance strong arguments in support of their respective positions on this point.however,our thorough review of the parties oral and written arguments and the record in this case reveals that it is unnecessary to decide today whether their consultant agreement may be properly deemed a seaman employment contract in order to determine the arbitrability of freudensprung claims.as otsi correctly points out in its most recent submission to this court on the peculiar facts of this case,even assuming arguendo that the consultant agreement is a seaman employment contract,the arbitration agreement contained therein is nonetheless enforceable pursuant to the convention on the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards convention as implemented by the united states through convention act,which we conclude governs concurrently with the faa in this case 
title of the united states code contains both the faa and the implementing legislation for the convention.the faa generally declares valid and enforceable written provisions for arbitration in any maritime transaction and in any contract evidencing a transaction involving interstate or foreign commerce.see.section of the faa,upon which freudensprung relies,excludes contracts of employment of seamen,railroad employees,or any other class of workers engaged in foreign or interstate commerce from the scope of the arbitration act.when the convention act governs the recognition and enforcement of an arbitration agreement or award,however,the faa applies only to the extent that the faa is not in conflict with the convention act or the convention as ratified by the united states.see francisco stolt achievement mt,cir,cert.denied,d.as we have recently recognized,unlike the faa,neither the convention,the ratifying language of the convention,nor the convention act recognize s an exception for seaman employment contracts.francisco,at.on the contrary,they recognize that the only limitation on the type of legal relationship falling under the convention is that it must be considered commercial,and an employment contract is commercial.id.
in determining whether the convention requires compelling arbitration in a given case,courts conduct only a very limited inquiry.see id.at citing sedco,petroleos mexicanos mexican oil,cir.accordingly,a court should compel arbitration if there is a written agreement to arbitrate the matter the agreement provides for arbitration in a convention signatory nation the agreement arises out of a commercial legal relationship and a party to the agreement is not an american citizen.id.citing sedco,at citing ledee ceramiche ragno,cir.once these requirements are met,the convention requires the district court to order arbitration,unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void,inoperative or incapable of being performed.sedco,at quoting convention,article ii.
in this case,the first three requirements are readily met.as noted above,freudensprung signed a written consultant agreement which contained an arbitration clause requiring the parties to submit any dispute arising from the agreement to binding arbitration in houston,texas the united states is a signatory to the convention and the agreement,which retained freudensprung to perform,engineering,planning,inspection,and pipeline work,arises out of a commercial legal relationship.see francisco,at defining a commercial legal relationship as including a transaction,contract,or agreement described in section of title that is,either a maritime transaction or a contract involving commerce.however,because both freudensprung and otsi are citizens we must further examine whether the lack of a foreign citizen as a party to the agreement renders the convention inapplicable.we conclude that it does not.
this court has yet to address whether the convention applies to an arbitration agreement between two citizens.we note at the outset that this court test,therefore,was articulated previously in the context of cases involving at least one foreign party to the agreement and derives from this court opinion in sedco,which in turn paraphrases the four criteria set forth by the first circuit in ledee.see sedco,at citing ledee,at.the first circuit,however,closely tracking the language of,did not require the presence of a party in all circumstances,instructing that the fourth criterion requires that courts ask is a party to the agreement not an american citizen,or does the commercial relationship have some reasonable relation with one or more foreign states see ledee,at emphasis added.consistent with this approach,the only federal appellate courts to have addressed the applicability of the convention to an arbitration agreement between two citizens,the second circuit and the seventh circuit,agree that the convention may apply in such cases provided that there is a reasonable relation between the parties commercial relationship and some important foreign element.jones sea tow,cir lander mmp investments,cir.this principle stems from the language of of the implementing legislation for the convention,entitled agreement or award falling under the convention,which provides 
an arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a commercial legal relationship,whether contractual or not,including a transaction,contract,or agreement described in section of the faa,which is entirely between citizens of the united states shall be deemed not to fall under the convention unless the relationship involves property located abroad,envisages performance or enforcement abroad,or has some other reasonable relation with one or more foreign states.
in jones,the second circuit found on the facts before it that the commercial relationship between the citizen disputants lacked the requisite foreign element and thus the arbitration agreement arising from that relationship was not governed by the convention.at.in that case,citizens hired a salvor pursuant to a lloyd standard form salvage agreement lof to rescue their yacht,which had grounded in waters off long island,new york.id.at.the relationship between the parties did not involve property abroad nor did it envisage performance abroad.id.at.the only purportedly foreign element in this otherwise wholly domestic matter was found in the lof itself,which contained an arbitral clause providing for arbitration in england under english law.id.at.the second circuit found that t he reasonable relation requirement necessary to make the arbitration provision in the lof cognizable under the convention could not be fulfilled by the terms of the lof is,the lof arbitration provision and its english clause.id.at.rather,the jones court reasoned,there had to be some reasonable connection to a foreign country independent of these provisions in the lof.
the present case,however,is distinguishable from jones,at,because the agreement at issue,albeit between two citizens,freudensprung and otsi,envisage d performance abroad the performance of pipefitting services on wwai barges in west africa.lander,however,involved circumstances similar to those before us.see at.the seventh circuit found in lander that,though phrased in the negative,applied concurrently with the faa to an arbitration agreement in a contract between two corporations where the only link between their relationship and a foreign nation was that their contract was to be performed in poland.id.at.in that case,the two corporations,mmp and lander,entered into a contract for the distribution by mmp in poland of products manufactured by lander in the united states.id.at.the contract contained an arbitration clause providing that disputes would be subject to binding arbitration to be conducted in new york.id.although both parties were citizens,the arbitration was to take place in the united states,and the only foreign connection to the parties legal relationship was that the distribution contract envisage d performance abroad,the seventh circuit concluded that the parties agreement fell squarely within the convention act scope and squarely outside its exclusion for agreements that have no foreign tie.id.at noting that adopts the provisions of the convention for any arbitration agreement arising out of a commercial legal relationship,provided only that if the relationship is entirely between citizens,it must involve performance abroad or have some other reasonable relation with a foreign country.
in this case,both jones and lander compel the conclusion that the convention act governs the arbitral clause at issue concurrently with the faa because there is a reasonable connection between the parties commercial relationship and a foreign state that is independent of the arbitral clause itself.see lander,at jones,at.as noted above,the consultant agreement between freudensprung and otsi envisage d performance abroad.accordingly,even assuming that the consultant agreement is a seaman employment contract,we conclude that its arbitral clause is enforceable under the convention as implemented by congress.
finally,we reject freudensprung assertion that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable because otsi failed to demonstrate that it was fair.under the faa,a written arbitration agreement is prima facie valid and must be enforced unless the opposing,freudensprung,allege s and prove s that the arbitration clause itself was a product of fraud,coercion,or such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of the contract.national iranian oil ashland oil,cir citation omitted see.as indicated above,in this case the faa applies to the extent that it is not in conflict with the convention act or the convention as ratified by the united states.see francisco,at.the convention imposes a mandatory obligation upon federal courts to enforce an arbitration agreement falling within its scope unless the agreement is null and void,inoperative,or incapable of being performed.see sedco,at quoting convention,article ii.we need not address whether the faa contractual defenses conflict with those of the convention,or whether they are any more inimical to the convention objective to encourage the recognition and enforcement of commercial arbitration agreements in international contracts,francisco,at they are to the longstanding federal policy favoring the enforcement of agreements to arbitrate disputes.see,of stamford,alaia,cir citation omitted.in this case,freudensprung has not alleged,let alone proffered any evidence,that would permit him to avoid arbitration under either standard.indeed,freudensprung has failed to point to any particular aspect of the agreement or circumstances surrounding its making that would render it unenforceable.freudensprung instead merely rests on the vague assertion that a agreement to arbitrate rather than litigate his personal injury claims is inherently unfair because he could not have made an informed decision concerning his remedies before his injury had occurred and before any medical advice was available to him.the difficulty with this argument is that the same could be said of any advance agreement to arbitrate personal injury claims,and it is by now beyond cavil that such agreements are presumptively enforceable.as noted above,freudensprung and otsi agreed to arbitrate any dispute arising out of the consultant agreement.it is o nly by rigorously enforcing arbitration agreements according to their terms,do we give effect to the contractual rights and expectations of the parties,without doing violence to the policies behind the faa.ford nylcare health plans of gulf coast,cir quoting volt information,bd.of trustees of leland stanford junior,d.accordingly,we find that freudensprung failed to demonstrate that the arbitration agreement was unfair.
iii.the propriety of the district court order dismissing wwai for lack of personal jurisdiction 
freudensprung next asserts that the district court erred by dismissing wwai for lack of personal jurisdiction,arguing that wwai had sufficient minimum contacts with texas to support the district court exercise of specific or general jurisdiction over wwai.alternatively,freudensprung argues that wwai impliedly consented to the district court exercise of personal jurisdiction by agreeing pursuant to its offshore personnel supply agreement with otsi to arbitrate any dispute with otsi in houston,texas wwai counters that it is a panamanian corporation with its principal place of business in panama,that it is a subsidiary of willbros international,also a panamanian corporation,and that it does not have the necessary minimum contacts with texas to be subject to the specific or general jurisdiction of that state courts.finding freudensprung arguments unavailing,we affirm.
standard of review and governing principles of law 
this court reviews de novo the district court determination that its exercise of personal jurisdiction over a defendant is proper.nuovo pignone,spa storman asia,cir citing wilson belin,cir.when,as in the instant case,the district court decides the motion to dismiss without holding an evidentiary hearing,the plaintiff must make only a prima facie showing of the facts on which jurisdiction is predicated.id.citing alpine view atlas copco ab,cir.in determining whether a prima facie case exists,this court must accept as true the plaintiff uncontroverted allegations,and resolve in its favor all conflicts between the jurisdictional facts contained in the parties affidavits and other documentation.id.quoting kelly syria shell petroleum dev,cir internal citation omitted.
in an admiralty case,the propriety of the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant,such as wwai,is determined first by the law of the forum state.a federal district court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant if the forum state statute confers personal jurisdiction over that defendant and the exercise of personal jurisdiction comports with the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.see storman asia,at citing adams unione mediterranea di sicurta,cir ruston gas turbines,donaldson,cir.in this case,these two inquiries merge into one because the texas statute permits the exercise of jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant to the fullest extent allowed by the united states constitution.see.civ.prac.rem.code ann.west ruston gas turbines,at.
as interpreted by the supreme court,the fourteenth amendment due process clause requires satisfaction of a test in order for a federal court to properly exercise jurisdiction the nonresident must have minimum contacts with the forum state,and subjecting the nonresident to jurisdiction must be consistent with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.asarco,glenara,cir international shoe washington.the minimum contacts prong is further subdivided into contacts that give rise to specific jurisdiction and those that give rise to general jurisdiction.a court may exercise specific jurisdiction when the defendant purposely directed its activities toward the forum state or purposely availed itself of the privileges of conducting activities there and the controversy arises out of or is related to the defendants contacts with the forum state.helicopteros nacionales de colombia,hall,d asarco,glenara,cir.in short,t he focus of this inquiry is on the relationship between the defendant,the forum,and the litigation.burger king rudzewicz,d.when a cause of action does not arise out of a foreign defendant purposeful contacts with the forum,however,a court may exercise general jurisdiction when the defendant has engaged in continuous and systematic contacts in the forum.storman asia,at.once the plaintiff has made out a prima facie showing under the first prong,the burden shifts to the defendant to show,under the second prong of the constitutional due process inquiry,that the exercise of jurisdiction would not comply with fair play and substantial justice.see id.
b.the sufficiency of wwai minimum contacts with texas 
freudensprung first contends that wwai has sufficient minimum contacts with texas to sustain the exercise of specific jurisdiction over that defendant,pointing primarily to wwai business dealings with otsi.specifically,freudensprung argues that wwai has purposely availed itself of the benefits and protections of the state of texas by contracting with otsi,a corporation,pursuant to the offshore personnel supply agreement contemplating arbitration of any disputes with otsi arising under that contract in houston,texas initiating and contemplating a business relationship with otsi engaging in communications with otsi in developing and carrying out that contract and wiring payments to otsi in texas.
our thorough review of the record and pertinent authorities convinces us that these limited contacts with the forum state were insufficient to support the exercise of specific jurisdiction over wwai.at the outset,we note that freudensprung is not a party to the contract between otsi and offshore personnel supply freudensprung cites as evidence of wwai minimum contacts with the forum state.the offshore personnel agreement provides that wwai agrees to purchase professional services from otsi for the performance of wwai projects in west africa,that all personnel supplied by otsi remained employees of otsi while assigned to wwai,and that wwai was absolved of the ordinary liabilities flowing to an employer.thus,strictly speaking,the instant litigation does not arise out of or relate to wwai contacts with texas.see coats penrod drilling,cir.
even assuming that the instant controversy could be deemed to arise out of the offshore personnel supply agreement,the minimum contacts resulting from this agreement,viewed in conjunction with the other contacts alleged by freudensprung,do not constitute the minimum contacts necessary to comport with constitutional due process.it is well established that merely contracting with a resident of the forum state is insufficient to subject the nonresident to the forum jurisdiction.holt oil gas harvey,cir citing colwell realty investments triple t inns,cir stuart spademan,cir see also burger king,at.moreover,this court has repeatedly held that the combination of mailing payments to the forum state,engaging in communications related to the execution and performance of the contract,and the existence of a contract between the nonresident defendant and a resident of the forum are insufficient to establish the minimum contacts necessary to support the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant.see,holt,at finding no specific jurisdiction over nonresident defendant where nonresident defendant entered into a contract with a texas resident,sent an agreement and checks to texas,and engaged in extensive telephonic and written communication with the plaintiff in texas stuart,at finding no indication that the nonresident defendant intended to avail himself of the privilege of doing business in texas and hence no specific jurisdiction where nonresident defendant contracted with texas residents,directed letters and phone calls to texas,shipped prototypes and products to texas,negotiated a contract with plaintiffs that was to be governed by texas law,and marketed his product in texas.
applying these principles here,it is apparent that freudensprung has not alleged sufficient minimum contacts to warrant the exercise of specific jurisdiction over otsi.as in holt and stuart,we find that in this case the fact that wwai contracted with otsi,initiated and contemplated a business relationship with otsi,communicated with otsi concerning the development and execution of the contract,and wired money to otsi in texas do not indicate that wwai intended to avail itself of the privilege of doing business in texas.see holt,at stuart,at.the significance of these alleged minimum contacts is severely diminished by the fact that the contract at issue specified that it was to be governed by english law and that the material portions of the contract,which contemplated the supply of personnel to wwai for its projects in west africa,were to be performed in west africa,not texas.see holt,at discussing relevance of contract provision and place of performance to minimum contacts analysis citing hydrokinetics,alaska mechanical,cir patterson dietze,cir.
the only other contact asserted by contemplation of arbitrating disputes arising under the contract in does not weigh in favor of finding specific jurisdiction.although in certain circumstances,an arbitration agreement may alter an otherwise decisive jurisdictional analysis by evidencing a nonresident implied consent to personal jurisdiction,see painewebber chase manhattan private bank,cir,this principle is inapplicable in the instant case where the arbitration agreement at issue only contemplates arbitration between wwai and otsi,not freudensprung.thus,even if wwai may have expected to arbitrate disputes between itself and otsi in texas,it does not concomitantly follow that wwai reasonably anticipated being haled into a texas court to defend a lawsuit brought by freudensprung or any other nonparty to the offshore personnel supply agreement.accordingly,we conclude that wwai did not impliedly consent to being subject to the jurisdiction of the texas courts for the adjudication of this particular dispute,and the arbitration provision at issue does not impact our jurisdictional analysis.
freudensprung similarly has failed to demonstrate that wwai had sufficient minimum contacts with texas to justify the exercise of general jurisdiction over wwai.as noted above,the general jurisdictional inquiry focuses exclusively on whether the nonresident defendant contacts with the forum unrelated to the cause of action are sufficiently continuous and systemic to satisfy due process requirements.helicopteros,at.in this case,freudensprung has asserted no contacts with texas made by wwai itself as evidence that the exercise of general jurisdiction is warranted.rather,freudensprung points to contacts made by willbros group,willbros group,the alleged parent company of wwai,as well as other willbros companies,in support of his assertion that wwai is subject to general jurisdiction in texas courts.citing willbros group form sec filing,which defines the company as willbros group,and all of its subsidiaries,freudensprung asserts that the company,and hence,wwai,is administered in texas,leases offices in texas,and has constructed a gas pipeline in texas and mexico.freudensprung also asserts that wwai general contacts with texas include the following willbros group principal place of business is in houston,texas,willbros group press releases are issued from houston,texas willbros group conference calls originate from houston,texas willbros group corporate officers reside in houston,texas and willbros group corporate board meetings occur in houston,texas.
as a general rule,however,the proper exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident corporation may not be based solely upon the contacts with the forum state of another corporate entity with which the defendant may be affiliated.see cannon cudahy packing.declining to attribute,for jurisdictional purposes,the presence of a subsidiary in the forum state to a nonresident parent corporation where the parent and subsidiary maintained distinct and separate corporate entities hargrave fibreboard,cir observing that g enerally,a foreign parent corporation is not subject to the jurisdiction of a forum state merely because its subsidiary is present or doing business in the forum state see also access telecom,mci,cir noting that typically,the corporate independence of companies defeats the assertion of jurisdiction over one by using contacts with the other.this principle,however,is not inviolate.rather,the presumption of institutional independence of related corporate entities may be rebutted by clear evidence,whic
