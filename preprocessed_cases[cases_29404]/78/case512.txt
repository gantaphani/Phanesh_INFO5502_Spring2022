discussion 
granite contends the board acted in excess of its jurisdiction,because mcreynolds did not file a timely petition to reopen case no.stk.we agree.
generally,appellate review of a board decision is limited to the question whether,under applicable legal principles,the board conclusions are supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record.kerley workmen.bd.cal d,mote workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.in this matter,however,the facts are essentially undisputed,and the question is the legal significance of those facts.where the facts are not in dispute,application of the legal rules to those facts is a question of law subject to de novo review.martinez workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
labor code section establishes a statute of limitations for claims of further disability.it reads,in relevant part nothing in this chapter shall bar the right of any injured worker to institute proceedings for the collection of compensation within five years after the date of the injury upon the ground that the original injury has caused new and further disability the jurisdiction of the appeals board in these cases shall be a continuing jurisdiction within this period further undesignated section references are to the labor code.section is jurisdictional selden workers comp.appeals bd.d.and bars the reopening of a workers compensation case more than five years after the date of injury newton workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
in his report and recommendation on petition for rehearing,the wcj acknowledged that mcreynolds filed a formal petition to reopen both cases on may.this was more than five years after the september,injury in case no.stk.however,the wcj relied on mcreynolds letter and the attached report by senegor.finally,the wcj noted that granite had participated in the proceedings since march.
in its opinion and decision after reconsideration,the board affirmed the wcj decision.the board adopted and incorporated the reasoning of the wcj and further explained e ven though applicant letter to the presiding wcj,received september,did not seek all benefits possible,we are persuaded that it preserved the appeals board jurisdiction to consider all benefits to which applicant is entitled.according to the board,mcreynolds made a broad request for additional workers compensation benefits within five years of the date of injury.
in reaching the foregoing conclusion,the board relied on two appellate decisions,bland workmen.bd.cal d,and blanchard workers comp.appeals bd.d.in bland,the employee injured his knee on december,and was awarded temporary and permanent disability benefits.bland workmen,supra,cal d at.on august,the employee filed a petition to reopen the case,requesting that the appeals board take such steps as may be necessary to a redetermination of this matter and for an increase in the benefits payable to petitioner on account of said permanent disability.id.at.the wcj awarded additional permanent disability benefits.however,because of a worsening condition that required surgery,the employee petitioned for reconsideration,claiming his condition was not yet permanent.on reconsideration,the board agreed and awarded the employee temporary disability benefits.ibid.the insurer petitioned for reconsideration,claiming the board lacked jurisdiction to award benefits for temporary disability because this had not been requested in the original petition.the board agreed and reversed itself.id.at.
the supreme court annulled the board decision.first,the court noted the language of the petition to reopen was sufficiently broad to encompass temporary disability.according to the court,the language requesting that the board take such steps as may be necessary to a redetermination of this matter invite d the b oard to enter a jurisdictional area of unlimited expanse bland workmen comp.app,supra,cal d at.the court explained the reference to permanent disability constitutes an additional and further request,joined with the prior prayer by the word and it does not restrict the prior,and broader,prayer.ibid.finally,the court summarized in conclusion,we do not believe that awkwardness in allegation should constrict a worker right to compensation.in many cases before the board,applicants are not represented by counsel and lack advice as to procedural niceties.the applicant claim is entitled to adjudication upon substance rather than upon formality of statement.id.at.
in blanchard,the employee sustained injury to his heart and circulatory system between november,and may,and was awarded permanent disability benefits.shortly before the expiration of five years from the last day of injury,the employee filed a petition for increased benefits,alleging since the issuance of such findings and award july,petitioner is informed and believes that there has been a chan
