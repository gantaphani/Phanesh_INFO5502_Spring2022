james kea petitions for review of the decision and order of the benefits review board the board denying his request for modification of his award of compensation pursuant to of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca or the act,west.for the following reasons,we grant the petition for review,vacate the board order,and remand.
on april,kea injured his right leg while working as a shipbuilder for newport news shipbuilding and dry dock company newport news.as a result of this injury,kea received temporary total disability benefits from april,to august,which were voluntarily paid by newport news.on september,the district director for the office of workers compensation programs owcp issued a compensation order awarding kea additional benefits in the amount of,representing temporary partial disability benefits for the period from august,to december,as well as continued medical care.newport news paid the final compensation payment for temporary disability benefits on september.
on september,kea counsel filed a letter with the district director,along with a form,employee claim for compensation,alleging that he had also sustained a permanent loss of wage earning capacity as a result of this injury,emphasis added.kea requested that the letter be considered a request for additional compensation in modification of the previous award and not a request for the scheduling of an informal conference.the also indicated that kea was pursuing permanent disability benefits.
on september,the district director served newport news with a notice to employer and insurance carrier that claim has been filed,and enclosed a copy of kea claim for additional compensation.the notice informed newport news that it should proceed to pay compensation promptly when due and to furnish medical treatment pursuant to the act,unless liability to pay compensation is controverted.the notice also advised newport news that notice that the right to compensation is controverted must be filed within fourteen days.newport news did not respond.
when kea filed his letter requesting modification,he remained under the medical care of his treating physician,alvin bryant.through counsel,he requested,on several occasions,that bryant provide a medical opinion as to whether he had reached maximum medical improvement,as well as to the degree of permanent partial disability to his right leg.bryant did not respond.
eventually,kea attorney was replaced and,in april,his new counsel was successful in obtaining the written opinion from bryant assigning a permanent partial disability rating of to kea right leg.upon further inquiry,bryant opined that kea had reached maximum medical improvement from his leg injury in august,but had experienced complications since then which had required ongoing medical attention.shortly thereafter,kea provided the permanent disability rating to newport news and requested payment for permanent partial disability benefits under the act.see c west.on may,mark ross performed an independent medical examination of kea at the request of newport news and assigned an impairment rating of to kea right leg.
in august,the parties executed a stipulation of facts regarding the april,injury.the document set forth the temporary total disability and temporary partial disability benefits paid to date,as well as a stipulation t hat as a result of the injury the employee has sustained permanent partial disability effective equivalent to loss of use of the right lower extremity which,at kea compensation rate,amounted to.the parties also agreed to waive a formal hearing and consent to the issuance of a formal order.however,newport news advised the owcp that it would not pay the stipulated amount because it believed the case to be time barred due to the order entered by owcp on.for the same reason,newport news sought to withdraw the stipulation of facts.
the owcp disagreed and informed newport news that although a compensation order had been entered on september,kea had filed an additional claim for benefits on september,which had been served upon newport news ten days thereafter.because a claim had been timely filed subsequent to the compensation order,owcp informed newport news that the claim for additional compensation was not barred by the limitations period in.the parties were given until september,to notify owcp of any objection regarding the entry of an order based on the august,stipulations.
in response,newport news asserted that kea letter was not a valid request for modification or for additional benefits,but rather amounted to a mere protective filing for future disability benefits prohibited by our decision in of pettus,cir.a request for formal adjudication of the dispute before an administrative law judge alj followed.
on january,the alj issued his decision and order denying additional benefits.the alj found that kea september,letter to the owcp did not operate to toll the statute of limitations on a request for modification and,therefore,that kea request for additional compensation based on bryant impairment rating was untimely.the alj also denied kea request for reconsideration.
the board affirmed on appeal.although the board concluded that the september,letter state d a valid basis for modification,as claimant sought a specific type of compensation,permanent partial disability benefits,the board believed that it was required to deny the claim because the relevant facts otherwise establish that th e letter constitutes an anticipatory filing of the type we disapproved in pettus.in particular,the board found it significant that kea requested that an informal conference not be scheduled,which belie d an intent to seek additional compensation and deliberately halted the administrative process,and that he failed to take any further action with regard to th e claim until he received the report of bryant in april.internal quotation marks omitted.the board held that these circumstances establish ed the absence of any actual intent to pursue modification at that time.
on appeal,we review the board interpretation of the lhwca de novo.because the board is not a policymaking agency,no deference is accorded its interpretations of the act.see potomac power director,owcp,d.
the statutory provision for modifications of compensation awards is found at,and provides as follows 
upon his own initiative,or upon the application of any party in interest,on the ground of a change in condition or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner,the deputy commissioner may,at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation,whether or not a compensation order has been issued,or at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim,review a compensation case and issue a new compensation order which may terminate,continue,reinstate,increase,or decrease such compensation,or award compensation.
emphasis added metropolitan stevedore rambo,d.the standard for requesting a modification under is most lenient.pettus,at.it need not meet any formal criteria,so long as it is sufficient to indicate a clear intention on the part of the claimant to seek further compensation and to trigger review before the limitations period expires.id.at.at a minimum,there must be some basis for a reasonable person to conclude that a modification request has been made.greathouse newport news shipbuilding dry dock,cir quoting pettus,at.thus,we have held that the modification request must manifest an actual intention to seek compensation for a particular loss,and filings anticipating future losses are not sufficient to initiate review.id.the request for benefits is only the first step of review.pettus,at.as we noted in pettus,s ection prescribes that w ithin ten days after such claim is filed,the district director shall notify the employer and any other person whom the district director considers an interested party,that a claim has been filed.id.at quoting b.upon notification of the claim,the district director shall make or cause to be made such investigations as he considers necessary in respect of the claim,and upon application of any interested party shall or
