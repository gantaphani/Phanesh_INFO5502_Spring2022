appellant was appointed to be a workers compensation judge wcj for the workers compensation appeals board wcab.in june,he attended new judges training,which included presentations on the timeliness of decisions.thereafter,in at least two quarterly trainings,he received instruction on the day rule.under this rule,a wcj may not receive his or her salary while any cause remains pending and undetermined for days after submission.at the end of a pay period,a wcj must sign and submit an affidavit under penalty of perjury,that to the best of his or her belief,no cause remains pending and undetermined that was submitted days prior to the first day of the next pay period 
in the fall of,appellant supervisor,presiding wcj barbara burke burke,met with him after reviewing a statistical report showing that he had been delinquent in completing his decisions.they discussed the term filed in the record within the context of the rule appellant expressed his belief that giving his secretary a handwritten decision met the requirement that the decision be filed in the record.burke explained that he was incorrect a decision was not filed in the record until it was typed,signed and officially filed in the record.appellant responded that there was a difference of opinion.burke reminded him of the correct meaning of the term and told him he would be held accountable for acting in accord with his belief.
appellant practice was to maintain a log in which he entered the date on which he wrote a handwritten decision and the date he signed a typed decision.to him,a decision was filed in the record when he wrote the handwritten decision,attached it to the case file and gave the decision and file to his secretary.
during the time period at issue herein,appellant executed eight affidavits stating under penalty of perjury that he had no causes pending and undetermined older than days when,in fact,he had causes older than days,in which no decision had been filed in the record.
appellant also engaged in inappropriate conduct toward two female attorneys who appeared before him.state compensation insurance fund attorney nona rentzer rentzer appeared in wcab cases before appellant from july through september.appellant was interested in pursuing a relationship with her.in july,he asked rentzer to come into his chambers during a conference.for to minutes,while the other attorneys involved in the conference waited,he engaged her in a personal conversation.as she was leaving his chambers,he gave her a card with his telephone number on it and invited her to lunch and the shooting range.thereafter,he telephoned her at least half a dozen times,sent her greeting cards and sought her out when she had appearances before the wcab.appellant conduct made rentzer uncomfortable.she was afraid,however,that if she did anything to anger him he would harm her.
appellant had been trained in disclosure requirements and recusal obligations as well as judicial ethics.despite his training,he did not recuse himself from cases in which rentzer was appearing.neither did he disclose to the parties that he had a personal interest in rentzer.he attempted to justify his behavior by stating that rentzer appearances before him were at uncontested settlement conferences,even though adversarial parties were involved in those settlement conferences.appellant conduct was persistent and conveyed an appearance of impropriety.
from june through september,marcia donald donald,an attorney for cigna,appeared in wcab cases before appellant one to five times a month.appellant initiated a personal relationship with her,although it never progressed beyond friendship.they frequently went to lunch together,and they went out together on a day neither had to work.appellant sent donald at least eight greeting cards and notes,in which he thanked her for her company and invited her to various activities and social events.appellant also telephoned donald at her office and home,sometimes as often as three or four times a week.
early in the summer of,donald told appellant that she did not want to pursue a relationship with him for fear of losing her job and because of the appearance of impropriety.appellant persisted in inviting her to lunch.she agreed to go only if they were part of a group.in september,donald agreed to allow appellant to join her and another attorney for lunch.when the other attorney failed to appear,donald had lunch with appellant alone.she felt pressured to do so because appellant was a judge before whom she appeared,and she did not want to anger or upset him.after the lunch,appellant telephone calls to donald increased in frequency,and he left messages for her at her office and home.finally,in october,donald told appellant he was no longer to telephone her,send her cards or go to lunch with her.during the time that appellant had a personal relationship with donald,he did not recuse himself from any cases in which she appeared or disclose their relationship to the other parties.
appellant was dismissed from his position effective september.this was accomplished by a notice of adverse action from the department of industrial relations,division of workers compensation.according to the notice of adverse action,appellant was being dismissed for incompetence,inefficiency,inexcusable neglect of duty,dishonesty,discourteous treatment of others,misuse of state property,other failure of good behavior and unlawful discrimination,including harassment,subds.b,c,d,f,m,p,t,w.this was based upon his falsification of affidavits,deficient productivity,and inappropriate behavior with rentzer and donald.

appellant motion to dismiss was heard in late and early by an administrative law judge alj.on april,the alj issued a proposed decision denying the motion to dismiss.
appellant appealed the alj proposed decision to the state personnel board board.the board rejected the alj proposed decision,resolving to decide the case itself.
the board issued its decision on october.a majority of the board concluded that appellant was dishonest on several occasions when he signed affidavits declaring that he had no cases pending for over days.a majority of the board also found that,while appellant conduct toward two female attorneys did not constitute sexual harassment under government code section w,it was extremely inappropriate and constituted cause for discipline.therefore,a majority of the board conclude d that dismissal was the just and proper penalty for the proven misconduct.
