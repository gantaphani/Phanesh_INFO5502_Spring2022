clifton norton norton,a battalion chief for the county of los angeles fire department county,was injured at work and was awarded vocational rehabilitation maintenance allowance at the temporary disability indemnity delay rate from september,to august,under labor code former sections and on december,the county petitioned the workers compensation appeals board wcab for reconsideration and contended that norton was not entitled to any maintenance allowance from september,to september,and,in any case,he was not entitled to receive a maintenance allowance at the significantly higher temporary disability indemnity delay rate for the entire period awarded.former section was repealed by operation of law on january.the wcab affirmed the entire award and the county petitioned this court for a writ of review,contending that norton right to any maintenance allowance ended with repeal of former section.we agree with the county,except for that part of the maintenance allowance that was not included in its petition for reconsideration and,therefore,became final before the repeal of former section.we affirm in part,and reverse in part,and remand the matter to the wcab for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
norton sustained work injuries to his neck,back and right arm on july,and to his cardiovascular system and hearing from april,to september.on june,the parties entered into stipulated awards for permanent disability,but the stipulation did not include vocational rehabilitation benefits.
norton requested reinstatement of vocational rehabilitation benefits in letters dated september and.on september,norton filed a request for dispute resolution with the rehabilitation unit unit.on march,the unit determined that norton claim for vocational rehabilitation benefits was barred by the statute of limitations.
norton appealed to the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj.on july,the wcj found that the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations and referred the matter to the unit for a determination of the benefits that are due.the county filed a petition for reconsideration of the statute of limitation finding with the wcab,which denied reconsideration on september.the county did not file a petition for writ of review of the denial of reconsideration.
during this period,the parties entered into a settlement of prospective vocational rehabilitation services under former section,a settlement approved by the unit.
on march,the unit issued another determination that norton was entitled to past maintenance allowance at the temporary disability indemnity delay rate for the period of september,to august,under california code of regulations,title,former section.the county appealed this decision to the wcj.
the parties proceeded to trial before the wcj,stipulated to the facts and submitted on the record.the county contended that norton was not entitled to maintenance allowance until he had actively pursued vocational rehabilitation by filing for dispute resolution with the unit,which occurred on september.thus,the county argued,norton was not entitled to maintenance allowance from september,to september.the county also contended that former section did not provide for maintenance allowance at a greater rate than per week,and former section,which did,had been repealed.
on december,the wcj issued findings and an order determining that norton was entitled to maintenance allowance at the temporary disability indemnity delay rate as ordered by the unit and denied the county appeal.in the wcj opinion on decision,he explained that defendant does not dispute that it owes retroactive benefits,and that norton had in fact requested vocational rehabilitation for the period between september,and september,but the county had failed to respond,request dispute resolution with the unit or attempt to terminate benefits.the wcj further decided that norton was entitled to maintenance allowance at the temporary disability indemnity delay rate because former section continued to apply under city of santa rosa workers comp.appeals bd.the wcab had ruled in city of santa rosa that former section,subdivision c expressly incorporated former section,indicating the legislature intended it to apply,and that california code of regulations,title,former section had not been amended or repealed.
on december,two days before the repeal of former section went into effect,the county petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.the county argued that even though norton was deemed to be a qualified injured worker for vocational rehabilitation due to injury to his cardiovascular system and hearing,he had not actively pursued benefits or chosen to participate under former section,subdivision c until he filed for a dispute resolution with the unit.the county also contended that norton was not entitled to maintenance allowance at the temporary disability indemnity delay rate because former section had been repealed and,therefore,maintenance allowance was limited to a maximum of per week under former section,subdivision d.the county requested that the wcab grant reconsideration and vacate the wcj order awarding maintenance allowance at the delay rate and for the period from september,through september.
in a report on reconsideration,the wcj detailed his reasons for his findings and order.
on january,the wcab denied the county petition for reconsideration based on the record and the wcj report.the county then filed its petition for writ of review with this court.
contentions 
in its petition for writ of review before this court,the county contends that there is no statutory authority to award maintenance allowance at the temporary disability indemnity delay rate because former section was repealed and former section,subdivision d limited maintenance allowance to per week.it argues that the legislature intended the repeal of former section and former section to extinguish existing rights retrospectively,citing aetna cas.surety.acc.com.cal d,aetna casualty and graczyk workers comp.appeals board d,graczyk.the county asserts the legislature did not reenact former section with former section.it further contends that the legislature,in senate bill reg.sess,included a sunset provision as part of urgency legislation intended to reduce the escalating cost of workers compensation.the county also contends that the wcab incorrectly interpreted former section,subdivision c as providing for continuation of former section.the county argues that the proceedings before the unit,wcj and wcab only decided that norton claim for vocational rehabilitation benefits was not barred by the statute of limitations,and no final,vested judgment exists awarding substantive vocational rehabilitation benefits.
norton answers that the repeal of former section did not extinguish his right to the awarded maintenance allowance.norton contends that the wcj findings and order became final when former section was repealed and reconsideration was denied by the wcab.he also contends that the county failed to raise the repeal of former section in its petition for reconsideration,and the issue was waived under section norton further asserts that because the petition for reconsideration was filed on december,this case is distinguishable from the recent case of beverly hilton hotel workers comp.appeals bd.th beverly hilton hotel in which division five of this district held that the right to vocational rehabilitation benefits is extinguished if an award was not final on the date former section was repealed.in beverly hilton hotel,the unit determination,the wcj findings and award,and the decision by the wcab on reconsideration were all issued before january,the effective repeal date of section.beverly hilton hotel,supra,th at.norton asserts that in any case maintenance allowance at per week from september,through august,was not appealed by the county and this part of the award should be deemed final 
in a letter brief to this court,the wcab responds that it should have granted the county petition for reconsideration,vacated the award of maintenance allowance from september,through august,and found
