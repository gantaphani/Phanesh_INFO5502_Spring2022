introduction 
petitioner aaron matea sustained an admitted industrial injury when a rack of lumber fell on his left leg.in addition to his physical injury matea alleged a resulting psychiatric injury,but at the time of his injury he had worked for respondent the home depot for less than six months.california workers compensation system is intended to guarantee compensation to employees injured in the course of their employment,but labor code section,subdivision d precludes compensation for a psychiatric injury related to a claim against an employer unless the employee has been employed by that employer for at least six months.an exception to this rule is provided for psychiatric injuries that are caused by a sudden and extraordinary employment condition,subd.d.in this case,the workers compensation judge wcj found that that matea injury was caused by a sudden and extraordinary event.the workers compensation appeals board the board reversed that finding by the wcj and found that it was matea burden to show that his psychiatric injury was caused by a sudden and extraordinary employment condition but,based on matea trial testimony,he did not meet his burden.
matea has filed a timely petition for writ of review,contending that the board erred when it reversed the wcj findings.in analyzing matea claim we must determine whether or not matea met his burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances under which his leg injury occurred constituted a sudden and extraordinary employment condition under section,subdivision d.we conclude,based on the limited record and factual findings of the board before us,that matea has met his burden and has established that he was injured during the first six months of his employment as a result of a sudden and extraordinary employment condition as required by section,subdivision d.accordingly,we will annul the board decision.
background 
matea began working for the home depot in july.on september,while working as a,matea injured his left foot and ankle when all the lumber four by fours from a rack fell on him after the store closed he does not know how many pieces of lumber actually fell on his leg.he suffered a contusion and swelling but no fracture,and has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy rsd.he worked in a restricted capacity after his leg injury for short periods of time.however,matea attempts to return to his prior position were unsuccessful and he last worked in december.he reports constant pain in his ankle and foot.he also reports depression due to his belief that he is not going to improve and anxiety due to his fear of being hurt again.one psychiatrist determined that the predominant cause of matea pain disorder and depression was his september,industrial injury.another psychiatrist found no industrial psychiatric injury.
the hearing before the wcj 
matea filed an application for adjudication of his workers compensation claim.matea was the only witness at the hearing before the wcj on january.he testified that he was hired by the home depot in may,june,or july.he injured his foot when a rack of lumber fell on his left leg.although matea had testified at his april,deposition that another employee witnessed the incident,neither party called that employee to testify.nor did the home depot offer or introduce the transcripts of matea april,and november,deposition testimony,choosing instead to submit them.the home depot admitted the injury to matea left leg but contested the alleged resulting psychiatric injury.the home depot also raised the issue of whether any psychiatric injury was compensable under section,which limits compensation for psychiatric injuries that occur during the first six months of an employee employment,and the wcj granted the parties time to file briefs on the issue.
in his brief matea contended that the section issue was improperly raised for the first time at trial the home depot did not carry its burden of proving that matea was not employed for six months under section including postinjury employment,matea was employed for the home depot for over six months matea injury falls under the sudden and extraordinary employment condition exception in section,subdivision d and regardless of whether section applies,the home depot is liable for psychiatric treatment needed to fix the underlying physical problem resulting from the admitted industrial leg injury.in its response to matea brief,the home depot contended that it was denying matea claim that his psychiatric injury is a compensable consequence of the september,injury pursuant to section,subdivision d,because matea was employed for less than six months at the time of the injury.the home depot further claimed that the issue as to the applicability of section was raised in its statement.
the wcj vacated submission of the matter and set a further hearing in order to supplement the record on the issue of the duration of matea employment under section.at the june,further hearing,which matea did not attend but where he was represented by counsel,the home depot submitted records indicating that matea was employed there from thorough december.the matter was resubmitted on july.
the wcj findings and award 
the wcj filed and served his findings and award on july.the wcj found in pertinent part that matea was percent permanently disabled and,although he was not employed by the home depot for a total of six months as required by section,subdivision d,his psychiatric injury was caused by a sudden and extraordinary event.while the case is a close one,the facts here do seem to meet that definition.matea was injured when a wall shelf holding up a large amount of lumber gave way without warning,which resulted in the fall of the lumber on matea leg.no testimony was presented regarding how often home depot has its shelves give way and dump lumber onto its aisles,but one assumes that such occurrences are quite rare,given that those aisles are open to the public.
the wcj awarded matea permanent disability of percent,entitling him to payments at the rate of per week beginning january,and continuing for life.the wcj also awarded matea further medical treatment reasonably required to cure or relieve him from the effects of his injury,and reimbursement for medical treatment expenses.the home depot filed a petition for reconsideration.
the board decision 
the board filed an opinion and order granting reconsideration and decision after reconsideration on september.the board found that,pursuant to section,subdivision d,matea claim of psychiatric injury is barred unless the psychiatric injury was caused by a sudden and extraordinary employment condition.and since the sudden and extraordinary provision negates the employment requirement,which is already established herein,it is matea burden to show that the psychiatric injury was caused by a sudden and extraordinary employment condition.based on matea trial testimony,we conclude that matea did not meet his burden.at the trial of january,matea testified that he injured his foot when a rack of lumber fell on his left leg.the home depot is a hardware store that sells lumber to the public the fact that matea,a store manager trainee,would be working in close proximity to racks of lumber is not unusual.again,it was matea testimony that the injury of september,happened when a rack of lumber fell on his left leg.considering the site of employment,wherein it would have been normal for matea to work in proximity to lumber racks,we conclude that a rack of lumber falling on his leg was not a sudden and extraordinary employment condition within the meaning of section,subdivision d.therefore,his claim of psychiatric injury is barred by the employment requirement.accordingly,we will reverse the wcj finding that matea sustained an industrial psychiatric injury.
the board rescinded the wcj decision and award.it found that matea sustained a compensable injury to his left leg,but all remaining issues,including but not limited to permanent disability,were returned to the trial level for further proceedings and a new decision consistent with the board opinion.matea petitioned for reconsideration.
the board filed an opinion and order denying further reconsideration on november.the board stated in part,the court in stores,workers compensation appeals board th,fn,d,stated that the sudden and extraordinary language is limited to occurrences such as gas main explosions or workplace type of events that would naturally be expected to cause psychic disturbances even in a diligent and honest employee.in asserting that his injury was sudden and extraordinary in this case,matea misinterprets the court language in footnote.the injury in this case may have been a devastating injury,but it was not legally sudden and extraordinary because it was not in the nature of a gas main explosion or workplace violence or a type of event that would naturally be expected to cause psychic disturbances even in a diligent and honest employee.
matea filed a timely petition for writ of review 
discussion 
overview of california workers compensation system 
california has a workers compensation system.with a few exceptions,all california employers are liable for the compensation provided by the system to employees injured or disabled in the course and scope of their employment,regardless of the fault of either party.cal,art.xiv.the workers compensation act intends comprehensive coverage of injuries during employment.see,subd.a.the purposes of the act are several.it seeks to ensure that the cost of industrial injuries will be part of the cost of goods rather than a burden on society,to guarantee prompt,limited compensation for an employee work injuries,regardless of fault,as an inevitable cost of production,to spur increased industrial safety,and in return,to insulate the employer from tort liability for his employees injuries.citations.borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d.
the employee has the burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,that he or she has sustained a compensable industrial injury.section provides that issues of compensation for injured workers shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.department of rehabilitation workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,department of rehabilitation.this rule is binding upon the board as well as this court.lamb workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,lamb department of rehabilitation,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,a ll aspects of workers compensation law are to be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker.citation.department of rehabilitation,supra,at,d.
it should be remembered,however,that the purpose of an award under the workers compensation scheme is not to make the employee whole for the loss which he has suffered but to prevent him and his dependents from becoming public charges during the period of his disability complete protection is not afforded the employee from disability because this would constitute an invitation to malinger or to be careless on the job as he would then lose nothing in assuming a disabled status.citation.department of rehabilitation,supra,cal th at,d.
all judicial powers under the workers compensation system are vested in the board,subject only to the review by the appellate courts of this state.wcjs hear and decide compensation claims as trial judges,and the board functions as an appellate body.the board has the power to reject the factual findings of a wcj and to make its own findings of fact,and may affirm,rescind,alter or amend a wcj decision or award,lamb,supra,cal d at.
appellate review 
an appellate court review of a decision by the board is limited.as to findings of fact,we defer to the board findings if supported by substantial evidence.citation.while we accord significant respect to the board interpretation of statutes in the area of workers compensation citation,we subject the board conclusions of law to de novo review citations.department of rehabilitation,supra,cal th at,d.
a lthough the board is empowered to resolve conflicts in the evidence citations,to make its own credibility determinations citations,and upon reconsideration to reject the findings of the wcj and enter its own findings on the basis of its review of the record citations,nevertheless,any award,order or decision of the board must be supported by substantial evidence in the light of the entire record,citation.citation.lamb,supra,cal d at,italics omitted.as a general rule,the board must accept as true the intended meaning of evidence both uncontradicted and unimpeached.citations.citation.id.at,italics omitted.
although the employee bears the burden of proving that his injury was sustained in the course of his employment,the established legislative policy is that the work ers compensation act must be liberally construed in the employee favor,and all reasonable doubts as to whether an injury arose out of employment are to be resolved in favor of the employee.citation.lamb,supra,cal d at.
the interpretation of a labor statute is a legal question which we review independently from the determination of the board.citation.nonetheless,we generally defer to the board interpretation of labor statutes,unless the interpretation is clearly erroneous.citation.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d pacific gas electric workers comp.appeals bd.th,d pacific gas electric.an erroneous interpretation or application of law by the board is a ground for annulment of its decision.citations.citations.pacific gas electric,supra,th at,d.
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose,fair employment housing com.cal d,pacific gas electric,supra,th at,d.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent,supra,cal d at.
section,subdivision a,states that a psychiatric injury shall be compensable if it is a mental disorder which causes disability or need for medical treatment,and it is diagnosed pursuant to specified procedures.subdivision d of section provides in pertinent part that,n otwithstanding any other provision of this division,no compensation shall be paid pursuant to this division for a psychiatric injury related to a claim against an employer unless the employee has been employed by that employer for at least six months.the six months of employment need not be continuous.this subdivision shall not apply if the psychiatric injury is caused by a sudden and extraordinary employment condition.
the statute,which contains other provisions governing and to some extent limiting benefits for psychiatric claims,was enacted in.it was designed to address public and legislative concerns about,inter alia,the proliferation of workers compensation cases with claims for psychiatric injuries.citation,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.section was passed in response to increased public concern about the high cost of workers compensation coverage,limited benefits for injured workers,suspected fraud and widespread abuses in the system,and particularly the proliferation of workers compensation cases with claims of psychiatric injuries.citation.as a result,t he legislature expressed intent in enacting labor code section was to establish a new and higher threshold of compensability for psychiatric injury.citations.city of oakland workers comp.appeals bd.th,d city of oakland see,subd.c.
