during the initial period of medical control by the employer following an industrial injury,daniel ordorica refused care by the employer doctor and instead began treatment with a physician he chose.the workers compensation appeals board wcab determined that ordorica refusal and change of physicians was an illegal and deliberate attempt to deny the employer its right of medical control,and ordorica was estopped from asserting his physician was the primary treating physician ptp in addition,the wcab extended the employer medical control to two days after a future examination with the employer physician.
ordorica as petitioner alleges he had no legal obligation to accept treatment from the employer physician,and he mistakenly scheduled an appointment with his treating doctor during the period of the employer medical control.ordorica further contends the relief afforded by the wcab is not provided by statute.the employer answers its right to medical control was violated and the decision is justified.
although initially we summarily denied the petition for writ of review,the supreme court granted review and ordered hearing of the matter by this court.we find that ordorica violated the employer right to control medical treatment,but agree that the wcab remedy exceeds the law.accordingly,the decision is affirmed only in part,and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
daniel ordorica,a motor home installer for lance campers manufacturing corporation,claimed he injured his head,neck,back,both upper extremities,and his psyche on february,when he was struck at work by a sheet of wood.
the same day lance campers referred ordorica to daniel mongiano,who diagnosed a wound to the forehead which required sutures.ordorica claims he told mongiano he had injured his neck and back as well,but the doctor found the complaints unrelated.pursuant to company policy,mongiano also conducted a drug test,which was positive for marijuana.
ordorica subsequently returned to mongiano to have the stitches removed,but the doctor was not in.he informed the receptionist he had to leave to pay some bills and was told the doctor would be in the office when he returned.when ordorica returned the office was closed.ordorica then removed the stitches himself.
on or about february,ordorica retained his current counsel,allan cutler.in a letter dated february,cutler wrote lance campers of the representation and that ordorica was unhappy with his present medical care and is making a demand to change primary treating physician within five days.in a separate letter,cutler stated that ordorica had chosen ronald perelman,as the ptp pursuant to labor code sections and generally,section provides for medical control of treatment by the employer for the first days following an industrial injury,while the employee has the right to select his or her own physician after the day period.ralphs grocery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.however,if an employer fails to provide appropriate treatment as required,an employee may be entitled to medical care.mccoy industrial acc.com.cal d.in addition,section permits at any time a change of physicians to be provided by the employer within five working days of the employee request.ralphs grocery workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.
in a third letter,cutler confirmed that an appointment had been set with perelman for march.these letters were also faxed to lance campers on february.
by letter of february,faxed to cutler,lance campers acknowledged receiving the february,fax.lance campers also gave notice that it had designated,as the new ptp,and an appointment had been scheduled for ordorica on march.
in a separate letter of the same date,lance campers asked whether ordorica would attend the appointment with since cutler had responded that perelman was selected as ptp.lance campers further stated that medical control of treatment within the period continued by providing the appointment with within five days,and attendance was mandatory.
meanwhile,mongiano issued a report signed on february,with a copy to,that ordorica was declared permanent and stationary and released from further medical care because he had not returned for treatment.
ordorica failed to attend the march,appointment with.lance campers then informed ordorica his claim was denied.on march,ordorica initiated treatment with perelman,which included therapy for the spine.
ordorica was finally evaluated by on june.diagnosed a concussion and forehead laceration which had been sutured and healed.further concluded ordorica was permanent and stationary,had no residual disability,and required no work restrictions or future medical care.
in addition,noted that showed a mild compression fracture of the spine at.however,concluded the compression fracture was not because ordorica had instead hyperextended his spine in the industrial injury.the compression fracture was caused by more forceful flexion,or flexion and rotation.
in deposition,ordorica testified he never received notice of the march,appointment with.when he subsequently received the denial letter from lance campers,ordorica called cutler office and was told,i did want you to go to that doctor.you are going to my doctor.
at trial lance campers admitted injury to the head but denied the upper extremities,neck,back and psyche.the issues submitted for decision were limited to whether ordorica could designate perelman as ptp or was estopped,and deposition attorney fees.
this time ordorica testified he was advised he did not have to go to ha eri for treatment,and could choose to wait and see perelman three days later.he added that he lost confidence in the company doctors because he was denied back treatment,the stitches were not removed,and he was tested for drugs although he did not cause the accident.
the workers compensation judge wcj found that ordorica failure to keep the march,appointment with was in bad faith,and an illegal attempt to deny lance campers right to control medical treatment during the first days following the industrial injury.consequently,ordorica was estopped to declare perelman as ptp,and lance campers right to control medical treatment was extended until two days following an examination to be scheduled with.the wcj also denied the deposition attorney fees.
in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained ordorica and cutler were informed by letter lance campers was maintaining its right to medical control of treatment with.in addition,the record showed cutler intended to secure the right before the day period expired as indicated by the appointment being set with perelman.as a result,remained ptp.
ordorica filed for reconsideration with the wcab.ordorica pointed out section required liberal construction of the facts and law as set forth in arriaga county of alameda cal th,d.
ordorica further alleged the interference with lance campers right of medical control during the first days was inadvertent.ordorica claimed the appointment with perelman was mistakenly set within the day period because it was overlooked that february contained only days,and march,was actually the day.
furthermore,ordorica had not been instructed to miss the appointment with.instead,cutler,who had been practicing for years without discipline by the state bar and was a certified specialist in workers compensation,advised ordorica he was free to reject medical care from lance campers since sections to are inapplicable to treatment,and section was never raised.
according to cutler,legal alternatives are,paying for alternative treatment or waiting for the employer period of medical control to expire.since testimony at trial confirmed there were good reasons to avoid treatment with lance campers physicians,ordorica decided to wait and treat with perelman.even if missing the initial appointment with was viewed as a deliberate deprival of lance campers right to medical control,there was no authority for rejecting ordorica choice of perelman as ptp,or to extend lance campers right of control indefinitely.
in the report on reconsideration the wcj pointed out the employer right to medical control during
