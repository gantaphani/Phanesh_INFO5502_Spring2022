on january,richard franzen filed a complaint against ellis corporation ellis,his former employer.he alleged,inter alia,that ellis had interfered unlawfully with his right to take medical leave under the family and medical leave act fmla,a,and had discriminated against him for taking leave,in violation of a.upon motion of ellis,the trial was bifurcated into liability and damages phases.a jury heard evidence on the issue of liability and rendered a verdict in favor of franzen.the district court then held a bench trial on the issue of damages.it found that franzen was not entitled to any damages therefore,it also refused to grant franzen request for attorneys fees.for the reasons set forth in this opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.
ellis corporation employed franzen as a mechanical engineer from until.at the end of april,franzen was seriously injured in an automobile accident.on may,he called jennifer ruffolo,ellis human resources manager,and informed her that he had been injured and was unsure when he would be able to return to work.during this conversation,ruffolo requested that he provide her with a doctor note in order to establish his eligibility to receive fmla leave and disability benefits.
on may,franzen received in the mail a packet that contained a number of forms,including a medical certification form.ellis employees were required to complete this paperwork in order to receive disability and fmla benefits.the forms stated that franzen had fifteen days from the date of receipt to return the paperwork or his absences would be considered unexcused and he would not be entitled to these benefits.his paperwork,including his medical certification form,therefore was due to the company no later than may,
after franzen conversation with ruffolo,ellis began paying franzen disability benefits in anticipation of receiving proper medical documentation.nevertheless,ellis claimed that,despite numerous calls informing him of the necessity of the documentation and the consequences of not sending it in a timely fashion,it did not receive the proper medical certification from franzen by may.accordingly,on may,ellis denied franzen request for fmla leave.
because franzen request for fmla leave had been denied,his absences from april through may were considered unexcused.ellis therefore terminated franzen employment on may,under the terms of its attendance and punctuality policy.that day,ellis sent franzen a letter notifying him that both his disability benefits and his employment had been terminated because of his unexcused absences.
complaining of severe back pain,franzen made numerous visits to physicians in the weeks after his accident.when conservative treatment failed,he visited avi bernstein,an orthopedic surgeon.on june,bernstein issued franzen a doctor note stating that he was temporarily disabled and unable to work until further notice.
in july,bernstein performed surgery to repair franzen spine.although the surgery was successful from a medical standpoint,franzen still complained of severe pain in the months that followed.on december,in connection with franzen application for social security benefits,bernstein offered his medical opinion that franzen was permanently and totally disabled and that he therefore could not return to any of his prior work activity or any other work.at no time since his discharge from ellis did franzen seek alternate employment.
in january,franzen filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois,alleging that ellis had interfered unlawfully with the exercise of his fmla rights under a.he also alleged that ellis had discriminated against him in violation of a,breached his employment contract by failing to provide disability benefits,and violated a state law that prohibits retaliatory discharge.
ellis moved for summary judgment on all claims.the district court dismissed both the contract claim and the retaliatory discharge claim on summary judgment,and franzen did not challenge this decision.the district court denied ellis summary judgment motion on the fmla claims.it held that a question of fact existed as to whether franzen had supplied ellis with the requisite documentation necessary for his receipt of fmla leave.
ellis then moved to bifurcate the trial on the fmla claims into separate liability and damages phases.before the district court could rule on this motion,however,both parties consented to the exercise of jurisdiction by a united states magistrate judge.upon reassignment to that judicial officer,the motion to bifurcate was granted.
in april,a jury trial was held on the issue of liability.the sole issue of fact litigated before the jury was whether ellis had received the requisite medical documentation from franzen prior to may.if it had not received the requisite documentation,franzen was not entitled to fmla protection.if it had,however,then its termination of franzen employment was in violation of the fmla.
in support of his contention that ellis in fact had received his physician note prior to the deadline,franzen presented the testimony of tamara herman,a secretary at his doctor office herman testified that,at least three times prior to may,she had faxed to ellis human resources department a note from franzen physician,konowitz,stating that he was temporarily unable to return to work in its defense,ellis introduced testimony from ruffolo,its human resources manager.ruffolo testified that she had not received the necessary documentation from franzen before may,despite numerous phone calls informing him that she needed to receive it by that date.specifically,she denied having received any fax from konowitz office prior to may.
at the conclusion of the trial,the jury was given the following interrogatory 
did plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant received the requested medical documentation by may,if you answer yes,then you are finding in favor of the plaintiff.if your answer is no,then you are finding in favor of the defendant.
tr.at.after deliberation,the jury answered yes,finding in favor of the plaintiff.id.on april,the court entered the following docket entry jury returns its verdict in favor of plaintiff richard franzen and against ellis corporation as to liability only.
the district court then held a bench trial to determine the appropriate amount of damages.franzen sought nearly million in back pay and front pay,contending that he would have been able to work and earn wages from may,the date of his discharge through the time of his planned retirement at age.
in response,ellis presented evidence that franzen was either unwilling or unable to return to work at any time after his accident.it pointed to franzen prior deposition statements in which he admitted that he was totally incapacitated and unable to work at all times after his accident.ellis also presented testimony from bernstein,the surgeon who had performed spinal surgery on franzen in july.he stated that franzen was permanently disabled and unable to return to work as of at least june.ellis noted that franzen had refused to appear for depositions during discovery because he had claimed to have been too ill to attend finally,ellis contended that,if the court found franzen argument that he was able to return to work immediately after his discharge to be credible,then he was barred from recovery because he had failed to mitigate his damages by seeking alternate employment.
on april,the district court concluded that franzen had not proven that he was entitled to any damages.it stated in open court that it is extremely clear that the plaintiff was unable to work from the time of his accident,at,and that,even if franzen had been physically able to work,there is no evidence that he mitigated his damages he never tried to work,at.the court therefore entered the following minute order 
the court finds that there are no damages that have been proven to this court,and therefore,the amount of damages is zero.there being no damages this case is dismissed with prejudice there are no attorneys fees available where the defendant has prevailed for the reasons stated in open court.civil case terminated.
franzen then filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment.he first contended that he was entitled to an award of attorneys fees under a because,even if he had failed to prove damages,the jury had found that ellis violated the fmla.he also submitted that ellis should have been estopped at the damages trial from introducing evidence of franzen inability to return to work because the issue already had been decided implicitly by the jury.finally,franzen argued that the district court improperly denied him his right to a jury trial on the issue of back pay.
the district court concluded that the jury verdict was not a judgment on the issue of liability.therefore,the jury verdict was insufficient to satisfy the judgment requirement of the fmla provision.it also decided that estoppel was inappropriate here because the jury had not been asked to determine whether franzen could have returned to work at the end of his leave period.finally,he concluded that back pay was an equitable remedy,and therefore a jury trial on the issue of damages was not required.accordingly,the court denied the motion to alter or amend the judgment.franzen timely appealed.
discussiona.
franzen first submits that the district court improperly denied him a jury trial on the question of damages,in violation of his rights under both the fmla and the seventh amendment.the district court concluded that a jury trial was not required in this case because the only forms of relief that franzen sought back pay and front pay were both equitable in nature.in making this determination,it relied upon language from a number of our cases in which we remarked that back pay,like front pay,is an equitable remedy.see,doe oberweis dairy,cir holding that the common law doctrine of comparative fault is not a defense to title vii because back pay is equitable in nature david caterpillar,cir stating that the district court has broad equitable discretion to fashion back pay awards to make the title vii victim whole citation omitted pals schepel buick gmc truck,cir asserting that back pay,like front pay,is an equitable remedy.
as franzen notes,however,each of the cases relied upon by the district court involved back pay under title vii,not the fmla,and none directly addressed the right to a jury trial under either statute.furthermore,he submits,the only circuit to have addressed the issue squarely concluded otherwise and held that a plaintiff who requests back pay as a remedy does have a right to a jury trial under the fmla.see frizzell motor freight,cir in frizzell,the sixth circuit considered the structure and the legislative history of the fmla,particularly its close ties to the fair labor standards act flsa.because courts have uniformly interpreted the remedial provisions of the flsa to provide a right to a jury trial,see feltner columbia pictures television,d,and both the structure and the legislative history of the fmla suggest that congress intended the remedial provisions of the fmla to mirror those of the flsa,the court inferred that congress had intended to provide a right to a jury trial under the fmla as well.frizzell,at.it also remarked that reliance on title vii and erisa case law for the proposition that back pay is an equitable remedy is inappropriate b ecause the fmla link to the remedial provisions of the flsa is stronger than it is to title vii or erisa.id.franzen submits that we should adopt the sixth circuit holding that the fmla provides a right to a jury trial for plaintiffs claiming back pay as a remedy for violations of the statute.
whether a plaintiff seeking back pay under the fmla is entitled to a jury trial appears to be an issue of first impression in this circuit.it is also,however,an issue that we need not decide at this time.as we shall explain below,the evidence in this case established,as a matter of law,that franzen was not entitled to damages because he was unable to return to work at the end of the fmla period,and he failed to mitigate his damages.on the evidence in this record,no reasonable jury could have found otherwise.therefore,if the district court had held a jury trial on the issue of damages,it would have been required to direct a verdict in favor of ellis.see.a.consequently,we need not decide today whether franzen otherwise would have had a right to a jury trial when requesting back pay under the fmla.
franzen contends that,because the jury determined that ellis had received the doctor note prior to the deadline and therefore discharged him in violation of the fmla,he was entitled to damages.specifically,he requested damages in an amount equivalent to his lost wages from the date of his discharge to the date of trial back pay,his potential earnings from the date of trial to his planned retirement date of front pay and liquidated damages and attorneys fees as provided under the statute see.
an employee may be entitled to both back pay and front pay as a remedy for losses flowing from an employer interference with his substantive rights under the fmla however,section provides no relief unless the plaintiff can prove that he was prejudiced by the violation.see ragsdale wolverine world wide,d.we have held that a plaintiff may not collect damages for periods of time in which he otherwise would have been unable to work for the company.flowers komatsu mining,cir.an employee also has no right to,therefore,at the end of his period of leave,he is either unable or unwilling to perform the essential functions of his job.see b colburn parker portland,cir.accordingly,if franzen was either unwilling or unable to return to work at the expiration of his fmla leave,ellis lawfully could have terminated his employment,and he would not be entitled to damages resulting from this termination.
at the bench trial on damages,ellis introduced the following excerpt from franzen deposition,in which he admitted that he was unable to return to work after his accident

in addition to these admissions,ellis presented testimony from bernstein,franzen spinal surgeon,who confirmed his previous opinion that franzen had been disabled and unable to work as of at least june.ellis also introduced letters written by bernstein in connection with franzen application for social security benefits,in which he offered his medical opinion that franzen was permanently and totally disabled.additionally,ellis pointed to franzen refusal on numerous occasions to appear for depositions in these that he was too disabled to proof that he was unable unwilling to return to ellis at the end of his fmla leave period.
as the district court noted,franzen presented no credible evidence to rebut ellis submission that he was unable unwilling to return to work after his accident.in support of his claim,franzen offered only the testimony of two physicians who had treated him after his accident konowitz and mccune.konowitz testified that,based on the information in his file,he knew of no reason that franzen would have been unable to return to work as of may.importantly,however,he also stated that his file contained information on franzen only until june,and he was not aware that franzen subsequently had undergone surgery to repair his spine.mccune confirmed that he had given franzen a doctor note clearing him for work as of may,however,he similarly testified that he was unaware of franzen surgery.furthermore,mccune clearance note is of limited usefulness to franzen,considering the fact that franzen made no attempt to return to work on may than a week before he was discharged from ellis.finally,franzen presented the testimony of tamara herman,an administrative assistant to konowitz.she testified that she had seen franzen come to the doctor office on one occasion,and she had not noticed him having any problems walking.to the extent that this testimony is at all relevant,it certainly is not indicative of franzen ability to return to work.indeed,in his brief on appeal,franzen does not contend that any evidence in the record showed that he was,in fact,able and willing to work he contends only that ellis should have been estopped from presenting evidence otherwise.
specifically,franzen contends that ellis should have been barred from presenting evidence regarding his ability to return to work at the damages phase of the trial because either it had conceded the issue at the jury trial on liability,or the jury implicitly had decided the issue when it found ellis liable under the fmla,and the district court was therefore barred from reaching a contrary conclusion.these arguments are without merit.
as the district court noted,ellis had no reason to present evidence of franzen inability to return to work at the jury phase of the trial.the sole question before the jury was did plaintiff prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant received the required medical documentation by may,tr.at.franzen ability to return to work at the end of his leave period is not relevant to this question it is relevant solely to the question of damages.accordingly,ellis did not waive its right to contest franzen ability to return to work by waiting to present evidence at the damages phase of the trial.
under the doctrine of issue preclusion or direct estoppel,a district court may not factual issues already necessarily determined by a jury.see united states bailin,cir lindsey am.cast iron pipe,cir.franzen submits that the jury finding of liability necessarily included a finding that he would have been able to return to work at least by the end of the period,and,therefore,the court may not find otherwise at the damages stage of the proceedings.
each of the cases cited by franzen,however,involved a jury trial in which the jury had determined both liability and damages issues,and the judge then considered only whether the plaintiff was entitled to equitable remedies.a jury award of back pay necessarily includes a determination that the plaintiff was able to return to work therefore,under direct estoppel principles,a district court could not refuse to grant equitable relief on the ground that the plaintiff was unable to return to work.see,smith diffee,cir.in this case,however,the jury did not consider franzen entitlement to damages it merely determined that ellis had received a doctor note and therefore terminated franzen in violation of the fmla.this conclusion does not necessarily include a finding that he was entitled to reinstatement or damages.accordingly,the judge was not precluded from finding otherwise at the damages portion of the trial.
franzen only plausible argument with respect to damages involves the period in which franzen employment was protected under the fmla.although the fmla itself does not require that the leave provided to employees be paid,see c,ellis voluntarily maintained a company policy of awarding disability pay concurrently with fmla leave.in fact,ellis paid franzen biweekly,or percent of his salary,from the date of his injury to the date of his termination.this disability payment,he contends,would have continued for at least twelve weeks had he not been discharged prematurely in violation of the fmla.relying on strickland water works sewer board,cir,franzen submits that,at a minimum,the district court should have awarded him damages equivalent to the disability pay that he would have received over this period.
the district court declined to award franzen these damages for three reasons the court already had dismissed on summary judgment his contract claim for and disability pay,a judgment that franzen declined to appeal franzen had waived any right to assert disability pay as a component of his damages because,throughout the proceedings,he had requested only back pay,front pay,liquidated damages and attorneys fees under the fmla and franzen made no attempt to mitigate his damages.
we agree with the court conclusion.we first note that,until his motion to alter or amend the judgment,franzen only mention of an entitlement to disability benefits was in connection with his contract claim.in his initial complaint,franzen contended that he was entitled to both and disability benefits under his employment contract with ellis.the district court concluded otherwise,however,noting that he was an employee and that ellis employee handbook,which was cited by franzen as the basis for his entitlement to disability benefits,also contained language that specifically disclaimed the creation of a contract.accordingly,the court determined that franzen had no entitlement to either or disability pay,and it dismissed his claim.at.franzen declined to appeal this judgment.he can not now subvert this conclusion by contending that he was entitled to disability benefits during the twelve weeks that he was protected under the fmla.
moreover,franzen failed to include disability pay as a component of his asserted damages under his fmla claim until after a bench trial on damages was held and a final judgment was entered.in his submissions to the court,franzen set forth an itemized statement of the damages that he requested.this itemization was limited to back pay,front pay,interest,liquidated damages and attorneys fees.nowhere did he mention any entitlement to disability benefits the final pretrial order similarly contains no reference to disability benefits.franzen did not proffer lost disability pay as a form of damages under the fmla until he filed his rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment.at this point,it was too late.see sigsworth city of aurora,cir i t is that a rule e motion is not properly utilized to advance arguments or theories that could and should have been made before the district court rendered a judgment.internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,with respect to disability payments as well as any other form of damages,it is important to note that,under his own theory of the case,franzen claims that he was able and willing to return to work as of may.nevertheless,he admitted in his deposition that he made no effort to obtain another position elsewhere after his termination from ellis.we have cautioned that a person simply refuse to seek other employment and expect his former employer to pay his salary until he reaches retirement age.mattenson baxter healthcare,cir.the familiar common law duty of mitigating damages is imposed the employee must make a diligent search for comparable employment.id.if franzen theory of the case is true,and he in fact was able to return to work as soon as may,then his failure to mitigate his damages by seeking substitute employment was unreasonable and bars his recovery of disability benefits,as well as any other form of damages requested by franzen.
in sum,we conclude that franzen failed to prove that he was prejudiced by ellis violation of the fmla.overwhelming evidence in the record shows that he was,at all times after his accident,unable unwilling to return to work.franzen made no effort to rebut ellis overwhelming evidence that he had failed to mitigate his damages.accordingly,he can not succeed on his fmla claim.
finally,franzen contends that,regardless of whether he is entitled to damages,he is entitled to an award of attorneys fees because he proved that ellis had interfered unlawfully with his rights under the fmla.see a the court in such an action shall,in addition to any judgment awarded to the plaintiff,allow a reasonable attorney fee emphasi
