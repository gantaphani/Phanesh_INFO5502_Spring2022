george shores worked for midland coal company as a miner for years.he now suffers from a variety of respiratory and pulmonary problems.on three separate occasions,he was unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain benefits under the black lung benefits act,et.his luck changed the fourth time around when an administrative law judge alj ruled in his favor and the benefits review board affirmed.midland now appeals.
shores worked for midland as a coal miner from until his retirement in.much of his time was spent above ground working as a welder at strip or surface mines,but even there,he was exposed to substantial amounts of coal dust.he also smoked for some thirty years,but he quit in,eleven years before he retired.when shores began to suffer from various respiratory problems,he applied for benefits under the black lung benefits act.he was rejected three times,in,and.meanwhile,his respiratory symptoms worsened and his overall health deteriorated.shores suffered his third heart attack in,and in he applied for benefits for a fourth time.
this time,the alj relied on the provisions of d and found that there had been a material change in condition that justified an award of benefits.in reaching that conclusion,the alj had to decide which of the eight medical opinions before him were persuasive.he rejected five opinions for various flaws marder understating shores smoking history,dengelman,shima,and sanchez black lung disease mentioned only in passing,and dababneh no explanation for the medical basis of his conclusion.of the three remaining physicians,skillrud and selby concluded that shores did not have an impairment related to exposure,but instead suffered only from simple asthma.cohen,in contrast,found that shores was suffering from pneumoconiosis.
the alj decided that cohen opinion was the of the three that were worthy of consideration,largely because skillrud and selby had relied on an unduly narrow definition of pneumoconiosis by requiring chest evidence of exposure.this,the alj noted,was a standard component of a medical diagnosis,but was merely one of several ways to establish eligibility for benefits under the legal or regulatory definition of the ailment.see.in addition,the alj found that the two physicians had not integrated all of the objective evidence as well as cohen had done,particularly test results showing diffusion impairment,reversibility studies,and readings.the alj concluded that shores had met the requirements for an award of benefits the board affirmed,and midland now appeals.
midland offers two ambitious arguments at the outset,but both fall short.because they involve purely legal propositions,our review is de novo.freeman united coal mining summers,cir.
midland first urges that shores claim for benefits was barred on res judicata grounds.it argues that nothing in the act overrides ordinary principles of finality and claim preclusion or authorizes the of claims that have finally been denied after an opportunity for a full and fair adjudication.this is not,however,an accurate statement of the special preclusion rules that apply in this area.at the time of shores fourth filing,an en banc decision of this court had interpreted the regulations contained at to the contrary,squarely holding that traditional principles of res judicata do not bar a subsequent application for black lung benefits where a miner demonstrates a material change in at least one of the conditions of entitlement.see peabody coal spese,cir en banc.and while it is true that spese interpreted an earlier version of,and that the new version does not have retroactive effect,see c,the revised regulations explicitly codified the holding of spese.see.midland general claim of preclusion is therefore without merit.
midland also assaults the alj finding that pneumoconiosis can be progressive and latent.the alj relied on the implementing regulation set forth at c,which recognizes pneumoconiosis as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.the department of labor adopted this regulation after shores filed his fourth application for benefits it was to take effect on january.
whether pneumoconiosis including the condition described for these purposes as legal pneumoconiosis is a disease that can be latent and progressive is a scientific question.the department of labor regulation reflects the agency conclusion on that point.midland is now challenging that scientific finding,but we see no reason to substitute our scientific judgment,such as it is,for that of the responsible agency.prior to the adoption of c,this court repeatedly noted that it would credit the position adopted in benefits proceedings by the department of labor on the progressivity and latency question,unless the mine operators produced the type and quality of medical evidence that would invalidate a regulation.see old ben coal scott,cir see also spese,at freeman united coal mining hilliard,cir.
at that time,because the agency had not gone through formal procedures,this deference was not compelled under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,but it was appropriate under united states mead,d.see alaska dep t of envtl.conservation epa,d.state dep t of soc.health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,d.now that the agency has issued a formal regulation using full procedures,chevron imposes on the mine operators the heavy burden of showing that the agency was not entitled to use its delegated authority to resolve the scientific question in this manner.midland has not undertaken to show why the department conclusion was not itself supported by substantial evidence a somewhat different question from whether it had the authority to adopt a general rule on the point.unless and until midland did so,shores was fully entitled to rely on the rule without the need to prop it up by introducing yet more independent scientific evidence tending to show that it is scientifically valid.we note as well that our colleagues in the circuit concluded in national mining association department of labor,that c was entitled to retroactive application.
taking a more modest tack,midland also argues that a claimant must now show that she suffers from one of the particular kinds of pneumoconiosis that are likely to manifest latent and progressive forms.midland gleans this new requirement from the circuit national mining association opinion.along the way to upholding c,the court noted that the secretary of labor had acknowledged that latent and progressive pneumoconiosis is rare,occurring in a small percentage of cases by all accounts.at.midland interprets this language as a positive command that a claimant bringing a subsequent application must prove that she suffers from the particular kinds of pneumoconiosis that have been found in the medical literature to be progressive latent.but that is not what the circuit said,and more importantly,the regulation itself is not so limited.the rule is instead designed to prevent operators from claiming that pneumoconiosis is never latent and progressive.id.
midland also argues that the alj decision was in any event not supported by substantial evidence.here,we apply the familiar rule that requires us to uphold the alj findings if they are supported by relevant evidence that a rational mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.amax coal beasley,cir quoting peabody coal helms,cir.
in order to be entitled to an award of benefits,a claimant must prove a totally disabling form of pneumoconiosis caused by coal mine employment.see pittston coal group sebben,d.in addition,in order to proceed on a subsequent claim,a claimant must show that her condition has changed with respect to at least one of the elements of entitlement.see spese,at sahara coal owcp,cir.a claimant may not show a material change by presenting new evidence that merely addresses her condition at the time of the earlier denial.hilliard,at spese,at.
midland first attacks the alj decision to credit the positive diagnosis of cohen and to discount the contrary diagnoses of skillrud and selby.shores relied on physician opinion to establish the existence of pne
