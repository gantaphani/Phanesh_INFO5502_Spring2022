this appeal is from a trial court order prohibiting the defendant union pacific railroad company union pacific from compelling plaintiff carlyle pratt to attend a medical examination or conducting a disciplinary hearing to terminate pratt employment for refusing to provide it with medical evidence justifying his continued absence from work.
in the underlying suit,pratt filed suit against his employer,union pacific,under the federal employers liability act et fela and the locomotive inspection act et for personal injuries suffered at work.the fela is a broad remedial statute,which authorizes railroad workers to recover damages for injuries resulting from the employer or a negligence.
after pratt filed the suit and while he was on extended medical leave resulting from his injuries,union pacific sought additional medical information from him,which he refused to supply on the advice of counsel.when union pacific summoned pratt to a disciplinary hearing for failure to provide the medical information,pratt sought a preliminary injunction prohibiting union pacific from conducting the hearing or from compelling him to attend an medical examination.the trial court found union pacific actions circumvented the established procedures for civil discovery under california law,granted the preliminary injunction,and awarded pratt in sanctions.
the railway labor act rla requires that a minor dispute involving the construction of a collective bargaining agreement between a covered carrier and a union must be resolved in an rla administrative proceeding.although the rla grants exclusive jurisdiction to the national railroad adjustment board board to resolve minor disputes,it does not grant the board jurisdiction over parallel claims arising from the same facts under state or federal law.the test for determining rla preemption is whether the plaintiff statutory claim is based upon a wholly independent state or federal right that does not require using the collective bargaining agreement as a standard for resolving that claim.
at issue in this case is whether the rla preempted the trial court authority to prohibit union pacific from conducting or compelling certain procedures.in determining that question,we must consider whether the california civil rules of discovery grant plaintiff an independent right to protective relief that can be resolved without considering the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.we find it can.
union pacific has failed to identify a provision in the collective bargaining agreement that authorizes its actions.however,even if we assume there is such a provision,union pacific has failed to explain why its application is necessary to resolve the discovery dispute.union pacific also fails to explain why civil discovery is inadequate to protect its legitimate business interests.these failures,coupled with union pacific position that it is no longer seeking discovery of plaintiff current medical information while maintaining its right to hold a disciplinary hearing to terminate pratt solely for failing to provide that information belie its reliance on the collective bargaining agreement.under these circumstances,the question whether union pacific has misused the discovery process to gain an unfair advantage in the fela action is a question of fact that may be determined wholly independent of the collective bargaining agreement.
we therefore conclude the trial court had jurisdiction to prohibit discovery because the civil rules of discovery provide independent authority to grant a protective order for misuse of the discovery process.we deem the preliminary injunction a protective order and find the trial court properly granted the requested relief and sanctions.
we shall affirm the order.
factual and procedural background 
pratt is a union pacific employee who has been employed by the company since in various capacities,including locomotive engineer.his employment is governed by a collective bargaining agreement between his union brotherhood of locomotive engineers and union pacific pratt alleges that he sustained cumulative injuries to his neck,shoulders,and back while employed by union pacific and it is undisputed that he ceased work in january.
beginning in february,pratt was granted a medical leave of absence,which he renewed several times over the next few months,each time furnishing union pacific with the necessary updated medical information.his requests for extended medical leave were approved through august.the medical report in support of that request,dated june,indicates pratt was being referred to physical therapy,his prognosis was classified as permanent limitations expected,a functional capacity evaluation would be performed to determine his level of permanent impairment,and his anticipated return to work date for light duty was after the evaluation.
meanwhile,on august,pratt filed suit in superior court against union pacific to recover damages for personal injuries under the fela et and the locomotive inspection act,et union pacific filed its answer on november,discovery was scheduled to take place in and the matter was set for trial on october,although the trial date has been vacated 
however,on october,prior to any discovery in the fela action,union pacific sent pratt an ex parte letter advising him that the medical information he had provided was inadequate to support his request for an extension of medical leave.the letter requested updated medical information regarding his current level of function,his treatment plan,prognosis and the results of any diagnostic studies.receiving no response,union pacific sent pratt a second ex parte request for the same information.larry lockshin,pratt attorney,objected to the request and informed union pacific that pratt would not provide the medical information and requested that no further letters be sent directly to pratt as such contact violated the california rules of professional conduct.
nevertheless,on november,union pacific sent pratt an ex parte notice of investigation directing him to appear at a disciplinary investigation hearing scheduled for december,to determine whether he had failed to protect his employment status by refusing to provide the requested medical information.lockshin engaged in several written exchanges with union pacific urging it to cancel or continue the hearing until after his request for injunctive relief could be heard in february.
although union pacific rescheduled the hearing several times,it failed to agree to an indefinite postponement of the hearing,which led pratt to apply for a temporary restraining order,preliminary injunction and monetary sanctions.
the trial court granted the temporary restraining order and on february,it granted a preliminary injunction and awarded in sanctions against union pacific.the order states that union pacific may neither compel plaintiff to attend a physical examination nor commence or maintain disciplinary proceedings against plaintiff for failing to provide documentation to explain his awol status.until after plaintiff pending fela lawsuit against uprr is resolved and this court is divested of its jurisdiction over the parties by entry of a final judgment,the orders of this court shall govern the relationship of the parties.smith union pacific.the trial court rejected union pacific position that pratt awol status was a minor issue preempted by the rla.instead,it found union pacific conduct circumvents the established procedures for discovery and its assertion it was merely engaging in medical discovery in a back to work case was not persuasive or credible.union pacific now appeals from the order.
discussion 
labor act preemption 
union pacific contends the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to issue injunctive relief because the rla preempts california discovery statutes.it argues that the question of pratt obligation to furnish medical information in connection with his medical leave is a minor dispute because it requires consideration and interpretation of the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.
pratt counters that the trial court had jurisdiction to grant the relief because the discovery statutes provide independent authority to protect the integrity of the judicial process.union pacific should not be allowed to circumvent the rules of discovery and demand extrajudicial information from a plaintiff by threatening disciplinary action and possible termination of employment.
although the question raised by the parties has been addressed by courts in other jurisdictions,it is one of first impression in california.having considered the question,we conclude that the rla does not preempt california discovery act code civ,et during the pendency of a fela action where as here,the discovery provisions provide an adequate means of obtaining medical information and the employer use of discovery is merely a pretext to gain an unfair advantage in the underlying action.
before turning to the merits of union pacific appeal,we first address pratt argument that union pacific waived the issue whether it had the right to seek medical discovery.pratt argues that union pacific failed to raise this question in the trial court and in fact expressly waived it by advising the trial court it was no longer interested in receiving medical discovery from pratt and considered that issue moot.union pacific counters that it did not waive the issue because the broad sweep of the trial court order compelled it to explain why it has the right to require injured employees to submit medical information to protect their employment status.we agree with union pacific on this issue.
generally,a reviewing court will not consider claims raised for the first time on appeal that could have been but were not presented to the trial court.newton clemons th,d.failure to raise a claim may be forfeited or waived.f orfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right,waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.cowan superior court cal th,d.
we find union pacific neither waived nor forfeited the issue raised on appeal.it is true union pacific advised the trial court that it was no longer seeking medical records from pratt and that that issue was moot.nevertheless,the question of its right to seek medical records was inherent in its opposition to pratt request for injunctive relief and in the trial court order prohibiting it from maintaining disciplinary proceedings against plaintiff for failing to provide medical documentation to explain his awol status.since the issue was fairly litigated and ruled upon by the trial court,it is properly before us.
railroad labor act 
congress power to preempt state law derives from the supremacy clause of article vi of the united states constitution lueck,d,and the question whether a federal law preempts state action is a question of congressional intent.hawaiian airlines,norris,d,norris.
by enacting the rla,congress established a comprehensive administrative framework for resolving labor disputes for the purpose of promoting stability in relations of common carriers subject to the rla.norris,supra,at.at,d at.to accomplish this goal,the rla provides a mandatory arbitral mechanism to handle disputes growing out of grievances or out of the interpretation or application of agreements concerning rates of pay,rules,or working conditions id.at.at,d at.
there are two classes of disputes subject to the arbitral process.the first class,referred to as major disputes,involves the formation of collective bargaining agreements or efforts to secure them.norris,supra,at.at,d at,quoting consolidated rail railway labor executives ass,d,conrail.the second class,referred to as minor disputes,involve controversies over the meaning of an existing collective bargaining agreement in a particular fact situation.id.at.at,d at,quoting brotherhood of trainmen chicago river,d.in short,major disputes seek to create contractual rights,minor disputes to enforce them,quoting conrail,supra,at.at,d at.
minor disputes must be adjudicated in accordance with rla grievance procedures,which begin with internal procedures,and if not settled,are then submitted to the board or a public law board for compulsory arbitration.i atchison,buell,d,buell hendley central of georgia railroad cir.
however,the rla does not vest the board with exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes that arise between employees and their employer buell,supra,at.at,d at nor does it preempt a state claim merely because the same factual inquiry is involved in resolving both the minor dispute and the state claim.norris,supra,at.at,d at see also buell,supra,at.at,d at.
in norris,the supreme court narrowed the test for determining rla preemption,adopting the test used by the court in lingle norge div.of magic chef,d,lingle to determine preemption under the labor management relations act.the rla only preempts resolution of minor disputes,defined as disputes grounded in the agreement involving the interpretation or application of existing labor agreements.norris,supra,at.at,d at.
therefore,to determine whether a claim is preempted by the rla,the court must look to the source of the right asserted by the plaintiff.norris,supra,at.at,d at,citing buell,supra,at.at,d at.when a plaintiff contends an employer actions violate rights protected by the collective bargaining agreement,the matter is preempted by the rla.norris,supra,at.at,d at.when a plaintiff claims the employer actions violate a obligation,the matter is not preempted if the state claim is wholly independent of the collective bargaining agreement and can be resolved without interpreting the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.at,d at quoting lingle,supra,at.at,d at.
the high court in norris rejected the argument that the rla preempts a state law claim if the employer action is arguably justified by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.that standard was employed only for policing the line between major and minor disputes and said nothing about the threshold question whether the dispute was subject to the rla in the first place.norris,supra,at.at,d at.
norris involved an airline mechanic who refused to certify the safety of a plane he considered unsafe and then reported his safety concerns to the federal aviation administration.his employment was governed by a collective bargaining agreement and the airline terminated him for refusing to sign the record.while pursuing his remedies under the collective bargaining agreement,he also filed a state court complaint for wrongful discharge alleging violations of public police under the federal aviation act and hawaii whistleblower protection statute.norris,supra,at.at,d at.in holding the rla did not preempt the independent state claims,the supreme court found that under hawaii law,the only issue to be determined was whether the mechanic termination was retaliatory,which was a purely factual question that did not require interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreement.id.at.at,d at.
the norris test also applies to independent rights arising out of federal law and it is now well established that claims brought under the fela are not preempted by the rla buell,supra,at.at,d at,nor are claims brought under the americans with disabilities act.saridakis united airlines cir.
pratt claim is wholly independent of the collective bargaining agreement 
as stated,pratt present claim for injunctive relief arises in the context of an underlying fela suit.the fela is a broad remedial statute,which authorizes railroad workers to recover damages for injuries resulting from the employer or a negligence.buell,supra,at.at,d at.
this case raises a corollary to that question does the rla preempt california discovery statutes during the pendency of a fela action filed in a court of this state so as to deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to prohibit the employer from engaging in discovery in order to gain an unfair advantage in the fela suit to answer that question,we consider whether the issuance of a protective order under the california civil discovery act code civ,et the discovery act is wholly independent of the collective bargaining agreement and we conclude the discovery act provides an independent right that does not require interpretation or application of the collective bargaining agreement.
union pacific relies on two administrative decisions and one appellate decision state ex rel.union pacific dierker to support its claim of preemption.we find these authorities are and inapposite.dierker,while factually similar to the case at bench,is inapposite because in finding rla preemption,the missouri supreme court found missouri state law did not confer a wholly independent right to a protective order.see partida union pacific,finding dierker nonbinding and unpersuasive.
union pacific also urges us to apply the test articulated in miller v.at t network systems cir miller the ninth circuit applied that test to determine whether a disability discrimination claim was wholly independent of the collective bargaining agreement for purposes of assessing labor management relations act preemption.however,union pacific cites no authority that this test has ever been applied in the context of a discovery dispute or in a fela action.moreover,as the court in miller explained,a court need not apply this test if the particular collective bargaining agreement contains no relevant provisions,explicit or implied,that might be interpreted.miller,supra,at,fn.the miller test is inapplicable here because union pacific failed to identify any term of the collective bargaining agreement that authorizes its requests or imposes a duty on the employee to furnish such information.while it cites two rules in a document entitled general code of operating rules gcor,it fails to identify any rule in that document or any term in the collective bargaining agreement that makes the gcor a part of the collective bargaining agreement.
we therefore turn for guidance to the federal district court cases cited by pratt.raven deukmejian cal d,state courts are bound by united states supreme court decisions interpreting the federal constitution while lower federal court decisions are merely persuasive authority trade center properties,superior court of the city and county of san francisco et d.when construing the discovery act,the court may consider federal decisions for such persuasive value as their reasoning may have.
in smith,supra,the case relied on by the trial court,after a railroad employee filed a fela action in federal district court,the court issued a protective order that restrained the railroad from compelling the employee to attend a physical examination by its doctors or disciplining him under the collective bargaining agreement for failing to do so.the employee argued that the exam was unnecessary because he had already attended two previous physical examinations and the railroad was using the examination to gain unfair advantage in the fela litigation.the court rejected the railroad preemption argument.it found the physical exam and the disciplinary proceeding constituted discovery within the meaning of rule b of the federal rules of civil procedure hereafter federal rules and these procedures were part of the discovery process,which the court had the authority to manage and control.the court reasoned that the physical at issue bears directly on the issues pending in this case.it is entirely possible smith could say something against his interest during the examination that could be used against him in this action.should smith continue to refuse to attend the physical and be fired pursuant to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement,defendant could significantly reduce the nature and amount of damages for which it is liable and obtain an unfair advantage in this litigation.id.at,fn.omitted.
similarly,in riensch union pacific railroad d,a railroad employee was granted a protective order preventing his employer from requiring him to attend a physical examination and from disciplining him for failing to do so.as a result of his injuries,the employee ceased working in and was told by his physician that he would be unable to return to work until july.the railroad demand that the employee attend the scheduled examinations and evaluations was made after the employee filed a fela action.relying on smith,supra,the district court found the examination raised a discovery dispute rather than a minor dispute and therefore it had discretion to issue the protective order under federal rule c.in the court view,it was inconceivable that congress afforded injured workers the right to seek recovery pursuant to the fela in federal court but denied to those same injured workers the ability to invoke the federal rules during the pendency of their fela actions the federal rules govern this fela action and provide for discovery in the form of physical examinations under rule upon a showing of good cause.thus,the railroad order requiring the employee to attend physical examinations circumvents the established procedures for discovery set forth in the federal rules.riensch,supra,at.no interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement was required to determine whether the demand for a physical examination violated the federal rules since the railroad duty to proceed in accordance with those rules was not a right or a duty grounded in the collective bargaining agreement.the court concluded there was good cause for issuance of the protective order because any interest the railroad had in obtaining medical information concerning the plaintiff was adequately protected by the federal rules.id.at.
in bernal southern pacific transportation company,a totally disabled railroad employee who was receiving a disability annuity was granted a protective order during the pendency of his fela suit.the order prohibited the railroad from taking disciplinary action against him for failing to respond to ex parte written inquiries concerning his current medical condition.the court concluded the employee possessed a right to the protection of the federal rules governing discovery and that the court did not have to look to the collective bargaining agreement to determine whether the railroad conduct contravened the discovery rules.id.at.the court found the railroad claim that it was exercising its rights under the collective bargaining agreement to monitor the disability status of its current employee lacked credibility.in so finding,the court considered the railroad refusal to stipulate that it would not seek to use any of the acquired medical information in the fela litigation as well as evidence that an employee receiving a disability pension has no need for updated medical information,fn.see also vicary consolidated rail corp,protective order granted under federal rule c to prohibit the railroad from employing unjustifiable procedures that circumvent the employee right to counsel partida union pacific,supra,protective order granted under federal rule c prohibiting employer from compelling him to attend a medical examination or face discipline and possible termination.
we find these cases persuasive and applicable to the discovery act when a fela complaint is filed in the superior court of this state.just as it is inconceivable that congress afforded injured workers the right to seek recovery under fela but denied those same workers the protections of the federal rules during the pendency of the fela suits riensch,supra,d at,it is equally inconceivable congress afforded injured workers the right to file their fela claims in state court but denied them the right to invoke the state civil discovery rules applicable to the state court litigation.this is particularly true where as here the rules of discovery serve the same purpose,authorize the same scope of discovery,and provide for similar protective relief as do the federal rules.
as originally enacted,the discovery act was proposed as an adaptation of the federal rules of discovery with the express purpose of broadening discovery proceedings in california so that they would be comparable with those in the federal courts.gorman rupp industries,superior court d.although both schemes have since been amended,the discovery act continues to share the same purpose as the federal rules to make discovery a simple,convenient,and inexpensive means of revealing the truth and exposing false
