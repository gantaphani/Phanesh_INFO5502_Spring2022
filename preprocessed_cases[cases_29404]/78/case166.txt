the incident 
in early,grosse pointe south high school determined that it would replace the carpeting located in the main office area.assistant principal pagel solicited bids from a number of carpeting suppliers and ultimately selected new york carpet world to remove,replace,and install the new carpeting.after performing initial tests on the vinyl floor tile located beneath the carpeting,new york carpet world informed pagel that it refused to complete the project because the machine scrapers it used to remove the carpet might disturb the underlying tiles.thereafter,pagel met with custodial foreman kalmus,and head engineer jeffries,and instructed them that south high custodial staff would complete the carpet removal.
although the plaintiffs claim that they protested prior to beginning the work,they nevertheless started removing the carpet around july.when they started to remove the carpet,they noticed that some of the underlying vinyl floor tiles were sticking to the back of the old carpeting.to remove these tiles,the plaintiffs chiseled,chipped,pounded,pulverized,hammered,and jackhammered the tiles causing breakage,flying debris,and dust.the defendants did not provide the plaintiffs with particulate air vacuums to clean up the dust and debris or any protective clothing or respirators.all of the plaintiffs except the two had received two hours of asbestos awareness training,but none of them had received the additional hours of training required by the asbestos hazard emergency response act of ahera,a,before conducting activities that would result in the disturbance of building materials acbm.
the plaintiffs allege that they suffer from respiratory irritations,posttraumatic stress disorder,and other physical and psychological problems resulting from their exposure to potentially harmful levels of friable asbestos.subsequent testing conducted by emsl,an accredited national voluntary laboratory accreditation program nvlp laboratory,located in ann arbor,michigan,revealed that the tiles contained anywhere between asbestos.additionally,the plaintiffs experts reported that as a result of exposure to the asbestos,the plaintiffs are at a significant increased risk of developing,inter alia,asbestosis,lung cancer,mesothelioma,kidney cancer,leukemia,and requiring expensive medical monitoring.
the plaintiffs filed a complaint with the michigan department of public health,which resulted in citations for failure to perform exposure monitoring to determine the airborne concentrations of asbestos required by the occupational safety and health administration osha asbestos construction standard,f and failure to instruct employees in the recognition and avoidance of unsafe conditions involving asbestos and the specific asbestos regulations applicable to the worksite that have been established to control or eliminate the hazards associated with exposure to asbestos.on february,the environmental protection agency epa issued a similar notice of noncompliance pursuant to section of the toxic substances control act tsca,as amended,for violations of,subpart 
the plaintiffs filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan alleging violations of the asbestos hazard emergency response act of ahera,the asbestos school hazard abatement act of ashaa,section of the resource conservation and recovery act of rcra,the clean air act caa,the solid waste disposal act swda,the civil rights act,strict liability,gross negligence,and willful and wanton misconduct activity intentional misconduct and conspiracy.the defendants moved for partial summary judgment,following which,the district court dismissed the plaintiffs environmental law claims,concluding that the plaintiffs had no private right of action that the plaintiffs had not exhausted their administrative remedies.the court reserved its ruling on the plaintiffs civil rights claim,the claim of intentional tort,and the accompanying derivative claims until after discovery.following discovery and upon the defendants renewed motion for summary judgment,the district court dismissed all of the plaintiffs remaining claims.the plaintiffs appeal only the district court grant of summary judgment to the defendants on their claim and the intentional tort exception to the mwdca.

first,we review whether the district court erred when it concluded that the plaintiffs evidence did not sufficiently establish a material issue of fact with regard to the defendants liability under.section provides,in relevant part 
every person who,under color of any statute,ordinance,regulation,custom,or usage,of any state or territory or the district of columbia,subjects,or causes to be subjected,any citizen of the united states or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws,shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity,or other proper proceeding for redress 
consequently,to state a viable claim under,plaintiffs must produce evidence that they were deprived of a right,privilege,or immunity secured by the federal constitution or law of the united states,and the deprivation was caused by a person while acting under the color of state law.flagg brooks,d see collins city of harker heights,d.section is not,but rat
