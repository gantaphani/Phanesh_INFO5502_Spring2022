rehearing was granted in this case and our previous opinion was withdrawn.we now substitute the following in its place.the judgment remains unchanged.
in this workers compensation case,we decide whether a premises owner that contracts for the performance of work on its premises,and provides workers compensation insurance to the contractor employees pursuant to that contract,is entitled to the benefit of the exclusive remedy defense generally afforded only to employers by the texas workers compensation act.while the act specifically confers statutory employer status on general contractors who qualify by providing workers compensation insurance for their subcontractors employees,it says nothing about whether premises owners who act as their own general contractor are also entitled to employer status,and thus the exclusive remedy defense.we hold that the exclusive remedy defense for qualifying general contractors is,likewise,available to premises owners who meet the act definition of general contractor,and who also provide workers compensation insurance to subcontractors employees.because we conclude that entergy gulf states,meets the definition of general contractor under the act,and because entergy otherwise qualifies under the act as having provided workers compensation insurance under its written agreement with international maintenance corporation imc,it is entitled to the exclusive remedy defense against the negligence claims brought by imc employee,john summers.we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for entergy.
entergy contracted with imc to assist in the performance of certain maintenance,repair and other technical services at its various facilities.the parties agreed that entergy would provide,at its own cost,workers compensation insurance for imc employees through an owner provided insurance program,or opip,in exchange for imc lower contract price.entergy complied with its obligation under the agreement by purchasing workers compensation insurance covering imc employees.john summers,an imc employee,was injured while working at entergy sabine station plant.he applied for,and received,benefits under the workers compensation policy purchased by entergy.he then sued entergy for negligence.entergy moved for summary judgment on the ground that it was a statutory employer immune from tort suits.see.a.the trial court agreed and granted judgment for entergy.the court of appeals reversed.we granted entergy petition for review to examine whether section of the workers compensation act excludes a premises owner from serving as its own general contractor for the purpose of qualifying for immunity as a statutory employer of its contractors employees.
the act outlines a process by which a general contractor qualifies for immunity from tort claims brought by the employees of its subcontractors first,the general contractor and subcontractor must enter into a written agreement under which the general contractor provides workers compensation insurance coverage to the subcontractor and the employees of the subcontractor.id.a this agreement makes the general contractor a statutory employer of the subcontractor employees for purposes of the workers compensation laws.id.e the statutory employer is entitled to immunity from tort actions brought by the subcontractor employees,and a covered employee exclusive remedy for injuries is workers compensation benefits.id.a 
summers first argues that entergy failed to establish as a matter of law that entergy and summers executed a written agreement under which entergy would provide workers compensation coverage.see.a.summers chief argument is that the contract for maintenance,construction,and general services was between imc and another entergy company,entergy services,as opposed to entergy gulf states.however,the contract stated that entergy services,acted for itself and as agent for other entergy companies,defined to include the entergy petitioner here.summers also admitted in his response to entergy summary judgment motion that the contract was between imc and entergy gulf states.in addition,the blanket contract order states that entergy would be paying wage rates,indicating that the contract purpose included insurance coverage.entergy also offered an affidavit from a risk manager,stating that pursuant to the contract between entergy and imc,entergy agreed to procure a workers compensation policy for imc employees.as a matter of law,these documents establish that entergy satisfied the written agreement requirement under the statute.under this agreement,the workers compensation coverage for imc employees was secured by entergy,not imc.likewise,it is undisputed that summers sought and collected benefits for his injury from entergy opip.thus,in determining entergy qualification as a statutory employer entitled to the exclusive remedy defense,the only remaining inquiry is whether entergy falls within the act definition of general contractor.we conclude that it does.
the meaning of a statute is a legal question,which we review de novo to ascertain and give effect to the legislature intent.operating,duenez.where text is clear,text is determinative of that intent.state shumake,w hen possible,we discern legislative intent from the plain meaning of the words chosen.see also alex sheshunoff mgmt,johnson.this general rule applies unless enforcing the plain language of the statute as written would produce absurd results.fleming foods of,rylander.therefore,our practice when construing a statute is to recognize that the words the legislature chooses should be the surest guide to legislative intent.fitzgerald advanced spine fixation.only when those words are ambiguous do we resort to rules of construction or extrinsic aids.in re estate of nash.
with these principles in mind,we examine what the legislature meant by the term general contractor in the workers compensation statute.we do not look to the ordinary,or commonly understood,meaning of the term because the legislature has supplied its own definition,which we are bound to follow.gov t code b.the legislature defines general contractor as 
a person who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.the term includes a principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term.the term does not include a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator.
that a premises owner can be a person within the meaning of the statute is not challenged.the dispute,instead,centers on whether one who undertakes to procure the performance of work can include a premises owner,or whether that phrase limits the definition of general contractor to contractors downstream from the owner.
since the words contained within the definition are not themselves defined,we apply a meaning that is consistent with the common understanding of those terms.according to black law dictionary,undertake generally means to take on an obligation or task,and procurement means the act of getting or obtaining something.black law dictionary,ed.in other words,a general contractor is a person who takes on the task of obtaining the performance of work.that definition does not exclude premises owners indeed,it describes precisely what entergy did.in the words of summers own summary judgment response,entergy entered into a contract with imc for imc to perform various maintenance work at entergy plant in bridge city,texas.therefore,we conclude that a premises owner can be a general contractor under the definition provided in the act.
the dissent,and some amici,contend that our reading of the statute constitutes a major change in the law that,for the first time,would enable premises owners to become statutory employers entitled to the exclusive remedy result they say the legislature never intended.however,the legislature enacted the section that established deemed employer status in,the very first provision to address a subscriber coverage of subcontractors employees.see act of,ch,part ii.laws.since then,subsequent revisions have not indicated an intent to create the kind of exception for the dissent would now recognize.indeed,when the deemed employer statute was first enacted,the act made no reference at all to general contractors.instead,the provision applied only to subscribers,a general term that included all purchasers of workers compensation insurance id.under this version,the statutory language broadly established,without qualification,that any subscriber,even a premises,could qualify as a statutory employer.when the legislature added the written agreement provision in,definitions for prime contractor and were also added,but the term subscriber and the original deemed employer language were retained in the act verbatim.act of may,ch.laws.the act made no distinction between different kinds of entities up and down the contracting chain,for a good reason.for the purposes of the statute,it would be just as bad for to try to avoid covering workers by subcontracting out the work as it would be for general contractors,subcontractors,or any other subscriber to do the same.the dissent fails to explain why the mere restructuring of this provision in,which left in the old language referring to subscribers,demonstrates a legislative intent to reorder the scope of the act coverage,not in a way that is consistent with its purpose of protecting workers by promoting coverage,but instead in a way that carves out an from the act protection for subscribers.nor does the dissent attempt to explain why,if such a significant change in policy was intended,it was done in such an obscure manner.
the dissent contends that the act never covered premises owners in the first place,and that owners were not included within the definition of general contractors in the amendment.we disagree.the originating statute applied to any subscriber,which necessarily means that,under the old version of the act,a subscriber who also happened to be a premises owner would not be permitted to escape liability to a worker by contracting out the work.by operation of the statute,then,the who contracted out work to avoid liability for its workers injuries would nevertheless be considered the employer,the injured worker would be entitled to benefits under the owner workers compensation policy,and the owner would be entitled to assert the exclusive remedy defense.see act of,ch,part ii.laws.so while the provision may have been enacted for the purpose of preventing employers from trying to avoid liability,the scope of its application did not exclude premises owners.
in,however,an amendment provided,for the first time,for voluntary employer status for upstream entities in the contracting chain through the use of written agreements between parties.act of may,ch.laws.more specifically,a general contractor was permitted to enter into a written agreement to provide workers compensation insurance coverage to its subcontractors and its subcontractors employees and,upon doing so,the prime contractor would become,by virtue of the statute,the deemed employer of the subcontractors employees entitled to the exclusive remedy defense.the provisions of the old law survived the amendment so,as before,all subscribers remained eligible for deemed employer status,including premises owners.the question that we address today is whether the legislature,when it amended the statute,intended to exclude premises owners from the class of entities that would now be entitled to voluntarily contract for deemed employer status.we conclude that it did not.
there can be no doubt that premises owners can be,and often are,employers who carry workers compensation insurance.it is also true that owners frequently contract with others to perform work on their premises.but there has never been a requirement that an owner must first engage a general contractor to have work done on its premises.the owner is free to do the work with its own employees,to directly contract with others to do the work,or to do the work using some combination of the two.the dissent says an owner can be an employer,but can not be a general contractor.however,we can find nothing in the statute specifying that an owner who also wears the hat of a general contractor is disqualified from coverage under the workers compensation act simply because it chooses to contract directly for work on its premises.
entergy did the very thing the legislature has long tried to encourage that is,entergy became a subscriber by taking out a workers compensation policy for the entire work site.it would be an odd result,indeed,if this premises owner,acting as its own general contractor,and further acting in accordance with the state strong public policy interest of encouraging workers compensation insurance coverage for workers,was now to be excluded from the act protections.see.workers comp.comm garcia.whether a premises owner,general contractor,prime contractor,or subcontractor,entergy is a subscriber of a workers compensation policy and therefore satisfies the legislature intent to ensure consistent and reliable coverage to all employees.
the dissent and the court of appeals contend that the only way to qualify as a general contractor is to be included in a tripartite relationship in which a general contractor in the middle of the transaction has,first,undertaken to perform work for an owner,and second,contracted part of that work to a subcontractor.but the statute is not written so restrictively as to encompass only a relationship,for several reasons.first,such a construction ignores the single exception found in the last sentence of the definition the term does not include a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator.here,the inclusion of an owner operator in the definition only exception indicates that the legislature intended for some owners to qualify as general contractors,while carving out only a narrow class of owners excluded from the term.id.since the legislature clearly specified that the exception apply only to a very narrow class,we decline to read this narrow exception broadly to include all premises owners.
second,the definition is not as restrictive as the dissent supposes because the second sentence of the definition,which specifies types of contractors to be included within the definition,specifically provides that the list is.id.the term includes a principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term.if we held that an owner contractor is not analogous to a principal contractor,original contractor,or prime contractor,we would essentially be strictly construing a sentence that is explicitly,as even the dissent concedes.inasmuch as we have been instructed that i ncludes and including are terms of enlargement and not of limitation or exclusive enumeration.gov t code,we are restrained from circumventing legislative intent by excluding from a list a term as similar as owner contractor.this is especially true since the original version of the act,which shared the common purpose of encouraging coverage of subcontractors employees,did not define any of these disputed terms,but rather utilized a single term,subscriber.see act of,ch,part ii.laws.since entergy is a subscriber of a workers compensation policy,we can not read such a list to evince the legislature intent to remove entergy from a category in which it would have been included under previous versions of the same act.
additionally,such a reading renders meaningless the part of the definition that qualifies how a general contractor undertakes to procure the performance of work.a general contractor undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors emphasis added.a reasonable reading of the words,either separately or through the use of subcontractors,recognizes the distinction between the owner who takes it upon himself separately to procure the performance of work from subcontractors,and the owner who undertakes with a middleman general contractor to procure the performance of work through the use of subcontractors.see see also black law dictionary ed.separate is defined as individual distinct,particular disconnected.certainly,one can hire a bricklayer,electrician,or cabinet maker to remodel his own office acting separately or,he can hire a general contractor to do the same acting through the use of subcontractors.this qualifier suggests that the legislature at least contemplated the existence of a premises owner who may want to act as its own general outcome that is by no means uncommon the dissent reading would have us read out this qualifier entirely,but we do not interpret a statute in a manner that renders parts of it meaningless.see kerrville state hosp.fernandez,citing city of laporte barfield.
finally,we address williams brown root,the case relied on by the court of appeals in reaching its conclusion that a premises owner is excluded from the act definition of general contractor,no writ.in williams,a premises owner,eastman,contracted with brown root to provide occasional construction services.id.at.brown root subcontracted part of the work to tracer.id.tracer employee,williams,was injured on eastman jobsite,so he applied for and received benefits from eastman workers compensation policy covering tracer.id.after williams sued eastman and brown root for his injuries,the trial court granted summary judgment for both defendants,in part because the exclusive remedy was workers compensation insurance,which had already been provided.id.on appeal,the court of appeals rejected the argument that the predecessor to this section of the act did not contemplate granting immunity to more than one general contractor.id.at.instead,the court of appeals held that brown root qualified as a general contractor because it procured tracer services,adding that even if the statute protected only one general contractor,that party was brown root because a general contractor is any person who contracts directly with the owner.id.at internal citations and quotations omitted.arguably,the court observed,because eastman did not contract with the owner,but instead was the owner,eastman was not protected by the statute.id.not only was the court observation here unnecessary to the decision in the case,it was also erroneous.the court erred by subordinating the statute specific definition of general contractor in favor of a generic definition outside the statute.id.at a general contractor is any person who contracts directly with the owner internal citations and quotations omitted.since the legislature provided its own definition for general contractor,we elevate the legislature substituted meaning even when it departs from the term ordinary meaning.gov t code b.
we granted rehearing to address several supplemental arguments made by the respondent and by a number of amici,many of which urge us to address the issue before us by going beyond the statutory text and looking to extrinsic aides such as the act legislative history.but we have been clear that we do not resort to such extrinsic aides unless the plain language is ambiguous.see,nash,at if a statute is clear and unambiguous,we apply its words according to their common meaning without resort to rules of construction or extrinsic aides.sheshunoff,at.
even if we assume the definition of general contractor is ambiguous,the legislative history of the bill passage favors entergy,not summers.the legislative history that supports summers outcome is apparent only in bills that failed to pass yet we attach no controlling significance to the legislature failure to enact legislation,texas employment comm holberg,for the simple reason that i t is always perilous to derive the meaning of an adopted provision from another provision deleted in the drafting process.dist.of columbia heller,d see also dutcher owens,discerning legislative intent from failed bills would be mere inference that would involve little more than conjecture 
as for the legislative history of what did pass,the overhaul of the workers compensation act amended the statutory definition of subcontractor.under the definition,a subcontractor was defined as a person who has contracted to perform all or any part of the work or services which a prime contractor has contracted with another party to perform.act of may,leg,ch.laws,amended by act of,leg d,ch,a.laws,emphasis added.the act,as amended,deleted with another party,which is the very phrase that summers argues prevents a premises owner from also being the general contractor.see wilkerson monsanto,interpreting contracted with another party in the definition to mean the prime contractor and premises owner must be distinct entities.we give weight to the deletion of the phrase with another party from the amended definition since we presume that deletions are intentional and that lawmakers enact statutes with complete knowledge of existing law.see acker.water comm n.it is,of course,axiomatic that the deletion of language better indicates the legislature intent to remove its effect,rather than to preserve it.thus,the removal of the phrase with another party from the subcontractor definition favors,rather than argues against,an interpretation allowing premises owners to act as their own general contractors for the purpose of workers compensation laws.enforcing the law as written is a court safest refuge in matters of statutory construction,and we should always refrain from rewriting text that lawmakers chose,but we should be particularly unwilling to reinsert language that the legislature has elected to delete.see simmons arnim,courts must take statutes as they find them.
amici cite to statements by some lawmakers that the act,and particularly the amendment,was never intended to provide statutory employer status to premises owners.just as we decline to consider failed attempts to pass legislation,we likewise decline consideration of lawmakers statements as to what a statute means.it has been our consistent view that e xplanations produced,after the fact,by individual legislators are not statutory history,and can provide little guidance as to what the legislature collectively intended.in re doe,citations and quotations omitted.at bottom,at least some of the amici seem to argue that the workers compensation scheme is itself inadequate,and that an injured employee should have remedies available apart from the benefits offered by the act,including the ability to sue a negligent premises owner.as a judicial question,this argument lacks merit because the availability and adequacy of workers compensation benefits is a purely legislative matter.
excluding a premises owner who acts as a general contractor also fails to serve the public policy of encouraging workers compensation coverage for all workers.see wingfoot enters.alvarado,garcia,at.as noted,the act offers incentives to general contractors to provide workers compensation coverage broadly to work site employees.in exchange,the act specifically protects general are not direct employers of subcontractors allowing them to assert as a statutorily deemed employer the exclusive remedy defense.in light of this statutory protection,it would seem to be contrary to the state public policy to read out of the act protections those premises owners who have otherwise qualified under the act by purchasing workers compensation coverage for their work site employees,but who have chosen to act as their own general contractor.
in the dissent view,a premises owner who,in complying with the act,enters into a written agreement to provide workers compensation coverage to all contractors and contractors employees at its work site would be the only in the contracting chain not afforded the exclusive remedy defense.presumably,in that event all the downstream contractors would be considered subscribers under the premises owner opip,thereby qualifying as statutory employers by virtue of their written agreements.see.a.but the dissent would disqualify the premises one who secured and actually paid for the being a statutory employer of his subcontractors employees.as a result,the premises owner own employees,working with the other contractors employees,would be limited to workers compensation benefits for their injuries while the other contractors employees injured in the same accident would be permitted to seek tort remedies against the premises owner in addition to the workers compensation benefits provided by the premises owner.unless the statute directs such a result,it makes no sense to read the statute in such an unreasonable manner.the dissent contends that this outcome is a policy choice made by the legislature,but we interpret the statute in the context of a policy that encourages the provision of workers compensation coverage to all workers on a given work site,not discouraging it by denying the statute protections to the owner who enters into just such a plan.
we conclude that entergy qualifies under the act definition as a general contractor and,as a statutory employer,is entitled to assert the exclusive remedy defense.the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and a judgment is rendered in favor entergy.
i think the court construction of the statutory text is reasonable,but so is the dissent though i disagree with much of its analysis,which means that the provisions are ambiguous and can be understood correctly only in the context of the texas workers compensation act as a whole.i join in all but part vii of the court opinion and write separately to explain my reasons for doing so,which come down to this the act encourages coverage,as does the court construction,but the dissent does not.
ascertaining the meaning of a statutory text or any text for that matter begins with the language used,and if that language is plain enough,absent some obvious error or an absurd result,that is where the task ends it matters not what someone thinks the text may have meant to say or now hopes or wishes it said to look beyond the plain language risks usurping authorship in the name of interpretation.construing statutes is the judiciary prerogative enacting them is the legislature.to prevent trespass,this court and others have repeatedly stressed that statutory construction must be faithful to the plain language of the text.
but that principle is undermined when it is invoked where it does not is,when the language of the text is not,in fact,plain.to find plain meaning where it is missing suggests at best that the investigation is insincere or incompetent,at worst that the search is rigged,that the outcome,whatever it is,will always come out to be plain.fidelity to plain meaning is important only if the word plain has itself a plain meaning.
i fear the phrase plain language has been overworked to the point of exhaustion.it has appeared in published texas cases more often in the past decade than in the prior fifteen usually as the basis for resolving a dispute over meaning,though it can hardly be said that the prevalence of plain language is increasing,let alone exponentially.i detect no waning in the power of the curse at babel.to the contrary,more and more this court is called upon to construe statutes which opposing parties insist are unambiguous and mean very different things.a dispute over meaning does not render a text ambiguous many disputes lack substance.but when language is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation,it is ambiguous that is the plain meaning of ambiguous.of course,reasonable people will sometimes disagree about what reasonable people can disagree about but even so,it is difficult to maintain that language is plain in the face of a substantial,legitimate dispute over its meaning 
only every so often do we come right out and brand a text with the as if it were a mark of shame.it seems nicer to call a statute unclear or better yet,just leave that implication but the truth is that the meaning of statutory language is often reasonably disputed and therefore ambiguous to some extent,and resolving reasonable disputes with reason,rather than by denying their reasonableness,would result in a sounder jurisprudence.two great evils attend this course.one is that judges will use analysis of reasonable disagreements over meaning as a guise for substituting their own preferences in place of the legislature.this would trespass upon the boundary between judicial and legislative spheres that is fundamental to our structure of government.the other is that in the search for the meaning of a statutory provision,courts will grasp at all sorts of statements made before,during,and after the process of enactment,whether by legislators or others,as relevant or even authoritative.the legislature does not speak through its committee hearings,in bill analyses and reports,in legislative debate,or in commentary it speaks through its enactments.
rather than struggle to understand and explain a difficult text,it might seem easier to fall back on a simple insistence that all language have a plain meaning,but doing so risks leaving the impression that the court is not being entirely honest.courts must scrupulously guard against both evils,but in doing so,can not ignore a statute context that may illumine its meaning.years ago special chief justice samuels wrote for this court 
a statute should not be construed in a spirit of detachment as if it were a protoplasm floating around in space.the historical treatment to which a statute may be subjected is aptly set forth in travelers insurance marshall,where it is said generally it may be said that in determining the meaning,intent,and purpose of a law or constitutional provision,the history of the times out of which it grew,and to which it may be rationally supposed to bear some direct relationship,the evils intended to be remedied,and the good to be accomplished,are proper subjects of inquiry.
the workers compensation act provides that a general contractor who agrees to furnish workers compensation insurance coverage to a subcontractor and its employees becomes their employer for purposes of the statutory employer,if you that their exclusive remedy against the general contractor for injuries is compensation benefits.specifically,the relevant provisions of the labor code state 
a general contractor and a subcontractor may enter into a written agreement under which the general contractor provides workers compensation insurance coverage to the subcontractor and the employees of the subcontractor.
general contractor means a person who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.the term includes a principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term.the term does not include a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator 
subcontractor means a person who contracts with a general contractor to perform all or part of the work or services that the general contractor has undertaken to perform 
an agreement under this section makes the general contractor the employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor employees only for purposes of the workers compensation laws of this state 
recovery of workers compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of an employee covered by workers compensation insurance coverage or a legal beneficiary against the employer or an agent or employee of the employer for the death of or a injury sustained by the employee 
the question is whether a person who subcontracts work to be done on his own property is a general contractor for purposes of these provisions.in the court first opinion,we all thought from the plain and ordinary meaning of the provisions the answer was clearly yes on rehearing,after reargument and a number of amicus briefs,three members of the court now disagree and think that the statutory language seems clear and compels the conclusion that the answer is no.the difficulty is this while it is true,as the court contends,that a person who engages subcontractors to work on his own property is often said to act as his own general contractor and certainly performs that function,more often,as the dissent contends,a general contractor is thought of as a person who works for someone else,like a property owner,subcontracting parts of a job to others as appropriate.on the face of it,either reading of the statute seems reasonable.the text,it must therefore be said,is ambiguous.
scrutinizing the text does not resolve the difficulty.the statutory definition of general contractor has three components.the first is this prescription general contractor means a person who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.a premises owner who undertakes to procure the performance of work or service on his property would appear to fit this definition of general contractor.a premises owner can undertake to procure work or service for himself,through subcontractors for example,or he may employ someone else to procure the work or him.nothing in the statute use of the word undertakes suggests any difference in its ordinary meaning.
the second component of the statutory definition is a list of examples the term includes a principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term.the dissent asserts that we have for decades defined a contractor as any person who,in the pursuit of an independent business,undertakes to do a specific piece of work for other persons,quoting a decision of this court,industrial indemnity exchange southard which in turn quoted a decision of the commission of appeals,shannon western indemnity but the issue in southard was whether the claimant was an independent contractor,and the quoted passage addresses that issue,as is clear from its context 
many definitions of what is meant by the term independent contractor have been given.they all rest substantially on the same basic principle.in the case of shannon western indemnity,this court announced,as the basis for the opinion rendered in that case,the following definition a contractor is any person who,in the pursuit of an independent business,undertakes to do a specific piece of work for other persons,using his own means and methods,without submitting himself to their control in respect to all its details.
the issue was the same in shannon,a case decided by the commission of appeals.certainly,a person could not act as his own independent contractor his independence would be severely compromised.but nothing in either case suggests that an owner can not act as his own general contractor.the dissent points out correctly that the legislature has sometimes used general contractor in a way that excludes a premises owner but the court cites instances in which a person who hires subcontractors directly is said to act as his own general contractor,suggesting that it is a common expression one can not be sure from the text alone whether the legislature meant for owners to be,or not to be,general contractors.
the list of examples is specifically but obviously intended to illustrate similarities the dissent argues that a premises owner can not be a general contractor because the edition of black law dictionary defined a contractor as a person who,in the pursuit of any independent business,undertakes to do a specific piece of work for other persons but the rest of the definition is not so restrictive 
this term is strictly applicable to any person who enters into a contract,but is commonly reserved to designate one who,for a fixed price,undertakes to procure the performance of works or services on a large scale,or the furnishing of goods in large quantities,whether for the public or a company or individual.such are generally classified as general contractors responsible for the entire job and subcontractors responsible for only portion of job plumber,carpenter 
the definitions describe someone who might or might not be the owner of the jobsite.the same dictionary gives this definition of general contractor 
one who contracts for the construction of an entire building or project,rather than for a portion of the work.the general contractor hires subcontractors plumbing,electrical,coordinates all work,and is responsible for payment to subcontractors.also called prime contractor.
it defines prime contractor thusly 
the party to a building contract who is charged with the total construction and who enters into for such work as electrical,plumbing,and the like.also called general contractor.
neither of these definitions excludes a jobsite owner from acting as his own general contractor.other dictionaries are similarly inconclusive the second component does not clearly indicate whether a jobsite owner is or is not to be treated as a general contractor.
the third component of the statutory definition is an exclusion the term does not include a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator.the court argues that expressing only one exclusion suggests that no others exist the dissent offers this tautological explanation of the exclusion the legislature likely expressly excluded motor carriers from the definition to make it clear that,even though they might otherwise fit the construct,they are to be treated differently.i dare say that it was not merely likely but absolutely certain that by excluding motor carriers,the legislature meant to make clear they are to be treated differently.but the dissent misses the court point if the legislature intended to make clear who should not be treated as a general contractor,as we all think it did,and it listed motor carriers but not premises owners,then premises owners should be treated as general contractors.
the statutory definition of subcontractor a person who contracts with a general contractor to perform all or part of the work or services that the general contractor has undertaken to perform does not help clarify the matter.a premises owner may be a general contractor who undertake s to perform work by contracting with subcontractors.
examined with precision,the statutory text can reasonably be read to provide that a person who undertakes to procure work or service is no less a general contractor because he also happens to own the premises where the job is to be done,and no less a statutory employer when he provides workers compensation insurance coverage for subcontractors and their employees.that,of course,is why the court was unanimous in its first opinion.the dissenters too quickly dismiss a position they so recently embraced unreservedly sometimes wrong,they are never in doubt.but their basic argument has weight general contractor often refers to someone who works for the job owner.this reading of the statute is a reasonable one,in my view,but it is not the only reasonable one.
the disagreement in this case is not over words and can not be resolved with dictionaries.it is over consequences and can only be settled by examining how the statutory provisions fit in the context of the workers compensation act as a whole.the issue for the court is not whether it is good policy to treat a person who arranges for work to be done on his property as a general contractor,something we can not decide,but whether such treatment is most consistent with the policies embedded in the act.for four reasons,i believe it is.
first the act decided bias is for coverage although employees and employers can opt out,an employee has only a limited time frame in which to do so and an employer is penalized for doing so by loss of his common law defenses to an employee claim of injury the act encouragement of coverage is furthered by incentivizing general contractors to provide workers compensation coverage for subcontractors and their employees no one questions that the act does this by providing such general contractors the protection of the exclusive remedy.to refuse the incentive when the general contractor happens to own the jobsite would discourage coverage,contrary to the policy of the act.the dissent responds that because the act is in derogation of common law rights,it should not be applied to cases not clearly within its purview but it has long been the settled policy of this state to construe liberally the provisions of the act in order to effectuate the purposes for which it was enacted.coverage is a fundamental purpose of the act.
second since,the act has expressly prohibited a subscriber from using a subcontractor to circumvent coverage to prohibit a subscriber who owns the jobsite from engaging subcontractors to avoid paying compensation benefits,while at the same time discouraging the subscriber from providing compensation benefits by denying the exclusive remedy protection,would be a perverse result indeed.the dissent dismisses the policy of discouraging avoidance of coverage,contained in the act since,as irrelevant but there is simply no reason to think that the act has ever beckoned with one hand and shunned with the other.
third since,the act has provided that a subscribing employer may agree in writing,before a worker has been injured,to assume a third party liability for the injury such agreements appear to be common among contractors on construction jobsites if the employer is a subcontractor and the third party is a general contractor who has provided coverage for the worker,the worker exclusive remedy against both is limited to compensation benefits.if the general contractor were not afforded the same protection because he owned the jobsite,the worker could recover common law damages against him,and he in turn could require the subcontractor to assume the liability,thereby defeating the protection of the exclusive remedy to the worker own employer,even though he and the general contractor both provided compensation benefits.in this case,entergy had just such an indemnity agreement with imc if summers can recover common law damages from entergy having already received compensation benefits,of course,entergy can require reimbursement by imc,summers direct employer.in this situation,the workers compensation system provides nothing to any employer,even though all employers have agreed to provide compensation benefits to all employees,which the injured worker himself requested and received.this would be an even more perverse disruption of the policies of the act.the dissent argues that the economic effect of indemnity agreements is minimal because an employer can obtain compensation coverage at a reduced cost through policies like entergy and can buy general liability insurance for the increased risk of damages not limited by providing compensation coverage.but compensation insurance that provides no protection is no bargain,however reduced the cost,and having to buy two policies for an increased risk when one policy for a limited risk should do is perverse.the fact that employers often do so,the dissent says,shows they know they must,but all it shows for sure is an unwillingness to put too much trust in the fairness of the law.anyway,according to the dissent,the problem is a policy choice the legislature made.i would not blame the legislature for a problem that can be avoided by a reasonable construction of the act.
fourth the act creates a comprehensive system and treating similarly situated contractors and employers differently would disrupt that system unnecessarily.there is no apparent reason why a premises owner should have the exclusive remedy protection when he provides workers compensation insurance covering his own employees engaged in particular work but not when he provides the same coverage for his subcontractors and their employees,retained to do the same work the dissent only response is that whimsy is a legislative prerogative.
the act,first passed in,provides an injured worker guaranteed but limited wage and medical benefits quickly and without regard to fault,in exchange for which the worker foregoes common law damage claims against his employer not long ago,we wrote the a ct,which was part of a nationwide compensation movement,was perceived to be in the best interests of both employers and employees.much earlier,we said 
workmen compensation laws have become part of our public policy.the object of the laws was to do away with the issues of negligence,unavoidable accident,assumed risk,contributory negligence,and other like issues,and to fix the amount recoverable free of any uncertainty.the old system of settling disputes was unsatisfactory,and modern business methods demanded that compensation for injuries to employees be not controlled by the fault or negligence of the employee,but should rest upon broader,more humane,and more certain rules 
an jobsite is not uncommon.no one has suggested a reason why a general contractor who works for an owner can submit to the obligations and protections of the workers compensation system as a statutory employer for all the workers on the job,while the owner himself can not,other than to subvert the system.of course,the legislature needs no reason to differentiate between general contractors who do not own the jobsite and those who do.but we are required to presume that the legislature has acted reasonably and in any event,the statutory provisions at issue draw no such distinction.while their silence on the subject may be read either way,we should assume that the legislature intended that the treatment of general contractors be consistent with the act as a whole.for these reasons,i conclude that of the two constructions of the statutory text,both reasonable on their face,the court is stronger.
the argument is made,however,that the legislature is not likely to have intended by its definition of general contractor to include a person who has work done on his own property because that would have been a major change in the law that would have drawn attention when in fact it was enacted without note.the court followed the same line of reasoning in energy service of bowie,superior snubbing services,where we construed an amendment to the statute governing the enforceability of indemnity agreements long used in the oil patch.the industry practice was,had never been criticized,and continued unchanged after the amendment.we concluded that a bsent any identifiable reason for a substantive change to have been made in the statutory provision,or any indication that one was intended,or any resulting change in industry practice,we think the most reasonable construction of the amended statute is the same as its predecessors.the problem with the argument in this case is that it has never been clear when a person is considered the statutory employer of a subcontractor or his employees,liable to provide the workers compensation benefits,and entitled to the exclusive remedy protection of the act.
before,the only provision in the workers compensation act relating to coverage of a subcontractor was article,section,which,as noted above,was enacted in and prohibited a subscriber from subcontracting work with the purpose and intention of avoiding the liability for workers compensation benefits he would have if his own employees were injured doing the work in that situation,the subcontractor injured employee was deemed to be the subscriber employee and therefore entitled to compensation benefits.
in three consecutive legislative sessions beginning in,six bills were introduced,the ostensible purpose of which was to eliminate section subjective purpose and intention trigger and provide greater certainty in determining whether a subscriber should be treated as the statutory employer of his subcontractors and their employees.the premise of the bills was that subscribers were being treated as statutory employers already,but not always predictably or consistently.the bills proposed to amend or replace section and provide,variously,either that coverage extended to subcontractors unless otherwise agreed,that coverage did not extend unless otherwise agreed,or something in between.in brief 
hb,introduced in,would have amended section and provided simply that under a bona fide made in good faith,workers compensation coverage was not provided hb passed the house but was left pending in the senate committee.
hb,also introduced in,would have replaced section altogether and provided that a subscriber coverage extended to subcontractors and their employees,absent an agreement to the contrary,unless they were already covered hb would also have provided that a subscriber could always agree to extend compensation coverage to a subcontractor and his employees and pass the cost through to the subcontractor hb was not voted out of committee.
in,sb was introduced,almost identical to hb,but it was rewritten in committee and passed the senate.the committee substitute deleted existing section and provided instead that a prime contractor would not be deemed the employer of a subcontractor or his employees without an agreement beforehand,but absent such an agreement,the prime contractor would be required to provide coverage if the subcontractor did not do so,and could pass the cost through to the subcontractor the house committee amended the bill,reverting to a version something like hb,providing that a general contractor could not be deemed to employ a subcontractor or his employees without agreeing at the outset of the job to provide workers compensation benefits to the subcontractor and his employees the cost could be passed through to the subcontractor.the committee substitute was tabled on the floor.
in,three bills were introduced,sb,hb,and sb,all essentially identical to the house committee substitute for sb the prior session.none made it to the floor.
none of these bills defined a general contractor or distinguished between one who owned the jobsite and one who worked for the owner.all seemed to treat any subscriber who engaged a subcontractor as a general contractor,though none specifically said so.nothing in any of the bills suggested that a subscriber who engaged a subcontractor either could not or should not be allowed to extend coverage to a subcontractor and his employees and thereby become their statutory employer,with the benefit of the exclusive remedy protection.
in,hb as introduced,like the bills the prior session,would have deleted existing section and provided that a prime contractor workers compensation insurance coverage would not extend to a subcontractor or his employees except by agreement but the bill was amended in the house and senate to restore existing section,redesignated d,delete the sentence precluding a prime contractor from being deemed the statutory employer of a subcontractor and his employees,and provide that a prime contractor could agree to extend coverage to a subcontractor and his employees,passing the cost through to the subcontractor.as thus amended,the bill was enacted.the new section had four paragraphs.section d retained the text of section,providing that any subscriber who tried to avoid covering a subcontractor employees would be deemed to be their employer for compensation purposes section a expressly recognized that a prime contractor could agree to extend coverage to a subcontractor and his employees section c defined prime contractor for the first time as follows 
the term prime contractor includes principal contractor,original contractor,or general contractor as those terms are commonly used and means the person who has undertaken to procure the performance of work or services.the prime contractor may engage subcontractors to perform all or any part of the work or services 
and section b defined subcontractor to mean a person who has contracted to perform all or any part of the work or services which a prime contractor has contracted with another party to perform.
by referring to a prime contractor as someone who works for another,the definition of subcontractor would exclude an owner.but if the meaning of prime contractor defined in section c is to be informed by the definition of subcontractor in section b,it must also be informed by section d,which refers to the person who engages a subcontractor as a subscriber,a term that includes an owner acting as his own general contractor.section d applies to all subscribers.if sections a c were read to address only the situation in which the subscriber and prime contractor is not the owner,no ambiguity in the meaning of prime contractor would exist.section d would have general application,while the other sections would not.the effect of hb was to provide greater certainty in one area,even if a comprehensive solution remained beyond reach.but if sections a c were also of general application and prescribed the requirements for considering any prime contractor to be the statutory employer of subcontractors and their employees,then the ambiguity in the meaning of prime contractor would be unavoidable.moreover,that construction of the statute would raise the question why a prime contractor who owns the jobsite should,like all other prime contractors,be prohibited from trying to avoid liability for workers compensation benefits,but unlike all other prime contractors,not be allowed to provide such benefits.
in any event,the law regarding statutory employers was not clear before,as evidenced by the variety of efforts to clarify it,and it was not much clearer after hb,as introduced,amended,and finally enacted,like the six bills in the prior three sessions,never suggested that statutory authorization previously lacking was required for prime contractors to extend workers compensation coverage to subcontractors and their employees.on the contrary,the one consistent theme in all the bills was the need to clarify when coverage was extended,not whether it could be.hb,like the others,never attempted to distinguish premises owners from prime contractors,and the definition of prime contractor finally enacted could reasonably be read to include a premises owner acting as his own general contractor.
i do not mean to suggest for a moment that the drafting history of the statute is relevant in determining the legislature intent by enacting it.the various bills and amendments do not reveal even the sponsors intentions,let alone the legislature.but the history of the legislation does effectively rebut the argument that the law regarding the extension of workers compensation coverage to subcontractors and their employees was clear in,and that allowing a person to be the statutory employer of subcontractors working on his property was so significant a change in that it would not have occurred without comment.the history of the legislation clearly shows that existing law was at all times unclear.
thus,the argument that the change in the definition of subcontractor was not substantive because it was made without comment could be correct,but it is not clear what the law was before the change.the definition referred to work or services which a prime contractor has contracted with another party to perform.the definition referred to work or services which a prime contractor has undertaken to perform.the dissent argues that the legislature used undertaken to mean the same thing as contracted with another party,but it is just as likely that the legislature used undertaken because it was more accurate and removed an ambiguity in the statute.the point is that the argument that the change was not substantive because it was not controversial proves nothing because the backdrop against which it appeared was itself unclear.
finally,a number of bills introduced between and would have clarified who is a statutory employer on construction jobsites the court explains why failed bills are not indicative of legislative intent.i would also point out that the fact that six bills failed in three sessions before did not indicate a legislative intent that hb not be the law.
respondent and the amici curiae that support his position argue that the statutory construction urged by petitioner is bad policy.we have no way to judge such matters and do not do so.underlying many of their arguments is a conviction that the workers compensation system is basically unfair.that issue also is not ours to judge.we must presume that the system is just and reasonable the court construction of the statutory provisions at issue is most consistent with that system.
in times of political rancor,vengeful motives are swiftly attributed and swiftly believed.this is unfortunate,but also unaffecting.the judiciary,rightly understood,is not a political institution but a legal one,meaning we must decide cases on the basis of principled legal points,not political talking points.
this appeal constitutes something of a legal rorschach test people see in it what they wish,and one person commendable restraint is another condemnable activism.here,one side entergy contends that judicial restraint requires a reading of the statute,that the surest manifestation of legislative will is found in legislative text.the other side summers brands such a reading judicial activism,that gleaning intent demands a more holistic and embellished approach.
my view is uncomplicated the law begins with language,and it smacks of lewis carroll when critics,voices raised high in derision,inveigh against judicial activism because judges refrain from rewriting the text lawmakers chose.this side of the looking glass,reading a statute as enacted is the nadir of activism,not its zenith.it must be stressed that even one of summers amicus supporters concedes the statute can be read in entergy favor a result that,sound and fury aside,will probably not have a substantial impact on the workers compensation system as a whole.
i agree with the court result and a good deal,though not all,of its analysis,but i write separately because this case raises important issues regarding statutory construction,and the judicial role more generally,that deserve fuller,more treatment.
entergy can qualify as a general contractor 
today issue is simply stated but sharply disputed can a premises owner qualify as a general contractor under the texas workers compensation act amid the spirited debate,two preliminary matters are unchallenged premises owners who provide workers compensation insurance coverage to their own employees are statutorily immune from tort suits over injuries and general contractors who cover their subcontractors employees are also immune.today case presents a a premises owner can serve as its own general contractor and assert the same defense as a contract employer that it asserts as a direct employer.
consider two employees working side by side at a workplace,performing the same work when the same accident inflicts the same injuries.one worker is the company direct employee,the other its contract employee,both having voluntarily elected coverage under the same written,workers compensation policy.if the owner meets the legislature elastic definition of general contractor written solely in terms of what contractors do,not what they its contract employees are bound by the same policy that binds its direct employees.ownership nowhere proscribes what the act prescribes.
two things should drive our legislature language,which is,and this court role,which is not.we must respect statutes as written and give wide leeway to the innumerable reflected therein.the act definition of general contractor is sweeping a person who undertakes to procure the performance of work and carves out only one narrow exclusion a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator.the wording is inclusive in general but exclusive in particular.the act used a similarly broad definition with no exclusion but a companion definition suggested a premises owner could not serve as its own general contractor.significantly,the legislature deleted that explicit reference in as part of a substantive overhaul.today act does not deny the defense if the person who procures the work and provides the two factors that define statutory employer also owns the jobsite.
i agree with the court.by undertak ing to procure the performance of work,entergy meets the legislature definition.this,coupled with entergy provision of workers comp coverage,confers status.
ii.the legislature chosen words dictate the outcome 
the act controlling provisions are straightforward 
general contractor any person who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.the term includes a principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term.
subcontractor any person who contracts with a general contractor to perform all or part of the work or services that the general contractor has undertaken to perform.
statutory employer a general contractor may enter into a written agreement with a subcontractor under which the general contractor provides workers compensation coverage to the subcontractor and the subcontractor employees and such an agreement makes the general contractor the employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor employees for purposes of the workers compensation laws.
exclusive remedy workers compensation benefits are a covered employee exclusive remedy against an employer for injuries 
legislative intent is revealed by legislative language 
there is one principle this court has declared repeatedly and emphatically the surest guide to what lawmakers intended is what lawmakers enacted we are interpreting words,and where those words are not doubtful,even though their wisdom may be,we are bound to honor them.accordingly,since intent is driven by text,we must not accept the peculiar view that construing the act definition of general contractor by its terms would subvert legislative intent indeed,it is displacing the concreteness of what was actually said with the conjecture of what was allegedly meant that invites activism,a mischievous way for courts to put a finger on the scale or in the wind and thus substitute judicial intent for legislative intent.our place in the constitutional architecture requires fidelity to what lawmakers actually passed.
consequently,we must focus on what a statute says and,just as attentively,on what it does not say,taking care to honor substantive changes,both additions and deletions,made over the years,and always presuming that the legislature chose its language carefully as for what the act includes,its definition of general contractor is notable for two things a solitary description undertakes to procure the performance of work,including a list of synonyms principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term and a solitary exclusion a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator.any entity that falls inside the former and outside the latter is shielded from tort liability if it provides workers compensation coverage to its contractors employees.as for what the act excludes,we must give effect to the legislature deletion in of a provision contracted with another party that contemplated a general contractor contracting upstream with a premises owner.
b.the court of appeals disregarded the act key provisions 
it ignored the specific definition of general contractor 
the court of appeals held entergy did not establish it had undertaken to perform work or services and then subcontracted part of that work to imc,as a general contractor would have done.to reach this conclusion,the court relied on williams brown root,a court of appeals decision stating that a general contractor is any person who contracts directly with the owner.the williams court reasoned an entity that did not contract with the owner,but instead was the owner arguably fell outside the definition the williams court,as the court today notes committed a fundamental error,disregarding the labor code specific definition of general contractor in favor of a more generic definition the legislature often supplies its own dictionary,and where it provides a precise definition,courts must honor that substituted meaning importantly,this admonition holds true even if the legislature technical definition departs from the term ordinary meaning so while a general contractor may ordinarily be thought to contract with the premises though,as the court observes,an owner serving as its own general contractor is by no means uncommon that construction must give way to the act specific definitions 
contrary to the suggestion in williams that an owner can not double as a general contractor because it can not contract with itself,the statute does not blanketly exclude premises owners who otherwise meet the act undemanding criteria nothing in the act dictates that a premises owner who procures the work and provides the coverage,the only two factors that confer status,lack the same immunity granted someone who performs the very same actions but lacks title to the worksite 
the legal test for determining whether entergy can invoke the defense is not whether the statute explicitly includes owners.the test is a simple one does entergy meet chapter eligibility criteria the record shows clearly that entergy undertook to procure the performance of work from imc deposition testimony established that entergy hired imc to supplement the entergy employee workforce and help perform maintenance,including water and,work,at its sabine plant.summers own response concedes that entergy entered into a contract with imc for imc to perform various maintenance work at entergy plant in bridge city,texas.entergy undeniably under took to procure the performance of work,thus meeting the act broad definition,and because it also provided the workers compensation policy under which summers recovered,entergy is his statutory employer.
it utilized a definition of subcontractor 
the court of appeals in this case and the williams court also erred in relying on wilkerson monsanto,a federal district court decision holding that a premises owner can not be a statutory employer because it can not be a general contractor here,too,the mistake concerns a misused statutory definition.wilkerson,unlike today case,was governed by the definition of subcontractor a person who has contracted to perform all or any part of the work or services which a prime contractor has contracted with another party to perform.the wilkerson court interpreted contracted with another party to mean the prime contractor and premises owner must be distinct entities the court said this phrase,the law from until meant a general contractor was necessarily an intermediary that contracts both upstream with the premises owner and downstream with the subcontractor.as the owner contracts in wilkerson were all downstream,he could not be a statutory employer 
assuming wilkerson was correctly decided,it lacks any interpretive force today,for a simple reason wilkerson turned entirely on four words the legislature removed during its substantive rewrite here are the pre and definitions that,construed together,control our decision 
as seen above,the reform bill deleted contracted with another party,the critical phrase that anchored wilkerson and suggested a premises owner could not wear the hat of general contractor.the comparison is difficult to brush aside.while the act indicated that a contractor undertook action on behalf of someone else the owner,the legislature in removed that upstream inference.our cases require us to treat such omissions as meaningful and not meaningless a principle even more prudent when deletions occur,as here,within a substantive overhaul that constitutes the lone piece of legislation that lawmakers are considering wilkerson remains instructive only to underscore that statutory construction must honor statutory definitions.
summers urges a construction rooted in language.while conceding that contracted with another party appears nowhere in the current statute,summers insists the notion was not deleted but transplanted,subsumed now by the phrase undertakes to procure in the definition of general contractor.this the condition was moved but not facially counterfactual,betrayed by this inconvenient truth undertake to procure also appeared in the definition.even though this phrase predated the overhaul,summers argues it became implicitly freighted with what was once explicitly stated in a different definition.this argument is unpersuasive.updated criteria require updated analysis.it is untenable that the four words so important in wilkerson were,though deleted,imported into three words that predated wilkerson.summers argument would reinsert what lawmakers took out and declare this part of a massive modernization part that anchors the precedent upon which summers relies nonsubstantive and merely aesthetic 
we can not treat the language in the act as mere surplusage and its deletion a nullity.nor does the dissent pivot on summers argument that undertakes to procure necessarily implies an upstream obligation and must be read as undertakes to procure for someone else.the deletion of something explicit means more than the retention of something implicit.indeed,several texas statutes use undertake to describe a person acting to benefit himself more to the point,when lawmakers have in mind an entity doing something on another behalf,they have no difficulty saying so explicitly,often using undertakes in tandem with clear language like for another person.in such instances,including elsewhere in the labor code,the legislature has done more than imply a obligation it has stated one outright,something lawmakers in did not do,instead choosing to scrap preexisting language 
the act as written bars summers claim,and it merits mention that even certain counsel supporting summers concede the statutory text can be read in entergy favor based on statutory language alone,reasonable persons may differ on whether a premises owner may also act as a general contractor in the procurement of work and provision of workers compensation coverage,thus receiving the exclusive remedy protection from third party actions.thus,we are directed to arguments that look beyond the statute itself.
iii.settled precedent bars summers extratextual arguments 
summers and his aligned amici contend that several factors outside the act actual language support a more flexible statutory reading.the court correctly rejects these arguments,and notably the dissent implicitly does likewise.
failed bills predating and postdating the act overhaul carry no interpretive force 
summers and various amici exhort us to construe language that passed in light of language that failed to pass.as the court makes clear,we can not.precedent from both the united states supreme court and from this court counsel against supplanting unequivocal enacted text with equivocal unenacted inferences drawn from failed legislation.
first,counsel supporting summers direct us to the overhaul effort itself.it is undisputed that the legislature was consumed with the task of restructuring the state workers compensation system the regular session failed to produce a reform bill,and governor clements immediately called a special session.summers places great weight on the fact that during this first of two special sessions,house members once considered an omnibus bill that used owner or general contractor in section predecessor.negotiations collapsed,reportedly over two unrelated issues and lawmakers adjourned and went home for several months.later that year,governor clements called a second special session,and in its final hours the legislature passed senate bill,which did not expressly include the word owner,a fact summers views as dispositive.
this argument is unavailing,as the united states supreme court recently explained it is always perilous to derive the meaning of an adopted provision from another provision deleted in the drafting process.the word momentary presence during special session and absence several months later during special session suggests nothing that can override the express terms of the enacted statute under summers position,we must assign great meaning to language owner that appeared in a prior session bill draft but no meaning to language contracted with another party that the legislature affirmatively removed from an statute.we can not bestow all significance on proposed alterations in failed bills while ignoring enacted alterations to the statute itself.settled law requires the opposite approach,respecting changes to actual statutes and discounting changes to statutes.
second,counsel supporting summers ask us to examine legislative efforts and conclude that intent to bar premises owners from invoking immunity is implicit in the legislature consideration,but not adoption,of various bills since related to liability summers sees the failure of these measures as tantamount to a legislative command to exclude premises owners from asserting the defense.
we can not draw such an inference for two reasons.first,the act itself controls,and its definitions include no such exclusion.far more probative than proposed legislation is passed legislation,what the people elected representatives actually enacted as a collective body.the legislature broad definition,narrow exception approach to general contractor and deletion of the language constitute dual reasons for not barring dual roles for those meeting the act liberal definitional criteria.
second,we eschew guesswork,and a bill failure to pass sheds no light because,as even casual capitol observers know,bills fall short for countless reasons,many of them wholly unrelated to the bill substantive merits or to the legislature view of what the original statute does or does not mean.bills rise and fall for reasons both incalculable and inscrutable,and courts reluctance to draw inferences from subsequent legislative inaction is deeply rooted,as explained by the united states supreme court a ago such by congress affords the most dubious foundation for drawing positive inferences whether congress thought the proposal unwise or unnecessary,we can not tell accordingly,no inference can properly be drawn from the failure of the congress to act.we,too,reject searching for confirmation or contradiction in later sessions unsuccessful bill drafts as infers nothing authoritative about an earlier statute meaning,we do not consult failed bills to divine what a previous legislature intended.
even if our precedent allowed us to conflate inaction with intention,the bills,as the court notes,were not only unsuccessful but immaterial.the bill that comes closest,senate bill from the legislature in,would have amended general contractor to include an owner or lessor of real property.any relevance ends there.senate bill would have let general contractors whether owners or not invoke the defense either by providing coverage directly or by entering into a written agreement with another person under which the other person provides the coverage.today question differs significantly whether a premises owner who meets every current criteria is nonetheless excluded.so while some bills over time would have extended immunity to owners who merely require coverage senate bill who directly provide coverage but do not also act as their own general contractors house bills and who are a parent or subsidiary corporation of an entity that provides coverage house bill,house bill,and senate bill or who are engaged in construction or building with a general contractor and a subcontractor where one of them provides coverage house bills and those expansions of immunity are committed to the legislature broad policymaking discretion.they are not today case,which examines whether entergy is disqualified under existing law despite meeting every applicable criteria.
as for senate bill,the legislative record is completely bare as to the individual sponsor or anyone else objective.the bill was referred to committee and then left pending no hearing,no testimony,no bill analysis,no action whatsoever.even if the bill were on all fours,a single the day before the filing deadline and never heard from constitutes the legislature repeatedly reject ing the notion of a premises owner acting dually as a general contractor under the workers compensation act.in fact,even if there were a failed bill that added owner to the existing definition and nothing else,it would be immaterial.lawmakers may have thought such a bill unwise,or maybe unnecessary.who knows either way,it is imprudent for courts to draw forensic truths from legislative machinations,ascribing intent and motivations based on nothing more than a judge hunch as to what autonomous lawmakers collectively had in mind.as judge easterbrook observes,intent is elusive for a natural person,fictive for a collective body.
neither purposive analysis nor representations regarding legislative history can trump the legislature enacted text 
on a related front,amici supporting summers exhort us to throw off our interpretive shackles and embrace a thorough and expansive methodology that relies on various interpretive tools that look beyond the legislature chosen language.given the lack of textual ambiguity,i reject this eclectic approach the text that lawmakers passed is the truest index of legislative will,and the legislature defines general contractor in terms of what a contractor does,not in terms of what a contractor owns.the definition uses the word owner exactly one time,to make clear that motor carriers that use owner operators to provide transportation services are excluded.there is indeed an exclusion in the act,but it is specific,not general.
notably,the dissent,while siding with summers,also declines this nontextual approach.true,we periodically consult external materials when text is nebulous and susceptible to varying interpretations,but even then,we proceed cautiously,mindful that such materials conflict as often as they converge and that our goal is to solve,but not to create,an ambiguity.even in rare cases where we mine secondary sources to help clarify ambiguity,judges,while not limited to the text,should always be limited by the text 
indeed,this case demonstrates vividly the perils of uncritical reliance on legislative history.it is distressing that those citing the legislative record in this case sometimes do so 
inaccurately misstating when key legislative changes to the draft act occurred 
selectively playing up friendly snippets that they believe reinforce a interpretation and ignoring snippets that subvert it 
misleadingly mischaracterizing the import of legislative actions 
and then,when confronted with a tidbit from the record that can be spun entergy way,summers dismisses it as something uttered mistakenly 
laws exist to guide behavior,and by resting on statutory language rather than embarking on a scavenger hunt for extratextual clues prone to contrivance we ensure that everyday texans struggling to decode the law and manage their affairs consistent with it can rely on a statute to mean what it says,without having to hire lawyers to scour the legislative record for unexpressed and often contradictory indicia of intent.as we recently held,if text is not hazy,we must resist morphing statutory construction into statutory excavation and instead take the legislature at its word and not rummage around in legislative minutiae.
c.the act is not absurd if injured deemed employees receive the same relief as injured direct employees 
summers insists we must adopt a relaxed interpretation more consonant with fairness because reading general contractor to limit contract workers to the same recovery that direct workers receive would render the term meaningless and absurd.while a looser reading is warranted when a reading produces a patently nonsensical result not merely an unpleasant one,this is not such a case.
under summers reading,a separate contractor would escape tort liability,but a premises owner who performs every chore the separate contractor would perform would not.more to the point,a general contractor that oversees work on its own property could not qualify as a general contractor under the act.that was perhaps true in the act,as wilkerson held,but the legislature rewrite amended the law.
one can complain that current comp benefits are inadequate,but it is unpersuasive to equate and contract employees receiving the same benefits when the employer owns the absurdity there is nothing nonsensical or even uncommon about a premises owner serving as its own general contractor or a reading of the act that results in expanded jobsite coverage by urging premises owners to secure coverage for their subcontractors workers the comp system quid pro uncertain tort recovery for medical and income been the embedded public policy of texas since woodrow wilson became president,and wider is,more injured workers receiving such advances that policy.
judges have no authority to the myriad policy judgments codified in the workers compensation act 
the restructuring of the texas workers compensation the most divisive legislative endeavor in contemporary texas politics consumed the legislature for one regular and two special sessions fraught with obstinacy and emotion.what emerged embodied innumerable and quintessential legislative judgments.the recovery of workers comp benefits is dictated by the legislature definitions,not by this court declarations.we must refrain from rewriting the text lawmakers chose,here by reinserting language the legislature deleted 
laid bare,summers core complaint is that benefits under the act are too stingy.we are to assess this charge.the act,whatever its alleged shortcomings,embodies public policy,and courts must read the legislature words as enacted,not revise them as desired.the wisdom or expediency of the law is the legislature prerogative,not ours a fundamental point we recently reaffirmed arguments that the statute is unwise or unfair must be addressed to the texas legislature.
it may be correct that lawmakers in did not intend to permit a role for premises owners.workers comp reform was a herculean,undertaking,one made tougher with short deadlines for drafting and short fuses for drafters.heaven knows laws sometimes pass quickly amid urgent circumstances with scant discussion,yielding untoward ramifications over time.recent examples of abound,including the newly passed and american recovery and reinvestment act of,which provided a rare window into the mad cookery of complex legislation the final draft filled with marks,insertions scrawled in the margins,deletions of whole paragraphs boxed with x slashing through them,and a variety of curious hash marks and other annotations.even evelyn wood would struggle mightily to read the bill,much less cast an informed vote.
even when laws are meticulously drafted and thoughtfully debated,legislative handiwork must often bend to a still more powerful force the law of unintended consequences to be sure,people are inventive at finding ways to confound lawmakers wishes rather than conform to them.but even if we suspected lawmakers intended to retain a requirement despite deleting language,we could not judicially reinsert the requirement,however desirable as a policy matter.
legislative text is often elastic,like the general contractor definition in this case,but the judicial role is not.when divining what lawmakers intended to do,we must focus on what they in fact did do and presume they meant what their words mean.where language is not unclear,a judge doctrinal toolbox is limited.i do not share the view that reliance on text is pretext,that reading laws as written is mere figleafing to disguise judicial willfulness aimed at imposing ideologically congenial results.purposive decisionmaking is achieved more readily and easily by straying from text than by sticking to it,and hewing to the legislature language has repeatedly led me to results i strongly dislike.
obviously,if lawmakers in or later dislike the court interpretation of the words their predecessors believe their predecessors drafted with remedy,and it is a simple one,rests wholly with them.this is precisely how the separation of powers works among branches of government.the presumption that lawmakers intended what they enacted is not just required and but desired and.it is an accommodation rooted in carefulness,not certitude.the legislature can easily reinsert an provision if it believes our interpretation is wooden legalism that honors the letter of the law but not its spirit,thus letting premises owners slip through an unintended loophole.
iv.a brief take on the dissent 
the court briefly addresses the dissent arguments,but more can be said.the dissent chief contention is that lawmakers expressly tethered general contractor to other terms that are commonly understood to mean a person who has contracted with an owner like principal contractor,original contractor,and prime contractor all terms that envision a tripartite relationship among an owner,a general contractor,and subcontractors the dissent acknowledges the listed terms are not exhaustive but concludes,rather conclusorily,that the notion of an is simply not analogous.
like the court,i find the dissent argument unpersuasive,for several reasons.first,the dissent cites the common usage provision of the code construction act in urging a commonly understood reading of general contractor.however,the act very next provision stresses that common usage must yield to specific legislative definitions thus,ordinary meanings should be applied only to undefined terms.the legislature enacted a specialized definition of general contractor,and in deleted not only the condition,but also the injunction to interpret the synonyms for general contractor as those terms are commonly used.if a statute defines a term,a court is bound to construe that term by its statutory definition only,deference that seems especially warranted where,as here,the statute omits an earlier directive to apply common usage.in any case,given the ordinariness of premises owners acting as their own general contractors i fail to understand the dissent outright rejection of owner contractor as dissimilar.
second,the dissent looks for support in statutory definitions of contractor outside the workers compensation act that explicitly mention a requirement however,none of these cited provisions define general contractor.there exists in texas statutory law only one definition of this term,labor code section,the provision at issue today.the act nowhere defines contractor,though independent contractor,the term most analogous to the contractor provisions cited by the dissent,is defined immediately below the definition of general contractor as someone who contracts to perform work or provide a service for the benefit of another.the definition by its terms requires an upstream relationship,something the general contractor definition does not.if anything,the provisions cited by the dissent,and the independent contractor definition in the act itself,only strengthen the court position,showing that the legislature is adept at including explicit language when it chooses.the fact that the legislature did not add language more,it subtracted such fortifies the court interpretation.
third,the dissent relies on two of our prior cases to assert we have recognized for almost a century that a contractor has a requirement a careful examination of these cases,however,shows that both cases concern whether an injured worker is an employee or an independent contractor and not whether a premises owner can qualify as a general contractor together,the two cases use the phrase independent contractor nineteen times and the phrase general contractor none at all.the cases are simply inapposite,though again,by focusing on independent contractor,they draw attention to the act current definition of that term,one that on its face requires a relationship,unlike the general contractor definition that immediately precedes it.
finally,the absence of owner contractor from a list the dissent concedes is nonexhaustive something we must construe liberally is less notable than the absence of premises owner from the act exclusion something we must construe strictly.the analogous terms seem of a kind and interchangeable,which makes the exclusion seem markedly out of place,suggesting that the definition was otherwise broad enough to capture them.stated differently,there seemed an awareness that entities beyond the listed terms could fall within the broad definition,but only this narrow class was carved out.
v.a brief take on justice hecht concurrence 
if my understanding is correct,the dissenters reject their original view of the case and now insist a premises owner has never been entitled to status by providing comp coverage to subcontractors and their employees.conversely,the court and justice hecht apparently believe that access to the defense by providing such coverage has been available perhaps since,when a provision was added that is now section of the labor code,and is certainly available today.my position,detailed above,is that the defense was made available in,when lawmakers removed language from the act.
the court and justice hecht attention to section and its earlier enacted versions is unhelpful and unnecessary in my view given the deletion in of the language.section currently provides that if a person hires a subcontractor,not for any legitimate reason but instead with the intent to avoid liability under the workers compensation laws,the scheme will fail because the worker will be deemed the person employee.this provision earlier applied to subscribers rather than persons,but in any case it has always applied to all statutory employers subject to the workers compensation laws.
section is a rarely employed subterfuge provision intended to thwart sham attempts by an employer to mischaracterize an employee as a subcontractor and thereby avoid comp liability.it says as to all statutory employers and targeting efforts to evade liability.the provision at issue in today case,currently section,addresses the separate matter of extending status to a general contractor who retains a legitimate,independent subcontractor and wishes to cover the subcontractor employees.the provision was added in,and substantively rewritten in,as i discuss above.
i essentially agree with justice on this point.none of the parties rely on section,and it is irrelevant to the key inquiry whether a premises owner can be a general contractor under section.the latter provision has never applied to all subscribers,but is limited to general contractors.today issue is whether a premises owner can fall within the definition of general contractor,a subset of all subscribers.
so while i agree with the court result and most of its reasoning,i part company with the court and justice hecht on the relevance of the subterfuge provision and its history,even though the changes to this provision and the eventual enactment of the provision share a common legislative ancestry to some extent.in short,i see less ambiguity than justice hecht does in the and subcontractor definitions.interestingly,he attaches no significance to the legislature deletion of contracted with another party.if anything,his meticulous effort to lay out the history of sections and and their interplay convinces me,more than ever,that we should focus on the text as enacted and amended and resist entreaties to meditate on the varying motives and atmospherics that may have spurred the texas legislators who have dealt with workers compensation over the past years.i simply do not share justice hecht ambiguity diagnosis though i certainly share his aversion to divorcing text,plain or not,from context 
for the reasons discussed in parts above,i disagree that the act can be read either way and thus requires a gestalt examination of a of legislative machinations for whatever authoritative lessons can be gleaned from that odyssey,interesting though it may be again,i would hold that the provision,unlike its version,does not forbid a premises owner from acting as its own general contractor.
vi.conclusion 
courts are charged with exercising judgment,not will and judicial of the line between adjudication and legislation and refusing to cross giving wide berth to legislative judgment.on policy matters,we must aim for utter disinterestedness,meaning we must interpret the act as it is written,not as we might have written it.the texas workers compensation act is replete with countless policy,and our confined role,one defined chiefly by limits and duties,not by powers,is to construe statutes as we find them,not to or refine them.
the court has reached the correct result,and for the reasons discussed above,i join all but parts iv,v,and viii of its decision.
the court today concludes that premises owners who pay and recoup their subcontractors workers compensation premiums are,and have always been,entitled to the workers compensation act defense against their subcontractors injured employees.the court pins its analysis on a provision that was designed to prevent subscribers from creating sham subcontractor relationships in order to avoid covering their own injured employees.remarkably,neither the parties nor the dozens of amici curiae in this case have proffered such an interpretation.although the court concludes that the law in this regard has remained essentially the same since,the legislature first afforded a general contractor that ha d contracted with another party to perform work the right to voluntarily assume statutory employer status in.had all subscribers always been statutory employers of subcontractors employees,this statutory revision and its iteration would make no sense.
the parties and amici appear to agree,as do i and justice willett,that before premises owners were not general contractors under the act.the appropriate inquiry,then,is not whether the general contractor definition excludes premises owners,as the court posits,but whether the legislature intended to change prior law by expanding the definition to include premises owners when it rewrote the act in and expressly tethered the term to others commonly understood to mean a person who has contracted with an owner.had the legislature intended to change the law in and for the first time afford premises owners the defense against subcontractors and their employees,it would surely have been simpler to say so by using the broader term subscriber,or by including the term owner contractor in the description of analogous terms that define a general contractor.
a few points bear noting at the outset.first,whether workers potential recovery is greater under the common law or the workers compensation act,and whether one scheme promotes workplace safety over the other,is a legislative call,not ours.second,one can not contract into the act protections if the legislature did not intend to allow it accordingly,that entergy reserved any right it might have to assert a defense against imc employees,or that summers accepted workers compensation benefits paid for by entergy and deducted from the contract price,does not inform the statutory analysis.and finally,whether premises owners should be afforded the act protections by paying their general contractor workers compensation premiums,as general contractors are by paying the premiums of their subcontractors,is a policy choice we are not at liberty to make.
as the court notes,this case has drawn much attention since our initial opinion,and numerous amici have weighed in.when this case was first presented,summers emphasis was on entergy proof regarding the existence of a written agreement and mistaken reliance on the legislature nonsubstantive recodification of the labor code.on rehearing,a more focused analysis of the applicable statutory text convinces me that the legislature,in rewriting the act in,did not intend to change the definition to include premises owners to the contrary,it tied the definition to terms commonly understood to mean a person who has contracted with an owner.it might well represent sound policy to allow premises owners to become statutory employers of their contractors employees by providing workers compensation coverage,potentially expanding the number of employees eligible to receive benefits under the act whether such an expansion would require an adjustment to premiums,benefits,or other provisions of the act is something only policymakers can decide.our job is to discern what the legislature intended.and that body has restricted the option to parties analogous to principal contractor s,original contractor s,and prime contractor s,entities that contract to perform work for third parties and who face no premises liability in the absence of control of the premises.based on the statute language and appropriate statutory construction principles,i do not agree that the legislature intended the term general contractor to encompass premises owners within the act protections.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
a.the statutory text 
under section of the act,a general contractor and a subcontractor may enter into a written agreement under which the general contractor provides workers compensation insurance coverage to the subcontractor and the employees of the subcontractor.a.if such an agreement is reached and properly filed,the general contractor may deduct premiums from the amount owed the subcontractor without incurring penalties under section of the act,which prohibits employers from collecting premiums or benefits from their employees id.d,f.more importantly,the agreement makes the general contractor the statutory employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor employees,shielded from tort liability by the act provision.id.e,a.the act defines a general contractor as 
a person who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.the term includes a principal contractor,original contractor,prime contractor,or other analogous term.the term does not include a motor carrier that provides a transportation service through the use of an owner operator.
id.a subcontractor,in turn,is a person who contracts with a general contractor to perform all or part of the work or services that the general contractor has undertaken to perform.id.a close analysis of these definitions,particularly viewed in light of controlling statutory construction principles,compels the conclusion that the legislature did not intend to allow a premises owner to assume status and assert the act defense against subcontractors and their employees at no additional cost to itself.
in construing a statute,our overarching purpose is to determine and effectuate the legislature intent.state shumake,citing city of san antonio city of boerne.the surest guide to that intent is,of course,the plain and common meaning of the language the legislature has employed.city of houston clark,citing mcintyre ramirez.treating premises owners who provide workers compensation coverage to subcontractors and their employees as general contractors is inconsistent with the common meaning associated with the terms to which the definition is tied.
throughout texas statutory and common law,a contractor is generally understood to be a person or entity that enters into a contract with another for compensation.in interpreting the act and its predecessors,we have for decades defined a contractor as any person who,in the pursuit of an independent business,undertakes to do a specific piece of work for other persons indus.indem.exch.southard,quoting shannon indem.comm app,judgm t adopted emphasis added while the precise issue before us in shannon was whether a party seeking workers compensation benefits was an independent contractor as opposed to an employee,we articulated a broader principle,that a contractor is someone who performs work for someone else.our legislature has repeatedly echoed that understanding.see.contractor means a person who contracts with an owner.original contractor means a person contracting with an owner.d c ontractor means a newspaper or statewide association with which the secretary of state contracts under this section.c ontractor in the context of a contract for the construction,rehabilitation,alteration,or repair of a facility means a legal entity that assumes the risk for constructing,rehabilitating,altering,or repairing all or part of the facility at the contracted price.gov t code contractor in the context of a contract for a project means a legal entity that assumes the risk for constructing,rehabilitating,altering,or repairing all or part of the project at the contracted price.
the illustrative language the legislature included in the workers compensation act general contractor definition is consistent with that general understanding principal contractor,original contractor,and prime contractor are all terms that envision a tripartite relationship in which one entity enters into a contract to perform work for another and then retains subcontractors or independent contractors to do all or part of the work.see,original contractor means a person contracting with an owner either directly or through the owner agent,and s ubcontractor means a person who has furnished labor or materials to fulfill an obligation to an original contractor or to a subcontractor to perform all or part of the work required by an original contract.interstate contracting city of dallas,using the term prime contractor interchangeably with general contractor in discussing claims page structural wood components,using the term general contractor interchangeably with original contractor in interpreting chapter of the property code see also op.att y no.ruling that university that hired independent contractors to provide work such as carpet installation and window repair did not act as a hiring contractor under section of the act because it did not act even as a contractor as that term is commonly understood,relying in part on section definition.while i acknowledge that the categories listed in the second sentence of section general contractor definition are not exhaustive,the legislature did make clear that only analogous entities are to be treated as general contractors.see.a premises owner is simply not analogous 
the court insists that the statutory definition controls over what it tacitly acknowledges is the commonly understood meaning of the term general contractor.but the legislature itself has mandated that w ords and phrases shall be construed according to common usage,and that w ords and phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning,whether by legislative definition or otherwise,shall be construed accordingly.gov t code a,b.in this instance,common usage,the common law,and a host of legislative pronouncements are contrary to the meaning the court attaches to the term.more importantly,the statutory language itself comports with,and is tied to,the general understanding of the term meaning.when the legislature enacted section,we had long defined a contractor as one who undertakes to do a specific piece of work for other persons southard,at quoting shannon,at emphasis added.and black law dictionary,at the time the legislature adopted the definition,similarly defined a contractor as a person who,in the pursuit of any independent business,undertakes to do a specific piece of work for other persons black law dictionary ed.it also stated that t his term is strictly applicable to any person who enters into a contract,but is commonly reserved to designate one who,for a fixed price undertakes to procure the performance of works or services for the public or a company or individual.id.emphasis added.in other words,a contractor is someone who receives payment for performing work for another.section precisely tracks these definitions by describing a general contractor as one who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.in light of this longstanding commonly understood usage,the legislature could easily have defined general contractor to include premises owners if that was its intent,but it did not.had the legislature intended the term to be as conceptually broad as the court and justice hecht today say it is,it could simply have written that a subscriber and a subcontractor may enter into an agreement,but again,it did not.
the court attaches a similarly strained meaning to the term separately within the definition.general contractor means a person who undertakes to procure the performance of work or a service,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.id.that is,the court says that a premises owner acts separately when it engages subcontractors directly rather than through a general contractor.at.but separately far likelier alludes to independent contractors,as opposed to subcontractors,terms which the legislature defined differently in the same bill that introduced the separately language.see act of,ch.laws,codified at.
b.the statutory revision 
significantly,the legislature used almost identical undertake to procure language in the prior version of the statute when conferring status on prime contractors who provided workers compensation coverage to their subcontractors.act of may,ch.laws,amended by act of,ch,a.laws.the prior statute equated the term prime contractor with general contractor,and defined it to mean the person who has undertaken to procure the performance of work or services.id.the definition of subcontractor in the same legislation left no doubt that the language embraced the commonly understood meaning of a contractor as one who has agreed with another to perform work or services in exchange for compensation.s was defined as a person who has contracted to perform all or part of work or services that a prime contractor has contracted with another party to perform.id.emphasis added.despite the clarity of that language,the court and justice hecht conclude that the definition could be read to encompass premises owners who have not contracted with other persons to perform work.apparently,they believe only language within the definition itself would demonstrate legislative intent to exclude premises owners.
justice willett,and the court to some extent,make much of the legislature omission in of the language,concluding that the legislature meant to abolish the upstream contract condition.it is hard to fathom that such a sweeping and deliberate change in the law would be so subtly effected.but if that had been the legislature intent,it would not have substituted undertaken to perform language that had long been recognized in the definition as imposing a obligation.the legislature use of the same language in the old and new definitions strongly indicates it intended the same meaning in each version.
reliance on omission of the language in the subcontractor definition is misplaced for yet another reason.it is true that the legislature is presumed to act with knowledge of existing laws,acker.water comm n,and that deletions in existing laws are presumed to be intentional.in re ament.but the workers compensation bill enacted in did not merely amend prior laws,it massively overhauled the entire workers compensation scheme.while portions of the bill amending the insurance code,the government code,and other measures related to workers compensation indicated deletions with bracketed strikeouts,articles through of the bill comprising the workers compensation act itself contained no such indications of omissions.see,codified as amended at.lab.code,title,subtitle a see also.legislative council drafting manual,available at.tlc.state.tx.us legal dm draftingmanual.pdf.thus,omission of the language from the subcontractor definition does not merit the weight the court and justice willett afford it.because contract ing with another party is inherent in the nature of general contractors and analogous terms,and because the concept had been subsumed in the definition of prime contractor and general contractor as the person who has undertaken to procure the performance of work or services,the language in the subcontractor definition was most likely not included in the new act to conform the two definitions.
giving virtually no effect to the legislature restriction of general contractor to terms analogous to principal contractor,original contractor,and prime contractor,the court and justice willett attach great significance to the sentence excluding motor carriers that provide transportation services through the use of.but when that exclusion is viewed in the context of the entire statutory scheme and other law applicable to motor carriers,the reason for the exclusion becomes clear in the rewrite of the act,the legislature made some,but not all,of section applicable to motor carriers.like general contractors and subcontractors,motor carriers and which are deemed independent contractors under section may enter into an agreement under which the motor carrier provides workers compensation coverage to an and its employees.c.and like a general contractor,a motor carrier that provides workers compensation coverage to its independent contractor may deduct the premium from the contract price without incurring penalties under section of the act.id.d.but unlike general contractors,a motor carrier that provides coverage to its does not become the statutory employer of the or the is no provision equivalent to section d that applies to motor carriers.this differing treatment of motor carriers is consistent with section a of the transportation code,which restricts the ability of common carriers to limit their common law liability.it may also be attributable to the heightened standard of care imposed upon common carriers in light of their potential impact on public safety and their highly regulated status.see speed boat leasing,elmer,states,state,gonzalez,dissenting.one could argue that motor carriers are analogous to general contractors,in that they frequently contract with third parties to provide transportation services and then subcontract with to actually perform those services.thus,the legislature likely expressly excluded motor carriers from the definition to make it clear that,even though they might otherwise fit the construct,they are to be treated differently.
justice hecht interpretation 
noting that a property owner may act as its own general contractor,but acknowledging that the term is more generally understood to mean one who contracts with a property owner and then subcontracts parts of the job to others,justice hecht concludes that we just ca tell from the statutory language what the legislature meant.finding the text elusive,justice hecht discerns policies embedded in the act which he believes tip the scales in favor of treating a premises owner as a general contractor.there are several problems with this approach.first,while the definition of a general contractor as one who undertakes to procure the performance of work may in isolation appear,the definition second sentence ties the term to its commonly understood meaning.second,if indeed the text is ambiguous as justice hecht claims,we have clearly said that statutes in derogation of common law rights should not be applied to cases not clearly within their purview.see energy serv.of bowie,superior snubbing,quoting satterfield satterfield.and third,the policies that justice hecht identifies and perceives would be thwarted if premises owners are not treated as general contractors have never been applied in this context and beg a question that is exclusively within the legislature realm,not ours.
the first policy that justice hecht believes sweeps premises owners into the definition is the act decided bias for coverage.see wingfoot enters.alvarado.but the act bias is in favor of employers electing to provide coverage for their employees we have never read a bias into the act that would confer its protections on third parties absent clear statutory authorization or any indicia of an relationship.the act general policy that favors employers covering employees can not expand the category of persons considered general contractors beyond the statutory definition invoking that policy here is particularly unwarranted when the legislature could so easily have defined the term as expansively as the court and justice hecht do today.
the second policy justice hecht cites is the provision.see.if the act prohibits subscribers from utilizing subcontractors to avoid coverage,he posits,it surely would not discourage coverage by denying subscribers the defense.but the provision was never intended to impute coverage to true third parties as justice hecht seems to imply it simply prohibits a person who has workers compensation coverage from subcontracting the work with the intent and purpose of avoiding liability as an employer.see id.in other words,an employer can not designate its employee a subcontractor in order to avoid paying benefits under the act.no one claims that imc was hired by entergy as a sham to avoid paying its own employees workers compensation benefits the provision is simply irrelevant to analysis of the definition.
justice hecht next charges that my reading of the statute would have perverse results because the contractual indemnity allowed under section and provided for in entergy contract with imc would permit summers to recover common law damages from entergy,which entergy could in turn recoup from imc.justice hecht suggests that in such a scenario,the workers compensation system provides nothing to any employer.of course the act,at least according to my reading and that of the litigants,amici and justice willett,had the same effect,which is a policy choice the legislature made.the question is whether in the legislature intended to change that policy.in addition,several factors undermine justice hecht point.one,while entergy paid imc premiums for summers benefits under its insurance plan opip,that cost was deducted from the contract price paid to imc,so entergy effectively paid nothing for the additional protection justice hecht reading would afford entergy.two,owners receive significant economic benefits from opips like entergy apart from tort immunity.opips allow owners to secure coverage for all their contractors at a lower overall price than the cost of workers compensation insurance that subcontractors would normally incorporate into their contract prices,thereby lowering owners overall costs.howrey llp,owner controlled insurance programs ocips why owners like them and why contractors may not,construction weblinks,july,reports news.in turn,the cost of the premium deducted from imc contract price was likely lower than the premium imc would have otherwise paid.consequently,both entergy and imc benefitted from the insurance arrangement in this instance irrespective of tort immunity.three,that indemnity agreements like that between entergy and imc are widespread in the industry is some indication that premises owners do not perceive the act provision to protect them from common law claims,else there would be no need for such agreements.and four,any tort damages that summers might recover would likely be paid from the commercial general liability policy that entergy required imc to obtain as a condition under the parties contract,and the workers compensation carrier would be subrogated to summers recovery under section of the act.the perverse result that justice hecht envisions simply does not exist.
the fourth policy reason justice hecht cites is that the act was intended to be comprehensive.but again,it can only be comprehensive to the extent that the legislature intended,and there is nothing in the revision that would indicate the legislature intent suddenly changed.underlying justice hecht analysis is an apparent assumption that summers might recover a windfall against entergy on his common law claims.but if entergy is not summers employer under the act,it retains the full panoply of defenses available to it under the common law,and summers shoulders the burden of establishing the company negligence with the consequent uncertainties of litigation.should summers prevail on his common law claims,which is far from certain,he would forfeit any benefits that he has received under the act.irrespective of the workers compensation system relative merits,which is not ours to decide,it has operated this way at least until the statutory revision in there is nothing to indicate the legislature revision was intended to effect a change.
statutory construction principles 
as i read the statutory language,it seems clear that the legislature did not intend to transform premises owners who contract for services into general contractors entitled to assert the act defense.but even if the language were less than clear,statutory construction principles lead to the same conclusion.in a decision issued a week before the court original opinion in this case,we considered whether an indemnification agreement between a subscribing employer and another party could be enforced by that party contractor even though the contractor had not executed the agreement.superior snubbing.the statute had formerly required only that such an agreement be executed by the subscriber to be enforceable,but in the legislature changed the statutory language to require a written agreement executed with the third party.id.at quoting.although the revision appeared to require the signature of both parties,we concluded that the legislature intended no change in the law and that the nonsignatory contractor could seek indemnification as an intended beneficiary of the agreement.id.at.in concluding that the legislature intended no substantive change in the law,despite the change in the statute language,we relied largely on two statutory construction principles.first,we noted that the common law allows the intended beneficiary of a contract to enforce it,and that statutes in derogation of common law rights will not be extended beyond their plain meaning or applied to cases not clearly within their purview.id.at quoting satterfield,at.second,we applied the legislature directive that in interpreting a statute,courts must consider at all times the old law,the evil,and the remedy.id.quoting.gov t code.because we could identify no practical motivation for a change,or any indication that the legislature amendment of the statute was intended to be substantive,we concluded that the beneficiary could seek indemnity.id.at.
the application of those same principles in this case demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to expand the class of contractors entitled to claim status to include premises owners when it rewrote the act in.nothing in the act legislative history suggests that the legislature perceived an evil in the requirement that a person must have contracted to perform services for another to be a general or prime contractor.see joint select committee on workers compensation insurance,a report to the legislature.workers comp.comm garcia,discussing report.and to the extent the statute language does not plainly entitle premises owners to assume status under these circumstances,superior snubbing counsels against that construction,as it would be in derogation of summers common law rights.at see also kroger keng,i t would be injudicious to construe the statute in a manner that supplies by implication restrictions on an employee rights that are not found in section plain language.citing miears indus.accident.
the court may perceive that it has managed to blur the inconsistency between its decision today and superior snubbing by proclaiming that the law has remained unchanged since.at.but its own analysis shows how hollow that statement is.the court acknowledges that an entirely new provision was introduced in,and then amended in.and the court attaches some significance to the omission of the phrase with another party from the subcontractor definition in.at.in superior snubbing,the court concluded that the legislature insertion of a phrase failed to demonstrate legislative intent to change the law absent a showing of any specific motivation.here,the record is similarly devoid of any showing of an evil in need of remedy,yet the court concludes that the omission of the with another party language effected a sweeping change in the law.
justice hecht recognizes the tension between today decision and superior snubbing,but brushes it aside because it has never been clear when a person is considered the statutory employer of a subcontractor or his employees he reaches that conclusion by focusing on a series of failed of which ultimately made clear that a general or prime contractor is someone who has agreed to perform work for a third the fact that the legislative forerunner to the sections at issue today originated in a bill that would have eliminated the provision of the act.following this circuitous route,justice hecht concludes that the definition of prime contractor finally enacted could reasonably be read to include a premises owner acting as his own general contractor.at.that view voiced by none of the litigants or amici is simply contrary to the statute terms before,the subcontractor definition made it unmistakably clear that a general contractor was someone who had contracted with another party to perform work.act of may,ch.laws,amended by act of,ch,a.laws.moreover,to the extent justice hecht interpretation of the act is informed bills that were never adopted by both houses of the legislature,it is worth noting that the house committee substitute for senate bill,the source of sections and,would have specifically allowed premises owners to secure status,but that version of the bill was rejected in its entirety by the senate.see of.in any event,i agree with justice willett that failed legislation is an unsound guide to legislative intent.
the court conclusion that premises owners are subsumed within the definition is also inconsistent with another statutory construction principle we have frequently employed.just four months ago,we analyzed section b of the texas civil practice and remedies code to determine whether loose gravel on a road amounted to a special defect.dep t of transp.york,wl.the statute we evaluated imposed a heightened duty on governmental units to warn of special defects such as excavations or obstructions on highways,roads,or streets of which they should have been aware.civ.prac.b.we explained that while the statute did not define special defect,it did give examples 
thus,u nder the ejusdem generis rule,we are to construe special defect to include those defects of the same kind or class as excavations or obstructions.while these specific examples are not exclusive and do not exhaust the class,the central inquiry is whether the condition is of the same kind or falls within the same class as an excavation or obstruction.
york.because loose gravel did not share the characteristics of an obstruction or excavation,we held that it was not a special defect.id.the application of york principles in this case demonstrates that the legislature did not intend to include premises owners within the act definition.as already explained,a premises owner who is not performing work for another does not share the characteristics of a general contractor,a principal contractor,an original contractor,or a prime contractor.see also fid.guar.goudeau,under the traditional canon of construction noscitur a sociis a word is known by the company it keeps,each of the words here must be construed in context.
in support of its construction,the court posits two workers injured in the same industrial accident receiving different compensation.the court apparently considers it anomalous that a worker employed by the premises owner working with a subcontractor employee might be limited to workers compensation benefits,while another employed by an independent contractor would be able to seek the full range of damages under the common law.first,to the extent such an anomaly exists under my reading of the statute,it is the result of policy choices made by the legislature that long the revision.moreover,in implying that the result is somehow unfair to the premises owner injured employee,the court overlooks the option the act provides employees of subscribing employers to elect not to be covered by workers compensation.it also overlooks the quid pro quo,being the relinquishment of uncertain common law recovery in exchange for the prompt receipt of defined benefits,that has insulated the act from constitutional challenge under the open courts provision of the texas constitution.garcia,at.
because i do not believe that the legislature in the act intended to change prior law and confer status on premises owners,i respectfully dissent.
such immunity arises when the statutory employer invokes the exclusive remedy defense,which limits the employee exclusive remedy to recovery of workers compensation benefits.a.
a general contractor and a subcontractor may enter into a written agreement under which the general contractor provides workers compensation insurance coverage to the subcontractor and the employees of the subcontractor.a.
an agreement under this section makes the general contractor the employer of the subcontractor and the subcontractor employees only for purposes of the workers compensation laws of this state.id.e.
recovery of workers compensation benefits is the exclusive remedy of an employee covered by workers compensation insurance coverage or a legal beneficiary against the employer or an agent or employee of the employer for the death of or a injury sustained by the employee.id.a.
it has long been the policy of this state,expressed in every version of the act,that no subscriber can avoid covering an injured worker merely because he was employed by a subcontractor.the version of the act created a deemed employer status to address this concern if any subscriber to this act with the purpose and intention of avoiding any liability imposed by the terms of the act sublets the whole or any part of the work to be performed or done by said subscriber to any,then in the event any employe e of such sustains an injury in the course of his employment he shall be deemed to be and taken for all purposes of this act to be the employe e of the subscriber,and in addition thereto such employe e shall have an independent right of action against such,which shall in no way be affected by any compensation to be received by him under the terms and provisions of this of,ch,part ii.laws.in,hb amended the statute by adding a different provision using the term prime contractor,defined to mean the person who has undertaken to procure the performance of work or services.act of may,ch.laws.then,in,the last major overhaul of the act kept the undertaken to definition,but substituted the term prime contractor for general contractor and defined that person with the same language a person who has undertaken to procure the performance of work or services,either separately or through the use of subcontractors.act of,ch.laws.the deemed employer provision remains virtually unchanged in the current labor code,except the term subscriber has been replaced by the term,person who has workers compensation insurance coverage.act of may,ch.laws,current version at.

special chief justice sidney samuels of fort worth was designated by governor ross sterling in january to sit for chief justice cureton under a statute now codified as section of the texas government code.the case involved a private claim against the state to lands in the region along the meridian from the red river to the parallel dividing texas and the indian territories that later became oklahoma.the united states supreme court finally held in oklahoma texas,that the region belonged to texas.chief justice cureton was disqualified because he had represented texas interests in the dispute.the court took just nine years to decide the case.interestingly,james allred had also represented texas interests while attorney general,and when the case was decided,had served two terms as governor and been nominated to serve as a federal judge,all the while being shown as counsel for the state in the case.the most famous exercise of the designation power was surely governor pat neff appointment of a special supreme court consisting of three women,hortense ward,special chief justice,and miss ruth virginia brazzil and miss hattie henenberg,special associate justices,to hear and determine the issues in johnson darr.

woolsey panhandle ref,the law the workers compensation act is comprehensive in its terms 
lee lewis,harrison,hecht,concurring the hire for a subscribing independent contractor presumably includes the cost of providing workers compensation coverage related to the work,and the contractor employer who pays it should have the same protection from extra liability for injuries to the contractor employees that the contractor has.the employer thus has the same economic incentive the contractor has to minimize risks to workers.the employer is not like a product manufacturer or other stranger to the work relationship who has not born any part of the cost of compensation and therefore is not immune from liability for injury to the contractor employees.imposing liability on the employer for the contractor negligent injury of its employee is simply inconsistent with the bedrock principle that workers compensation is an employee exclusive remedy and full compensation for injuries.footnotes omitted citing monk virgin is.water power,cir anderson marathon petrol,cir.
kroger keng,the texas legislature enacted the act in in response to the needs of workers,who,despite escalating industrial accidents,were increasingly being denied recovery.the act allowed injured workers,whose employers subscribed to workers compensation insurance,to recover without establishing the employer fault and without regard to the employee negligence.in exchange,the employees received a lower,but more certain,recovery than would have been possible under the common law.citation omitted texas workers compensation com garcia,employees injured in the course and scope of employment could recover compensation without proving fault by the employer and without regard to their or their coworkers negligence.in exchange,the employer total liability for an injury was substantially limited.citation omitted edmunds highrise,dist,writ ref the theory behind the exclusive remedy provision of the workers compensation act is that in cases where the employee is merely injured,he be given the opportunity to relinquish common law remedies for lesser benefits which are paid more quickly and efficiently,and without proof of fault.
