plaintiffs paul and gail sobieski twice filed suit in federal court,advancing various claims under the jones act and general maritime law relating to a peculiar incident that took place aboard the joseph block.a grant of summary judgment and a stipulation of dismissal eliminated most of the sobieskis claims against most of the defendants in the two cases.the district court then consolidated the two cases and later dismissed the remaining claims.the sobieskis appeal the grant of summary judgment on their jones act claims.we affirm.
background 
the circumstances giving rise to this suit,as alleged by paul sobieski,are decidedly odd.on the afternoon of april,the joseph block was underway on its lake michigan route from south chicago,illinois,to muskegon,michigan.sobieski a crewman assigned to the ship engine department,completed a coal load on the ship conveyor system and then headed to the recreation room to drink a cup of coffee.sobieski eased back in a chair to relax and watch television for a bit.unbeknownst to sobieski,however,a figure silently crept up behind him as he watched the television.suddenly,before sobieski could react,the figure seized sobieski head between its hands.
the lurking figure was sobieski crewmate,mike barrett.and what barrett did with sobieski head was bizarre,to say the least.as sobieski alleged in his complaint and repeats in his opening brief,barrett snuck up behind his,paul sobieski,placed his hands on each side of sobieski head,and forcefully slammed it to the side against sobieski own right shoulder causing his neck to be injured.in short,barrett cracked,or popped,sobieski,as sobieski styles it,barrett tractioned sobieski neck,chiropractor style 
sobieski claims that,as a result of this unrequested and unexpected neck tractioning,he suffered intense immediately fell onto one knee in front of his chair,with his eyes watering and a burning sensation in his neck.after a few seconds in which to recover,sobieski demanded to know why barrett had done what he did.barrett replied,look,i do it to myself all the time,and he proved it by maneuvering his own head in the same manner.
for days after this strange incident,sobieski continued to suffer various of the numbness and tingling in his neck,left leg,arm,and side.sobieski physical problems worsened after he went ashore on april.for several months,sobieski sought and received treatment for these ailments from several medical specialists.during the course of this treatment,sobieski employer,central marine logistics,central marine,paid percent of his medical bills.it also paid sobieski for hours of work a week while the joseph block was at sea,and paid him at the sickness and accident rate while the vessel was laid up.
on november,however,matters took a turn for the worse.sobieski experienced a lock up pinch in his neck and fell down his basement stairs.as a result,sobieski broke his neck in three places and required multiple surgeries and rehabilitation.central marine stopped paying full medical coverage,so sobieski had to rely on medical insurance to pick up coverage.
these events gave rise to a tangle of claims in federal court.in brief,the sobieskis filed two separate complaints advancing various negligence claims under maritime law,including unseaworthiness,maintenance and cure,and negligence under the jones act.following a grant of summary judgment that disposed of most of the claims in the sobieskis first suit including the jones act negligence claims,the parties stipulated to partial dismissal of most of the remaining claims.the two suits were then consolidated,and the district court dismissed all of the sobieskis remaining claims.
this appeal challenges the district court grant of summary judgment on the jones act claims in favor of sobieski employer,central marine.
ii.discussion 
the district court granted summary judgment on the sobieskis jones act claims,so our review is de novo.scott trump,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when the record,viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see also celotex catrett,d wilson,milwaukee,paul pacific,cir jones act cases deciding summary judgment on scope of employment issues apply the traditional summary judgment standards.citations omitted.
we review briefly the jones act before proceeding to the merits.prior to the enactment of the jones act,seamen were entitled only to maintenance and cure from their employer for injuries incurred in the service of the ship but not damages for the negligence of the ship master or a fellow crewman.see chandris,latsis,d citations omitted.congress enacted the jones act to create a federal negligence claim for seamen injured in the course of employment.app.a.the jones act provides this heightened legal protection to eligible seamen because of their exposure to the perils of the sea in the course of their duties.chandris,at.the act by its terms extends the protections of the federal employer liability act fela to seamen,and thus fela caselaw is broadly applicable in the jones act context.see greenwell aztar.gaming,cir hernandez trawler miss vertie mae,cir t he jones act gives seamen rights that parallel those given to railway employees under the fela.
thus,under the jones act,an eligible seaman or a personal representative if the seaman is deceased may file an in personam action in federal court against his employer for injuries suffered due to the employer negligence.see lewis lewis clark marine,d wingerter chester quarry,cir per curiam.in addition,under the doctrine of respondeat superior,a jones act employer may be liable for the negligence or intentional torts of its employees.greenwell,at lancaster norfolk,cir landry oceanic contractors,cir williamson pacific dredging,cir.
turning to the merits,the sobieskis advance two different jones act arguments.first,the plaintiffs contend that central marine is vicariously liable for what they describe as barrett pseudo chiropractic ways.second,the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is directly negligent and liable for sobieski injury because it was aware or should have been aware,through its officers,of barrett activities and did nothing to prevent them.we take these arguments in turn.
respondeat superior 
as noted above,vicarious liability may extend to fela or jones act employers under the traditional doctrine of respondeat superior.precedent applies the common law principle that an employer may be vicariously liable for its employee negligence or intentional tort committed within the course or scope of is,committed while furthering the employer or the ship business.see greenwell,at wilson,at lancaster,at consol.rail gottshall,d.
the plaintiffs argue for a more expansive interpretation of jones act vicarious liability.the plaintiffs urge us to apply a standard that would abrogate the common law scope of employment rule in the jones act context.according to the plaintiffs,seamen should be entitled to broader legal protections under the jones act than railroad workers under fela all seamen serving aboard a seagoing vessel are by definition acting within the scope of employment,because the seamen must remain on the vessel while off watch and at sea and therefore are on the job.in fact,the plaintiffs proposed rule would extend liability to the jones act employer for all negligent acts by employees which occur on the vessel.thus,the plaintiffs contend that there is no need to show that barrett acts were in furtherance of the ship business.
we decline,however,to adopt the rule the plaintiffs propose.we may not ignore common law principles of negligence unless congress expressly indicates otherwise.see gottshall,at.see also discussion supra in note.the express terms of neither fela nor the jones act suggest the broad theory of vicarious liability proposed by the plaintiffs.in addition,we have noted that the course of employment test for fela cases is identical to the standard to be applied in jones act cases.see lancaster,at collecting authority.under that standard,a plaintiff must show that the employee tort was committed in furtherance of the employer business.see id.
the plaintiffs seek a rule that would in essence make jones act employers the absolute insurers of seamen they employ,regardless of the underlying theory of liability.binding precedent makes clear,however,that neither fela nor the jones act has such a broad sweep.see gottshall,at.fela does not make the employer the insurer of the safety of his employees while they are on duty.the basis of his liability is his negligence,not the fact that injuries occur.quotation marks and citation omitted lancaster,at rejecting proposed rule that fela employers should be liable without regard to traditional limitations on respondeat superior accord hernandez,at t he supreme court has cautioned that the fela,and derivatively the jones act,is not to be interpreted as a workers compensation statute and that the unmodified negligence principles are to be applied as informed by the common law.
the plaintiffs cite a number of cases in support of their proposed rule,but only two bear discussion.first,the plaintiffs offer wilson for the proposition that this court has dispensed with the employer business interest requirement in favor of an enterprise liability theory purportedly favored by congress.in wilson,we applied of the restatement second of agency to determine whether the tortfeasor acts were within the scope of employment.see wilson,at.in a footnote,we noted that a number of courts had adopted the restatement approach in fela cases and also that there was some indication that congress intended to impose enterprise liability in fela cases.id.at.it is this dicta that the plaintiffs offer in support of the view that wilson endorses their proposed broad theory of vicarious liability.
we did not,however,decide wilson on the basis of commentary regarding enterprise liability.indeed,we expressly indicated that,t o define scope of employment,a federal court should apply common law principles,as interpreted by other federal courts.id.at citations omitted.we merely recognized that the factors in were a useful guide in applying the common law,and we concluded that genuine issues of fact remained precluding summary judgment in that case.see id.at.we did not,by application of,endorse a rule abrogating the common law requirement that an employee acts must be within the scope of employment before liability may be imputed to the employer.in fact,we expressly noted that i f the employee only had a personal purpose,it would be unusual that the acts would satisfy fela scope of employment requirement.see id.at.the case entailed an unremarkable application of and did not take the radical step of dispensing altogether with common law principles of respondeat,in any event,are not inconsistent with the factors enumerated in.thus,as the defendants observe,wilson does considerably less than the plaintiffs claim.
the plaintiffs also cite baker baltimore ohio railroad,cir.in baker,the court declined to apply a scope of employment test at all,concluding that u nder the fela,a defendant liability for the negligence of its servants is not restricted by the common law doctrine of respondeat superior.id.at.the court also expressed its view that i t is unnecessary to show that employees were negligent while performing a particular act in furtherance of their master business,as this common law term has been interpreted.id.citation omitted.moreover,in a footnote,the court noted in dicta its view that fela is a liberal rule and suggested that even if a scope of employment test might apply,it might extend liability to the railroad for all negligent acts by employees which occur during the hours of the employee working day on the employer premises.id.at.this dicta,of course,echoes the rule proposed by the plaintiffs.
we are unpersuaded,however,by the analysis and dicta in baker.while it may be true that fela and,by implication,the jones act was intended to be a liberal rule,it is also true that we are not to ignore the statutes clear terms or common law principles in the absence of statutory language indicating otherwise.gottshall,at.as we indicated in lancaster,the baker court read fela statutory language and liberal purpose too broadly in the respondeat superior context,and we decline to follow suit.see lancaster,at t he purpose of fela was not to broaden the doctrine of respondeat superior,least of all in intentional tort cases it was to eliminate the rule.although fela dispenses with certain common law defenses,nothing in its express terms or the terms of the jones act indicates congress intent that we set aside common law principles of respondeat superior,and most courts have continued to apply traditional rules of respondeat superior for both negligence and intentional tort cases.id.collecting authority and rejecting the baker interpretation.
we shall do likewise here and apply the traditional scope of employment test.the plaintiffs must therefore show that barrett acted in furtherance of the ship business before central marine may be held vicariously liable for his actions,whether one characterizes the as negligence or as an intentional tort.the plaintiffs have not done so,and we believe no reasonable jury could conclude otherwise.
as we have stated,regardless of how individual courts have stated the tests,in order for an activity to qualify as being within the scope of employment,it must be a necessary incident of the day work or be essential to the performance of the work.rogers chi.trans,cir.by no stretch can it be said that barrett act of cracking sobieski neck satisfies the latter requirements.barrett was a mate assistant,and his official duties were to work on deck,steer the ship,and act as a lookout.it is undisputed that barrett had no express authorization to crack anyone neck,nor was such part of his official duties.
the plaintiffs offer no evidence to the contrary,but instead argue that t he focus of the inquiry,thus,is whether the negligent had a purpose,in part,to further the employer interests.the plaintiffs point to barrett deposition testimony,in which he testified that he had cracked the necks of several crewmen over the years to help them feel better and,presumably,work better.the plaintiffs therefore contend that barrett subjective belief that he was helping sobieski brings the within the scope of employment because it was somehow beneficial to the operation of the ship.
we disagree.to the extent barrett subjective beliefs may be relevant to the scope of employment inquiry,those beliefs should be reasonable and the resulting action somehow related to the ship business.in rogers,for example,we held that a railroad employee who was injured while jogging off duty on company property was not acting in the scope of employment.we concluded that the plaintiff subjective belief that jogging furthered his employer business was not reasonable,and thus the act of jogging was not within the scope of his employment.see rogers,at if plaintiff thought he was doing something which was necessary for or in the benefit of the railroad,this belief was not reasonable.jogging benefits an employer in such an indirect and tangential way that plaintiff can not be said to have been acting within the scope of employment.we distinguished cases in which certain activities,such as sleeping or eating,were found to be within the scope of employment because those activities were essential to acceptable work performance.see id.at collecting authority.in the absence of a company directive suggesting otherwise,we concluded that exercise was not a necessary incident to the plaintiff job duties.see id.at.
as far as barrett subjective belief and his subsequent action,the same reasoning applies here.there simply is no evidence that the defendant knew of or condoned barrett massages,no matter how they may have been.in addition,we fail to see how barrett was in any sense a necessary incident to the performance of his duties,regardless of what barrett may have thought.moreover,any conceivable benefit to central marine by the is even more tangential than the jogging was to the employer in rogers.instead,barrett altruistic tractioning of
