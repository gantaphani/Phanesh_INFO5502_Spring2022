this case comes to us on a petition for writ of review following the workers compensation appeals board reversal of a workers compensation judge award of benefits to an injured worker,avelino lópez.the board concluded that the worker should receive greater benefits because prior law applied in the worker case.the question before us is whether the permanent disability rating of the worker should be based on the permanent disability rating schedule pdrs or the version of the pdrs.we conclude that the pdrs applies and therefore annul the board opinion and decision.
facts and procedural background 
avelino lópez sustained a workplace injury to his left hand on september,that was compensable under the workers compensation system.he received temporary and total disability payments from september,through march.following an examination on january,a physician who specializes in hand treatment determined,in an agreed medical examiner report,that lópez was permanent and stationary as of that date.the date for beginning permanent disability payments was agreed to be march.
the parties disagreed whether the permanent disability described in the examining physician report should be rated under the pdrs or the version.they did agree,however,that the rating would be percent under the schedule and nine percent under the schedule.
on july,following a trial before a workers compensation judge,the judge ruled that the pdrs applied and that lópez qualified for a nine percent permanent disability.the judge explained in his opinion on decision that b ased upon the clear meaning of labor code section,subdivision d,the pdrs is to apply to claims arising before january,unless they meet certain exceptions.in this case,there is no comprehensive report prepared prior to january,nor a report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability or any evidence that the employer was required to issue a labor code section notice to the injured worker prior to january,therefore,the new schedule applies to this case.the workers compensation judge awarded lópez,payable at per week.
lópez filed a petition for reconsideration with the workers compensation appeals board that he dated july.the filestamp in the record is too faint for us to be able to discern the filing date.he urged the board to award him the percent permanent disability rating to which he would be entitled under the pdrs.the board granted the petition and,on november,issued a divided opinion and decision that reversed the workers compensation judge decision.the majority held that the pdrs should apply,and awarded lópez,payable at per week.the majority stated from our reading of labor code section,subdivision a,there is no obligation to provide any notice unless temporary disability benefits are payable.thus,as soon as temporary disability payments commence,the duty to give section,subdivision a notice comes into existence.we distinguish here between when the duty arises and when the duty is required to be executed.here,the duty arose when the first payment of temporary disability was made,in september of.the dissenting board member concluded that principles of statutory construction required applying the pdrs.tanimura antle and its insurer petitioned this court for writ of review,and we granted the petition.
statutory background 
on april,the legislature passed a comprehensive reform of the workers compensation laws.citation.among other things,the legislature required a change in the schedule by which permanent disability is rated the schedule was revised and became effective on january,vera workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,fns.omitted.
implementing one of the reforms,labor code section,subdivision d,now provides the schedule shall promote consistency,uniformity,and objectivity.the schedule and any amendment thereto or revision thereof shall apply prospectively and shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule,amendment or revision,as the fact may be.for compensable claims arising before january,the new schedule shall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities when there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker.
in turn,labor code section provides in relevant part a together with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity,the employer shall provide the employee one of the following notice either that no permanent disability indemnity will be paid because the employer alleges the employee has no permanent impairment or limitations resulting from the injury or notice of the amount of permanent disability indemnity determined by the employer to be payable notice that permanent disability indemnity may be or is payable,but that the amount can not be determined because the employee medical condition is not yet permanent and stationary 
discussion 
the question before us concerns the meaning and application of labor code sections,subdivision d,and.this is a purely legal question the parties do not dispute the underlying facts.we apply a de novo standard of review when interpreting a statute,but we also apply the principle that the wcab statutory construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.vera workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.
as noted,the workers compensation judge interpreted labor code section,subdivision d as requiring one of three statutorily enumerated conditions to exist in order for lópez to be compensated for his workplace injury under the pdrs.the judge concluded that the pdrs applied to the case instead of the pdrs because none of the three conditions existed.specifically,before the key date of january,neither a comprehensive report nor a report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability was issued,and there was no evidence that the employer was required to issue a notice under labor code section to lópez,a notice that advises the employee of the employer position regarding the entitlement to permanent disability at the time the last payment of temporary disability is made.costco wholesale workers comp.appeals bd.th,d costco.a divided workers compensation appeals board found that there was evidence that tanimura antle incurred a duty to issue notice under labor code section,subdivision a,in,so the third condition existed and lópez must be compensated under the pdrs.
since this court granted the employer writ petition,several published appellate decisions have disagreed with the conclusion of the majority of the board herein.we agree with them.
costco refutes the reasoning of the workers compensation appeals board in this case that an employer was required to give notice under section before january,because the duty to provide such notice arises when temporary disability payments are commenced rather than when they are terminated.costco,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.while labor code section,subdivision d is not a model of linguistic clarity,its intent is clear.the intent is to apply the rating schedule in effect on the date of injury to injuries suffered prior to in only three circumstances when a comprehensive report issued prior to indicates permanent disability,when a report from a treating physician issued prior to indicates permanent disability,and when an employer has been required to give notice under section prior to concerning its intentions regarding payment of permanent disability benefits.this interpretation supports the legislative goal of bringing as many cases as possible under the new workers compensation law.id.at,d.

in sum,although lópez injury occurred on september,before the pdrs was adopted,the intent of labor code section,subdivision d,is to req
