this appeal asks us to decide whether a workers compensation carrier can take a credit under section of the workers compensation law against the settlement proceeds of a civil rights lawsuit brought by a recipient of worker compensation benefits against her employer and coemployees for injuries arising from the same incident.in light of the terms of the settlement in this case,we conclude that the carrier is entitled to offset the full amount of the settlement proceeds.
in late,claimant beth was employed at the cass residential center,a secure juvenile detention facility operated by the state of new york office of children family services ocfs in rensselaerville,new york see executive law article family court act article.beth was hired by ocfs as a youth division aide and was assigned to work in the kitchen,a male resident,was given kitchen duty as part of a facility work program.on december,when momentarily stepped away from the dining room,beth confiscated a notebook that he had brought with him to the kitchen.according to beth,she took away the notebook because had told her that he was writing notes about her of a sexual nature,and had made crude,sexually explicit gestures.she gave the notebook to the youth division aide on duty,and threw a fit when he discovered this.after this incident,beth claims to have told various supervisors and ocfs employees that she felt unsafe,uncomfortable and fearful of physical and sexual harm from 
on december,at,near the end of her shift,beth was in an office off the kitchen,logging out from work,with her back to the door.accosted beth from behind,taking her by surprise.he choked,punched and raped her at knifepoint.after forcing beth to turn over the keys to her jeep,he abducted her from camp cass.but when stopped in albany to make a phone call at a pay phone,he left beth in the jeep with the keys in the ignition.beth escaped to a local police station where she reported what had happened to her.
as a consequence of attack,beth suffered physical and mental injuries.she made a claim for workers compensation benefits,and by a decision filed on april,the workers compensation law judge wclj adjudged beth to be permanently partially disabled as a result of injuries to her back,head,neck,left hand,right foot and teeth,as well as rape,stress symptoms and consequential low back injury.
in the meantime,on march,beth filed a lawsuit in federal court against ocfs and three supervisory ocfs employees collectively,defendants.she claimed that defendants knew or should have known about history of being assaultive towards women and carrying knives,and the customs practiced by camp cass residents,including misogynistic statements,gestures and conduct.
as a first cause of action,beth alleged in her amended complaint that the individual defendants denied her civil rights pursuant to usc by various omissions in the training and supervision of ocfs camp cass employees,causing her to suffer physical injuries,pain and mental suffering,embarrassment,humiliation and fear,and to incur expenses for medical care,and deprivation of her liberty.as a second cause of action,beth alleged a hostile work environment in violation of the human rights law,executive law et,created by unwelcome sexual comments,threats and contact,which the defendants caused her to endure,resulting in psychological,mental and emotional damages.as a third cause of action,beth alleged that ocfs violated usc e et by failing to investigate and remedy harassing and inappropriate conduct toward her,and as a result she suffered physical,psychological,mental and emotional damages and for a fourth cause of action,again grounded in the state human rights law,she alleged that ocfs had knowledge of harassment of her,inadequately investigated her complaints and so acquiesced in and effectively condoned discriminatory conduct,again causing her to suffer physical,psychological,mental and emotional damages.beth demanded compensatory damages from ocfs and the individual defendants,punitive damages from the individual defendants,attorney fees pursuant to usc and such further relief as the court deemed proper.
in addition to denying the operative allegations of beth complaint,defendants interposed,among other defenses,that the complaint failed to state a cause of action,the individually named defendants were entitled to qualified immunity,beth injuries resulted from an intervening cause,the complaint was barred by the eleventh amendment and,since defendants were not personally involved in the alleged constitutional or statutory violations,there was no liability under usc.
the federal lawsuit was settled by a stipulation and order of discontinuance filed on may,a week after the close of discovery,for the sum of in compensatory damages in full settlement of any and all claims,attorney fees,and costs emphasis added arising from or in any way related to attack on beth v.the stipulation further recited in paragraph that 
t he parties acknowledge that beth claim includes claims for personal injuries of a physical nature and that the entire settlement sum is allocated to her personal physical injuries and the loss of enjoyment of life and emotional response related thereto.the parties further acknowledge that the settlement payment is for personal injuries as set forth in internal revenue code a emphases added.
section a excludes from an individual gross income the amount of any damages other than punitive damages received whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness.
after payments of roughly in attorney fees and to satisfy the new york state crime victims board lien beth netted about from the settlement.by letter dated may,the new york state insurance fund sif,the workers compensation carrier in this case,approved the settlement in so doing,sif waived its lien against the settlement proceeds,but reserved its right under workers compensation law to take a credit against beth future benefits in the amount of her net recovery.sif announced that it would make no additional payments of benefits after september,until this credit was exhausted.
beth protested the of compensation payments at a hearing on october,when the stipulation terms were placed on the record.beth took the position that sif was not entitled to a credit because she sued for damages to compensate a deprivation of civil rights that in her federal lawsuit she alleged discrimination and creation of a hostile work environment,which demonstrates that such constitutional claims are in a different category from those to which wcl is normally directed because insofar as she was allowed to sue her employer without running afoul of wcl exclusivity provision the offset provisions should be treated differently as well and that the credit was intended to prevent a double recovery for wage benefits whereas beth injuries derive in part from violations of civil rights amendments to the united states constitution and the settlement she negotiated involved demands for punitive relief.
sif contended that the settlement resolved a action within the meaning of workers compensation law,entitling it to a credit against future payments for the full amount of beth recovery.citing petterson daystrom,dietrick kemper ins.and hanford plaza packaging,sif espoused the position that 
where the employer coemployees are accused of intentional torts,the has the right to sue these parties,since the workers compensation remedy exclusivity defense does not apply,and to collect workers compensation benefits.thus,as the employer and coemployees are treated as third parties in these case,wcl section applies in order to prevent the from receiving a double recovery.
by decision filed on january,the wclj decided that sif was not entitled to offset the proceeds of a civil rights lawsuit that sought punitive damages.the wclj decision seems to have been informed,in part,by his view that a civil rights lawsuit was not a tort action,or at least was not treated the same as other intentional torts for purposes of section.sif appealed.
in a decision filed on june,the workers compensation board the board found that a suit against an employer is a action within the meaning of workers compensation law nothing bars the board application of section to a claimant recovery in a federal civil rights lawsuit and sif was only entitled to claim a credit against so much of the settlement as compensated beth for the same injuries which were the basis for the award of compensation.finding the record inadequate to apply this last principle,the board returned the case to the trial calendar.the board instructed the parties to produce evidence of how beth net proceeds from her action were allocated between the types of damages sought,and directed the wclj to determine the amount of the net recovery which compensated beth for her established physical and psychological injuries and the medical expenses for those injuries,and make a finding that the carrier is entitled to a credit for that amount pursuant to wcl.
at the hearing on remand,the attorney who represented beth in federal court testified about the nature of that lawsuit and the settlement.he explained that beth came to him to explore her options for bringing an action against her employer,coemployees concerning an event that occurred at camp cass in rensselaerville in which she was first raped and attacked and then kidnapped by one of the residents.he testified that although a number of different causes of action were stated,the primary claim was for the deprivation of her constitutional rights by virtue of the violation of her right to substantive due process and a usc action was the primary claim where the constitutional deprivation was alleged.when asked if the settlement was allocated in any way,the attorney replied 
from the four corners of the document itself you ca really determine that.but the nature of the claim was a constitutional deprivation.she was kidnapped.her liberty interest was compromised as a result of the allegations made.and paragraph ten was very important in the sense that under the internal revenue code if we had strictly a civil rights claim,the award could potentially be taxable.if there is a claim for violation of civil rights and the person has some physical injury,then you can allocate the recovery entirely towards section,which is a provision for pain and suffering clearly beth had physical injury.but if you asking me what the thrust of the claim was,the thrust of the claim was for her the constitutional deprivation,her liberty interest being deprived,the emotional response to the event.the physical injuries were a component,yes.was it a major component no.
he added that wage loss and medical expenses were perhaps a strategic part of the case that he never had to use and,in any event,any such damages would have been backed out from beth gross recovery under the collateral source rule and so meant nothing to her as far as the bottom line.
on,beth attorney was pressed to explain where in the stipulation there was any expression that the payments were made for something other than beth personal injuries.he pointed to the statement in paragraph that beth was being compensated,in part,for loss of enjoyment of life and emotional response,which he attributed to her deprivation of liberty and all the constitutional deprivations that she suffered in the context of this event.
the attorney acknowledged there was no reference in the stipulation to punitive damages,stating w as there a punitive aspect to the settlement and our claim,absolutely.was it characterized in the settlement agreement as punitive damages per se,no.sif did not call any witnesses,but rather submitted a letter from the assistant attorney general who had represented the state in the federal action.this letter simply stated that punitive damages were not involved in the settlement.
in a decision filed on august,the wclj opined that,contrary to the board decision,a lawsuit against an employer and coemployees was not a action within the meaning of section and,in any event,the settlement resolved claims for violation of beth civil and constitutional rights,recovery not included in workers compensation law.sif again appealed.
in a decision filed on december,the board found in sif favor,allowing it to take a credit against the whole of the settlement proceeds.citing petterson and hanford,the board observed that a civil lawsuit against an employer or a person in the same employ for sexual harassment or other intentional tort is a action to which wcl applies.the board also noted that under section,a carrier has a lien on the proceeds of any recovery and turning to the facts,that t he damage award resulting from the settlement was the result of the same injuries arising under the compensation claim.the board went on to suggest there was no distinction between categories of damages that might be encompassed within a claimant settlement anyway,citing section any recovery language and the appellate division decisions in simmons v lawrence county,cdp,dept carrier offset rights apply to any recovery by a claimant in a action with the exception of benefits in lieu of benefits which the insurer would have been obligated to pay and matter of parmelee international paper dept stating that whether the claimant settlement purported to be for pain and suffering was irrelevant in light of the any recovery language.having previously remanded the case for a determination of how the settlement was allocated as to types of damages,the board invoked its wcl continuing jurisdiction to the extent its findings were inconsistent with its prior decision beth appealed.
the appellate division affirmed dept.the court held that w hen a claimant obtains a recovery in a civil action for the same injuries that were the predicate for the workers compensation benefits,the carrier has a lien against any recovery,even where the action is brought against an employer or a coemployee id.at.and here,the appellate division continued,the settlement stipulation and the testimony of beth attorney supplied substantial evidence to support the board conclusion that the injuries for which claimant recovered in the settlement were the same injuries for which workers compensation benefits were awarded id.we granted beth leave to appeal,and now affirm.
workers compensation law provides that an employee injured by the negligence or wrong of another not in the same employ may commence an action against such other.if the employee has received workers compensation benefits,sif or the other entity or person liable for the payment of these benefits 
shall have a lien on the proceeds of any recovery from such other,whether by judgment,settlement or otherwise,after the deduction of the reasonable and necessary expenditures,including attorney fees,incurred in effecting such recovery,to the extent of the total amount of compensation awarded under or provided or estimated for such case and the expenses for medical treatment paid or to be paid by it and to such extent such recovery shall be deemed for the benefit of 
sif or the other entity or person liable for the payment of compensation benefits workers compensation law.concomitantly,section specifies that i f such injured employee shall proceed against such other,sif or the other entity or person liable for the payment of compensation benefits shall contribute only the deficiency,if any,between the amount of the recovery against such person actually collected,and the compensation provided or estimated for such case workers compensation law.
section is referred to as the carrier credit against or right to offset the proceeds of a lawsuit brought pursuant to section.the lien and offset provisions in sections and,respectively,cushion the inflationary impact of the cost of compensation insurance and avoid double recovery by the claimant for the same predicate injury matter of granger urda.additionally,the statute shifts the burden of paying compensation from the carrier or employer to the party actually responsible for the same injury as the settlement of the action matter of murphy new york city police,dept.
beth contends that workers compensation law,the only recoupment provision at issue here since
