factual and procedural summary 
samuel was employed as a security guard by pinkerton.on april,she was injured at work when she slipped and fell on a waxed floor.she injured her back,neck,shoulder,right wrist,right knee and both ankles pinkerton prepared a preprinted document entitled notice to doctor to refer samuel to santa monica bay physicians.the first line simply stated to treating doctor ptp.no physician was named or otherwise identified.the next day,however,chris effimoff of santa monica bay physicians examined samuel.in his report entitled doctor first report of work injury,effimoff diagnosed multiple contusions and sprains.he prescribed pain medication and recommended that she stay at home for two days to rest.samuel was directed to return in three days for further evaluation to determine whether she needed physical therapy.
on may and,samuel received further treatment at santa monica bay physicians,this time from a different physician.samuel was not discharged from treatment.effimoff report was not served on samuel.
samuel retained an attorney.on may,within days of the injury,the attorney sent a letter of representation to pinkerton asking for a change of treating physician to westside wilshire medical group,pursuant to labor code sections or,as applicable all statutory references are to this code.
a week later,on may,pinkerton prepared a preprinted notice to doctor for an appointment at healthworks.this form was similar to the notice to doctor that referred samuel to santa monica bay physicians.the notice does not indicate whether the appointment was in response to samuel request for a change of treating physician.nor does it expressly specify any person or entity as a recipient.it bears the signature of a pinkerton supervisor and the same date as that of samuel appointment at healthworks.at some point,samuel became aware of the appointment.
samuel was examined by mark newman at healthworks on may.in his report based on that examination,entitled doctor first report of occupational illness or injury,newman found samuel complaints to be grossly embellished and that she was permanent and stationary.he discharged her from further treatment and stated she could return to work without restriction.
nevertheless samuel was again examined by newman a week later.in a report dated july,entitled primary treating physician permanent stationary report,newman reiterated that samuel had been discharged from treatment on may and and could return to her full work duties.he found she had no permanent disability.
neither the first nor the report by newman was served on samuel attorney until july,a date subsequent to her examination by a physician she selected,lana geyber.
in a letter to samuel dated may,the pinkerton claims administrator,mary johnson,informed her that she could object to newman findings and was entitled to obtain an expert medical evaluation from a qualified medical examiner.newman report of may,purportedly was attached to that letter.the letter and attached report were not served on samuel attorney of record.
in,johnson telephoned samuel and informed her that newman had discharged her from treatment and that she needed to obtain an expert evaluation.johnson also left a message for samuel attorney informing him of the need to attempt to agree on a medical expert in the event samuel intended to object to newman decision.
on june,samuel was examined by geyber of westside wilshire medical group,the provider she had selected.geyber noted samuel exhibited pain and limited range of motion.she diagnosed samuel as having cervical,lumbar,chest,and right wrist strains and strain to both ankles.she recommended that samuel be treated with muscle relaxing medication,physical therapy,and an ankle brace.
on june,geyber served her report of june,entitled initial primary treating physician examination and report on both pinkerton and on samuel attorney.on june,samuel attorney served geyber report on mary johnson,pinkerton claims administrator.
in september,geyber referred samuel to furman and baybrook,respectively,for neurological and orthopedic consultations.in december,geyber referred samuel to habibi,a neurosurgeon,to be evaluated for surgery.habibi performed surgery on samuel low back in january.
a hearing before the workers compensation judge was held in november to determine whether continuing medical treatment was necessary,and to determine the primary treating physician.samuel was the only witness.at that hearing,pinkerton objected to any evidence from geyber because,it claimed,newman was the primary treating physician.samuel argued that geyber was the primary treating physician.each party claimed the other had failed to comply with the objection requirements of section the issue whether the initial appointment with newman was in response to samuel request for a change of treating physician was not raised.
the judge found geyber was the primary treating physician and,hence,that newman discharge of samuel from treatment had no effect.the judge also found that because samuel needed further treatment,the section issues were moot.
the board granted pinkerton petition for reconsideration.pinkerton asserted it had referred samuel to newman in response to samuel request for a new treating physician.it pointed out that samuel attended the appointment,and argued that it had complied with the service and identification requirements for the primary treating physician contained in former california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b as evidentiary support,it relied on the letter of may,served on samuel,and on the service of samuel attorney with newman reports on july.
the board found that it was not clear that pinkerton had referred samuel to newman in response to her request for a change of treating physician.it also found that neither party had complied with the requirements of former section,subdivision b.in pinkerton case,the ptp designation it had inserted before effimoff name was insufficient identification,and it was not clear that effimoff report had been served on samuel.additionally,neither the notice to the doctor referring samuel to healthworks nor newman first report of injury identified newman as the primary treating physician.samuel had not complied,because it was not clear that pinkerton had been served with geyber report.
the board remanded the matter to the judge to determine whether effimoff was the primary treating physician.
on july,geyber declared samuel permanent and stationary and determined there was no need for immediate further treatment but provided for future treatment as needed.geyber also described significant permanent disability.
following a new hearing in late july,the judge again found that geyber was the primary treating physician,and that effimoff was not because he had not complied with section in that he had failed to identify himself as the primary treating physician and to serve his report.
the judge also found newman was not the primary treating physician.the reasons were that,although samuel received newman may,report along with pinkerton letter of may,that report did not identify newman as the primary treating physician nor had the report been served on samuel attorney of record.
no evidence was presented on the issue of whether the referral to newman was in response to samuel request for change of treating physician.the judge made no finding on that issue.
pinkerton again petitioned for reconsideration on the same issues as before.this time,it asserted that the reference to newm
