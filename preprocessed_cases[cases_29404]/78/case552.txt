on remand,the workers compensation judge wcj awarded barnes one section penalty for delay in making the penalty payment.the wcab issued its own opinion affirming the decision,with one commissioner dissenting.both the wcj and wcab discussed stuart and avalon bay foods but concluded that a penalty assessment was required because the county did not meet its burden of showing that the delay was reasonable.
in this petition,the county argues that the wcab erred because it did not make a specific finding of intentional delay,it did not apply the fair balance test required by stuart,and a penalty in this case would be an excessive fine in violation of the eighth amendment to the united states constitution and article i,section of the california constitution.it also argues that it is immune from a section penalty assessment under government code section.
barnes contends that the wcab correctly imposed the penalty because the county did not meet its burden of explaining the delay and that a penalty is required for unreasonable delay in paying even de minimis sums.
the california applicants attorneys association filed an amicus curiae brief on barnes behalf and the city of los angeles filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of the county.

whether a delay is unreasonable is usually a question of fact,and the court is required to give deference to the wcab finding on the issue.kampner workers comp.appeals bd.d.however,t his court is not bound to accept the board factual findings where they are unreasonable and do not withstand scrutiny when viewed in the light of the entire record,or where on a examination we discern an inequitable result when the entire record is examined for fairness,reasonableness,and proportionality in the overall scheme of the workers compensation law and the purposes sought to be accomplished by that law.chu workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see also henry workers comp.appeals bd.th,d same.

the purpose of the section penalty is twofold.first,the statute provides an incentive to employers and insurance carriers to pay benefits promptly by making delays costly.citations.a second and equally important purpose is to encourage timely payments of compensation to working people to promptly ameliorate economic hardship resulting from the interruption of their employment and concomitant loss of income.stuart,supra,cal th at,d.
in stuart,the supreme court stated that the totality of the circumstances should be considered in determining whether a delay is unreasonable,including such things as the size of the late payment,the length of the delay,and the defendant history of payment.the supreme court noted that it has repeatedly interpreted section as requiring a balancing of the interests of the employee and employer.when penalties are assessed in the workers compensation setting,we have cautioned that the board should proceed with a view toward achieving a fair balance between the right of the employee to prompt payment of compensation benefits,and the avoidance of imposition upon the employer or insurance carrier of harsh and unreasonable penalties.gallamore workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.we have since reiterated this position.christian workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,rhiner workers comp.appeals bd.cal th.stuart,supra,cal th at,d.
