introduction 
in this case,we consider whether the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act the act et excepts internal workers compensation fraud investigations from the limitations period established in section,subdivision d.we conclude it does and affirm the judgment.
background 
the parties do not dispute the relevant facts of this case.on august,stephanie tapia,the coordinator at centinela state prison prison,sent the prison warden,michael smelosky,a memo requesting corrections sergeant moises moya be investigated for workers compensation fraud.in the memo,tapia stated moya had filed a workers compensation claim on may,indicating he injured his right wrist at work when a coworker inadvertently closed it in a door.two days later,a doctor at an industrial healthcare center evaluated moya and diagnosed him with a right wrist contusion.on june,a hand specialist evaluated moya and diagnosed him with a fractured right wrist.as of a result of the injury,moya was unable to work.however,someone subsequently informed tapia that moya was seen working out at a gym and riding around town on his motorcycle in violation of his work restrictions.
accompanying the memo was an anonymous letter alleging moya had actually injured his wrist in an fight rather than at work.the letter stated moya attended an event called battle of the badges.his came to the event with a male friend.enraged,moya started a parking lot brawl with the man.moya injured his hand during the fight,but did not seek medical attention.instead,he waited for an incident to happen at work so he could file a workers compensation claim for his hand injury.
approximately a month after receiving tapia memo,smelosky requested the internal affairs office ia office of the department of corrections and rehabilitation department investigate the allegations.in november the ia office started a criminal investigation into whether moya had committed workers compensation fraud.investigators reviewed hundreds of documents and interviewed numerous witnesses,including the hand specialist who evaluated moya.the hand specialist told investigators moya injury was more consistent with a fight than with a work injury.
a little over a year later,in december,the ia office submitted a report of its investigation to the imperial county district attorney office,which declined to prosecute.two months later,in february,the ia office submitted the report to the san diego county district attorney office.the san diego county district attorney office requested additional investigation,which the ia office completed and provided in june.in july the san diego county district attorney office also declined to prosecute the matter.
meanwhile,in january,the ia office opened an administrative investigation.as part of the administrative investigation,investigators interviewed moya in april about his workers compensation claim and how he injured his wrist.
on august,approximately two years after tapia requested the fraud investigation,the department served moya with a notice of adverse action notice dismissing him from his position for,among other causes,dishonesty under section,subdivision f.as support for the dishonesty charge,the notice alleged moya submitted a workers compensation claim and other documents falsely stating he injured his hand and wrist at work lied to the hand specialist about how he injured his wrist and lied during his interview with investigators about how he injured his wrist.
moya appealed his dismissal to the state personnel board board.he then filed a motion to dismiss the notice,arguing it was barred by the act statute of limitations contained in section,subdivision d.the department countered by arguing section,subdivision d h,of the act provides an exception to the limitations period for investigations into allegations of workers compensation fraud.additionally,the department argued the portion of the notice involving the allegation moya lied during his interview with the ia office was timely.the department also argued the statute of limitations was tolled under section,subdivision d a,because moya conduct was the subject of a criminal investigation.
in january the board issued an order directing the department to provide evidence the limitations period should be tolled under section,subdivision d h.the department submitted two declarations showing it had conducted a criminal investigation into moya conduct,followed by an administrative investigation.
on april,the board issued a written decision finding the notice was and dismissed the action.the board relied on its decision in in re appeal of andrew ruiz spb.ruiz to find that the exception in section,subdivision d a,does not apply to internal criminal investigations.the board relied on the same decision to similarly find the exception in section,subdivision d h,does not apply to internal workers compensation fraud investigations.the department filed a petition for rehearing,which the board denied without comment.
the department petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate,arguing the board committed a clear error of law because section,subdivision d h,plainly created an exception to the limitations period for workers compensation fraud investigations and does not contain any language requiring that the investigations be external rather than internal.the superior court agreed and granted the petition.
discussion 
the sole issue in this case is whether the trial court properly construed section,subdivision d h.t he trial court construction of a statute is purely a question of law and is subject to de novo review on appeal.sulier state personnel bd.th,sulier breslin city and county of san francisco th,breslin.
in construing statutes,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citations.we begin by examining the statutory language because it generally is the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.citation.we give the language its usual and ordinary meaning,and i f there is no ambiguity,then we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citation.if,however,the statutory language is ambiguous,we may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history.citation.ultimately we choose the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the lawmakers,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute.mays city of los angeles cal th,mays.

among the act procedural protections,section,subdivision d generally provides n o punitive action,nor denial of promotion on grounds other than merit,shall be undertaken for any act,omission,or other allegation of misconduct if the investigation of the allegation is not completed within one year of the public agency discovery by a person authorized to initiate an investigation of the allegation of an act,omission,or other misconduct.however,of relevance here,the limitation period does not apply

the department contends the latter exception applies in this case because the investigation at issue involved an allegation of workers compensation fraud by moya.moya contends the exception does no
