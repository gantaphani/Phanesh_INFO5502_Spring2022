in this matter involving workers compensation and an employer subrogation action against an alleged tortfeasor,we construe the notice and consent obligations of labor code sections,and,subdivision a 
we conclude that when an employer fails to adequately notify its employee of its subrogation lawsuit and proposed settlement involving the alleged tortfeasor and fails to obtain the employee consent to the settlement of that suit,and when the settling alleged tortfeasor,prior to settlement,was or reasonably should have been aware of the possibility of the employee claim for damages against the tortfeasor,the alleged tortfeasor can not use the mere settlement and dismissal of the employer subrogation action to bar the employee from maintaining her own action for damages against the alleged tortfeasor,subd.a.the employee action for damages against the alleged tortfeasor,however,must account for any workers compensation benefits paid to the employee,or to be paid,so as to preclude double recovery for the employee and double liability for the tortfeasor.
accordingly,we reverse the summary judgment in favor of the alleged tortfeasor here.

discussion 
the issue in this appeal is whether the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment against employee in favor of the alleged tortfeasor,otis.this issue requires us to construe the notice and consent provisions of sections,and,subdivision a.this presents a question of law based on undisputed facts that we determine independently.reader digest franchise tax bd.th,d.we conclude the trial court erroneously granted summary judgment to otis.
first,some background.
the basic bargain underlying the workers compensation system is that an injured worker forgoes the pursuit of tort damages against her employer in return for an expeditious financial resolution of her workplace injury.shoemaker myers cal d.
the california workers compensation scheme not only fixes the right of an employee who suffers a injury to recover compensation from his or her employer,but also significantly defines the rights of action of both an employee and an employer in the event that a third party is responsible for the employee injury et.these statutory provisions,et are primarily procedural.roe workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.they seek to insure,first,that,regardless of whether it is the employee or the employer who sues the third party,both the employee and the employer recover their due,and,second,that,as far as possible,the third party need defend only one lawsuit.
to these ends,the workers compensation statutes set up procedures which guarantee an employee and an employer notice of each other action,authorize the employee and the employer to intervene in each other lawsuit,provide for mandatory consolidation of separate employee and employer actions,and grant the employee and the employer the right to share in each other judgment or settlement.county of san diego sanfax cal d,sanfax.in this way,employer and employee actions are interchangeable under the workers compensation scheme.ibid.
the statutory scheme of section et is designed to prevent double recovery by an employee or an employer,and to preclude double liability being imposed on a tortfeasor.freightliner th,d sanfax,supra,cal d at,board of administration glover cal d,glover.this statutory scheme is designed to hold the third party liable,as far as possible sanfax,supra,at,in one total action,for all the wrong his tortfeasance brought about citation regardless of whether it is the employee or the employer who brings suit.sanfax,supra,at,italics omitted glover,supra,at.
as we have noted,at issue here are sections,and,subdivision a of the statutory scheme codified in section et.
to set the stage,though,we must begin with section,which provides in relevant part 
the claim of an employee for workers compensation does not affect his or her claim or right of action for all damages proximately resulting from the injury or death against any person other than the employer.any employer who pays,or becomes obligated to pay workers compensation may likewise make a claim or bring an action against the third person.
section pertains to notice regarding employee or employer lawsuits and specifies 
if either the employee or the employer brings an action against such third person,he shall forthwith give to the other a copy of the complaint by personal service or certified mail.proof of such service shall be filed in such action.if the action is brought by either the employer or employee,the other may,at any time before trial on the facts,join as party plaintiff or shall consolidate his action,if brought independently.
here,employer did not serve employee with a copy of its subrogation complaint for negligence against otis,but merely provided a letter to employee,dated june,from the attorney for its workers compensation insurer.this letter stated 
i represent american commercial claims administrators acca in its subrogation against otis elevator.we are representing acca in an attempt to recover the benefits paid to you or on your behalf as a result of the incident on otis elevator which occurred on may.
i am interested to know whether or not you are pursuing a third party action against the elevator company and whether or not you have filed a lawsuit.if you could please provide me with the information to that end i would appreciate it.you can contact me by telephone or by mail at the above address.
about a week later,employee responded to this letter,stating 
in response to you sic request i am undecided at this time if i plan to pursue a third part sic action.it depends on the outcome of my foot and toes.
indisputably,employer did not satisfy the notice requirements of section.it did not serve,either personally or by certified mail,its subrogation complaint on employee.it did not even mention in its june,letter that there was a subrogation complaint or lawsuit.it suggested that employee could pursue an independent action,and it said nothing about the mandatory consolidation of such an action required by section.see carden otto d.carden to satisfy section requires proper notice id.at.since the right to intervene exists up to the time of trial on the facts,proper notice of the trial date is essential.proper and orderly procedure dictates that the notice be a formal one and
