petitioner tennessee consolidated coal tcc appeals a final decision of the benefits review board the board affirming an award to their former employee jack kirk,made pursuant to the black lung benefits act,et.kirk had sought and been denied these benefits three times before,beginning in.tcc claims that kirk fourth,successful,application was untimely.tcc also disputes that kirk showed a material change in condition sufficient to overcome the preclusive effect of the prior denials.finally,tcc argues that even if kirk application could be considered on its merits,the board erred in affirming an award,because kirk respiratory illness was caused by his chronic cigarette habit rather than his employment in the mines we affirm.
jack kirk was born in,and ceased working in a coal mine in due to his increasingly severe respiratory problems the parties have stipulated that kirk worked in the mines for at least years.kirk filed his first claim for benefits in.this was denied because medical evidence showed that kirk was not totally disabled,did not have pneumoconiosis,and such respiratory difficulties as he had were due to his cigarette smoking,a habit pursued for years.at that time,kirk reported some difficulty breathing at night,but indicated that he had sought no medical attention for his problem and that he was still able to work as a miner.over the last two decades,however,there is no dispute that the record reflects a progressive deterioration of kirk condition.
kirk second application for benefits occurred in october,just after he ceased working in any capacity for tcc this application was denied because there was no medical evidence to establish total disability,or pneumoconiosis.in denying the claim,the decision also noted it would not be unusual for people to have respiratory symptoms of the type experienced by kirk if they were smokers.kirk third application for benefits occurred in the year after his previous application had been finally denied,in august.this claim was also denied on the grounds that he had failed to show a material change in condition since his previous denial,he did not show he had pneumoconiosis,did not show that his problems were caused by coal mining,and did not show that he was totally disabled because of a breathing impairment caused by pneumoconiosis.cfr b defining the term totally disabled without reference to causation.
kirk pulmonary test results,attached to the denial of his third application,demonstrated total disability under part regulations.his respiratory function had now declined below the levels specified in b i b.both parties agree that scores showing total disability were obtained.gov t br.at tcc br.at.the rejection of kirk third application did not deny the presence of a breathing impairment constituting total disability as a general matter,but it reiterated the finding that kirk breathing impairment was not due to coal mining or pneumoconiosis.
the current claim for benefits was filed by kirk in march.although kirk respiratory health had worsened by,and his pulmonary capacity was further into the totally disabled range,his claim was initially denied.the reasons given by the district director were lack of total disability due to pneumoconiosis,and no change in material condition.the initial denial,unlike previous denials,did not rely on either the absence of pneumoconiosis or the failure of coal mining to contribute to pneumoconiosis.although the form denial is not explicit,it appears to indicate a summary finding by the district director not inconsistent with the medical evidence that kirk did indeed have pneumoconiosis caused by his coal mining,and that he was totally disabled,but that the two were not causally connected,because the severity of kirk condition arose from his other respiratory ailments.since these other respiratory conditions were not compensable and not caused by coal mining,kirk claim was denied 
kirk sought review before an administrative law judge alj in,and was awarded benefits in.this decision was based on new medical opinions by adcock and soteres,who attributed kirk disability in substantial part to pneumoconiosis.the alj also relied on a diagnosis by gilley,which had implied a similar etiology for kirk problems,but which had not been convincing enough to sustain kirk third,gilley diagnosis had not made an explicit finding of total disability.
tcc appealed the alj decision and,although affirming in large part,the board remanded it in for reconsideration in light of our intervening decision in sharondale ross,cir.this remand was with special reference to whether,under the sharondale standards,kirk fourth application was timely filed and had established a material change in conditions.in,the alj determined that,although kirk had not done any mining work between and,the communication of a new medical opinion to him in march shortly after he filed his fourth application should be deemed the start of the limitations period contained in.the alj also determined that kirk had shown a material change in conditions because adcock and soteres had found in that he was now totally disabled,and kirk third claim had been denied by district director on january,for failure to establish either pneumoconiosis or total disability.since the alj found kirk had proven one of the elements previously adjudicated against him,sharondale,at,he concluded that a material change had been shown.
tcc appealed to the board,which affirmed the alj award in.the board held that the statute of limitations could not begin to run until a medical opinion had been communicated to the miner of a finding of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.it found that neither of gilley and medical opinions had come to that conclusion and that soteres opinion was the first to do so.sharondale had suggested that in order for the statute to begin again,an applicant miner,in addition to receiving a new medical opinion,must work in the coal mines for a substantial period after the denial at.the board concluded that in this case this language was not determinative,and relied on sharondale statement that a claimant must be free to reapply for benefits if his first filing was premature.ibid.the board also affirmed the alj finding that there had been a material change in conditions because the denial of the claim had been based not merely on claimant failure to show any disability was due to pneumoconiosis but on the ground that claimant failed to establish any of the elements of entitlement,including total disability.the board did not discuss kirk pulmonary tests.
tcc now appeals the board decision as erroneous on several grounds.it argues,inter alia,that the board ignored one of the preconditions sharondale imposed for restarting the statute of limitations,that the applicant return to work after the previous denial.tcc also asserts that the alj and the board erred in finding kirk total disability in represented a material change of condition,because kirk was totally disabled well before that time.the claimant is not currently participating in the litigation.the director,however,defends the board interpretation of sharondale,and claims that even if tcc argument regarding total disability is accepted,there was another clear basis for finding a change in condition,based on the new diagnoses of pneumoconiosis.gov t br.at

the timeliness of kirk claim 
claims for black lung benefits are presumptively timely.c.to be timely,the claim must have been filed before three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis is communicated to the miner.f a.since the current claim was filed in march,it is the employer burden to rebut the presumption of timeliness by showing that a medical determination satisfying the statutory definition was communicated to kirk prior to march.if such a showing was made,we could then examine the analysis in sharondale to determine if events following the determination may restart the statute of limitations.see at.
as the alj and board found,tcc has failed to demonstrate that a diagnosis of total disability due to pneumoconiosis was made prior to soteres in.tcc points to the earlier denials,but these do not trigger the statute of limitations and are treated as premature filings not barring later applications.see id.at.tcc also briefly refers to the diagnoses of gilley in and,and adcock course of treatment after,as constituting medical determinations of total disability.tcc br.at.however,adcock notes do not show conclusively that he believed kirk to be totally disabled prior to march,and they certainly do not show a determination that pneumoconiosis was the cause.although gilley did diagnose kirk with the initial stages of pneumoconiosis,he did not label him as totally disabled on that basis or any other.by contrast,the only determination that did arguably label him as totally disabled although not in so many words,the respiratory test submitted as part of his third claim,specifically denied that the disability was due to pneumoconiosis.we have rejected as medical determinations under f communications much more closely resembling the statutory definition than those relied upon by tcc.in clark coal,wl,at cir,we held insufficient as a determination a successful worker compensation claim which relied on a finding that the claimant became permanently and totally disabled as the result of the occupational disease of pneumoconiosis quoting the language of the kentucky worker compensation award.based on the differences in the definitions of terms such as totally disabled between the different types of claims,we held that the worker compensation finding did not start the running of the statute.although clark is persuasive rather than precedential,given the far lower specificity of the putative determinations offered by tcc,they also must be considered incapable of starting the f clock.
tcc also attempts to fall back on general principles of accrual by arguing that kirk had notice of his injury,and that kirk applications dating back to reflect his belief that he was disabled due to pneumoconiosis at that time.tcc,at.however,the statute does not limit actions to three years after they accrue or use similar general language it relies on the far more explicit trigger of the reasoned opinion of a medical professional.therefore,tcc use of cases discussing general principles of accrual such as united states kubrick,d,is mistaken.likewise,the statute makes what kirk believes about his condition irrelevant to the initiation of the limitations clock.to see the fallacy of tcc position,one has only to note that if mere application for benefits were enough to start the clock running,our entire discussion of premature filing in sharondale would have been pointless,and the language in f largely surplusage in the rule advocated by the employer,there are no premature unwise ones that may foreclose compensation for pneumoconiosis.the employer having failed to rebut the presumption of timeliness,the board and the alj did not legally err in so holding.
tcc complains that our acceptance of kirk claim as timely implies it will never know when its liability for a particular miner will cease,defeating the purposes of a statute of repose.they argue,essentially,that a miner will be able to infinitely file claim after claim until they find a pliant alj and a compliant physician.lisa lee mines director,owcp,cir en banc luttig,dissenting.this is less problematic than tcc asserts.the limitations clock begins to tick the first time that a miner is told by a physician that he is totally disabled by pneumoconiosis.this clock is not stopped by the resolution of the miner claim or claims,and,pursuant to sharondale,the clock may only be turned back if the miner returns to the mines after a denial of benefits.there is thus a distinction between premature claims that are unsupported by a medical determination,like kirk,and claims,and those claims that come with or acquire such support.medically supported claims,even if ultimately deemed premature because the weight of the evidence does not support the elements of the miner claim,are effective to begin the statutory period three years after such a determination,a miner who has not subsequently worked in the mines will be unable to file any further claims against his employer,although,of course,he may continue to pursue pending claims.
evidence for a material change in kirk condition 
kirk fourth claim occurred more than one year after the denial of his previous claim,and therefore was subject to denial unless kirk could show there had been a material change in conditions.d.to assess whether a material change is established,the alj must consider all of the new medical evidence obtained after the previous denial,both favorable and unfavorable,and determine whether the miner has proven at least one of the elements of entitlement previously adjudicated against him.sharondale,at.if the miner establishes the existence of that element,he has demonstrated a material change as a matter of law,and the alj must then consider whether all of the record evidence,including that submitted with the previous claim,supports a finding of entitlement to benefits.ibid.
tcc argues that,in addition to the above requirements,the new medical evidence must be compared with the preexisting medical evidence on the same issue.it claims that the alj and the board failed to do this with regard to the evidence on total disability,and if they had done so,they would have discovered that pulmonary measures also showed total disability.thus,on this issue,tcc asserts,there was no change in condition and res judicata can not be avoided on the ground actually used by the alj and the board.
as the employer correctly points out,if the alj need only assess whether the new medical evidence proved an element previously held to have been missing,it would allow the relitigation of cases in which the new and old medical evidence were essentially the same,but in which there had been a legal error in the previous adjudication.in sharondale,we held such situations were correctable within the time period after a denial,but that after this point,a claimant is not entitled to benefits simply because his claim should have been granted.at.in order to maintain this limitation in favor of finality,and in order to measure a change in conditions the alj must compare the sum of the new evidence with the sum of the earlier evidence on which the denial of the claim had been premised.a material change exists only if the new evidence both establishes the element and is substantially more supportive of claimant see id.at despite alj finding that new evidence established the existence of pneumoconiosis,remanding for an alj determination of how the later differ qualitatively from those submitted in.
the alj in this case made a legal error similar to that of the judge in sharondale by failing to show that,on the element selected to show a material change,there was in fact a worsening of claimant condition.in addition,the alj erred by misidentifying the elements of entitlement actually adjudicated against kirk.the alj finding on the current existence of total disability was not directly responsive to the key holding of the denial,that kirk had failed to show total disability due to pneumoconiosis emphasis added.if this is deemed the element,then the alj failed to address that element.if,on the other hand,the element under consideration was total disability the alj apparently there is evidence acknowledged by all parties that kirk was already totally disabled in,and there could have been no material change in this condition 
the director asserts nonetheless that there is substantial evidence t
