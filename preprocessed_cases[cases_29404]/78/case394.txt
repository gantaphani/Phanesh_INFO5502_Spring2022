under labor code section,the employer of an injured employee is entitled to a credit against the employer liability for future workers compensation benefits out of any recovery the employee receives for his injury,either by settlement or after judgment,from a third party tortfeasor.
in this case,petitioner lance baur,a police officer employed by respondent city of stockton the city,was injured on the job during an altercation with suspect richard thomas beck.the city provided baur workers compensation benefits.baur then filed a lawsuit against beck,but beck insurance company was insolvent.as a result,baur settled his lawsuit with the california insurance guarantee association ciga the city then claimed a credit pursuant to labor code section,up to the amount of the net settlement,against its liability for future workers compensation benefits.a workers compensation administrative law judge granted the credit.
baur argues to this court that since ciga is not permitted to pay for claims covered by other insurance,subd.a,subd.c,it was improper to grant the city a credit under labor code section against its liability for future workers compensation benefits resulting from baur injuries.
baur reasoning appears to be as follows a judgment or settlement paid by a solvent insurer can include money for future medical costs which are covered by workers compensation,and thus applying the credit in that circumstance simply requires the employee to pay for future medical costs with money received for that purpose.when ciga is involved,however,a judgment or settlement paid by ciga can not include future medical costs because those costs are covered by workers compensation.thus,applying the credit would require the employee to pay for future medical costs with money received for an entirely different purpose,such as to compensate for pain and suffering.in baur view,this essentially requires ciga to indirectly pay for future medical costs in violation of the insurance code provisions governing ciga.
baur is partially correct.applying the labor code section credit to a settlement or judgment paid by ciga will require the employee to pay for future medical costs with money received from ciga for another purpose.as we will explain,however,this result does not violate the governing insurance code provisions,and it is compelled by the plain language of section,which mandates a credit against any recovery.
factual and procedural background 
officer baur was employed by the city in august when he was injured on the job by suspect beck.as a result of baur injuries,the city provided baur with in workers compensation benefits.
baur then filed a civil lawsuit against beck,and the city filed a lien in the lawsuit,seeking reimbursement for workers compensation benefits in the amount of.
beck insurance carrier,vesta fire insurance company vesta,became insolvent,so ciga stepped in on behalf of vesta.in settlement of the lawsuit,ciga agreed to pay to baur,and the city agreed to release its lien 
in light of the settlement,the city advised baur that it was entitled to a credit against its liability for future workers compensation benefits up to.
baur objected to the credit,claiming the city has no credit rights in this matter for the same reasons it has no lien rights.specifically,baur asserted that the credit was not allowed because the insurance code prohibits subrogation on a settlement paid by ciga.
the workers compensation administrative law judge held that the labor code specifically allowed the credit,finding that ciga is not involved nor a party to this workers compensation action.the judge calculated the credit to which the city was entitled after costs and attorney fees were deducted from the recovery from ciga was.
baur sought reconsideration by the workers compensation appeals board.it denied reconsideration,adopting the reasoning of the judge.
baur petitioned this court for a writ of review.we issued the writ to determine the legality of the credit awarded here.
discussion 
labor code section grants an employer the right to a credit against its liability for compensation as follows the appeals board is empowered to and shall allow,as a credit to the employer to be applied against his liability for compensation,such amount of any recovery by the employee for his injury,either by settlement or after judgment,as has not theretofore been applied to the payment of expenses or attorneys fees,pursuant to the provisions of sections,and of this code,or has not been applied to reimburse the employer.
here,part of baur recovery for his injuries included the from ciga for settlement of his lawsuit against beck.this qualifies as any recovery by the employee for his injury including by settlement.under the plain language of labor code section,then,the city was entitled to a credit against its liability for future workers compensation benefits up to the amount of the claim ciga paid minus attorney fees and costs.
notwithstanding this analysis,baur persists that the credit provision of labor code section should not apply to ciga.he explains that in reaching the settlement,ciga valued the case at approximately,and the it was agreeing to pay was only for amounts not covered by other insurance.baur contends that since the could not include future medical costs,which is the responsibility of workers compensation,the credit should not be allowed.even accepting the factual premise of baur argument,the plain language of labor code section defeats that argument.
assume that ciga structured the settlement to explicitly state the it was going to pay baur was only for general damages,pain and suffering,something not covered by workers compensation insurance.after costs and attorney fees,baur would receive approximately.would the city still be entitled to a credit for this that it could apply to future medical costs,where the money originally came from ciga and was for something pain and suffering that workers compensation would never cover yes,because labor code section speaks broadly in terms of any recovery.specifically,it grants the city a credit for any recovery by baur for his injury that he received by way of settlement.this means the city is entitled to a credit whether the tortfeasor insurer was a solvent company or ciga and whether the recovery was for general or special damages.the effect of this credit provision is to reduce the cost to the workers compensation system by making the employee apply any net recovery to pay for future medical costs tied to his injury.
our interpretation of labor code section is consistent with that of the workers compensation appeals board,which spoke to this issue over two decades ago in moreno workers compensation appeals board.cases moreno there,a truck driver was fatally injured while employed by a corporation insured by fremont indemnity company fremont.fremont awarded moreno wife in death benefits.the wife then filed a action against the owner of the truck driven by her husband at the time he was injured.the third party insurer was insolvent,so ciga stepped in to discharge the insurer liabilities.the wife and ciga settled the action,and fremont applied for a credit for workers compensation benefits paid.the workers compensation administrative law judge granted the credit,and the workers compensation appeals board denied the wife petition for reconsideration,adopting the report of the judge.the wife unsuccessfully sought a writ of review,contending that the insurance code precluded the credit.the judge explained that labor code section provided a basis for the credit that was not diminished or extinguished by the insurance code.strictly speaking,the assertion of a credit does not involve a disbursement of funds and as such is not contemplated by the insurance code.moreno,at.
despite moreno,which reflects the policy of the workers compensation appeals board since at least,and the plain language of the labor code,baur argues for a different result when the insurer is ciga.specifically,he notes that as an insurer of last resort reynolds california ins.guarantee d,d,ciga is required to pay only covered claims,subd.a,which exclude claims for s
