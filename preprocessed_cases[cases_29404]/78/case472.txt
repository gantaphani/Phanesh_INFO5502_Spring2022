in,the legislature enacted substantial changes in workers compensation law.the legislative vehicle for these changes was senate bill reg.sess.bill,enacted as an urgency measure on april.most of the legislation was effective immediately,but the portion at issue in this case,relating to medical evaluation and reporting when the employee is represented by counsel,is only operative for injuries occurring on or after january.
under the former version of labor code section a represented employee and his or her employer could each select a reporting medical evaluator when compensability of industrial injury was disputed.if liability was admitted by the employer and the dispute involved other issues,the parties were required to attempt selection of an agreed medical evaluator,and if unsuccessful,each side was entitled to select its own reporting medical evaluator under the former version of section or.
bill imposed a new procedure to resolve these disputes,but with limitations in its application.under this procedure,the represented employee and employer are required to attempt to reach agreement on a reporting medical evaluator.but if they are unsuccessful,either party may ask the administrative director of the division of workers compensation to assign the names of three possible reporting medical evaluators for the case.each side is permitted to strike one,and the one remaining becomes the reporting medical evaluator.if a party does not timely choose to exercise the right to strike a name,the other party is entitled to choose the evaluator from among the three names.
there is a significant limitation to this new procedure,which is at the core of the present dispute.section,subdivision a,provides whenever a comprehensive medical evaluation is required to resolve any dispute arising out of an injury or a claimed injury occurring on or after january,and the employee is represented by an attorney,the evaluation shall be obtained only as provided in this section.
the issue before us is what procedure,if any,applies where the employee is represented and the injury occurred before january.the statute does not spell out the answer.
lourdes nunez,the petitioner and represented employee in this case,takes the position that the new medical evaluation and reporting procedure applies to her industrial injury of july,notwithstanding the provision limiting its application to cases where the date of injury is subsequent to.assoluto,her employer and the respondent in this case,argues that the former procedure applies in this situation.the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj in this case agreed with assoluto and,more importantly,this also is the position taken by the workers compensation appeals board board in an earlier published decision,and implicitly in this case as shown by its decision not to remove this case to itself.
we believe the board has the better of the argument.we are led to that position by the illogic of allowing a vacuum in which the employer would have no right to have a medical evaluation performed,the plain language of the new statute,which confines its application in represented cases to injuries occurring after,and by deference to the board,a constitutional agency,which is charged with construction and application of workers compensation law and administration of the workers compensation system.
for these reasons,as we shall explain,we shall affirm the decision of the board.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner,lourdes nunez,claimed that she sustained injuries from a fall while working for assoluto on july.assoluto provided workers compensation benefits,including medical treatment,temporary disability indemnity and vocational rehabilitation.when assoluto objected to continuing medical treatment and disability and the parties could not agree on a physician to conduct a medical evaluation,assoluto arranged for nunez to be evaluated by richard zapanta,under the procedure of former section or.
in a workers compensation form answer served in response to nunez claim,assoluto placed an x on the line for denial of the july,industrial injury.however,assoluto qualified its denial on the adjacent line by adding the words nature and extent.assoluto also scheduled a reevaluation with zapanta for january,which nunez did not attend.
on january,assoluto served by mail a petition for order compelling attendance at medical examination.assoluto petition alleged that nunez had failed to attend the january,evaluation with zapanta.the petition included a proposed order to be signed by the wcj.the order compelled nunez to attend a rescheduled evaluation,and for suspension of proceedings for the collection of compensation under section should nunez not attend.
on january,assoluto submitted its petition and proposed order to the wcj,utilizing the board procedure.the wcj signed the proposed order the same day,but lined out the warning that failure to attend the ordered evaluation would bar disability payments under section.
nunez filed a timely petition for reconsideration or removal she contended that assoluto denied industrial injury,so that the medical evaluator should be selected under sections and.
the wcj reported to the board that the medical evaluation procedure of former section applies,based on simi foods,simi.simi is an en banc decision in which the board granted removal and the employer petition to compel a defense medical evaluation for a admitted injury under former section.the board reasoned that the legislature created a new procedure for obtaining reports for injuries on or after january,but it did not retain any procedure for injuries before january.nevertheless,former section applies where the employee is represented and the date of injury occurred prior to january.the board relied on the rationale of godinez buffets,in which it applied former section to find an appeal of a rehabilitation unit decision timely,since section,subdivision c,which was repealed in and reenacted under bill,expressly refers to former sections and.
the wcj also recommended against removal to the board because nunez was not substantially prejudiced or irreparably harmed.the wcj concluded that nunez was required to attend a medical examination under section a decision on whether the resulting examining physician report is admissible could be deferred until trial.
the board dismissed nunez petition for reconsideration and denied her request for removal.
in her petition for writ of review,nunez challenges the board rulings and argues that since assoluto denied industrial injury and bill repealed former section,sections and apply.she argues further that the wcj unauthorized order of a medical evaluator chosen solely by assoluto results in substantial prejudice or irreparable harm,and deprives her of the substantial right to participate in the selection of the medical evaluator.nunez also claims that she was denied due process,since there was no notice or opportunity to respond to assoluto petition or ex parte appearance before the wcj.
assoluto answers that the industrial injury is admitted and nunez is being reevaluated under former section,which applies under simi.
discussion 
generally,factual findings that are supported by substantial evidence are affirmed upon review we review governing statutes de novo,but we accord considerable weight to the board interpretation and application of workers compensation law 
in interpreting and applying legislation de novo,we first determine the legislature intent from the plain or ordinary meaning of the statutory language,unless the language is uncertain or ambiguous if the statutory language is uncertain,ambiguous or conflicting,the statute is interpreted consistent with its purpose and the statutory scheme,using rules of construction or legislative history to implement the legislature intent 
nunez contends that assoluto form answer denied compensability of the industrial injury,and former section upon which the wcj relied was repealed by bill.she argues that the medical evaluation and reporting procedure of section is applicable because section expressly applies to disputes over the compensability of any inj
