background 
jake liuzza,now deceased,worked as a longshoreman for numerous employers between and.during this time period it is alleged that he was exposed to asbestos.he voluntarily retired in.in may,he was diagnosed as having squamous cell carcinoma,a malignant lung cancer.later that month,a left upper pulmonary lobectomy was performed.the cancer reappeared in august of,and a second resection was performed.he died on september.subsequently,liuzza widow,rosemary liuzza widow,filed a claim under the lhwca,seeking death benefits as well as disability benefits on behalf of the decedent.
the alj found that the widow had established a causal relationship between liuzza employment and his lung cancer.the alj also determined that liuzza had been totally disabled from may,through the date of his death on september.accordingly,the alj awarded permanent partial disability compensation based upon a one hundred percent impairment for the relevant time period pursuant to c,death benefits pursuant to,and funeral expenses.
smith appealed,arguing that the alj erred in concluding that it was the responsible employer,that the widow had established a causal relationship between the employment and the lung cancer,and that liuzza had been totally disabled.the brb vacated the finding with respect to the extent of liuzza disability prior to his death and remanded the case for reconsideration of the extent of impairment pursuant to the american medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment ed.the brb affirmed the decision in all other respects.
on remand,the alj found that the decedent was not entitled to any permanent partial disability benefits from june,through july,but was entitled to compensation benefits based on a percent impairment rating from may,to may,and from july,until his death.the alj rejected.smith claim that it was entitled to an offset of overpayment of disability benefits already paid against death benefits it owed the widow.the brb affirmed the alj decision and order on remand.smith now petitions this court for review of the brb decisions.

denial of offset for overpayment under j 
as previously set forth.smith paid disability benefits erroneously awarded by the alj initial decision and order.relying on j.smith challenges the alj denial of its request to offset against the death benefits due to the widow any overpayment of the employee disability benefits.this appears to be a question of first impression.
like other workers compensation programs,the lhwca represents a compromise between the interests of injured workers,who receive a certain and immediate recovery,and the interests of employers and insurers,who in turn receive definite and lower limits on potential liability than would have been applicable in tort actions for damages.ceres gulf cooper,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.with respect to reimbursement,we have explained that the lhwca does not provide a basis upon which an employer may recover overpayments directly from the employee.id.recovery of any overpayment can only be an offset against future lhwca compensation.id.
in answering any statutory question,we begin with the language of the statute itself.united states ron pair enterprises,d.section j is entitled reimbursement for advance payments,and provides that if the employer has made advance payments of compensation,he shall be entitled to be reimbursed out of any unpaid installment or installments of compensation due.
in denying.smith request for offset of the overpayment,the alj cited our decision in ceres gulf,at,and ruled that there was no statutory basis for such an offset because the claims were separate.smith correctly contends that the primary issue in ceres gulf was whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction for an original action by an employer to recover advance payments made to its former employee under the lwhca.as previously indicated,in ceres gulf we explained that because congress permitted recovery only as an offset against future benefits in the statutory provisions of the lhwca,we should not imply a federal remedy for reimbursement.at.ceres gulf,however,does not address the issue joined in this case,which is whether disability compensation may be credited against death benefits.smith cites no fifth circuit precedent or any other circuit for that matter in support of its argument 
on the other hand,the director of the office of workers compensation programs,department of labor director,relying on circuit precedent,has filed a brief arguing that j does not provide a basis for.smith to be reimbursed for its overpayment of liuzza disability payments by collecting out of unpaid installments of the widow death benefits.we afford deference to the director interpretations of the lhwca and the amount of deference depends upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,if lacking power to control.pool,at.here,we are persuaded by the director reasoning that the brb did not err in denying.smith request for reimbursement pursuant to j.
the director propounds two principal arguments in support of its position.first,it argues that the plain language of j forecloses reimbursement.second,the director argues that interpreting j to be claim specific is consistent with caselaw interpreting the lhwca.
with respect to the former argument,the director asserts that the overpayments of compensation for which.smith seeks reimbursement were made in satisfaction of a compensation order issued by the alj,thereby not in advance of that order as indicated by the language of j section j,however,does not specify the event to which the payments are made in advance.additionally,the director states that neither the lhwca nor the regulations define the phrase advance payments of compensation.
the canons of statutory construction dictate that when construing a statute,the court should give words their ordinary meaning and should not render as meaningless the language of the statute.white black,cir citation omitted.the director asserts that the word advance is commonly understood to indicate that the payments must take place prior to a specific event.advance payments are defined as payments made in anticipation of a contingent or fixed future liability or obligation.black law dictionary ed.
if advance payments included payments made after an award was ordered,that would
