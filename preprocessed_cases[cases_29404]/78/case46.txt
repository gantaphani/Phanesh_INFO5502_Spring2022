opinion of the court 
marmon coal company and its carrier collectively,marmon petition for review of a decision by the benefits review board the board of the department of labor the dol,which confirmed an award of survivors benefits to ethel eckman under the black lung benefits act the blba,et,as amended by the patient protection and affordable care act the aca,stat.for the reasons stated below,we will deny the petition for review.
statutory background 
the blba provides coal miners and their surviving dependents with a means to obtain benefits in compensation for the disabling effects of pneumoconiosis,black lung disease.there have been several changes in the law with respect to survivors benefits over the past years.congress first provided benefits to surviving dependents of coal miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis through the federal coal mine health and safety act of the fcmhsa,et.in,congress amended the fcmhsa and title iv of the act as the blba.the blba has been amended numerous times since its original enactment until,a deceased miner dependents could obtain survivors benefits under the blba by showing that the miner death was substantially caused by pneumoconiosis or by merely showing that the miner had been awarded benefits during his lifetime.thus,surviving dependents were entitled to benefits automatically if the miner had been awarded benefits during his lifetime,even if pneumoconiosis played no role in the miner death see a.
in,due to a soaring increase in the number of claims for benefits under the blba,congress prospectively eliminated the automatic entitlement to benefits for surviving dependents.see black lung benefits amendments of,stat.instead,after january,surviving dependents could receive benefits only after proving that pneumoconiosis substantially contributed to the miner death.
the dol regulations pertaining to the blba,as amended in,distinguish between survivors previously filed claims and survivors subsequent claims.d.a subsequent claim is a claim filed more than one year after the effective date of a final order denying a claim previously filed by the claimant.id.the dol comments to this regulation include the following statement 
where a previous survivor claim was denied solely on the basis that the survivor did not prove that the miner died due to pneumoconiosis,an element not subject to change,the survivor may be barred from litigating another claim filed more than one year after the denial of the first one.
in,congress enacted the aca,the much publicized and debated healthcare law.lost in the larger debate over the proper role of the federal government in the health insurance market was a little known provision of the aca that amended the blba and reinstated automatic entitlement to benefits for surviving dependents.see aca b g constr,owcp,cir holding that the aca reinstated automatic entitlement to benefits for surviving dependents.the blba provision titled filing of new claims or refiling or revalidation of claims of miners already determined eligible at time of death,which is codified at l,now reads as follows 
in no case shall the eligible survivors of a miner who was determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this subchapter at the time of his or her death be required to file a new claim for benefits,or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such miner.
section b of the aca simply eliminated from the end of l the following language except with respect to a claim filed under this part on or after the effective date of the black lung benefits amendments of.critically,for purposes of this case,c of the aca specifies the applicability and scope of the amendment to l 
the amendments made by this section shall apply with respect to claims filed under part b or part c of the black lung benefits act et,et after january,that are pending on or after the date of enactment of this act.
the dol,on march,proposed new regulations to implement the aca amendments to l.see.the proposed regulations take the position that the aca created,for certain survivors,a new cause of action by establishing a new method of demonstrating entitlements to benefits.id.at.the proposed regulations further provide that l,as amended,applies to all survivors claims meeting the requirements and that the amendment fundamentally altered the legal landscape for subsequent survivors claims and requires a revision to current d.id.
factual and procedural history 
after leaving coal mining,john eckman filed a claim for benefits under the blba in.an administrative law judge alj awarded benefits in,and the board affirmed the decision on appeal.marmon then paid benefits to john eckman until his death on may.john eckman widow,ethel eckman,filed a claim for benefits as a dependent survivor on may,five days after her husband death.an alj denied her claim in,finding that although john eckman had pneumoconiosis,ethel eckman failed to prove that his death was due to the disease.ethel eckman appealed to the board,which affirmed the alj decision on march.the board decision became final on may.
after congress enacted the aca and amended the blba on march,ethel eckman filed a new claim on september.a dol district director awarded benefits based on her new claim.marmon then asked for an alj hearing.the alj agreed with the district director and awarded benefits.the alj specifically found that ethel eckman satisfied the familial relationship and dependency criteria for survivors under the blba.the alj also found that,based on john eckman lifetime disability award and the filing date of ethel eckman subsequent claim,ethel eckman was entitled to benefits under l,as amended by the aca.the alj awarded benefits as of april,the month after the board issued its decision on ethel eckman original claim.
marmon appealed to the board,arguing that ethel eckman subsequent claim was barred by the dol regulations and principles of res judicata.the board rejected these arguments.after affirming the award,the board modified the entitlement date on the claim to june,the month after the board decision on the original claim became final.marmon then petitioned this court for review.
we have jurisdiction over a petition for review of a final order from the board under c.the board decisions on matters of law are subject to plenary review.lombardy,owcp,cir.
this case concerns a subsequent claim for benefits by a surviving dependent under the recently amended blba.with respect to original or claims,we have already determined that l,as amended,automatically entitles surviving dependents to benefits if the miners were eligible to receive benefits at the time of their deaths.see b g,at.now,we must determine whether l,as amended,applies to a subsequent claim for benefits where the original claim was denied due to the claimant failure to show that pneumoconiosis substantially contributed to the miner death,and whether res judicata precludes a award of survivors benefits on a subsequent claim where the original claim was denied due to the claimant failure to show that pneumoconiosis substantially contributed to the miner death.
the only court of appeals to have addressed these issues has held that l,as amended,applies to subsequent claims that are filed and pending within the proper temporal thresholds,and that res judicata does not preclude a award of survivors benefits on a subsequent claim where the original claim was denied due to the claimant failure to show that pneumoconiosis substantially contributed to the miner death.see union carbide richards,wl cir.july.
a.the scope of aca 
marmon first argument is that eckman subsequent claim is foreclosed by the lack of a specific reference to subsequent claims in the language of aca c,which outlines the applicability and scope of the aca amendments to the blba.thus,our first task is to determine whether the success of a subsequent claim is foreclosed by the following statutory language the amendments made by this section shall apply with respect to claims filed after january,that are pending on or after the date of enactment of this act.aca c emphasis added.
the goal of statutory interpretation is to give effect to congress inten
