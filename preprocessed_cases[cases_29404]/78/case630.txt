background 
on august,employee edwin ade injured his left hand while working for employer cassens transport company.as compensation for this injury,the illinois awarded ade wage differential benefits in the amount of per week.although evidence of the initial proceeding is absent from the record in this appeal,the parties briefing indicates that the commission made its award pursuant to section d of the workers compensation act ilcs d west.this section provides that an employee who is partially incapacitated from pursuing his usual and customary line of employment shall receive a portion of the difference between his former wages and the wages he earns or is able to earn in his new employment.ilcs d west.an employee receiving an installment award under section d is entitled to compensation for the duration of his disability.ilcs d west.
a decade after ade injury,cassens renewed its interest in ade case.in the years and,cassens requested ade income tax returns.ade declined to disclose this information.cassens then filed a motion with the commission,requesting that it suspend ade benefits based on his refusal to provide current wage information.the commission denied this motion.while cassens appeal to the circuit court was pending,the company served a subpoena on ade current employer and obtained years of information about ade wages.the wage information revealed that in the year,years after he was injured as a cassens employee,ade began to earn a wage that exceeded the wage cassens paid him at the time of his injury.
cassens terminated the appeal of its original motion to suspend ade benefits.it filed a new motion to suspend benefits,arguing that the wage discrepancy which gave rise to ade award under section d no longer existed.the commission again denied cassens motion.the commission relied on an appellate court case,petrie industrial comm n,d,to determine that the section d phrase for the duration of his disability refers to the duration of the employee physical or mental disability,not the duration of an economic loss.thus,the alleged change in ade earnings was irrelevant.
the circuit court of coles county denied cassens motion to overturn the decision of the commission,echoing the commission rationale.on appeal,the appellate court vacated the decision of the commission and dismissed cassens motion to suspend benefits,finding that the act did not give the commission or the court jurisdiction to entertain the motion.d at.the appellate court relied on section h of the act,which requires requests for review based on a change in disability to be filed within months of the date of an award.d at,citing ilcs h west.the court determined that the duration language in section d of the act did not give the commission jurisdiction to reopen or modify an award after the period of section h.d at.
however,before dismissing the appeal,the court addressed cassens argument that the definition of disability in section d includes economic loss.the court noted that while petrie addressed the definition of disability in section h of the act ilcs h west,it did so by examining the use of language throughout the act.d at.the petrie court determined that disability means physical disability because the act consistently uses other terms when referring to economic status.d at,citing petrie,d at.thus,the section d language addressing the duration of a disability refers to the duration of a physical disability.d at.in a special concurrence,one justice noted that this discussion of the merits was dictum.d at,holdridge,specially concurring.the special concurrence also noted that the court holding on jurisdiction did not prevent an employer from unilaterally terminating benefits based on a belief that the duration of a claimant disability had ended.d at,holdridge,specially concurring.
the appellate court denied cassens petition for rehearing,but filed a statement that the case involves a substantial question warranting consideration by this court.we granted cassens petition for leave to appeal.
this case requires us to interpret section d of the workers compensation act ilcs d west.this is a matter of statutory construction,presenting a question of law that we review de novo.masonry,industrial comm n.in interpreting the act,our primary goal is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.sylvester industrial comm n.we determine this intent by reading the statute as a whole and considering all the relevant parts.sylvester,at,flynn industrial comm n,declining to read section d in isolation.we must construe the statute so that each word,clause,and sentence is given a reasonable meaning and not rendered superfluous,avoiding an interpretation that would render any portion of the statute meaningless or void.sylvester,at.we interpret the act liberally to effectuate its main purpose providing financial protection for injured workers.flynn,at.
this appeal presents the threshold question of whether the workers compensation commission has jurisdiction to reopen or modify a wage differential award.cassens argues that section d grants extended jurisdiction by allowing an employee to receive compensation for the duration of his disability.ilcs d west.cassens argues that the use of this phrase suggests that the commission may modify an award whenever a disability no longer exists.
in determining whether section d of the act allows limitless modifications to an installment award for partial disability,we are mindful that the workers compensation commission is an administrative agency,lacking general or common law powers.alvarado industrial comm n,citing city of chicago fair employment practices comm n.because its powers are limited to those granted by the legislature,any action taken by the commission must be specifically authorized by statute.alvarado,at,citing business professional people for the public interest illinois commerce comm n.an act that is unauthorized is beyond the scope of the agency jurisdiction.alvarado,at,citing business professional people,at.
section of the act authorizes the commission to settle all questions arising under the act ilcs west,and section establishes the procedure by which the commission is authorized to do so ilcs west.section f of the act provides that a decision of the commission is conclusive unless a proceeding for review is commenced within days of receipt of notice of the decision.ilcs f west.thus,the commission may modify a conclusive decision only where the act specifically authorizes it to do so.
this court recently noted that the act specifies only two instances where the commission may modify a final award.alvarado,at.section f gives the commission limited authority to correct clerical errors.ilcs f west alvarado,at.section h gives the commission authority to review an installment award within months of its entry when a party alleges that the employee disability has recurred,increased,diminished,or ended.ilcs h west alvarado,at.cassens argues that section f of the act provides a third route to modification of a final award,one which cassens analogizes to extended jurisdiction under section d.
we note first that the plain language of section d,which authorizes compensation to an injured worker for the duration of his disability,does not mention modification of a final award.in accordance with our responsibility to read the act as a whole sylvester,at,flynn,at,we examine each provision which does specifically authorize the commission to reopen a final award.
section f allows modifications to correct clerical errors
