in this appeal,involving a car accident,we consider an apparent conflict between two provisions of new york law section of new york workers compensation law section,which provides that workers compensation is the exclusive remedy of an employee injured by his negligence,and section of new york vehicle and traffic law section,which provides that every owner of a vehicle operated in new york is liable for injuries resulting from the negligent permissive use of that vehicle.ultimately,we conclude that the new york court of appeals is in a better position to resolve the conflict,if any,between these two provisions,both of which arguably apply in this case.the court of appeals previously prohibited plaintiffs who are injured by the negligence of a driver from suing the owner of the vehicle,reasoning that vicarious liability against the owner can not exist in the absence of direct liability against the driver.more recent new york state court decisions have not been consistent on the issue,however,leading us to believe that the more specific question presented in this case is not yet fully resolved.accordingly,we defer decision and certify the following question to the new york court of appeals 
whether a defendant may pursue a contribution claim under new york vehicle and traffic law against the owner of a vehicle,where the vehicle driver negligence was a substantial factor in causing the plaintiff injuries,but the driver is protected from suit by the exclusive remedy provisions of new york workers compensation law 
background 
this case arises from a car accident in new york.michael koubek appeals from a decision of the united states district court for the northern district of new york sharpe,which refused to dismiss the contribution claims of doris and peter hallock the hallocks.on november,roberta oldenborg,koubek wife,was driving koubek car back from a business meeting when she collided with a car driven by doris hallock and owned by peter hallock.oldenborg,matthew isabella isabella had been riding as a passenger in oldenborg car and was injured in the accident.because the injury occurred in the course of his employment,isabella was prevented by new york workers compensation law from suing oldenborg,and he eventually obtained workers compensation benefits.
in isabella and his wife sued the hallocks in federal court based on diversity of citizenship.they claimed that doris hallock negligent and reckless driving proximately caused isabella injuries.in turn,the hallocks filed a complaint against koubek for contribution and indemnification,claiming that his wife oldenborg negligence,not doris hallock,proximately caused isabella injuries.koubek countered that his wife statutory immunity under section of the new york workers compensation law protected him from liability,and he moved for summary judgment.
the district court denied koubek motion in view of clamp estate of hales,misc d,which held that a defendant in the hallocks position could sue the owner of a car under new york vehicle and traffic law even though the negligent driver of that car enjoyed statutory immunity based on workers compensation law.the district court reasoned that the purpose of section would not be frustrated by allowing the suit to proceed because the parties were not related by employment 
just before trial,the parties entered into an agreement pursuant to which the isabellas would receive,plus interest,and the jury trial would apportion liability between koubek and the hallocks.the parties also agreed that if this court were to reverse the district court denial of summary judgment on appeal,the hallocks would be responsible for paying the full amount of the settlement.at trial,the jury found koubek ninety percent liable and the hallocks ten percent liable for the accident.after the district court denied koubek motion for judgment as a matter of law,koubek appealed.
discussion 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor.allianz ins.lerner,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.a.
as we have noted,this case concerns the interplay of two new york state statutes.first,section of the workers compensation law,in relevant part,provides 
the right to compensation or benefits under this chapter,shall be the exclusive remedy to an employee when such employee is injured or killed by the negligence or wrong of another in the same employ the limitation of liability of an employer set forth in section eleven of this article for the injury or death of an employee shall be applicable to another in the same employ 
workers comp.law.section of the statute,in turn,provides in relevant part 
the liability of an employer prescribed by the last preceding section shall be exclusive and in place of any other liability whatsoever,to such employee or any person otherwise entitled to recover damages,contribution or indemnity,at common law or otherwise,on account of such injury or death or liability arising therefrom 
an employer shall not be liable for contribution or indemnity to any third person based upon liability for injuries sustained by an employee acting within the scope of his or her employment for such employer unless such third person proves through competent medical evidence that such employee has sustained a grave injury 
workers comp.law.therefore,under new york law,an injured party who receives workers compensation can not sue the employer or whose negligence caused his injuries,nor can a defendant sue the employer or for contribution.see majewski broadalbin perth cent.sch.second,section of the vehicle traffic law provides 
every owner of a vehicle used or operated in this state shall be liable and responsible for death or injuries to person or property resulting from negligence in the use or operation of such vehicle,in the business of such owner or otherwise,by any person using or operating the same with the permission,express or implied,of such owner.
veh.traf.law.in other words,it is clear that under section a defendant in a tort action arising from a car accident caused by the driver negligence can proceed with a claim for contribution against the owner of the car,so long as the driver operated the car with the owner permission.the question presented on appeal,however,is whether section permits a defendant to proceed with a tort action for contribution against the car owner even when a direct cause of action by the defendant against the driver would be prohibited by section exclusive remedy provisions.there is no dispute that the accident occurred while isabella and his,oldenborg,the driver,were acting in the course of their employment,and that oldenborg was therefore immune from suit under section.
opinions from the new york court of appeals and intermediate new york state courts suggest that the exclusive remedy provision also bars such a suit against the car owner.in rauch jones,the court of appeals held that section prevented an injured plaintiff from suing the owner of a vehicle where,at the time of the accident,the vehicle was operated by a in the course of his employment,but the vehicle owner had no employment relationship with the plaintiff.the court of appeals reasoned that vehicle and traffic law section,the predecessor statute to section,was intended to create a remedy where no right to relief existed,and so did not apply when a plaintiff recovers for his injury through workers compensation.rauch,at.the court concluded 
where the only negligence alleged consists of negligen t acts and omissions ascribed to the operator of the vehicle,plaintiff clearly seeks to recover for injury caused solely by the negligence or wrong of another in the same employ and not because the defendant owner was a wrongdoer.this privilege is denied him by the compensation statute.
naso lafata,was decided the same day as rauch,involved a very similar fact pattern,and reached the same conclusion.id.at.having been injured in an a
