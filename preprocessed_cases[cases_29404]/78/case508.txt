in this appeal,sandra abraham appellant challenges a judgment of the superior court denying her petition for writ of administrative mandamus against the workers compensation appeals board wcab.the city of buena park the city,appellant former employer,appeared as the real party in interest in the proceeding below.we affirm the judgment,finding the court was without jurisdiction to entertain the petition.
appellant began her police career as one of two female officers with the city in.she resigned in,suffering debilitating depression and anxiety caused by the discrimination and sexual harassment of the male officers and their retaliation when she reported them to her unresponsive supervisors.she filed a claim for workers compensation,which the city denied by letter dated december,stating,in pertinent part,your claim is being denied because we do not have any medical information indicating that your claim is work related.appellant did not challenge the city decision that her workers compensation injury claim was nonindustrial.
appellant filed a civil suit against the city,and in a jury awarded her in damages.in,this court affirmed the judgment,establishing appellant had been constructively discharged by the city as a result of the wrongful conduct.mcclaren city of buena park,nonpub.opn.
by virtue of her employment as a city police officer,appellant was a member of the public employees retirement system pers.consequently,while appellant civil litigation was pending,she filed an application for disability retirement with pers,basing her claim on her psychiatric condition stemming from the workplace pers forwarded the application to the city,its contracting agency,for a determination under government code section in may,the city decided appellant was not disabled,but that determination was overturned in,when an administrative law judge found appellant was substantially incapacitated from performing her usual and customary duties as a police officer for the city police department because of a chronic mental condition.
thereafter,in june,appellant sought a determination by the wcab that her disability was industrial.in accordance with section,the wcab hears and determines disputes arising under pers regarding industrial causation of a disability.the city moved to dismiss the matter for lack of jurisdiction,noting appellant workers compensation claim had been denied nine years earlier,appellant had never before filed an application for adjudication of her claim before the wcab,and the instant petition was presented outside the statutory jurisdictional limit of the wcab to hear it.
in march,the wcab judge issued the following finding of fact it is found that the wcab has no jurisdiction to make a finding on behalf of the applicant under government code section due to the failure of applicant to file an application for adjudication of claim from her alleged date of injury culminating on or about october.more particularly,the opinion states,t he applicant is alleging injury which occurred on a continuous trauma basis culminating on or about october,r ule then in effect states that proceedings from the adjudication of rights and liability before the wcab shall be initiated by the filing of an application for adjudication,compromise and release agreement or stipulations with request for award.no such filing has been made in this matter thus,it would appear that the petition in this matter is the first formal filing relative to the applicant request for compensation benefits.it is noted that her claim as presented to the city in was denied.under the rules extant at that time her option was to file an application for adjudication of claim to invoke the jurisdiction of the board for further proceedings.the opinion notes that appellant claim for workers compensation was specifically denied by the employer defendant on december,bringing into play the labor code statute of limitations,giving appellant one year from the date of injury to commence proceedings with the wcab,yet appellant failed to commence the proceedings and has failed to do so to this very date.for this reason,the wcab found itself without jurisdiction to render any decision relative to appellant request for a finding of industrial causation pursuant to government code section.
appellant sought reconsideration.she argued her pers claim under the government code and her workers compensation claim under the labor code were completely separate and apart from one another for purposes of wcab determination.she contended jurisdiction under the government code does not even arise until the employer has made a determination of disability for pension purposes.according to appellant,that determination did not occur until,when the administrative law judge overturned the city nondisability decision and found appellant was,in fact,disabled thus the application for determination of industrial causation was timely.
the wcab denied reconsideration,stating an additional ground for lack of jurisdiction.specifically,it observed,here,the date of injury was august,but applicant did not file a petition seeking the wcab determination until june.even in cases where the wcab makes an original determination under section and a party subsequently seeks reopening under section,there is an outside limit of years from the date of injury for the board to rescind,alter,or amend its original determination for good cause,under the power of continuing jurisdiction.therefore,even if we were to assume that the wcr was incorrect in ruling that an application for adjudication of claim must be filed to invoke the jurisdiction of the wcab on a petition pursued under section,applicant failure to file the petition within years from the date of injury would bar the petition if section was applied here.
appellant petitioned this court for a writ of review under sections and to determine whether the wcab had acted unreasonably or without or in excess of its powers the question presented was whether the wcab had jurisdiction under section to make an industrial causation finding.per order of august,another panel of this court summarily denied the petition.
three years later,on august,pursuant to code of civil procedure section,appellant filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus in the superior court,seeking to compel the wcab to set aside its decision that it lacked jurisdiction to determine industrial causation of appellant disability and to compel it to decide the issue and grant relief.she set forth the procedural history summarized above,alleged she was eligible for an industrial disability retirement,and claimed she had never had a judicial review of the wcab determination.in its answer to the petition,the city asserted,inter alia,that under labor code section,the superior court was without jurisdiction to consider the matter,and that relief was barred by the collateral estoppel or res judicata effect of this court august,summary denial of appellant petition for writ of review.
the superior court,deciding the labor code was no obstacle to its jurisdiction,issued a judgment denying the request for writ for the reasons stated in open court on april.the record to which the court alluded sets forth the following comments by the court i t appears very straightforward under the allegations of the pleadings before the court that laches does and should and must apply.here we have the petitioner having sat on rights for a very long time.even more importantly,we have a res judicata situation.here the petitioner has filed before the court of appeal on the very same issues that she now wishes to file before this court on the case.in re rose cal th,d,talks about that issue and it has been adjudicated,and at this level,therefore,the court does not have jurisdiction.for that reason,the petition would be denied.following further argument,the court concluded the court of appeal took the case.like in here,even though they denied redress without comment,they still took jurisdiction and at that point then res judicata applies.i ca help that.that is the basis for this court decision.appellant appeals from the judgment denying her petition for
