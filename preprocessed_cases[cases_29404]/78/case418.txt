pursuant to the legislature comprehensive reform of workers compensation under senate bill,a new schedule for rating permanent disabilities of injured workers was adopted and became effective on january.the legislature also amended labor code section,subdivision d section d,which provides that the new schedule applies prospectively to compensable injuries on or after the effective date,as well as to compensable claims arising before january,when there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker.
zenith insurance company petitions for writ of review and contends that the new schedule applies to respondent randolph cugini industrial injury,because section,subdivision a section a expressly requires the notice with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity in and not the first payment in as determined by the workers compensation appeals board wcab.petitioner also contends that the new schedule applies because the treating physician report in that indicated the existence of permanent disability was an unsupported conclusion and not substantial evidence.in addition,permanent disability did not exist because cugini condition was not permanent and stationary until.
based on the plain language of section a,which provides for notice of permanent disability indemnity t ogether with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity,we agree with petitioner that the wcab erred in ruling that the requirement to provide the notice arose with the first payment of temporary disability indemnity in.however,we conclude that the wcab should determine on remand whether there is a comprehensive or treating physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability under section d,which is substantial evidence considering the entire record.we also conclude that the injured worker permanent and stationary status is not required before a physician report can indicate the existence of permanent disability under section d,for the reasons we stated in genlyte group,llc,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d genlyte.accordingly,the wcab decision is annulled and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural background 
cugini industrial injury and treatment 
randolph cugini,a swimming pool technician for browning pool service,insured for workers compensation by zenith insurance company zenith,injured his back at work on june,when he lifted two gallons of chlorine out of the bed of a pickup truck.cugini was referred to little company of mary hospital for treatment,and an mri was performed that revealed a mm disc bulge at,a small disc protrusion with moderate narrowing at,and multilevel degenerative disc disease and diffuse disc bulging.cugini treated with various physicians and medications were prescribed and back surgery discussed.
cugini also was referred to robert fenton,for an orthopedic consultation and treatment.in a report dated october,fenton indicated that the diagnosis was disc herniation refractory to conservative care based upon the history,medical record review,and physical examination.fenton recommended that cugini remain temporarily totally disabled and off work,and undergo evaluation by a neurosurgeon in a three sentence report dated december,fenton stated that,i am a treating physician for the applicant.there is a reasonable medical probability that permanent disability exists as a result of the injury or injuries for which i am treating this patient.i will describe that disability further in a subsequent report.
on december,fenton reported that an discectomy at was performed on march,and cugini condition had reached maximum medical improvement fenton also reported permanent disability under the former schedule,including no repetitive bending or hyperextension at the waist or lifting,pushing,or pulling over pounds,and that cugini had lost percent of his capacity to perform such activities.fenton further indicated that there was percent whole person impairment under the new schedule,there was no apportionment to causes,and cugini required vocational rehabilitation.
zenith obtained a evaluation from phillip kanter,kanter reported that cugini condition had reached maximum medical improvement on november,he was precluded from repetitive heavy lifting,bending,pushing,pulling,stooping and crawling under the former schedule,there was percent whole person impairment under the new schedule,there was no apportionment and vocational rehabilitation was required.
proceedings before the wcab 
the parties proceeded to trial before the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj,and submitted on the record and briefing which schedule applied.the wcj determined that temporary disability indemnity was paid from june,through december,and permanent disability was percent under the former schedule or permanent disability indemnity.in the opinion on decision,the wcj explained that the former schedule applies under section d because a wcab panel decision determined that the duty to provide the notice of permanent disability indemnity arises with the initial payment of temporary disability indemnity under section a.
zenith petitioned the wcab for reconsideration that the new schedule applies because the notice of permanent disability indemnity was required with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity in under the express language of section a.cugini answered that the former schedule is applicable based on the wcab panel decision,and fenton report of december,indicated the existence of permanent disability.
in the report on reconsideration,the wcj explained that,considering the treatment that applicant has undergone including surgery and a long recuperative period,it is hard to argue that the assessment of fenton in was not accurate and thoughtful.this consideration in addition to the fact that temporary disability was paid and there is no evidence of the notice having been provided as indicated in the labor code,applicant right to have this permanent disability assessed under the schedule appears thoroughly appropriate.
the wcab adopted the wcj decision and report and denied zenith reconsideration.however,commissioner brass disagreed that zenith duty to provide notice of permanent disability indemnity arose in under section a,but concluded that fenton december,report is a report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability.therefore,the prior rating schedule applies in this case.
zenith petitions for writ of review and contends further that the new schedule applies because the notice of permanent disability indemnity under section d was not required until the last payment of temporary disability indemnity in under the express language of section a.in addition,fenton report of december,is not substantial evidence permanent disability existed because it is a three sentence conclusion and cugini was not permanent and stationary.
cugini answers that the former schedule is applicable because the requirement to provide notice of permanent disability indemnity arose when zenith paid temporary disability indemnity in.in addition,fenton supplemental report of december,is substantial evidence of the existence of permanent disability under section d when read with his initial report of october.moreover,numerous medical reports in indicated permanent disability existed.while section d expressly refers to permanent disability,permanent and stationary status is not mentioned.
discussion 
standard of review and rules of statutory construction 
a decision by the wcab that is based on factual findings which are supported by substantial evidence is affirmed by the reviewing court substantial evidence generally means evidence that is credible,reasonable,and of solid value,which a reasonable mind might accept as probative on the issues and adequate to support a conclusion a factual finding,order,decision or award is not based on substantial evidence if unreasonable,illogical,arbitrary,improbable,or inequitable considering the entire record and statutory scheme the reviewing court also may not isolate facts which support or disapprove of the wcab conclusions and ignore facts which rebut or explain the supporting evidence,but must examine the entire record similarly,the reviewing court may not reweigh evidence or decide disputed facts 
interpretation of governing statutes or application of the law to undisputed facts is decided de novo by the reviewing court,even though the wcab interpretation is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous the legislature intent should be determined and given effect the legislature intent is generally determined from the plain meaning of the statutory language,unless the language or intent is uncertain or ambiguous interpretation of the statutory language should be consistent and harmonized with the purpose of the statute and the statutory framework as a whole where statutory language or the legislature intent is uncertain or ambiguous,rules of construction,legislative history or historical use aid in determining the meaning or intent 
in addition,the reviewing court is obligated to liberally construe workers compensation however,liberal construction under section is a tool for resolving statutory ambiguity where it is not possible through other means to discern the legislature actual intent.
the reform of workers compensation under senate bill 
on april,the legislature enacted a comprehensive reform of workers compensation under senate bill.was an urgency measure designed to alleviate a perceived crisis in skyrocketing workers compensation costs,although some employee benefits increased 
section,which governs how the percentage of permanent disability is determined was amended by the legislature as part of the reform.part of the amendment required a new schedule which incorporated the american medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment ed.on or before january,the new schedule went into effect on january,superseding the former schedule as with the schedule under former section c,the new schedule applies prospectively to compensable injuries on or after the effective date under amended section d.
however,section d also provides that the new schedule applies to compensable claims arising before january,when there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker.in other words,when any of these three circumstances have occurred before january,the percentage of permanent disability will be calculated using the earlier schedule that was in effect on the date of the injury.on the other hand,when none of the three circumstances has occurred before january,then the schedule applies.
in many cases,application of the new schedule reduces the injured worker permanent disability percentage,rating and compensation in this case,the parties stipulated that the permanent disability rating under the former schedule was percent based on fenton opinion and percent based on kanter opinion.under the new schedule,both physicians reported percent whole person impairment which the parties stipulated is a permanent disability rating of percent.
the notice under section d is required with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity under the express language of section a 
zenith contends that the new schedule applies under section d because section a expressly states that the notice of permanent disability indemnity is required with the last payment of temporary disability,and not the first payment in as determined by the wcj.zenith argues that the wcj application of the former schedule is contrary to the legislature intent to include as many cases as possible under the workers compensation reform.
cugini contends that the wcj application of sections d and a and the former schedule is correct,as confirmed by pendergrass duggan plumbing,wl pendergrass i.in pendergrass i,the wcab in bank concluded that the former schedule applied under section d,because the duty to provide notice of permanent disability indemnity arises with the first payment of temporary disability indemnity,and execution of the duty occurs with the last payment under section a.
we conclude that the notice requirement is not triggered with the first payment of temporary disability indemnity simply because the notice will be required once temporary disability indemnity has been paid.the plain and unambiguous language of section a states that notice of permanent disability indemnity shall be provided by the employer t ogether with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity.moreover,pendergrass i was not final when the decision was reversed on reconsideration by pendergrass duggan plumbing,wl pendergrass ii and is not binding on this court in any case in addition,appellate courts that have interpreted section d with section a have concluded that the notice is required with the last payment of temporary disability indemnity to find that the notice requirement is triggered upon payment of temporary disability indemnity would render the other two exceptions under section d virtually meaningless and violate the legislature expressed intent to include specified claims under the new or former schedule therefore,the notice exception to applying the new schedule under section d was not satisfied by zenith payment of temporary disability indemnity in where the last payment was after january,and the decision must be annulled.
a treating physician or other qualifying report indicating the existence of permanent disability under section d must be substantial evidence in light of the entire record 
zenith also contends that the new schedule applies because fenton report of december,is a three sentence conclusion that permanent disability exists,which is unsupported by the history,facts,a diagnosis or reasoning and is not substantial evidence under state comp.ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.th,d state fund new schedule applies where physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability under section d not substantial evidence.cugini contends that fenton report should be read with his initial report of october,and there are numerous medical reports indicating the existence of permanent disability under section d.
we conclude that determining whether fenton december,report is substantial evidence indicating the existence of permanent disability under section d,or there are other qualifying medical reports,should be based on the entire record although the court in state fund determined that the treating physician report,consisting of the single sentence i believe permanent disability is within reasonable medical probability emanating from this injury,was not substantial evidence,the court considered the physician previous medical reports in reaching its conclusion.the court explained that,nothing in the reports,however,appears to tie the range of motion and pain symptoms to morales december,prediction of permanent disability.to the contrary,the reports make no mention at all of prognosis,but instead simply declare that echeverria remained temporarily totally disabled.none of the reports provide any reasoning to support morales december,conclusion.
however,the circumstances in this case are very different than the situation described in state fund.the history,facts and diagnosis of disc herniation were documented in fenton report of october,and are supported by objective findings such as the positive mri.the consulting neurosurgeon also confirmed the need for back surgery before fenton report of december.the wcj and commissioner brass indicated that the record provided the reasoning for fenton opinion in that permanent disability existed within the meaning of section d.
however,it is well settled that the finding of permanent disability is a question of fact and the two other commissioners on the wcab panel in this case applied the former schedule based on an incorrect interpretation of the notice provision of section d and did not decide the issue.accordingly,whether fenton report indicating the existence of permanent disability under section d is substantial evidence in light of the entire record,or there is any other qualifying medical report,should be decided on remand.
the injured worker condition need not be permanent and stationary for the comprehensive or treating physician report to indicate the existence of permanent disability 
zenith further contends that permanent disability did not exist as reported by fenton on december,because cugini condition was not permanent and stationary.as indicated by fenton and the wcj,cugini reached permanent and stationary status in december.if zenith is correct that a permanent and stationary status is required under section d,then the new schedule would necessarily apply to cugini permanent disability.
zenith relies on vera,supra,th,d,which applied the new schedule because the treating physician report must indicate that the claimant has a ratable disability that has reached permanent and stationary status,and that in enacting section,subdivision d,the legislature was using the term permanent disability as another way of referring to the status of having a ratable disability that is permanent and stationary.the vera court was persuaded that the terms permanent and stationary and permanent disability are interchangeable under section d because applicable regulations define identically permanent and stationary status and when a disability is considered permanent.vera,supra,th at,d.in addition,the treating physician is not required to report permanent disability under the applicable schedule until permanent and stationary status is achieved pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision g vera,supra,th at,d.
for reasons we expressed in genlyte,we conclude that the terms permanent disability and permanent and stationary are not interchangeable,and a permanent and stationary status is not required in order for the comprehensive or treating physician report to indicate the existence of permanent disability under section d.the term permanent disability,although not defined in the labor code has been historically defined in workers compensation jurisprudence as the impairment of earning capacity,impairment of the normal use of a body member or function,or a competitive handicap in the open labor market the legislature has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to distinguish the terms permanent disability and permanent and stationary in this area of the law when that is what it intends.section,subdivision a requires the employer to provide notice that permanent disability indemnity may be or is payable,but that the amount can not be determined because the employee medical condition is not yet permanent and stationary.the notice shall advise the employee that his or her medical condition will be monitored until it is permanent and stationary,as cugini points out,the legislature only used the term permanent disability and not the term permanent and stationary in section d.we are reluctant to conclude that the legislature use of different terms,at different times in the statutory scheme,is meaningless.
moreover,section d is worded broadly to include any comprehensive or treating physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability.the language is not limited to what the vera court describes as the typical final or permanent and stationary report in which the extent of ratable permanent disability is reported in an appropriate case,a physician is not precluded from reporting that permanent disability exists prior to permanent and stationary status or the extent of ratable permanent disability is known.
by providing for notice of permanent disability indemnity that may be or is payable before the employee medical condition is permanent and stationary under section,subdivision a,the legislature acknowledged that permanent disability may exist and be reported by physicians in order for employers to provide the required notice before permanent and stationary status is achieved.similarly,the claims administrator must provide notice of permanent disability indemnity that is or may be payable even though the employee medical condition is not yet permanent and stationary under california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision g 
recognition by the legislature under the statutory scheme that permanent disability may exist before there is permanent and stationary status is also consistent with case law.in instances of insidious and progressive occupational diseases,such as from exposure to asbestos,permanent disability may be rated and indemnity advances ordered before the employee medical condition is permanent and stationary,with jurisdiction reserved pending permanent and stationary status or permanent total disability permanent disability before permanent and stationary status may also be found in cases involving serious injuries,such as severe burns,deafness or the loss of sight or limbs 
therefore,the terms permanent disability and permanent and stationary status are not used interchangeably under the statutory scheme and case law,nor did the legislature indicate in section d or that such use was intended.we therefore conclude that a permanent and stationary status is not required in order for the comprehensive or treating physician report to indicate the existence of permanent disability under section d.
remand to the wcab is necessary to determine if fenton december,report,or any other qualifying medical report,indicates the existence of permanent disability under section d 
as we have previously explained,two commissioners on the wcab panel in this case applied the former schedule based on the incorrect interpretation of the notice provision in section d,and did not determine whether there is a comprehensive or treating physician report indicating the existence of permanent disability as did the wcj and commissioner brass.the wcab also has extensive experience and expertise in interpreting and applying the statutory scheme and case law,and is charged with the administration of workers compensation law accordingly,we remand the matter to the wcab to determine whether fenton december,report,or any other qualifying report,indicates the existence of permanent disability under section d.
disposition 
the decision of the wcab is annulled and the matter is remanded to determine which schedule applies and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.the parties are to bear their own costs in this proceeding.

cugini was examined by neurosurgeon david morgan,who,in a report dated december,recommended an emg but could see no other option save for surgery for an extruded fragment.
maximum medical improvement or permanent and stationary status is the point when the employee has reached maximal medical improvement,meaning his or her condition is well stabilized,and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment,tit,subd.a.permanent and stationary status also has been found w hen the employee condition has reached maximum improvement or it has become stationary for a reasonable period of time.kopitske workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.permanent and stationary status refers to medical rehabilitation from an injury,not ability to work.harold workers comp.appeals bd.d,quoting huston workers comp.appeals bd.d.
