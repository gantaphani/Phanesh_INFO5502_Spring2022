at issue in this case is whether the workers compensation appeals board wcab has jurisdiction to impose penalties under labor code section for the unreasonable delay or denial of advance disability pension payments,available under section to local peace officers who are disabled on the job.because such payments qualify as compensation under section section penalties are available for unreasonable delay or denial of the payment of compensation and no other provision of the labor code evinces a legislative intent to exclude such payments from the penalty provisions of section,we conclude that the answer is yes.
rebecca gage was a deputy sheriff in sacramento county who sustained a injury and applied for industrial disability retirement.she also requested advance disability pension payments while her retirement application was processed.although she eventually received such advance pension payments,gage also sought penalties under section for an unreasonable delay.the workers compensation judge wcj ruled section penalties were available for the unreasonable delay in payment of advance disability pension payments,but deferred the decision on whether the delay in this case was unreasonable.the county petitioned for removal.the wcab reversed the wcj findings of fact and order.gage petitioned for a writ of review.
we will remand for a determination of whether section penalties are appropriate in this case.
background 
gage applied for disability retirement with the sacramento county employees retirement system scers on march,she requested section advance disability pension payments until her pension application was processed.
on june,gage petitioned the wcab,contending the county had failed and refused to commence payment of the section benefits she also requested penalties under section.the county responded that it did not receive notice of gage application for disability retirement until june,and it was working to begin section benefit payments.the county also objected to the request for penalties.it claimed there was no unreasonable delay or denial.further,it was the county belief and understanding that the wcab had no jurisdiction to make determinations concerning an applicant disability pension payments.
subsequently,the county notified gage that scers could not determine her benefit amount because there was a legal joinder filed against her scers account.this matter was resolved by june.
on june,the county informed gage that her request for advance disability pension payments had been approved and the benefits were to commence effective may.the next day,gage filed a petition for penalties for an unreasonable delay,noting the county had indicated the benefit check would not be sent until july and gage would not receive it until july or.
the matter proceeded to trial.the issue was limited to whether section penalties were an appropriate remedy if the county failed to comply with the requirements of section which we detail post.the parties tendered their exhibits and the matter was submitted.the issue of penalties was reserved.
the wcj found section advanced disability pension payments were compensation under section and therefore section penalties applied in the case of an unreasonable delay.
the county petitioned for removal.the county argued it would be for the wcab to have jurisdiction over the penalty for delayed section benefits where it had no jurisdiction to award these benefits in the first instance.
the wcj recommended the petition be denied.he noted the advance disability pension payments were intended to provide for the public safety officer while his or her retirement application was pending and without such payments,the officer might be unable to pay for food or housing.
the wcab granted reconsideration and reversed the order.it found that because advance disability retirement payments were not equivalent to regular workers compensation benefits,but are instead obligations of the applicable retirement system,a denial or delay in the payment of these benefits was not subject to a section penalty.one board member dissented,opining that section benefits fell within the clear statutory definition of compensation in section.the county had the obligation to pay that compensation and the wcab had jurisdiction to enforce that payment through the penalty provision of section.
gage petitioned for a writ of review.
discussion 
california workers compensation law is codified in division of the labor code et.see cal.const.art.xiv.its fundamental purpose is to protect individuals from any special risks of employment.laeng workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.division shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.
public employees are covered by workers compensation.state of california workers comp.appeals bd.th,ellison.certain public employees engaged in active law enforcement who are disabled on the job are entitled to special benefits in lieu of disability benefits.under section,they are entitled to a leave of absence without loss of salary.a county that is subject to the county employees retirement law of may make advanced disability pension payments to any local safety officer who has qualified for benefits under section and is approved for a disability allowance,italics added.the payments shall be no less than percent of the estimated highest average annual compensation earnable by the local safety officer during the three consecutive years of employment immediately preceding the effective date of his or her disability retirement,unless the local safety officer chooses an optional settlement in the permanent disability retirement application process which would reduce the pension allowance below percent.ibid.
in,the legislature made these advance disability retirement payments mandatory.stats,ch.the county shall make advanced disability pension payments in accordance with section unless a physician determines that there no discernible injury to,or illness of,the employee,the employee was incontrovertibly outside the course of his or her employment duties when the injury occurred,or there is proof of fraud,subd.a,italics added.the employer is required to make advanced disability payments if the employee files a timely application for disability retirement and fully cooperates in providing information and with the medical examination and evaluation process,subd.d.the payments shall commence no later than days after the latest of the employee last payment of wages or salary,benefits under section,or sick leave,subd.b.if the employee disability application is denied,the employee must repay these benefits if the employer and the local agency can not agree on a repayment plan,the matter shall be submitted to the local agency administrative appeals remedy,subd.f.
the wcab may impose penalties where payment of compensation is denied or unreasonably delayed.section,subdivision a provides in part when payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused,either prior to or subsequent to the issuance of an award,the amount of the payment unreasonably delayed or refused shall be increased up to percent or up to ten thousand dollars,whichever is less.in any proceeding under this section,the appeals board shall use its discretion to accomplish a fair balance and substantial justice between the parties.
a lthough denominated a penalty,section is to be interpreted liberally,in accordance with the general purpose of the workmen compensation laws.kerley workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,kerley.the penalty is designed to help an employee obtain promptly the cure or relief he is entitled to under the law,and to compel his employer to provide this cure or relief in timely fashion.citation.the penalty has been applied to virtually all types of benefits provided by the workers compensation laws adams workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,adams applying to medical and legal costs.
compensation under division includes every benefit or payment conferred by this division upon an injured employee,or in the event of his or her death,upon his or her dependents,without regard to negligence.the term compensation is a technical one and includes all payments conferred by the act upon an injured employee.compensation of an employee in the form of wages or salary for services performed,does not have the same meaning as the word compensation in the workmen compensation act.the former is remuneration for work done the latter is indemnification for injury sustained.citation.knopfer flournoy d,knopfer.
in considering a petition for writ of review of a decision of the wcab,this court authority is limited.this court must determine whether the evidence,when viewed in light of the entire record,supports the award of the wcab.this court may not reweigh the evidence or decide disputed questions of fact.citations.questions of statutory interpretation are,of course,for this court to decide.citations.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th.
applicability of section penaltiesa.plain meaning 
gage argument that section penalties are applicable to section benefits is based on the plain language of the statutes.section provides a penalty,in the form of an increased payment,w hen payment of compensation has been unreasonably delayed or refused.compensation includes every benefit or payment conferred by this division.section benefits are in this division division of the labor code.thus,gage argues,section benefits are compensation and section penalties apply to an unreasonable delay in their payment.
the interpretation of a labor statute is a legal question which we review independently from the determination of the appeals board.citation.nonetheless,we generally defer to the appeals board interpretation of labor statutes,unless the interpretation is clearly erroneous.citation.we begin with the familiar axiom that we must apply the plain language of the statute if it is unambiguous on its face.citation.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th.if the language is clear and unambiguous,there is ordinarily no need for judicial construction.citation.in construing a provision,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning governs.citation.smith workers comp.appeals bd.cal th.
the plain meaning rule,however,does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.literal construction should not prevail if it is contrary to the legislative intent apparent in the statute.the intent prevails over the letter,and the letter will,if possible,be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act.citations.lungren deukmejian cal d.
the county does not argue that applying section penalties to delayed payments of section benefits is contrary to the intent of the workers compensation statutes.nor would such an argument be convincing.section is intended to help an injured employee obtain help promptly.adams,supra,cal d at.applying section to advanced disability pension benefits furthers this purpose.as the wcj noted,without such advance payments,the disabled officer may have difficulty supporting him or herself until disability retirement payments begin.
rather,the county argues that applying section penalties to section benefits is inconsistent with the entire statutory scheme.it posits that because disability pension advances are subject to the county employees retirement law of,they are not workers compensation benefits nor are they in lieu of workers compensation benefits,so they are not compensation as referenced by section.the county asserts that since the workers compensation board has no jurisdiction to award section benefits to a disabled employee,it would be for the workers compensation board to have the jurisdiction to penalize an employer for any delay or denial of section disability pension advancements.
section in context 
we recognize that the plain meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.lungren deukmejian,supra,cal d at.we must interpret the language in the light of the statutory scheme.ibid.
other provisions of the labor code may show that compensation is not always given the broad,literal definition in section.for example,section,subdivision a grants the wcab exclusive jurisdiction for recovery of compensation,including any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto.yet the wcab has no jurisdiction to determine eligibility for benefits under section,which provides for a leave of absence for members of the department of justice falling within the state safety class who are disabled by injury arising out of and in the course of their duties,even though section is in division.department of justice workers comp.appeals bd.d,doj.the doj court based its conclusion on section which limits the wcab jurisdiction to determining,upon request,whether the disability arose out of and in the course of duty and when the disability ceases.doj,at.thus,another,more specific,provision of the labor code overrode the broad definition of compensation.
here,the wcab mistakenly relied on subdivision f of section to deny itself jurisdiction to award penalties with respect to section benefits.subdivision f grants jurisdiction to resolve disputes over repayment of advance disability pension payments,where the final adjudication is that the disability retirement is denied,to the local agency administrative appeal remedy,not to the wcab,subd.f.but the fact that the resolution of disputes over repayment is excluded from the wcab jurisdiction does not show the lack of jurisdiction to impose penalties.to the contrary,as noted by the dissenting panel member of wcab,it evidences an intention by the legislature that the wcab protect the injured worker by acting to assure that this item of compensation is timely paid.
in dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th dubois,our supreme court held the uninsured employer fund uef is not subject to payment of a section penalty for its own unreasonable delay in paying benefits to an injured worker.the uef was created to ensure that workers who happen to be employed by illegally uninsured employers are not deprived of workers compensation benefits,subd.b.section provides in part the uef shall not be liable for any penalties or for the payment of interest on any awards.the court considered this sentence in the context of the entire statute and the statutory scheme of which it is a part.dubois,at.the provisions creating the uef and defining its obligations express no legislative concern for the timeliness of the benefits to be provided by the uef and emphasize the legislature intent to limit the purposes for which the uef funds are to be applied,and to impose only derivative liability upon the uef.id.at.the court found nothing to indicate the uef was to pay any amount greater than the award against the employer and the statute set no deadline for payment.id.at.in light of the apparent legislative intent to ensure basic compensation to all employees otherwise deprived of benefits,the derivative nature of the uef statutory liability,and the failure of the legislature expressly to provide a deadline within which the uef must pay benefits after entry of the award and failure by the uninsured employer to pay the award,we believe there is no statutory basis to support the underlying assertion of dubois and amicus curiae that the uef may be subject to a penalty for its own unreasonable delay in paying benefits.ibid.
in contrast to the statutory provisions regarding the uef,the provisions for advance disability retirement payments have no express exclusion from penalties,nor is there a legislative concern of limiting the amount to be paid.further,section,subdivision b provides an express deadline for payment,no later than days after the last payment of wages or
