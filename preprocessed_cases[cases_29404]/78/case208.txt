vala borcky brought this action against her former employer,maytag corporation maytag.she alleged that maytag discharged her in retaliation for exercising her rights under the illinois workers compensation act.the district court granted maytag motion for summary judgment,and borcky appealed.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
borcky was an employee of maytag from october,until january.her employment relationship with maytag was governed by the collective bargaining agreement cba between maytag and the international association of machinists and aerospace workers.
the cba contained an absentee policy that allowed maytag,under certain circumstances,to assess points against union employees who were absent from work.the policy specifically provided that,when an employee was absent due to personal illness and provided an acceptable medical excuse,the employee would be assessed points for each occurrence if the employee was absent and failed to provide an acceptable medical excuse,the employee would be assessed points for each absence.no points were assessed for medical absences due to a reported occupational injury.an employee became subject to progressive discipline when he or she reached points within a period.according to the progressive discipline schedule,any employee who accumulated points within a period would be discharged.
the parties dispute the number of points that borcky accrued in the six months preceding december.however,borcky seems to agree that she was properly assessed at least points for absences in october and november in addition to her absences in october and november,borcky was absent from december through december,she was not assessed any points,however,because the absences were due to an earlier,injury.borcky was again absent from work on december through december and december through december,due to bronchitis.
maytag also mistakenly believed that borcky was absent on december through and that she had not called in to report her absences.consequently,maytag terminated her employment pursuant to cba f,which treats two consecutive days of no report absences as a quit without notice,at.upon receiving her termination letter,borcky brought the error to maytag attention,and she was reinstated.
shortly thereafter,borcky provided maytag with a doctor note to cover her absences from december through.according to the note,borcky contacted mark smith office on december,saying she had b ronchitis and wanted antibiotics refilled.she was not seen in the office.maytag found the excuse unacceptable because the doctor note did not state that borcky was unable to work during her absence and because it did not corroborate borcky contention that she did,in fact,have bronchitis.consequently,borcky was assessed points points per day for her december absences.combined with her points from october and november,borcky exceeded points as a result,borcky was discharged on january,
following her discharge,borcky again provided maytag with a note from her doctor.this second note from smith,dated january,stated 
borcky was seen in our office and and diagnosed and treated for bronchitis.she called the office and stated she had a reoccurrence of b ronchitis.medications were called in.based on her previous and recent episodes of b ronchitis,i have no reason to doubt that she was ill.
however,like the first excuse,the note did not state that smith had examined borcky or state conclusively that borcky was unable to work during her absence.maytag termination decision,therefore,remained unchanged.
district court proceedings 
borcky brought this cause of action in the circuit court of williamson county,illinois,on january.in her original complaint,borcky alleged that maytag discharged her in retaliation for exercising her rights under the illinois workers compensation act in violation of ilcs h,that it had violated the cba,and that it intentionally had caused her emotional distress.based on diversity of citizenship and,with respect to count two,federal question jurisdiction,maytag removed the case to district court.
maytag then filed its motion for summary judgment.before a ruling on the motion,however,counts two and three of borcky complaint were voluntarily dismissed.consequently,the only remaining count before the district court was borcky retaliatory discharge claim.with respect to that claim,maytag maintained that borcky could not establish a necessary element of her cause of action a causal connection between her workers compensation claim and her termination.according to maytag,the only allegation in borcky complaint to support this element was that she unjustifiably was assessed points for her december absences.however,explained maytag,it had followed its usual procedure under the cba for requiring a valid physician note for any absences.maytag asserted that the doctor notes that borcky presented upon her return to work in late december and upon her termination in january did not indicate that she was unable to work from december through december.because borcky was unable to show that she was erroneously assessed points for these days,maytag contended,she accrued over points within a period and was,therefore,subject to termination under the cba.
in her opposition memorandum and affidavit,borcky argued that maytag reason for terminating her employment should not be believed.she pointed to alleged errors in maytag attendance records as well as maytag prior,but rescinded,termination of her employment as evidence of a retaliatory motive.borcky also maintained that her absences in december should have been excused because her doctor note of january,was sufficient to meet her obligations under the cba.
on february,the district court ordered that the parties file a joint statement of uncontested facts by may,pursuant to a local rule.however,on may,before the joint statement of facts was filed,the district court granted maytag motion for summary judgment.the district court held that borcky was unable to prove that her discharge was causally related to her filing a claim under the illinois workers compensation act.the district court stated that,even construing the evidence in a light most favorable to borcky,she had provided nothing except her own unfounded allegations in support of her claim that maytag had discharged her in retaliation for her workers compensation claim.the district court therefore granted maytag motion for summary judgment.this appeal followed.
