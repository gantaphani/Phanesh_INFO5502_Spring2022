petitioner peabody coal peabody appeals an award of benefits under the black lung benefits act blba.peabody argues that the administrative law judge alj applied a treating physician presumption in violation of the administrative procedure act,and that the alj decision to rely on the treating physicians medical opinions was irrational.because peabody arguments lack merit,we affirm the benefits award.
background 
on april,elze groves groves died in the emergency room of ohio county hospital.his death certificate identified the cause of death as cardiac arrest due to acute myocardial infarction and arteriosclerotic heart disease.groves had worked underground in coal mines for over years.on may,his widow wilma jean groves wilma applied for black lung survivor benefits under the blba on may,a district director of the office of workers compensation programs owcp of the united states department of labor dol affirmed a previous finding that the evidence failed to establish that groves had suffered from or died as a result of pneumoconiosis.the dol identified peabody as the responsible coal mine operator and notified it of the pending claim.
at wilma request,the case was forwarded to the dol office of administrative law judges for a hearing,which was held on april.on june,the alj denied wilma claim.he first found that groves had suffered from pneumoconiosis,giving the most weight to the opinions of robert johnson johnson and blue blue which were supported by the and reports of several other doctors who had examined groves.joint appendix at.however,the alj found that the evidence did not establish that groves death was hastened by pneumoconiosis 
only blue opined that groves death was hastened by pneumoconiosis.however,i find that blue opinion is outweighed by the and opinions of branscomb and fino.to the contrary,blue opinion regarding the factors contributing to groves death is not.an undocumented opinion may be given little or no weight.
at citations and footnote omitted wilma filed a timely notice of appeal with the board.on july,the board affirmed the alj finding of pneumoconiosis but vacated his finding about groves cause of death and remanded the case for further consideration.the board noted that the alj had described blue opinion as undocumented but failed to consider blue treatment notes,as he should have in determining the physician credibility.at 
on november,the alj issued a decision and order awarding survivor benefits to wilma.in finding on remand that blue opinion about groves cause of death was the most credible,at,the alj referred to blue treatment notes,which recorded that blue had treated groves for breathing problems from to.at.the alj then quoted verbatim a report submitted by blue on february,that opined 
groves was a product of many years in the mines with the primary lack of oxygenation to his tissues speeding his death significantly.his immediate cause of death was the coronary artery disease which was largely a result of the chronic low oxygen assaturation superimposed on his metabolic abnormalities of sugar and lipids.it is my opi ni on that his pneumoconiosis was probably a third to a half responsible for his final demise.
at.the alj specifically found that blue treatment notes,which show that groves lung function was impaired,support blue letter of february,and bolster his credibility.at.in contrast,he found that the opinions of peabody experts were entitled to less weight because they failed to find any evidence of pneumoconiosis.at.on december,peabody filed a timely appeal to the board from the alj decision.
on december,the board affirmed the alj decision,observing that the alj decision to accord the greatest weight to blue opinion about groves cause of death was rational because blue had treated groves for a lengthy period of time and blue conclusion about a decrease in oxygenation to groves tissues,which hastened his death,was credible.at.the board also stated that the alj had permissibly accorded less weight to the opinions of physicians who had not examined groves and who had ruled out the existence of pneumoconiosis in groves,when in fact the presence of the disease had been established.at.peabody then filed a motion for reconsideration,which the board denied on may.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
we have a very narrow scope of review over the board decisions,which must be affirmed unless the board has committed legal error or exceeded its scope of review of the alj findings.tennessee consol.coal kirk,cir.the alj findings are conclusive if they are supported by substantial evidence and are in accordance with the applicable law.id.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.cross mountain coal,ward,cir quoting richardson perales,d.we do not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for that of the alj.tennessee,at.thus,we will not reverse the conclusions of an alj that are supported by substantial evidence,even if the facts permit an alternative conclusion.id.quoting youghiogheny ohio coal webb,cir.
treating physician presumption 
the survivors of a miner are eligible for benefits under the blba if they can prove that the miner had pneumoconiosis,which arose out of coal mine employment,and that the miner death was due to pneumoconiosis.a.claimants may satisfy the second requirement by showing that pneumoconiosis was a substantially contributing cause of the miner death.id.c.peabody argues that t he alj found both the existence of pneumoconiosis and death due to it by presuming that the opinion of a doctor who treated the miner was automatically more credible than any other doctor opinion simply by virtue of that treatment.petitioner br.at.
in tussey island creek coal,cir,we confirmed that the opinions of treating physicians are entitled to greater weight than those of physicians.id.at.however,we did not suggest that treating physicians should automatically be presumed to be indicated that their opinions should be properly credited and weighed.id.indeed,peabody concedes as much in unpublished decisions,however,this court almost uniformly has recognized that notwithstanding tussey,aljs are not required to credit treating doctors opinions either standing alone or where there is conflicting proof in the record.petitioner br.at we therefore conclude that peabody treating physician presumption argument lacks merit and disagree with its characterization of the tussey decision as ambiguous or in conflict with the established caselaw.
tussey requires aljs in black lung cases to examine the medical opinions of treating physicians on their merits and to make a reasoned judgment about their credibility.these opinions should be g iven their proper deference.tussey,at.in determining the level of deference that would be proper,we turn for quidance to d,which delineates the criteria for the development of medical evidence in black lung proceedings 
in appropriate cases,the relationship between the miner and his treating physician may constitute substantial evidence in support of the adjudication officer decision to give that physician opinion controlling weight,provided that the weight given to the opinion of a miner treating physician shall also be based on the credibility of the physician opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation,other relevant evidence and the record as a whole.
id given this standard,peabody interpretation of the alj decision and order in this case is not tenable.in particular,we observe that the alj initially denied wilma claim,finding that wilma had failed to establish that pneumoconiosis hastened her husband death after the board vacated this finding and remanded the case for further findings with respect to the medical opinion evidence,the alj found that wilma was entitled to survivor benefits.in his decision and order on remand,the alj reviewed groves medical records as compiled by his treating physicians and the consultative reports issued by a dol expert and two peabody experts.the alj discounted the opinion of the dol expert,who had reviewed a limited amount of the available evidence,as not.at.the alj
