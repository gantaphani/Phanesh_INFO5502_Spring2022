factual and procedural background 
albert matthews settled his workers compensation claim against his employer and others in a structured settlement approved by the workers compensation appeals board wcab.the settlement provided for an immediate payment and monthly payments of for life,with ten years guaranteed.the employer insurer assigned the obligation to make the monthly payments to liberty assignment corporation through a qualified assignment under federal tax law.c.in accordance with the requirements for a qualified assignment c b,the structured settlement agreement provided that the payments to matthews can not be accelerated,deferred,increased or decreased by matthews.liability for the monthly payments was funded through an annuity purchased from liberty life assurance company.the wcab approved the parties compromise and release agreement and entered it as the workers compensation award.
about three years later,matthews filed in superior court a request for entry of a clerk judgment on the workers compensation award,pursuant to labor code section the clerk entered the judgment in conformity with the order approving compromise release.wc then moved for entry of a qualified order approving assignment of the judgment from matthews to wc.wc motion alleged matthews and wc entered into an agreement to assign award,by which matthews agreed to convert his workers compensation compromise and release into a civil judgment,then assign his right,title,and interest in the judgment to wc.according to matthews declaration,he agreed to sell all of his interest in the judgment to wc.in exchange,he would receive a payment of on court approval of the transaction.he would also receive monthly payments of from wc until,when the payments would return to per month for life.matthews stated he would use the lump sum to pay his delinquent mortgage in order to avoid foreclosure on his house he would also prepay some of his mortgage payments and make some repairs to his home.wc sought court approval of a qualified assignment in order to avoid a federal excise tax of percent of the factoring discount,which it would be required to pay without such approval.

discussion 
standard of review 
the primary question presented by this appeal is whether a judgment,based on a structured settlement of an employee workers compensation claims against his employer and others,which was agreed upon by the parties and entered as an award in the workers compensation proceeding,may be assigned by the injured employee.the issue requires interpretation of statutes and orders and application of those statutes and orders to undisputed facts.accordingly,our review is de novo.rsl funding,llc alford th,morgan united retail th.

transfer of structured settlement payments 
structured settlements are a type of settlement designed to provide certain tax advantages.in a typical personal injury settlement,a plaintiff who receives a payment may exclude this payment from taxable income under the internal revenue code.citation.however,any return from the plaintiff investment of the payment is taxable investment income.in contrast,in a structured settlement the claimant receives periodic payments rather than a lump sum,and all of these payments are considered damages received on account of personal injuries or sickness and are thus excludable from income.accordingly,a structured settlement effectively shelters from taxation the returns from the investment of the payment.henderson receivables origination llc sioteco th,henderson.
the periodic structured settlement payments are locked in at the time of settlement based upon the settlement agreement and the annuity contract.however,sometimes,the structured settlement recipient or payee requires immediate cash because of changes in personal circumstances.in these cases,payees sometimes sell some or all of their future payments to factoring companies for an immediate cash payment.thus,a factoring transaction partially or fully destroys the structured aspect of a structured settlement because it permits the payee to convert some or all of the periodic payments into a payment.henderson,supra,th at.under federal law,the transferee of the structured settlement payment rights must pay a federal tax on the transaction of percent of the factoring discount unless the transferee obtains court approval of the transfer in advance in a qualified order.a,b.a qualified order is a final order,judgment,or decree which a finds that the transfer i does not contravene any federal or state statute or the order of any court or responsible administrative authority,and ii is in the best interest of the payee,taking into account the welfare and support of the payee dependents.b a.
the qualified order must also be issued under the authority of an applicable state statute by an applicable state court.b b i.an applicable state statute is a statute providing for the entry of an order,judgment,or decree described in paragraph a if the state of domicile of the payee of the structured settlement payments does not have such a statute,then the applicable state statute is the statute of the state where the person issuing the funding asset for the structured settlement is domiciled or has its principal place of business.b.
the california act governing transfers of structured settlement payment rights defines a s tructured settlement agreement as an arrangement for periodic payment of damages established by settlement or judgment in resolution of a tort claim in which the payment of the judgment or award is paid in whole,or in part,in periodic payments rather than a payment,subd.k,italics added.because the definition specifies the payments must be for settlement of a tort claim,the parties here agree the act does not apply to structured settlements of workers compensation claims.wc contends the massachusetts statute regarding transfer of structured settlement payments applies,as the law of the state where liberty life the annuity issuer is domiciled or has its principal place of business.
contravening state statute 
consistent with federal law b a,the massachusetts statute providing for approval of the transfer of payments under a structured settlement agreement requires that the court or administrative authority asked to approve the transfer expressly find that the transfer will not contravene other applicable law.ann.laws ch,a lexisnexis.the trial court,in determining whether to issue a qualified order for the transfer of the structured settlement payments,concluded the transaction would contravene california law,because section prohibits the assignment.wc challenges that conclusion.
with an exception not applicable here,under the workers compensation statutes,n o claim for compensation is assignable before payment.the term claim for compensation has been interpreted expansively.in pacific commonwealth bonding cas.ins.pacific,an injured employee obtained a workers compensation award against the employer insurer.id.at.the state subsequently paid the amount of the award to the employee and obtained his assignment of the award.id.at.the state attempted to recover the amount of the award from the insurer.
the issue was the validity of the assignment in light of a statute then providing no claim for compensation shall be assignable before payment.pacific,supra.at.the state argued the statute applied only to claims and not to awards.id.at.the court conceded there was much reason in his argument that a restriction upon the assignment of claims which are uncertain in amount is more necessary than a restriction upon the assignment of awards which are fixed amounts,under technical definitions of these terms.ibid.the court rejected the argument,however,concluding that the statute obviously,was intended to cover both claims and awards and that the word claim is used in this broad sense.the act states that no assignment shall be made before payment.claims are not paid until they become awards,and it is clear that the only thing payable under the provisions of the act is awards.it is evident that the legislature intended that there should be no assignment of claimant rights whatsoever and that the award should be paid by the one against whom it was made directly to the claimant and to no one else.ibid.the court therefore found the assignment of the award was illegal and unenforceable.id.at.
wc relies on richey zeigler.richey for the proposition that,once the wcab award has been entered as a court judgment,section does not apply to prohibit assignment.in richey,an injured employee obtained a workers compensation award against her corporate employer and had it entered as a court judgment.richey,at pp.she then assigned the judgment to the plaintiff,who sought recovery on the judgment against the shareholders of the corporation.the defendants contended the award could not be lawfully assigned before payment.after acknowledging pacific had construed the term claim in the statute in its broadest sense as covering both claims and awards,the court stated 
it is apparent that defendants are invoking the aid of an act to resist the payment of an award which was designed to protect disabled workmen and their dependents,in the event of death,from making assignments of industrial compensation.that the legislature never intended the act should be used as a shield for this purpose goes without saying.however,this may be,the defense interposed can avail defendants nothing for the reason that the award when reduced to judgment as above recited,lost its actionable character as a claim or award as it became merged in the judgment and the complaint is based upon such judgment and not upon the award there could be no action based upon the award after it became merged in the judgment for,as stated,it had lost its actionable character,nor could the award be paid as it no longer existed.satisfaction could only be had by payment of the judgment.richey,supra.at pp.
the richey court addressed a situation in which the prohibition against assignment was being invoked not to protect the injured employee and preserve her right to compensation,but to allow the shareholders of the employer to escape liability to compensate the employee for her injury.the court opined that the statute should not be used for that purpose.we have no disagreement with that portion of the opinion.
we disagree,however,with the richey court conclusion that the judgment on the workers compensation award was not subject to the prohibition against assignment because entry of judgment caused the award to become merged with the judgment.like the court in pacific,we believe the focus in interpreting section should not be on the term claim for compensation,as denoting the stage of the proceedings at which the assignment is attempted rather,the focus should be on the term before payment,indicating the intent that the employee right to compensation for the work injury can not be alienated before payment is made.as discussed in pacific,by the prohibition of assignments of claims for compensation under the workers compensation law prior to payment,the legislature intended that there should be no assignment of claimant rights whatsoever and that the award should be paid by the one against whom it was made directly to the claimant and to no one else.pacific,supra.at.
in cases addressing liens against workers compensation awards,courts have observed that sections prohibiting assignment of claims for compensation,providing no claim for compensation or compensation awarded,adjudged,or paid may be taken for the debts of an injured worker entitled to compensation,except as provided by the workers compensation statutes,and precluding an award of workers compensation from being paid to attorneys or agents of the employee,except as ordered by the board indicate a clear legislative intent to remove workers compensation awards from the operation of the usual remedies available to creditors,to limit and regulate the kinds of debts which may be allowed,and to insure that the award is made available to the injured employee for his recovery and rehabilitation in accordance with the purposes of the act.ogdon workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.in general,compensation benefits are payable only to the employee,or the employee dependents in the event of his or her death,and are neither assignable nor subject to the employee general debts williams workers comp.appeals bd.th.
because of the unique nature of workers compensation awards and the judgments entered on those awards,we believe a workers compensation award is not assignable simply because a judgment on the award has been entered.in a workers compensation proceeding,the wcab may determine all relevant matters and enter an award.alternatively,if the parties reach a compromise,the wcab may approve it and enter an award based on the compromise and release agreement.wcab approval is mandatory no release of liability or compromise agreement is valid unless it is approved by the appeals board or referee.
a party to a workers compensation proceeding may obtain a judgment on the award simply by filing with the clerk of the superior court a certified copy of the findings and order,decision,or award of the appeal board.the clerk has a ministerial duty to immediately enter judgment in conformity with the award.ibid.
the wcab retains continuing jurisdiction until five years after the date of the injury to rescind,alter,or amend its decision or award.no exception is made for an award on which a court judgment has been entered.the wcab may also stay execution of a judgment entered pursuant to a workers compensation award.where the wcab amended the award to reduce the amount awarded after entry of judgment,the wcab had exclusive jurisdiction to stay execution of the judgment to prevent the employee from recovering an amount in excess of the amended award,and the superior court was without jurisdiction to do so.vickich superior court.
the vickich court explained 
the provisions of the compensation act which authorize the entry of judgment upon an award and the issuance of execution thereon in the superior court are merely a method adopted for the enforcement of such awards,in lieu of machinery of enforcement which might have been provided for and given to the commission itself,to exercise through executive officers appointed for that purpose the execution on a judgment entered upon an award of the industrial accident commission predecessor of wcab,although in the form of an execution upon a judgment of the superior court,is in reality an execution upon the award of the commission.the clerk in issuing the execution,and the sheriff in making his levy and sale under the writ,are for the purposes of the proceeding instrumentalities of the commission in the enforcement of its award.that those officers are respectively the clerk of the county clerk of the superior court and sheriff of the county are simply and only facts which under the statute qualify them to perform these duties.vickich superior court,supra.at,italics added.
thus,even after the award has been entered as a co
