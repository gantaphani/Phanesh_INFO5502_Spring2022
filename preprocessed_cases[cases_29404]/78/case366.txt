defendant rwa trucking company,rwa appeals from the trial court judgment that it violated the unfair competition law,business and professions code section ucl or section,by charging its drivers for automobile liability insurance,physical damage insurance,cargo insurance,and workers compensation insurance from to.rwa contends that the ucl causes of action and the state laws on which they are based are preempted by federal law.we affirm in part,reverse in part,and remand the matter to the trial court.
factual and procedural background 
i.the parties and the dispute 
rwa is an interstate trucking company registered as a interstate motor carrier with the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa.at all relevant times,rwa conducted its trucking business from facilities in long beach,california,transporting containers and other cargo from the ports of los angeles and long beach.
rwa contracted with plaintiff salvador rodriguez and other drivers who owned their own tractors drivers under written lease agreements agreements.under the agreements,rwa leased the tractors from the drivers and dispatched the drivers to transport cargo.the agreements characterized the drivers as independent contractors.
the agreements required each driver to carry automobile liability insurance,physical damage insurance,and cargo insurance collectively,liability insurance,and it gave the drivers the option either to obtain their own policies or elect coverage under rwa fleet policies.if the drivers elected coverage under rwa fleet policies,rwa deducted from the drivers earnings or charged back from his or her compensation the costs of the insurance.rwa also deducted from the drivers earnings the cost of workers compensation insurance.the chargebacks were reflected on weekly settlement statements given to each driver.
the agreements authorized rwa to charge an administrative fee for arranging insurance for the drivers.an administrative fee for that purpose of at least percent was deducted from the drivers compensation during some years.
rwa deducted the following amounts from the drivers for workers compensation december,to december,december,to december.
during the years to,rwa collected from its drivers a percent administration fee for automobile liability insurance,physical damage insurance,and cargo insurance.during the years to,rwa collected significantly less from its drivers than it paid in insurance premiums,ranging from in to in.during the years to,rwa deducted more from its drivers than it paid in insurance premiums.
ii.the present litigation 
a.the pleadings and class certification 
plaintiff filed the present action in los angeles superior court in.the complaint alleged plaintiff was an employee,not an independent contractor,but was denied employee benefits defendants failed to comply with federal truth in leasing regulations,thereby breaching fiduciary duties to plaintiff and defendants sold insurance to plaintiff without a license.rivas rail delivery serv.cir.on january,defendants removed the case to federal court on september,the ninth circuit held plaintiff lacked article iii standing and remanded the case back to state court.id.at.
plaintiff filed the operative fourth amended complaint on may.the first cause of action alleged rwa transacted insurance within the meaning of insurance code section by selling insurance to plaintiff for compensation and charging plaintiff an administrative fee of at least on the aforementioned insurance that defendant sold to plaintiff.such transactions were unlawful,plaintiff alleged,because rwa was not licensed to transact insurance in california.further,rwa failed to properly disclose the total premium it charged plaintiff and each class member by failing to properly disclose the at least commission defendants earned,violating california insurance code f.these insurance code violations were alleged to be unlawful and to constitute unfair business practices in violation of the ucl.the second cause of action alleged rwa violated section by charging plaintiff for workers compensation insurance,in violation of labor code section section and albillo intermodal container services,th albillo.
the court granted plaintiff motion for class certification and,on june,it issued an order certifying the following class all persons and entities in california that provided trucking services,including the transport of cargo and freight,for rwa trucking,from december,through the present,who had money deducted from their earnings by rwa trucking,to pay for liability insurance coverage,property damage insurance coverage,cargo loss insurance coverage,or workers compensation insurance coverage.
trial and decision 
the case went to trial on stipulated facts.on december,the court filed a statement of decision.following is a summary.
first cause of action transacting insurance without a license 
prior to trial,the court found that rwa was transacting insurance and receiving compensation for doing so within the meaning of the insurance code.the court explained it is undisputed that rwa received compensation in connection with obtaining insurance for rodriguez.accordingly,rwa was required to have a license to transact insurance,but,undisputedly,rwa did not have a license.the court finds that albillo intermodal container services,supra,th does not compel a different result as to the transacting insurance without a license issue.
following trial,the court further found that rwa did not comply with the insurance code disclosure requirements rwa stipulated that it did not comply with insurance code rwa did not give any class member an insurance policy or certificate of insurance,nor any of the items listed in insurance code section,nothing was given to the class members that showed the insurance premium,rates,or criteria used to determine how much to charge the truck driver for insurance.
rwa stipulated in fact,and,just as farmers did in the troyk case,that it charged plaintiff an administrative fee for providing insurance to plaintiff.troyk farmers group,th.rwa,like farmers,did not comply with the disclosure requirement in insurance code f.following troyk,rwa violated insurance code f and plaintiff has established through stipulated fact that plaintiff and each class member has standing to sue rwa under california unfair competition laws for rwa violation of insurance code f.
the court also rejects rwa argument that its practice of violating insurance code is permitted by the truth in leasing regulation in j.regardless whether for insurance might be permitted,rwa must comply with the law in making any such,such as complying with california insurance code.
based on these findings,the court found that rwa violated the unlawful prong of section,and it ordered restitution in the amount of the difference for each class member between the premium for each such insurance and the amount of money deducted by rwa from each class member for such insurance,or,plus prejudgment interest of.
second cause of action charging plaintiffs for workers compensation insurance 
prior to trial,the court granted plaintiffs motion for summary adjudication of the second cause of action.the court found that under albillo,rwa was not permitted to require plaintiffs to reimburse it for the cost of workers compensation insurance.it explained the facts of this case are nearly identical to the facts in albillo.here,as in albillo,the workers compensation policy at issue protects defendant from lawsuits made by plaintiff,should plaintiff suffer a injury.following albillo,plaintiff is treated as though he were an employee and defendant is treated as if it were an employer under the election thus,it is unlawful for defendant to receive from plaintiff any portion of the cost of the workers compensation insurance.albillo,th at.
the albillo court explained,while it is correct that an election under labor code section does not make a person an employee for all purposes,it does expressly subject him or her to the compensation provisions of division of the act.labor code section is one of those provisions.citation.accordingly,we hold that by deducting amounts from appellants compensation to secure workers compensation coverage,respondents violated labor code section.citation.
following trial,the court applied its summary adjudication holding to the entire plaintiff class and ordered rwa to restore to plaintiff and the class all funds rwa retained by means of the unfair and unlawful business acts and practices alleged herein.it awarded the plaintiff class the principal amount of,and prejudgment interest through september,in the amount of.
federal preemption 
in concluding that plaintiffs were entitled to compensation for rwa violations of california law,the court determined that these laws were not preempted by federal law,namely,the federal aviation administration authorization act of faaaa,title united states code section et,or the truth in leasing act.it explained there is no california case that says that the ucl is preempted in a faaa a case.equally important,the district court for the central district of california already rejected the precise preemption arguments raised by rwa holding that plaintiff claims here are not preempted by c.see renteria k r transportation,wl furthermore,the mccarran ferguson act,prevents the court from interpreting c so as to preempt plaintiff claims that are based upon california insurance laws.here,congress expressly reiterated state authority to regulate insurance when enacting c.renteria,wl at.the renteria court held that t he aim of the regulation j is to compel disclosure of the contract terms between the and the carriers,not to govern the terms for which the parties are permitted to bargain.nothing in the federal regulations prevents a state from passing legislation that mandates a particular contract term with regard to the costs of insurance.similarly,while separate licensing requirements in each state may impact carriers in some way,the brokering of insurance is not the focus of the federal law,so c does not preempt california worker compensation insurance or liability insurance laws.renteria,wl at emphasis added.under c,t he effects of the state insurance,wage,and workers compensation laws on defendants are insufficient to relate to prices additionally,insurance and wage requirements are areas generally reserved to the states.see californians for safe and competitive dump truck transp.mendonca cir c.renteria,wl at.fns.underling omitted.
judgment and appeal 
the court entered judgment on may.the judgment awarded plaintiffs as and for restitution for the first cause of action the sum of principal,plus prejudgment interest through may,in the amount of and for the second cause of action,principal plus prejudgment interest in the amount of through may,for a total of.
notice of entry of judgment was served on may.rwa timely appealed from the judgment,and plaintiffs timely.
rwa appeal 
rwa contends rwa did not engage in the sale of insurance under california law if it did violate california insurance law,that law is preempted by federal law california law,which prohibits an employer from charging an independent contractor the costs of his or her workers compensation insurance,is preempted by the faaaa the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs prejudgment interest.because rwa appeal presents solely issues of law on stipulated facts,our review is de novo.weingarten realty investors chiang th.
federal law preempts plaintiffs claim for unlawfully transacting insurance 
during all the years relevant to this action,rwa required each of its drivers to maintain automobile liability insurance,physical damage insurance,and cargo insurance for his or her vehicle.rwa gave each driver the option of accepting coverage under rwa fleet policies if the driver elected such coverage,rwa deducted the cost of the insurance from the driver earnings.during some years,rwa also deducted an additional administrative fee from the drivers earnings.
plaintiffs allege that these deductions or chargebacks constitute the transacting of insurance without a license in violation of the insurance code.rwa disagrees,contending that the chargebacks at issue do not violate the california insurance code in the alternative,rwa urges that if the chargebacks do violate california law,that law is preempted by federal law.we address these issues below and conclude that because the claim for unlawfully transacting insurance is preempted by federal law,the award of restitution and prejudgment interest as to the first cause of action must be reversed.
transacting insurance under california law 
insurance code section provides that unless exempt by the provisions of this article,a person shall not solicit,negotiate,or effect contracts of insurance,or act in any of the capacities defined in article commencing with section unless the person holds a valid insurance license.the capacities defined in article of the code include acting as an insurance broker,for compensation and on behalf of another person,transact ing insurance with,but not on behalf of,an admitted insurer,subd.a,italics added.
transacting insurance under section of the insurance code includes all of the following 
a solicitation.
b negotiations preliminary to execution.
c execution of a contract of insurance.
d transaction of matters subsequent to execution of the contract and arising out of it.
insurance code section,subdivision h provides that an individual need not hold a license to complete or deliver a declaration or certificate of coverage under a running inland marine insurance contract evidencing coverage thereunder and including only those negotiations as are necessary to the completion or delivery if the person performing those acts or his or her employer has an insurable interest in the risk covered by the certificate or declaration,so long as no commission is paid or allowed,directly or indirectly,by the insurer,creditor,retailer,or other person for acting in those capacities or engaging in those activities.
plaintiffs contend that by purchasing insurance for its drivers and charging the drivers an administrative fee,rwa transacted insurance for compensation within the meaning of the insurance code.further,plaintiffs urge that rwa does not come within the exemption of insurance code section,subdivision h,because not all the insurance coverage rwa provided its drivers was cargo insurance,and rwa recovered a commission for transacting insurance for its drivers.
for the reasons that follow,we believe that california insurance law,if interpreted as plaintiffs suggest,is preempted by federal law.we therefore assume for the sake of argument that rwa activities did violate california law and address the preemption issue below.
federal law governing chargebacks of insurance costs by federal motor carriers 
federal truth in leasing regulations 
as federal cases have recognized,motor carriers frequently prepay the costs of certain goods for which drivers ultimately may be responsible.the cost of these items then is deducted from drivers compensation in a process known as chargebacks.chargebacks are noted along with compensation on drivers weekly pay stubs,also known as settlement sheets or statements.owner operator independent drivers,swift transportation,cir swift.
the department of transportation is authorized to regulate the relationships between drivers and motor carriers,including required terms of their leases.the federal truth in leasing regulations,part,set forth specific requirements with regard to chargebacks.swift,supra,at,citing ooida swift transp.cir.
federally mandated motor carrier liability insurance 
section of title of the united states code requires federal motor carriers to carry specified levels of liability insurance,as follows liability insurance requirement.the secretary of transportation may register a motor carrier under section only if the registrant files with the secretary a bond,insurance policy,or other type of security approved by the secretary,in an amount not less than such amount as the secretary prescribes pursuant to,or as is required by,sections and,and the laws of the state or states in which the registrant is operating,to the extent applicable.the security must be sufficient to pay,not more than the amount of the security,for each final judgment against the registrant for bodily injury to,or death of,an individual resulting from the negligent operation,maintenance,or use of motor vehicles,or for loss or damage to property except property referred to in paragraph of this subsection,or both.a.the secretary may determine the type and amount of security filed under this section.d.
the truth in leasing regulations,section j,provide for the allocation of these insurance costs between motor carriers and drivers as follows 
insurance.the lease shall clearly specify the legal obligation of the authorized carrier to maintain insurance coverage for the protection of the public pursuant to fmcsa regulations under.the lease shall further specify who is responsible for providing any other insurance coverage for the operation of the leased equipment,such as bobtail insurance.if the authorized carrier will make a charge back to the lessor for any of this insurance,the lease shall specify the amount which will be to the lessor.
if the lessor purchases any insurance coverage for the operation of the leased equipment from or through the authorized carrier,the lease shall specify that the authorized carrier will provide the lessor with a copy of each policy upon the request of the lessor.also,where the lessor purchases such insurance in this manner,the lease shall specify that the authorized carrier will provide the lessor with a certificate of insurance for each such policy.each certificate of insurance shall include the name of the insurer,the policy number,the effective dates of the policy,the amounts and types of coverage,the cost to the lessor for each type of coverage,and the deductible amount for each type of coverage for which the lessor may be liable.
federal cases holding that motor carriers may lawfully charge back insurance costs to drivers 
the seventh circuit court of appeals considered whether section permits motor carriers to lawfully charge back to drivers the costs of liability insurance in owner operator independent drivers,mayflower transit,llc cir mayflower.there,defendant mayflower paid its truck drivers a negotiated price per mile,reduced by the cost of insurance in the form of a chargeback.some of the truckers sued,contending that the chargebacks violated section i,which provides that the lessor is not required to purchase or rent any products,equipment,or services from the authorized carrier as a condition of entering into the lease arrangement.the truckers contended that a requirement to reimburse mayflower for the cost of insurance constituted a purchase of insurance within the meaning of section i.id.at.
the seventh circuit disagreed.it explained plaintiffs treat the chargeback as a sale of insurance by mayflower.yet it is not an insurer.it is not authorized to underwrite risks.the regulation requires motor carriers to purchase insurance underwritten by real insurers,so that persons injured by a motor carrier operations may find a source of compensation more reliable than the motor carrier itself,which often is thinly capitalized.mayflower is a large and solvent firm that has been in business for decades it can pay for its own casualties and will do so indirectly because its insurer will set an premium that covers the costs of indemnity,plus a loading charge for the insurer administrative overhead.but many other motor carriers are small,and some would take too few precautions against accidents if they anticipated that a major loss would lead them to declare bankruptcy.then the owners would reap profits as they came in,and use the corporate shield of limited investors liability to protect themselves against tort judgments.the insurance requirement prevents that.and the regulation places on the motor carrier under whose certificate the service is rendered the obligation to secure insurance that makes enforcement much easier than placing a separate obligation on the many who own and lease a single truck.yet nothing in this rationale for mandatory insurance implies that lessors need not pay for the coverage secured through the motor carrier as we observed already,they will pay indirectly through lower rates per mile if they do not pay through a chargeback.mayflower,supra,at.
the court continued if this were not clear from the text of i and the fact that mayflower is not an insurer so it ca be selling insurance to the lessors,it is made clear by comparing i with j,which speaks to the topic.this subsection,captioned insurance,reads the lease shall clearly specify the legal obligation of the authorized carrier to maintain insurance coverage for the protection of the public pursuant to fmcsa regulations under.the lease shall further specify who is responsible for providing any other insurance coverage for the operation of the leased equipment,such as bobtail insurance.if the authorized carrier will make a charge back to the lessor for any of this insurance,the lease shall specify the amount which will be to the lessor.the reference to chargebacks in the third sentence is incompatible with the contention that chargebacks are sales forbidden by i.courts do not read regulations to create such a glaring,and unnecessary,inconsistency.
plaintiffs want us to read the third sentence,which speaks of chargebacks,as limited to the second,which deals with other insurance coverage such as bobtail insurance.but the third sentence refers to any of this insurance,and that construction is best understood as including the insurance mentioned in the whole subsection.it would have been easy to write if the authorized carrier will make a charge back to the lessor for any of the other insurance mentioned in the previous sentence,the lease shall specify the amount which will be to the lessor.but that not what the third sentence says.section j confirms our understanding of i a chargeback for the cost of insurance is not a sale of insurance.mayflower,supra,at.
the eighth circuit court of appeals reached a similar result in owner operator independent drivers asso.united van lines,llc cir united.there,individual truckers who leased trucks to united van lines,a federally registered motor carrier,alleged that united improperly charged back the cost of public liability and property damage insurance.the court disagreed the first sentence of j establishes that all carriers must maintain public liability and property damage insurance.the second sentence provides that carriers and drivers may decide who is responsible for maintaining other insurance,such as bobtail insurance.the third sentence permits the carrier to charge back to the driver any of this insurance.the inclusion of the word any and the exclusion of the word other signify that this insurance in the third sentence refers to all insurance referenced in the paragraph,not just to the insurance discussed in the previous sentence.id.at.the court also rejected the truckers contention that construing section j to permit chargebacks conflicted with federal motor carrier financial responsibility statutes,which the truckers urged reflected congress intent to bar insurance chargebacks so as to improve carriers level of care.the court explained without question,congress requires that motor carriers maintain adequate levels of insurance to protect the public and to encourage safer motor carrier operations.see.but the statutes requiring insurance and minimum levels of financial responsibility a and do not specify which party to a motor carrier lease must bear the cost of that insurance.thus,the legislation neither grants nor denies the secretary power to regulate compensation paid under lease arrangements.in these circumstances,we must apply the plain language of j reflecting the secretary decision not to dictate how these private parties must resolve this aspect of their financial arrangement.id.at.
federal cases holding that motor carriers may lawfully chargebacks to drivers 
in swift,supra,the ninth circuit considered the claim of independent drivers that motor carriers violated federal law by chargebacks.the court concluded that federal law permitted motor carriers to chargebacks,as long as the were not excessive.the court explained intended to curb excessive by motor carriers and level the playing field with regard to information about how are computed.see final rule,wl.however,drivers seem to erroneously equate excessive with any in this instance.see dc opinion order,wl,at.the district court,and virtually every court that has addressed the issue,has correctly concluded that profiting from is not per se unlawful.see also,owner operator indep.drivers ass landstar,ooida england,d,c that include profits and fees are not per se unlawful under h.thus,to ascribe to the regulations a purpose of eliminating carriers profits is unsustainable.swift,supra,at,fn.omitted.
mayflower and united stand for the proposition that federal law permits motor carriers to charge back the cost of liability insurance to their drivers.swift stands for the related proposition that federal law also permits motor carriers to profit from chargebacks by or charging an administrative fee on items.having thus established the state of federal law,we turn to the question before us whether these federal regulations preempt contrary state law.
federal preemption 
a preemption question is basically one of congressional intent.did congress,in enacting the federal statute,intend to exercise its constitutionally delegated authority to set aside the laws of a state if so,the supremacy clause requires courts to follow federal,not state,law.barnett bank of marion,nelson,citing,art.vi,cl.see also viva internat.voice for animals adidas promotional retail operations,cal th,viva international.parks mbna america bank,cal th,parks.
the supreme court has recognized four species of federal preemption express,conflict,obstacle,and field.viva international,supra,cal th at.first,express preemption arises when congress define s explicitly the extent to which its enactments state law.citation.citations.second,conflict preemption will be found when simultaneous compliance with both state and federal directives is impossible.citations.third,obstacle preemption arises when under the circumstances of a particular case,the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.citations.finally,field preemption,congress intent to all state law in a particular area,applies where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.citation.id.at accord,bronco wine jolly cal th,see also barnett bank,supra,at.parks,supra,cal th at.
we begin with obstacle preemption.obstacle preemption is implicated when state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of federal law.parks,supra,cal th at.such preemption may exist even where compliance with both federal and state law is not impossible,because federal law requires something that state law prohibits.id.at.rather,obstacle preemption may exist where state law prohibits something permitted but not required by federal law,thus standing as an obstacle to accomplishing the purposes of the federal law.
parks illustrates such circumstances.in parks,the california supreme court considered whether the national bank act of nba,which grants national banks all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking,preempted civil code section,a california law requiring that certain disclosures accompany preprinted checks issued by a credit card issuer to its cardholders.parks,supra,cal th at.specifically,section required that a credit card issuer that extended credit to a cardholder through preprinted checks convenience checks shall disclose on the front of an attachment that is affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check or draft,in clear and conspicuous language,all of the following information that use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account.the annual percentage rate and the calculation of finance charges,as required by section of regulation z of the code of federal regulations,associated with the use of the attached check or draft.whether the finance charges are triggered immediately upon the use of the check or draft.parks,supra,at.the federal nba did not require such disclosures.after using convenience checks that did not include the disclosures required by section,plaintiff sued his credit card company,mbna america bank mbna,on behalf of himself and similarly situated mbna customers,alleging that the bank engaged in unfair competition in violation of section by failing to make the disclosures mandated by section.id.at.
the supreme court held that plaintiff claims under sections and were preempted by the nba.parks,supra,cal th at.the court explained that the broad power granted by the nba to national banks to exercise all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking expressly included the power to loan money on personal security.id.at.the disclosure requirements in section purported to impose a condition on that federally granted power,providing that it could be exercised only if national banks offered credit through convenience checks containing specific disclosures.further,t he specific disclosure obligations imposed by section exceed any requirements in federal law.the requirement in section that disclosures appear on the front of an attachment that is affixed by perforation or other means to the preprinted check or draft has no counterpart in federal law.the same is true of section requirement that precise language use of the attached check or draft will constitute a charge against your credit account appear on each check,subd.a.in addition,although federal regulations require certain disclosures when the terms of using a convenience check differ from the terms of the customer credit account b,they do not mandate that every convenience check disclose w hether the finance charges are triggered immediately upon the use of the check,as section,subdivision a requires.id.at.
the court continued in characterizing the disclosure requirements of section,the court of appeal said that the statute does not forbid the exercise of a banking power authorized by the nba.section does not bar national banks from loaning money on personal security through convenience checks.it is true that section does not outlaw a category of banking activity.however,to say that mbna may offer convenience checks so long as it complies with section is equivalent to saying that mbna may not offer convenience checks unless it complies with section.whether phrased as a conditional permission or as a contingent prohibition,the effect of section is to forbid national banks from offering credit in the form of convenience checks unless they comply with state law.as demonstrated by the instant lawsuit brought under california unfair competition law bus,et,a national bank may be subject to monetary liability,and its convenience check offers may be enjoined,if it does not comply.parks,supra,cal th at.such a requirement,the court concluded,significantly impair s the exercise of authority granted to national banks by the nba.id.at.
further,the court said,although the disclosures required by california law were not themselves onerous,our preemption analysis must consider the burden of disclosure regimes imposed not just by california,but by all states in which the banks operate.watters wachovia bank.if disclosure requirements such as those in section were allowed to stand,national banks operating in multiple states would face the prospect of limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the states.citation.id.at.national banks would have to monitor requirements as to the content,language,manner,and format of disclosures for each of the states and possibly municipalities as well,and continually adjust their convenience check offers to comply with the prescriptions of each local jurisdiction.such d iverse and duplicative regulation of national banks engagement in the business of banking is precisely what the nba was designed to prevent.id.at.parks,supra,cal th at.
applying the principles articulated in parks,we conclude that if state insurance laws prohibit rwa from charging back its liability insurance costs to its drivers,those laws are preempted by section.as we have said,section permits motor carriers to charge back liability insurance costs to its drivers,so long as the amounts of those chargebacks are clearly specified.in contrast,if california insurance law is interpreted as plaintiffs suggest,it would forbid such chargebacks unless the motor carriers were licensed to sell insurance.thus,under plaintiffs interpretation of california law,it would prohibit precisely the kind of chargebacks that federal law permits.
as in parks,there is no indication here that congress intended to subject the rights granted by federal regulation to state or local restriction.parks,supra,cal th at.and,as in parks,if the present state law is enforceable against federal motor carriers,motor carriers may be subject to monetary liability if they do not comply with state law.thus,as in parks,requiring compliance with state insurance regulation as a condition of charging back insurance costs to drivers under the federal motor carrier act would significantly impair the exercise of authority granted under federal law.id.at.further,if the state insurance law at issue is allowed to stand,motor carriers operating in multiple states would face the prospect of limitations and restrictions as various and as numerous as the states.citation.citation.ibid.federal motor carriers would have to monitor chargeback requirements for each of the states and continually adjust their leases with drivers to comply with the prescriptions of each local jurisdiction.such d iverse and duplicative regulation is precisely what the faaaa was designed to prevent.citation.id.at.
plaintiffs contend that obstacle preemption can not apply where congress has expressly defined the scope of preemption,but we do not agree.as our supreme court has explained in freightliner myrick,the court clarified the relation between express preemption clauses and implied preemption doctrines,explaining that an express definition of the reach of a statute implies,supports a reasonable inference that congress did not intend to other matters,but the express clause does not entirely foreclose any possibility of implied.martinez regents of university of california cal th,italics added see also freightliner myrick,supra,at as an initial matter,we must address the argument that we need not reach the conflict issue at all.according to respondents and the court of appeals,cipollone liggett group,held that implied can not exist when congress has chosen to include an express clause in a statute.this argument is without merit,italics added.
plaintiffs also contend that the mccarran ferguson act,title of the united states code section,prohibits the court from finding that the faaaa preempts provisions of the insurance code.again,we do not agree.the mccarran ferguson act provides no act of congress shall be construed to invalidate,impair,or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance,or which imposes a fee or tax upon such business,unless such act specifically relates to the business of insurance.b,italics added.this act preserves a state statute from federal preemption where the state statute has been enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance application of the relevant federal statute would invalidate,impair,or supersede that state statute and the federal statute does not itself specifically relate to the business of insurance.citations.as the united states supreme court has explained,consistent with congress clear mandate under the mccarran ferguson act,state laws enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance do not yield to conflicting federal statutes unless a federal statute specifically requires otherwise.citations.pagarigan superior court th.
in the present case,the controlling federal statutes and rules clearly relate to the business of insurance.title united states code section requires motor carriers to file a bond or insurance policy section authorizes the secretary of transportation to prescribe regulations to require minimum levels of financial responsibility sufficient to satisfy liability amounts established by the secretary covering public liability,property damage,and environmental restoration for the transportation of property by motor carrier and section authorizes the secretary of transportation to require motor carriers using motor vehicles owned by others to obtain liability and cargo insurance on them.these powers are implemented through section j,which is entitled insurance and requires that leases between motor carriers and drivers shall clearly specify the legal obligation of the authorized carrier to maintain insurance coverage for the protection of the public pursuant to fmcsa regulations under and shall further specify who is responsible for providing any other insurance coverage for the operation of the leased equipment,such as bobtail insurance.italics added.
plaintiffs contend,finally,that even if rwa did not violate the insurance code,it violated section because it did not provide its drivers with certificates of insurance that specified the cost to the drivers of each kind of insurance coverage.whatever the merits of this argument,it was neither pled in the operative complaint nor litigated in the trial court,and thus we do not reach it.
ii.the faaaa does not preempt california law prohibiting employers from seeking reimbursement from independent contractors for the cost of workers compensation insurance 
during some of the years relevant to this action,rwa charged back to plaintiffs rwa costs for workers compensation insurance.plaintiffs contend this violated section,as interpreted by albillo,supra,th.rwa agrees that charging plaintiffs for workers compensation insurance violated california law,but urges that the state law is expressly preempted by the faaaa.for the reasons that follow,plaintiffs are correct.we conclude that because section is not preempted by federal law,the award of restitution under the second cause of action was proper.
a.the workers compensation law 
the workers compensation law,et is a comprehensive statutory scheme that governs the compensation provided to california employees for injuries occurring during the course and scope of their employment.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,the underlying premise behind this statutorily created system of workers compensation is the compensation bargain.citation.pursuant to this presumed bargain,the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.citation.id.at.albillo,supra,th at.
independent contractors are not,by statute,subject to the workers compensation laws.however,pursuant to labor code section,employers and independent contractors may elect to come under the compensation provisions of this division,including the workers compensation provisions.
section,subdivision a prohibits employers from deducting the cost of workers compensation insurance from employee wages stated simply,this provision requires the employer to bear the entire cost of securing compensation.albillo,supra,th at.the california courts of appeal have interpreted section to apply to independent contractors who have elected to come within the workers compensation insurance system.albillo,supra,at.thus,under california law,p arties who elect to come under the compensation provisions of this division necessarily elect to come under labor code section,which bars employers from requiring independent contractors to cover any portion of the cost of compensation.albillo,supra,at.
the parties agree that under california law specifically,section and albillo rwa could not lawfully have charged the plaintiff class for the cost of workers compensation insurance.rwa contends,however,that the faaaa expressly preempts california law in this area and,therefore,charging plaintiffs for workers compensation insurance was not unlawful.plaintiffs disagree,contending that section and albillo are not preempted by the faaaa.
b.the faaaa 
in,congress determin ed that maximum reliance on competitive market forces would favor lower airline fares and better airline service,and it enacted the airline deregulation act ada.morales trans world airlines,morales quoting.a ed.see stat.in order to ensure that the states would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,that act included a provision that said no state shall enact or enforce any law relating to rates,routes,or services of any air carrier.morales,supra,at.a ed.rowe new hampshire motor transport,rowe.
in,congress deregulated trucking.see motor carrier act of,stat.in,congress similarly sought to preempt state trucking regulation through the faaaa.in doing so,it modeled its preemption provision on the ada as follows a state may not enact or enforce a law related to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier with respect to the transportation of property.c see rowe,supra,at.
because the relevant preemption language of the ada and faaaa are so closely related,the united states supreme court has relied on its ada jurisprudence to interpret the scope of faaaa preemption.rowe,supra,at.
supreme court ada and faaaa preemption decisions 
the united states supreme court first considered the scope of ada preemption in morales,supra.there,the issue before the court was whether the ada preempted air travel industry enforcement guidelines guidelines adopted by state attorneys general that contain ed detailed standards governing the content and format of airline advertising,the awarding of premiums to regular customers frequent flyers,and the payment of compensation to passengers who voluntarily yield their seats on overbooked flights.id.at.these guidelines purported not to create any new laws or regulations,but instead claimed to explain in detail how existing state laws apply to air fare advertising and frequent flyer programs.ibid.
the court concluded that the guidelines were preempted by the ada.it explained that the ordinary meaning of relating to is broad to stand in some relation to have bearing or concern to pertain refer to bring into association with or connection with,black law dictionary ed.and the words thus express a broad purpose.morales,supra,at.accordingly,s tate enforcement actions having a connection with or reference to airline rates,routes,or services are under.a.morales,supra,at,italics added.applying this standard,the court concluded that the guidelines quite obviously related to fares.morales,supra,at.it explained one can not avoid the conclusion that the guidelines relate to airline rates.in its terms,every one of the guidelines enumerated above bears a reference to airfares.citation.and,collectively,the guidelines establish binding requirements as to how tickets may be marketed if they are to be sold at given prices.id.at.moreover,beyond the guidelines express reference to fares,it is clear as an economic matter that state restrictions on fare advertising have the forbidden significant effect upon fares because a dvertising serves to inform the public of the prices of products and services,and thus performs an indispensable role in the allocation of resources.id.at.thus,the court held the fare advertising provisions of the guidelines were preempted by the ada.id.at.
the supreme court applied its preemptions analysis to the faaaa in rowe,supra.there,it considered whether the faaaa preempted two provisions of maine law that regulated the delivery of tobacco to customers within the state.id.at.the court noted that in morales,it had described congress goal in enacting the ada as helping assure transportation rates,routes,and services that reflect maximum reliance on competitive market forces,thereby stimulating efficiency,innovation,and low prices,as well as variety and quality.rowe,supra,at.thus,morales had held that s tate enforcement actions having a connection with,or reference to carrier rates,routes,or services are citation emphasis added that such may occur even if a state law effect on rates,routes or services is only indirect citation that,in respect to,it makes no difference whether a state law is consistent or inconsistent with federal regulation citation and that occurs at least where state laws have a significant impact related to congress deregulatory and objectives citation.rowe,supra,at.morales further said that federal law might not state laws that affect fares in only a tenuous,remote,or peripheral manner.rowe,supra,at.however,the court noted,morales did not say where,or how,it would be appropriate to draw the line,for the state law before it did not present a borderline question.ibid.
the court held that the maine tobacco law was preempted by the faaaa because it has a significant and adverse impact in respect to the federal act ability to achieve its objectives.rowe,supra,at.it explained the solicitor general and the carrier associations claim and maine does not deny that the law will require carriers to offer a system of services that the market does not now provide and which the carriers would prefer not to offer.and even were that not so,the law would freeze into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.the maine law thereby produces the very effect that the federal law sought to avoid,namely,a state direct substitution of its own governmental commands for competitive market forces in determining to a significant degree the services that motor carriers will provide.id.at.
the court concluded the provision requires the carrier to check each shipment for certain markings and to compare it against the maine attorney general list of proscribed shippers.and it thereby directly regulates a significant aspect of the motor carrier package pickup and delivery service.in this way it creates the kind of regulation that the federal act.t o interpret the federal law to permit these,and similar,state requirements could easily lead to a patchwork of state laws,rules,and regulations.that state regulatory patchwork is inconsistent with congress major legislative effort to leave such decisions,where federally unregulated,to the competitive marketplace.rowe,supra,at.
dillingham 
the supreme court considered whether state labor laws were preempted by the federal employee retirement income security act of erisa in california division of labor standards enforcement dillingham construction,dillingham.there,a california law required contractors on public works projects to pay their workers the prevailing wage in the projects locale.an exception to that requirement permitted a contractor to pay lower wages to workers participating in approved apprenticeship programs.before the court in dillingham was whether erisa preemption provision which provided that erisa shall supersede state laws insofar as they relate d to any employee benefit plan a preempted california prevailing wage law to the extent that the wage law prohibited paying an apprentice wage to an apprentice trained in an unapproved program.
the court said that a law relate s to a covered benefit plan for purposes of section,subdivision a if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.dillingham,supra,at.it explained that where a state law acts immediately and exclusively upon erisa plans,or where the existence of erisa plans is essential to the law operation,that reference will result in pre emption.id.at.further,a law that does not refer to erisa plans may yet be if it has a connection with erisa plans.ibid.t o determine whether a state law has the forbidden connection,we look both to the objectives of the erisa statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that congress understood would survive,citation,as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on erisa plans,citation.ibid.in doing so,a s is always the case in our jurisprudence,where federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional state regulation,we have worked on the assumption that the historic police powers of the states were not to be superseded by the federal act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.citations.ibid.
the court concluded that the prevailing wage law did not explicitly make reference to erisa plans,and thus it was not barred by the second prong of the test.dillingham,supra,at.the law also did not ha ve a connection with erisa plans,and thus was not barred by the first prong of the test,because it had only an indirect economic influence on such plans.id.at.the court explained the wages to be paid on public works projects and the substantive standards to be applied to apprenticeship training programs are quite remote from the areas with which erisa is expressly concerned reporting,disclosure,fiduciary responsibility,and the like.new york state conf.of blue cross blue shield plans travelers ins,quoting shaw delta air lines.a reading of a resulting in the pre emption of traditionally substantive law in those areas where erisa has nothing to say would be unsettling,travelers,at.dillingham,supra,at.
the court continued t he apprenticeship portion of the prevailing wage statute does not bind erisa plans to anything.no apprenticeship program is required by california law to meet california standards.see southern cal.abc,cal th,at.if a contractor chooses to hire apprentices for a public works project,it need not hire them from an approved program although if it does not,it must pay these apprentices journeyman wages.so,apprenticeship programs that have not gained california apprenticeship council approval may still supply public works contractors with apprentices.unapproved apprenticeship programs also may supply apprentices to private contractors.the effect of on erisa apprenticeship programs,therefore,is merely to provide some measure of economic incentive to comport with the state requirements,at least to the extent that those programs seek to provide apprentices who can work on public works projects at a lower wage it can not be gainsaid that has the effect of encouraging apprenticeship programs including erisa plans to meet the standards set out by california,but it has not been demonstrated here that the added inducement created by the wage break available on state public works projects is tantamount to a compulsion upon apprenticeship programs.dillingham,supra,at,fns.omitted.
the court concluded the prevailing wage statute alters the incentives,but does not dictate the choices,facing erisa plans.in this regard,it is no different from myriad state laws in areas traditionally subject to local regulation,which congress could not possibly have intended to eliminate.travelers,at.we could not hold pre empted a state law in an area of traditional state regulation based on so tenuous a relation without doing grave violence to our presumption that congress intended nothing of the sort.we thus conclude that california prevailing wage laws and apprenticeship standards do not have a connection with,and therefore do not relate to,erisa plans.dillingham,supra,at.
lower federal court decisions addressing the effect of faaaa preemption on state labor laws 
following morales,rowe,and dillingham,the lower federal courts have struggled with the scope of faaaa preemption,particularly as applied to state labor laws.a case illustrating this struggle is californians for safe and competitive dump truck transp.mendonca,supra,mendonca.there,the ninth circuit considered whether the faaaa preempted enforcement of california prevailing wage law cpwl.under that law,contractors and subcontractors awarded public works contracts were required to pay their workers not less than the general prevailing rate for work of a similar character in the locality in which the public work is performed,and contractors who failed to pay prevailing wages were assessed penalties.mendonca,supra,at.plaintiffs,public works contractors who provided transportation on projects in california,failed to pay their workers prevailing wages and were assessed penalties by california enforcement authorities.thereafter,plaintiffs filed suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief,claiming that enforcement of the cpwl violated the supremacy clause of the united states constitution because the faaaa preempted the cpwl.ibid.
the ninth circuit held that the faaaa did not preempt the cpwl.it began by noting that state laws dealing with matters traditionally within a state police powers,such as prevailing wage laws,should not be found to be preempted unless congress intent to do so was clear.mendonca,supra,at.here,congress had expressed no such clear intent.the court explained while cpwl in a certain sense is related to plaintiffs prices,routes and services,we hold that the effect is no more than indirect,remote,and tenuous.see dillingham.at.we do not believe that cpwl frustrates the purpose of deregulation by acutely interfering with the forces of competition.see travelers,at.nor can it be said,borrowing from justice scalia concurrence in dillingham,that cpwl falls into the field of laws regulating prices,routes,or services.see dillingham.at.accordingly,we hold that cpwl is not related to plaintiffs prices,routes,and services within the meaning of the faaa act preemption clause.mendonca,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the court reached a similar conclusion in air transport asso.of america city and county of san francisco cir air transport.there,a provision of san francisco administrative code required city contractors to provide employee benefits to the domestic partners of employees,whether married or registered with a government entity.plaintiffs united airlines,federal express,and others airlines urged that the city ordinance was preempted by the ada.id.at.specifically,the airlines urged that there was a forbidden connection with routes and services because if they did not comply with the ordinance,they would be unable to lease property at san francisco international airport sfo.the court disagreed what the airlines are truly complaining about are free market forces and their own competitive decisions.whatever leverage the city has in its negotiations over the airlines is created by the market conditions that were allowed to blossom through the passage of the ada.the ada allows air carriers to make their own decisions about where to fly and how many resources to devote to each route and service.in this deregulated environment,airlines can decide whether or not to make large economic investments at the san francisco airport.now,as the airlines claim,because of competitive demands and the economic commitments made to respond to those demands,they are committed to staying at san francisco.that economic decision may mean the airlines will have to agree to abide by the ordinance nondiscrimination requirements as a cost of maintaining their leases at sfo.that san francisco may have bargaining power because of the airlines competitive decisions does not,however,thereby disable san francisco from enforcing its nondiscrimination ordinance it is not using that power to force the airlines to adopt or change their prices,routes or services the prerequisite for ada preemption.
indeed,the costs of providing the domestic partner employment benefits at issue here the only costs the airlines complained about are a small,if not inconsequential,fraction of the airlines costs of flying through sfo the airlines could comply with the ordinance requirements by reducing or eliminating these benefits altogether,thereby avoiding any additional costs.moreover,some of the plaintiffs have actually begun extending employment benefits to their employees domestic partners on a nationwide basis during the pendency of this appeal,even though they were not obligated to do so under the ordinance.this further evidences that the costs of providing these benefits are not enough to compel the airlines to change their routes and services.citation.hypothetically,there might be some contract term the city could demand whose costs would be so high that it would compel the airlines to change their prices,routes or services.citation.the nondiscrimination provisions at issue here,however,do not approach that level.air transport,supra,at,fn.omitted.
the court reached a contrary result in dilts penske logistics,llc d dilts.there,defendant penske hired hourly employees to provide warehouse and warehouse management services to whirlpool corporation in california.penske employees received customer orders,caused appliances to be manufactured outside california and then delivered to whirlpool warehouses,inventoried the appliances,loaded appliances onto trucks,and then delivered appliances to customers.id.at.because penske expected employees to take meal breaks,it automatically deducted minutes from its employees work time without inquiry into whether the employee was actually provided with a timely minute uninterrupted and meal period.id.at.plaintiffs,hourly appliance delivery drivers and installers assigned to penske whirlpool account,sued,alleging violations of several provisions of the california labor code as well as unfair business practices in violation of business and professions code section.penske moved for summary judgment,contending that all of plaintiffs causes of action were preempted by the faaaa.id.at.
the district court granted summary judgment,finding that plaintiffs claims were preempted by the faaaa.it explained that although state law need not directly regulate motor carriers to be preempted,a law will be preempted if its effect is such that motor carriers would have to offer different services than what the market would otherwise dictate or freeze into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future.see rowe,at the effect of the regulation is that carriers will have to offer tobacco delivery services that differ significantly from those that,in the absence of the regulation,the market might dictate.dilts,supra,d at.the court noted,however,that neither morales nor rowe indicate exactly where,or how,it would be appropriate to draw the line between a significant impact and a tenuous effect because neither of the state laws at issue in those cases presented a borderline question.morales,at rowe,at.dilts,supra,at.
the court continued in a very recent decision,the ninth circuit examined a borderline case of federal preemption under the faaa act.see am.trucking,city of los angeles,cir.american trucking acknowledged that t he waters are murkier when a state does not directly regulate or even specifically reference rates,routes,or services.id.at.recognizing that preemption by the faaa act may occur even when the effect on rates,routes,and services is only indirect,american trucking sets out the proper inquiry in borderline cases where the effect on prices,routes,and services may be close to merely tenuous or remote the proper inquiry is whether the provision,directly or indirectly,binds the carrier to a particular price,route or service and thereby interferes with competitive market forces within the industry.id.citing air transport ass of am.city cnty.of san francisco,cir.air transport considered whether a city ordinance relating to equal protection of domestic partners had an effect on the routes of airlines,finding that the ordinance was not preempted because it can not be said to compel or bind the airlines to a particular route or service,even though it might require airlines to increase their rates or cease operating at san francisco airport.air transport,at.in spite of the ordinance,air carriers could still make their own decisions about where to fly and how many resources to devote to each route and service.id.at.
thus,american trucking and air transport make clear that the court task here is to determine whether these laws,which do not directly target the motor carrier industry,bind penske prices,routes,or services and thereby interfere with competitive market forces within the industry.although it is a close question,the court finds that they do.
penske argues these m rb meal and rest break laws have a significant effect on the routes of a motor carrier.the fairly rigid meal and break requirements impact the types and lengths of routes that are feasible.the five stops plaintiffs insist penske should have ensured at specified times in a hour workday would thus have necessarily forced drivers to alter their routes daily while searching out an appropriate place to exit the highway,and locating stopping places that safely and lawfully accommodate their vehicles.while the laws do not strictly bind penske drivers to one particular route,they have the same effect by depriving them of the ability to take any route that does not offer adequate locations for stopping,or by forcing them to take shorter or fewer routes.in essence,the laws bind motor carriers to a smaller set of possible routes.
additionally,the m rb laws have a significant impact on penske services.the parties both agree that scheduling meal periods for drivers would require one or two less deliveries per day per driver.penske states further that the mandated minute rest periods every four hours preferably in the middle of the period and minute meal breaks every five hours reduce driver flexibility,interfere with customer service,and,by virtue of simple mathematics,reduce the amount of work time allowable to drivers and thus reduce the amount and level of service penske can offer its customers without increasing its workforce and investment in equipment.id.plaintiffs do not contest these facts.
here,the length and timing of meal and rest breaks seems directly and significantly related to such things as the frequency and scheduling of transportation.both parties agree that the m rb laws impact the number of routes each may go on each day,and plaintiffs do not oppose penske argument that the laws impact the types of roads their may take and the amount of time it takes them to reach their destination from the warehouse.the connection to schedules,origins,and destinations is far from tenuous.while penske has not shown that the m rb laws would prevent them from serving certain markets,the laws bind penske to a schedule and frequency of routes that ensures many breaks at specific times throughout the workday in such a way that would interfere with competitive market forces within the industry.
t o allow california to insist exactly when and for exactly how long carriers provide breaks for their employees would allow other states to do the same,and to do so differently.and to interpret the federal law to permit these,and similar,state requirements could easily lead to a patchwork of state laws,rules,and regulations.id.thus,the court finds state regulation of details significantly impacting the routes or services of the carrier transportation itself preempted by the faaa act.dilts,supra,d at,internal record citations omitted.
fitz gerald skywest airlines.
division six of this district considered the effect of ada preemption on state wage and hour laws in fitz gerald skywest airlines,th fitz gerald.there,plaintiffs were flight attendants who sued their employer for unpaid minimum wages,unpaid meal and rest breaks,overtime,waiting time penalties,and violations of the ucl.id.at.in the main portion of the opinion,the court concluded that plaintiffs claims were preempted by the federal railway labor act et.in the alternative,the court considered whether plaintiffs claims were also preempted by the ada.the court held that the ada did not preempt plaintiffs causes of action for violations of state labor law,explaining skywest cites no authority that the ada preempts actions to enforce state minimum wage laws or state laws governing breaks.although the ada has been broadly interpreted as preempting state enforcement actions having a connection with,or reflect to,airline rates,routes,or services,it has its limits.morales,supra,at.if the rule was otherwise,any string of contingencies is sufficient to establish a connection with price,route or service,and there will be no end to ada preemption.citations.air transport city and county of san francisco.fitz gerald,supra,at.the court reached a different result,however,with regard to plaintiffs ucl cause of action,which apparently was based on the underlying labor code violations.in that regard,it concluded without analysis that b ased on morales and american airlines,wolens,we conclude that the ada bars the fifth cause of action for relief under the california unfair business practices act.fitz gerald,supra,at.
as we have said,the faaaa preempts state laws that relate to a price,route,or service of any motor carrier.c rowe,supra,at.taken together,the cases discussed above hold that a state law relates to federal law if it has a connection with or reference to the subject of the federal law.preemption may occur even if the state law effect is only indirect,but there is no preemption if that effect is only tenuous,remote,or peripheral.rowe,supra,at.generally applicable state labor laws are not preempted if they do not acutely interfere with the forces of competition or prevent carriers from making their own decisions about routes and how many resources to devote to each route and service.mendonca,supra,at air transport,supra,at.however,if the state labor laws are such that they bind the motor carrier prices,routes,or services,they interfere with competitive market forces and are preempted by the faaaa.dilts,supra,d at.
here,both plaintiffs and rwa appear to agree that the california laws at issue do not reference motor carrier prices,routes,or services within the meaning of morales,rowe,and dillingham.that is plainly true section is a law of general application that does not apply exclusively to motor carriers.the law therefore does not act immediately and exclusively upon motor carriers.further,the existence of motor carriers is not essential to the law operation.dillingham,supra,at.therefore,section does not reference motor carrier prices,routes,or services.
we turn therefore to the second part of the analysis whether section and albillo have a connection with motor carrier prices,routes,or services within the meaning of morales,rowe,and dillingham.for the following reasons,they do not.
first,as in dillingham,the laws at issue concern the exercise of the state historic police powers.dillingham,supra,at.examples of historic police powers include c hild labor laws,minimum and other wage laws,laws affecting occupational health and safety,and workmen compensation laws.de canas bica.states possess broad authority under their police powers to regulate the employment relationship to protect workers within the state.ibid.farmer brothers coffee workers comp.appeals bd.th,italics added.under these circumstances,there can be no federal preemption unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.dillingham,supra,at.
moreover,as in dillingham and as distinct from morales and rowe the workers compensation laws at issue have only an indirect economic influence on motor carriers.that is,unlike the statutes at issue in morales and rowe,the workers compensation laws at issue here neither establish binding requirements as to how the motor carriers products may be marketed morales,supra,at,nor freeze into place services that carriers might prefer to discontinue in the future rowe,supra,at.indeed,as in dillingham,the laws at issue do not bind motor carriers to anything.dillingham,supra,at.specifically,they do not require california motor carriers to purchase workers compensation insurance for their independent contractors.they merely provide that if motor carriers choose to purchase such workers compensation insurance,the motor carriers can not pass the costs of that insurance on to their independent contractors.whether motor carriers purchase workers compensation insurance is entirely their own decision state law does not force their hand in this regard.as in dillingham,state law may alter the incentives,but does not dictate the choices facing motor carriers.id.at.
rwa urges that section has a direct connection with prices because it transfers an operating expense from the contract trucker to the motor carrier,necessarily undermin ing the pricing decision the motor carrier made when determining what to charge its customers.this has the effect,rwa contends,of substituting a governmental policy for the forces of free market competition and,thus,is preempted by the faaaa.we do not agree.the crux of rwa preemption argument is that the effect of california law,as interpreted by albillo,is to increase its operating expenses and,thus,decrease its profitability.as we have said,however,california law does not require rwa to purchase workers compensation insurance for its independent contractors.to the extent that motor carriers incur workers compensation insurance expenses on behalf of their independent contractors,it is because they choose to purchase workers compensation insurance not because state law mandates that they do so.
moreover,on the present record there is no evidence that section increases rwa operating expenses.under california law,employers such as rwa may choose to forgo workers compensation insurance for their independent contractors thus exposing themselves to the wider range of damages potentially available in tort albillo,supra,th at or they may purchase workers compensation insurance,which eliminates a worker tort recovery in most cases.there is before us no evidence that purchasing workers compensation insurance increased rwa operating expenses over what they would have been had rwa chosen not to purchase that insurance.indeed,rwa presumably chose to purchase workers compensation insurance because it believed that doing so would decrease,not increase,its expenses.
rwa also contends that albillo affects rwa services because rwa may or may not be a less attractive place for a contract trucker to work and t he environment in which the contract trucker works has a direct effect on the quality of rwa service to its customers.rwa argument seems to suggest a direct connection between the services rwa offers its drivers and the services it offers its customers.rwa cites no authority for this proposition,nor are we aware of any.in any event,we reject this contention for the same reason we rejected the suggestion of an effect on price nothing in california law requires rwa to provide workers compensation insurance for its independent contractors.
finally,rwa cites fitz gerald for the proposition that the faaaa preempts all ucl causes of action,even if the underlying labor laws on which the ucl causes of action are based are not themselves preempted.although fitz gerald appears to so hold,it does not explain or justify its conclusion other than by a brief reference to morales and wolens.fitz gerald,supra,th at.thus,like the court of appeal in pac anchor,supra,th see fn,ante,we respectfully disagree with fitz gerald and conclude that where a cause of action is based on allegations of unlawful violations of the state labor laws,there is no reason to find preemption merely because the pleading raised these issues under the ucl,rather than directly under the provisions of the labor code alleged to have been violated.
for all of these reasons,we conclude that section,as interpreted by albillo,is not preempted by the faaaa.the trial court did not err in so concluding.
iii.the trial court erred in awarding plaintiffs prejudgment interest under civil code section 
th
