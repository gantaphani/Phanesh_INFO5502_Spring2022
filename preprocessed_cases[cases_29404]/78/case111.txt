knowing that his therapist,fred davis,would convey his threat to its target,john auster informed davis that unless the managers of his workers compensation claim continued to pay the benefits that he believed he was owed,he would carry out his plan of violent retribution against them and others.the authorities were called,auster arrested and indicted for extortion.though denying his motion to dismiss the indictment,the district court ruled that communications between auster and his therapist were inadmissible at trial under the privilege.the government appeals that interim order,and we reverse and remand,because auster had no reasonable expectation of confidentiality when he made his threat.
auster,a retired new orleans police officer,has been receiving workers compensation benefits since.cannon cochran management services,ccmsi,manages auster benefit claim.auster is treated for paranoia,anger,and depression and has threatened various individuals over the years.he often makes his threats during sessions with his two therapists,davis and harold ginzburg,and his therapists then to their duty to warn his threats to their targets.auster admits that he is aware that his threats are communicated in that way 
auster relationship with ccmsi is strained.his anger regarding the administration of workers compensation settlement is a frequent topic of therapy.in the past,after particularly troubling sessions,auster therapists have felt compelled to warn ccmsi employees about his potential for violence.
in september,ccmsi informed auster that it would stop paying a portion of his benefits beginning on october.on september,auster discussed the pending partial termination of benefits with davis,specifically threatening ccmsi personnel,city authorities,and police officials.davis sent keith smith,a ccmsi employee responsible for auster claim,a letter warning that it was auster position that if ccmis sic persists in their position,that would serve as a provocation for him to carry out his plan of violent retribution against a list of persons he feels have caused him injury.davis alerted ccmsi that auster had stated that he possessed stockpiles of weapons and supplies to provide the basis for his actions.october was marked as the date of violent retribution.
when smith received davis letter,he became concerned,bought a gun for,and called the police,who notified the fbi auster was arrested on september.the united states filed an extortion complaint against auster under alleging that he made his threat with knowledge and intent that davis would convey it to ccmsi,thereby causing ccmsi to submit to his demands.the magistrate judge and district court,respectively,held detention hearings and took evidence.
auster unsuccessfully moved to dismiss the complaint a grand jury indicted him for attempt ing to obtain property of ccmsi with the consent of ccmsi having been induced by the wrongful use of threatened force,violence and fear,in that the defendant did communicate to ccmsi,via his treating psychotherapist,his threat of violence if his benefits were reduced.
before the indictment issued,auster unsuccessfully argued to the magistrate judge that the communications between him and davis were privileged.after a hearing,the court suppressed the communications,citing the privilege.
except as otherwise required by the constitution of the united states or other authority listed in rule,privilege s shall be governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the united states in the light of reason and experience.united states robinson,cir quoting fed.evid.we review factual findings underlying a privilege ruling for clear error and the application of legal principles de novo.id.
for more than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public in the words sanctioned by lord hardwicke has a right to every man evidence.united states bryan.internal citations and quotations omitted.this fundamental principle,trammel united states,d,counsels that privileges are not lightly created nor expansively construed,for they are in derogation of the search for truth.united states nixon,d.
the privilege is a recognized privilege though declining to delineate the privilege full contours in a way that would govern all conceivable future questions in this area,jaffee redmond,d,the court recognized that this privilege can be appropriate in certain circumstances the court,however,mindful of the burden imposed on the judiciary function,unambiguously limited the privilege applicability to those instances in which the patient statement was made in confidence,holding that the privilege covers confidential communications made to licensed psychiatrists and psychologists,and confidential communications made to licensed social workers in the course of psychotherapy.id.at.emphasis added.
jaffee explicit confidentiality requirement is fatal to auster claim of privilege.because auster knew,when he made the september threat,that it would be forwarded to ccmsi,his privilege claim fails,because he had no reasonable basis to conclude that the statement was confidential.as a matter of law,where the confidentiality requirement has not been satisfied,the with other does not apply.
auster was informed repeatedly by his therapists that his violent threats,although made during therapy,would be communicated to his potential victims that is unremarkable his therapists have a tarasoff to convey significant threat s of physical violence against clearly identified victims,and they also have an ethical duty to inform auster of that legal duty consequently,when auster made the threat,he knew it would be relayed to ccmsi he therefore had no reasonable expectation of confidentiality,robinson,at,in his threatening statement,and without such a reasonable expectation,there is no privilege.
the federal circuits are in disagreement in this regard.the sixth and ninth circuits have held that such statements,though made without a reasonable expectation of confidentiality,are nonetheless privileged and the tenth circuit has held that,in such situations,the privilege must give way,though for reasons different from those we have articulated we respectfully disagree with those circuits that have extended jaffee by holding that even if a patient knows that a threat is not made in confidence,any statements made to the therapist are privileged in a federal trial.those courts have held,thus,that confidentiality is not a requirement for the applicability of the privilege,the ninth circuit holding being explicit in that regard that is not in accord with jaffee or testimonial privileges is open to question.
in support for their position,the sixth and ninth circuits assert that i f the federal evidentiary privilege were tied to the states disclosure laws,then similarly situated patients would face different rules of evidence in federal criminal trials,chase,at,and it can not be the case that the scope of a federal testimonial privilege should vary depending upon state determinations of what constitutes reasonable professional conduct,hayes,at.but this misunderstands the effect of state law.federal law does not depend on state law but instead is turning on the lack of confidentiality,regardless of the reason.though,in certain instances,state law may play a role in negating confidentiality just as other factors can nullify it,the presence of third,the operative test is a federal one whether there was a reasonable expectation of confidentiality when the statement was made.
likewise,both the sixth and ninth circuits erroneously conclude that in weighing the pros and cons of extending the privilege,the harm in permitting material obtained from a therapy session into a criminal trial outweighs its benefits.this is a miscalculation.it is true that in jaffee,at,the court noted that the private ends served by a privilege include an atmosphere of confidence and trust,something that is necessary for effective therapy.and,at the same time,the court observed that the privilege can be relatively costless,because w ithout a privilege,much of the desirable evidence to which litigants seek access is unlikely to come into being.id.at.these considerations led the court to conclude that the privilege,at least in some form,should be recognized.
but,as the jaffee court implicitly recognized by explicitly requiring confidentiality this calculation is inapt where the patient already knows the confidence will not be kept.consider the marginal impact on effective therapy of allowing a statement into evidence that the patient knew would be communicated to third parties when he uttered it in such a case,the atmosphere of confidence and trust has already been severely undermined now,the patient target and deepest enemy,the person the deranged individual hates so much that he plans to kill him,chase,at kleinfeld,concurring,knows the patient secret.and for sincere threats,the target can now defend himself.if the therapist professional duty to thwart the patient plans has not already chilled the patient willingness to speak candidly,it is doubtful that the possibility that the therapist might also testify in federal court will do so 
the deleterious effect of a tarasoff warning on the atmosphere of confidence and trust is further reinforced by the knowledge that the intimate details of therapy will be spread to more than just the target of the threat there is,after all,no obligation that the target keep the tarasoff warning confidential,and it is unrealistic to believe that he will do so there are likely mutual acquaintances between the target and the,friends,the target will almost certainly tell them,if for no other reason than to let them know that there is a potentially serious problem with the patient and that everyone ought to be on the lookout for trouble.
thus,knowing that anyone,or everyone,might be privy to the secret will embarrass the patient and will detrimentally affect his relationships with others.such a tarasoff disclosure might also cost the patient his job.the marginal increase,therefore,in effective therapy achieved by privileging communications at trial,but still allowing the therapist to warn threatened third parties,is de minimis.
moreover,it is not even true,under the sixth and ninth circuits standard,that a therapist can not assist in having a patient locked away.both courts acknowledge that a psychotherapist can testify in civil commitment hearings.see id.at hayes,at.though there is a legal distinction between criminal incarceration and involuntary civil commitment,the terms of trust and does not matter much to the fellow committed because,by definition,patients reject the prospect of forced hospitalization,hayes,at,reason and experience dictate that it is unlikely that many patients will be dissuaded from seeking therapy by the additional chance that,aside from being committed against their will because of what they say to their therapists,they may also be criminally incarcerated based in part on those same statements.
the slight marginal therapeutic benefit of allowing the therapist to divulge confidences and to testify in civil commitment hearings,but not in federal criminal trials,must then be weighed against the marginal increase in having truth vindicated and justice done.chase,at kleinfeld,concurring.the public interest at stake in a criminal trial of any sort is substantial,more so than in a civil case like jaffee.but the criminal issues that are raised by cases like auster are of a more serious sort still,because the tarasoff duty does not come into play lightly.those cases are the ones that are the most serious,so any marginal increase in the admissibility of probative evidence in criminal proceedings is especially valuable consequently,where a patient has no reasonable expectation of confidentiality,the scales favor disclosure 
the sixth and ninth circuits also opine that because the majority of states permit psychotherapists to issue tarasoff or other similar warnings but not to testify at trial,the federal courts should not let them testify either this justification too is wanting.there is not a uniform consensus among the states regarding statements made with no reasonable expectation of confidentiality 
even a cursory review of the laws of the states reveals wide divergences.for instance,in california a psychotherapist not only must disclose to authorities or intended victims the existence of a dangerous patient,he also may testify to threats made during the course of therapy.chase,at citing cal.a decision from an appellate court suggests that florida follows california states like west virginia,connecticut,and wyoming also seem to favor the testimony admission north carolina code contemplates judges deciding on a basis whether to exclude such evidence and texas does not recognize the privilege at all in criminal cases 
moreover,for the reasons laid out above,it would not at state laws to hold that a defendant can not claim the protections of the privilege if he had actual knowledge,when making the statements,that they would not be kept confidential.it is unlikely that any patient,knowing that his threats will be relayed to the relevant target,will be substantially deterred from seeking therapy by the additional possibility that,although the therapist will not testify in a state criminal trial,the patient may some day be on trial for a federal crime,and his therapist might be called to testify.in summary,because auster concedes that he had actual knowledge that his threat would be conveyed to ccmsi,his threat was not confidential,and,under jaffee,the privilege does not apply 
because auster statement can not,as a matter of law,be privileged,we need not address whether the district court improperly suppressed evidence sua sponte,erroneously placed the burden of disproving the privilege on the government,or abused its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing.we also need not decide whether there is a or exception to the privilege.
for the foregoing reasons,the order of suppression is reversed,and this matter is remanded for further proceedings.

in argument to the district court,auster lawyer conceded that auster was in fact on occasion told that his threats of violence would be communicated to ccmsi.likewise,when ginzburg related to auster,after auster had threatened ccmsi on a separate occasion,that ccmsi had been warned,auster stated that he had expected that ginzburg would do just that.auster introduced into evidence a letter from davis to ccmsi wherein davis stated that i have had to exercise my duty to warn,with auster knowledge,several times when he was in danger of acting violently auster is well aware of my position regarding violence and has agreed that he understands that i have such an obligation.this understanding has not interfered in his reporting of homicidal intentions in the past.

the court added that a lthough it would be premature to speculate about most future developments in the federal psychotherapist privilege,we do not doubt that there are situations in which the privilege must give way,for example,if a serious threat of harm to the patient or to others can be averted only by means of a disclosure by the,at.although we decline to rule on whether there is a exception to the privilege,we note that th
