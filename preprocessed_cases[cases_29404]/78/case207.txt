gilbert jarrard filed a diversity suit in district court,alleging wrongdoing by his former employer,cdi telecommunications,cdi,and its worker compensation claims administrator,crawford company crawford.the district court dismissed jarrard complaint for failure to state a claim,and jarrard appeals.we affirm.
background 
on october,gilbert jarrard fell from a communications pole while on the job,suffering a crushed ankle and injuries to his shoulders,lower extremities,and back.
jarrard underwent treatment for some of his injuries,but not the additional and therapy that jarrard claims were necessary to treat his remaining injuries.unfortunately,persons employed by cdi and crawford disagreed that jarrard needed the additional treatment and therapy.worse,from jarrard standpoint,these persons persuaded jarrard physician who had been treating jarrard ankle and back injuries,and who had initially prescribed a program,to issue a determination of maximum medical improvement.according to jarrard,this determination prematurely terminated his worker compensation benefits,causing him to lose medical and temporary disability benefits that were to fund the treatment of his shoulder injuries until such time that he could return to work.
in october,jarrard requested an independent medical examination,but on crawford recommendation,jarrard request was denied.in january,cdi applied to indiana worker compensation board the board for an adjustment of claim,seeking to impose on jarrard an unfavorable permanent partial impairment rating and to foreclose additional medical and disability income benefits.a month later,cdi refused jarrard request for a physician to provide treatment for his shoulder injuries,and,in october,jarrard filed his own application for adjustment of claim with the board.
years later,on april,jarrard filed a complaint with the board alleging that the defendants had acted in bad faith and committed other torts when they sought an adjustment of his compensation claim.jarrard filed his complaint with the board pursuant to the relevant statutory provision,which,as of july,grants the board exclusive jurisdiction over bad faith and other independent tort claims relating to adjustment of worker compensation claims.the statute 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,arguing that the indiana legislature did not indicate that the statute was to be applied board therefore did not have jurisdiction because the acts jarrard complained of took place prior to the statute effective date.in other words,because the board jurisdiction did not apply retroactively,jarrard needed to vindicate his rights in state court,not before the board.on february,the board agreed and issued an order dismissing jarrard claim on the basis that it did not have jurisdiction to hear his complaint a final award in jarrard worker compensation claim was entered on may.jarrard never appealed the board dismissal of his claim,nor did he file suit in state court.
in february,jarrard filed a complaint in federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,alleging that he suffered damages as a result of the gross negligence of cdi and crawford in adjusting his claim.the defendants again moved to dismiss jarrard complaint,but this time the defendants argued a position opposite to the one taken before the board that the board has exclusive jurisdiction,not the courts.in support of this position,the defendants cited indiana in the period after the board dismissed jarrard first that the statute applies retroactively,so the board was the exclusive forum for jarrard new complaint.the district court in essence agreed with the defendants position and dismissed jarrard complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.b.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,jarrard argues that the district court improperly dismissed his case.as jarrard sees it,the district court did have jurisdiction to hear his case because,under indiana law,the board entry of award accepting the defendants interpretation of the statute was final and conclusive.in other words,the district court was bound to accept the board determination that it had no retroactive jurisdiction.in any event,jarrard argues that the defendants should not have been able to argue inconsistent positions before the board and the district court.jarrard asserts that it would be unconscionable to allow defendants to prevail on the basis of the inconsistent arguments,and that various preclusion and estoppel doctrines block the defendants from taking a position directly opposite to the position they took before the board.
because the district court dismissed jarrard complaint pursuant to.b,our review in this case is de novo.see cole capital,cir.before turning to the merits,however,some expansion on the applicable law and key facts is in order.as indicated earlier,the relevant indiana statute,which was effective as of july,grants exclusive jurisdiction to the board to determine whether a worker compensation insurance carrier acted in bad faith or committed other torts in adjusting or settling the aggrieved worker claim.a see also sims united states fid.guar,holding statute constitutional.as of the time jarrard filed his claim before the board,the indiana courts had not spoken regarding the statute retroactivity.
within months of the board dismissal of jarrard claim,however,two indiana court of appeals cases held that the statute in fact could be applied retroactively.see samm great dane trailers,borgman state farm ins,see also goetzke,at analyzing changes in indiana law wrought by the statute and samm.in borgman,the plaintiffs like jarrard filed suit in indiana court after the effective date of the statute alleging tortious acts that took place before that date.borgman,at.the court dismissed the case,concluding that the statute applied retroactively,and thus the board was the proper forum for the plaintiffs suit.see id.at.the indiana court of appeals held that the plaintiffs complaint rested within the exclusive jurisdiction of the board even though the acts complained of took place before the statute effective date,and thus dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction was appropriate.see id.at.likewise,in samm,the court reaffirmed borgman holding that the statute can be applied retroactively to acts taking place before the statute effective date.see samm,at.
in short,indiana law required that jarrard bring his claims before the board,not the courts.although this interpretation of the statute was not clearly established in indiana law as of the time jarrard brought his action before the board in,the interpretation was controlling as of the time he filed suit in federal district court in.the defendants won a dismissal from the board based on a colorable interpretation of the statute at the time,and then,years later,won another dismissal in federal court based on the recently decided indiana caselaw refuting the defendants proposed interpretation.
unfortunately,somewhere along the way,jarrard slipped through the cracks and has not been able to have his case heard on the merits before any tribunal.jarrard first filed his claim with the board,only to be told that he should have filed his claim in state court.when he later sought to vindicate his rights in federal court,he discovered that,as a result of indiana caselaw decided in the interim,the proper forum for his claim was the board after all.it is therefore easy to characterize jarrard as being trapped in a sort of legal limbo over which he had no trick box,as the district court aptly described it.
this characterization does not tell the entire story,however.jarrard was not without recourse when the board dismissed his tort claims in february.jarrard need not have uncomplainingly accepted the defendants and the board conclusions with respect to whether the statute applied retroactively.as jarrard concedes,he could have appealed the board decision to the full board in accordance with procedures set forth in indiana law.he would have had to file such an appeal by march,but jarrard opted not to do so.or jarrard could have filed suit in court in response to the board determination that it did not have jurisdiction to hear his case.indeed,had jarrard expeditiously appealed the board decision or sought relief in state court,it is likely that the borgman opinion decided june,would have issued during the course of his appeal or state court litigation,perhaps settling the retroactivity question in jarrard favor in the nick of time jarrard did none of these things,but he instead filed a complaint in federal court over four years after the board dismissal and well after the borgman and samm cases were decided.in this regard,it appears that jarrard predicament is,at least in part,a problem of his own making.in any event,for the reasons discussed below,we conclude that jarrard arguments on appeal are unavailing,and the district court properly dismissed jarrard complaint.
a.the final and conclusive board decision and the law of the case doctrine 
jarrard arguments largely stem from his conception of the law of the case doctrine,so it is to this facet of jarrard appeal we turn first.jarrard contends that when he filed his application for adjustment of claim in october,it was settled law in indiana that an employee could bring an independent tort cause of action in state court against an employer or its worker compensation carrier.see stump commercial union.such claims were governed by indiana common law.see sims,at.this practice,of course,came to an end with the enactment of the statute,which requires that such claims be adjudicated by the board.
jarrard argues that under the law of the case doctrine,his complaint in federal court should have been governed by the common law.specifically,jarrard argues that when the board concluded that it had no jurisdiction to hear jarrard claims,its determination was final and conclusive and not subject to reversal by a civil court.appellant br.at.jarrard further suggests that the decision to appeal the board final award was purely his choice,and when he opted not to appeal the award,the board determination became the law of the case binding not only on the board and the parties,but on all courts subject to indiana law.id.at.indeed,jarrard contends that indiana cases decided following the board final award,such as borgman,had no effect on jarrard or on the defendants,for whom the final and conclusive determination of no jurisdiction had been made by the board on march.id.at.as jarrard sees it,the indiana courts or federal district court exercising diversity jurisdiction must therefore entertain his tort claim,regardless of the statute exclusivity provision and controlling indiana caselaw giving it retroactive effect 
precedent teaches that,a s most commonly defined,the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law,that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.christianson colt indus.operating,d citation omitted emphasis added see also id.at.t he doctrine applies as much to the decisions of a coordinate court in the same case as to a court own decisions.the doctrine is a rule of practice,based on sound policy that,when an issue is once litigated and decided,that should be the end of the matter.evans city of,cir quoting barrett baylor,cir.it is well established that under the doctrine,matters decided on appeal become the law of the case to be followed in all subsequent proceedings in the trial court and,on second appeal,in the appellate court,unless there is plain error of law in the original decision.see evans,at internal quotes and citation omitted.the doctrine does not apply if the prior decision is clearly,for example,controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law.see id.at collecting authority.indiana version of the doctrine is virtually identical.see,in re adoption of baby,t he doctrine provides that an appellate court determination of a legal issue binds both the trial court and the court on appeal in any subsequent appeal involving the same case and substantially the same facts.platt state,collecting authority.
given this authority,it is apparent that jarrard misapprehends the law of the case doctrine jarrard federal case was not a successive stage in the same action he previously had filed before the board.when jarrard filed his claims before the board and,later,his complaint in federal court,jarrard initiated two separate cases.but even if jarrard federal case could be considered a subsequent stage of the same litigation or the board a coordinate or appellate court,the district court was not obliged to follow the board dictates regarding the statute retroactivity in light of controlling indiana law making it clear that the board interpretation of the statute was erroneous.see evans,at christianson,at.teaching that even if a coordinate court decision regarding jurisdiction is the law of the case,a subsequent coordinate court may decline jurisdiction if the prior decision is clearly wrong mcmasters united states,cir lincoln utilities,at.
the caselaw jarrard cites does not change our conclusion.in particular,jarrard relies heavily on rassbach alcala,for his theory that the board final award was binding not only on the board and the parties,but on all courts subject to indiana law.in rassbach,the plaintiffs filed a worker compensation claim for injuries suffered during a car accident that took place prior to the plaintiffs work shift but on a road on the premises of their employer place of business.id.at.the board dismissed the plaintiffs claim,concluding that the accident did not arise in the course of the plaintiffs employment because,in part,the road upon which the accident occurred was a municipal road.id.at.the plaintiffs did not appeal the board decision,but filed negligence claims in the trial court.id.at.the defendant then filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that the accident had occurred on the employer property,and thus the board had exclusive jurisdiction over the claim.id.the trial court agreed with the defendant argument and concluded that the accident occurred on the employer premises,thus giving rise to a worker compensation claim within the board exclusive jurisdiction.
on appeal,the indiana court of appeals reversed the trial court order dismissing the case.the court concluded that indiana law did not empower trial courts to review a board decision or to determine whether the board decision is correct.id.at.by revisiting factual determinations made by the board,the trial court had invaded the exclusive province of the board.id.
rassbach is inapposite to the present case.true,rassbach held that the trial court was required to abide by the board determination regarding its jurisdiction,a point which echoes jarrard argument here.the similarity ends there,however.in rassbach,the board jurisdictional determination arose from factual findings relating to the merits of the plaintiffs worker compensation,and the trial court revisited the board factual conclusions.indiana law clearly establishes the procedure by which a party may appeal a board decision,and a trial court is not to the correctness of the board decision.in contrast,in the present case,the board conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to hear jarrard claims arose not from a factual determination relating to the merits,but from a colorable albeit erroneous interpretation of the statute retroactivity provision.subsequent indiana caselaw,of course,proved that interpretation wrong as a matter of law,and this caselaw is controlling.see lincoln utilities,at.the district court certainly did not invade the board exclusive province simply by applying the controlling law as set forth in borgman.
the board jurisdictional determination was not final and conclusive in the way jarrard would have it.simply put,the district court was not bound by the board determination regarding the statute retroactivity and neither are we.we therefore reject jarrard contention that the law of the case doctrine compelled the district court to entertain jarrard claims under the common law scheme in place prior to the statute enactment and subsequent indiana caselaw.
