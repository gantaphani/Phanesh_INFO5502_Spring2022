factual and procedural background 
original complaint and demurrer 
respondent employed appellant as a maintenance technician from may until august.in november,appellant brought suit against respondent.the complaint alleged that during appellant term of employment,respondent paid him a wage of per hour for a hour week.after the first month,appellant supervisors began instructing him to drive his own truck for errands,such as going to the hardware store to buy items needed for apartments owned or managed by respondent.appellant estimated that he thereafter drove a minimum of miles per day running errands related to his employment.according to the complaint,appellant told his supervisors nearly every week that he could not afford to pay for the gasoline and vehicle maintenance,and he requested reimbursement.despite his repeated requests,his supervisors continued to assign him tasks that required many miles of driving and consistently informed him he would not be reimbursed.
in august,appellant informed a new supervisor that he could not afford to maintain his vehicle due to using his money to purchase gasoline for errands.appellant told the new supervisor he could not tolerate the work environment of only being paid per hour,not being paid for gas and having to drive around town for work without being reimbursed for mileage.when respondent continued to refuse to reimburse for mileage,appellant had no choice but to resign.based on these allegations,appellant brought suit for violation of labor code section he also asserted claims for constructive wrongful termination in violation of public policy and intentional infliction of emotional distress according to the complaint,the public policy respondent allegedly violated was embodied in labor code sections and california unfair competition law bus,et 
respondent demurred to the claims for constructive discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress.respondent contended that failure to reimburse for mileage was not sufficiently intolerable or aggravated to support a claim of constructive discharge.respondent further contended that appellant failed to allege sufficiently outrageous and extreme conduct to support a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.
the trial court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend the claim for constructive discharge and without leave to amend the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress.the court found that the complaint failed to allege facts sufficient to constitute a constructive discharge and failed to allege any outrageous conduct on the part of respondent.
fac and demurrer 
appellant filed a first amended complaint fac,adding more detail to the allegations of the original complaint.the fac alleged that appellant should have been reimbursed per month based on driving miles each workday and the standard mileage rate of cents per mile,and that this represented a significant percentage of his monthly salary.appellant contended that the failure to reimburse him for mileage resulted in his salary of per hour being effectively reduced to less than the minimum wage however,in asserting his claim for constructive discharge in violation of public policy,appellant did not invoke the minimum wage statutes or claim that the public policy embodied in california minimum wage laws had been violated.
respondent again demurred to the constructive discharge claim,contending that the facts alleged did not demonstrate that appellant had been constructively discharged.in his opposition,appellant asserted that the facts alleged showed that the amount he was forced to spend on gasoline and vehicle maintenance left him with insufficient money to sustain himself,thus making his working conditions intolerable.specifically,he calculated that the amount of unreimbursed expenses left him earning less than the minimum wage 
the court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.the court found that failing to pay mileage expenses of is not conduct that is so intolerable or aggravated that a reasonable person in the employee position would have felt no choice but to resign.it therefore appeared from the facts alleged that appellant decision to quit was not a forced or coerced decision.
following settlement of his mileage reimbursement claim,appellant dismissed the remaining causes of action with prejudice and filed this appeal.

constructive discharge

as the supreme court explained in turner,an employer may,in an attempt to avoid liability for a wrongful termination,refrain from actually firing an employee,preferring instead to engage in conduct causing him or her to quit.turner,supra,cal th at.if the employer conduct effectively forces an employee to resign,this is a constructive discharge,and is legally regarded as a firing rather than a resignation.id.at.
an employee may not simply quit and sue,claiming to have been constructively discharged.turner,supra,cal th at.the facts must support a finding that the resignation was coerced,rather than simply one rational option for the employee.ibid.the conditions giving rise to the resignation must be sufficiently extraordinary and egregious to overcome the normal motivation of a competent,diligent,and reasonable employee to remain on the job to earn a livelihood and to serve his or her employer.ibid.moreover,the cases are in agreement that the standard by which a constructive discharge is determined is an objective one the question is whether a reasonable person faced with the allegedly intolerable employer actions or conditions of employment would have no reasonable alternative except to quit.citations.id.at,quoting rochlis walt disney th.in other words,the applicable standard is whether the adverse working conditions are so intolerable or unusually adverse that any reasonable employee would resign rather than endure them.turner,supra,at,quoting slack kanawha county housing.

the complaint and fac essentially described the intolerable working conditions which compelled appellant to resign as being assigned duties which required him to drive his own vehicle every day for many miles without being reimbursed for his expenses in violation of labor code section.on appeal,appellant contends he could amend the complaint to allege violations of labor code section,subdivision a specifically,he claims the result of respondent failure to reimburse him for mileage was to force him to spend his wages by paying back his employer for business expenses,reducing his hourly pay to below the minimum wage.
the general rule is that the existence of a legal violation within the workplace does not,standing alone,establish that the working conditions are intolerable.turner,supra,cal th at.nor do deprivations of salary or other economic benefits generally support a constructive discharge claim.see turner,supra,at poor performance rating,accompanied by demotion and reduction in pay,did not constitute constructive discharge scotch art institute of california,supra,th at potential change in instructor employment status to did not constitute constructive discharge king ac r advertising,et cir,applying california law reducing employee salary and changing annual bonus did not constitute constructive discharge.accordingly,in the typical case,an employer failure to reimburse an employee for expenses that should have been borne by the employer would not create such intolerable working conditions that the employee would have no option but to resign.
here,however,appellant alleged not only that respondent violated the labor code by failing to reimburse for mileage,but that the duties respondent assigned required such extensive driving that the reimbursement to which he was entitled represented a significant percentage of his already low salary.appellant specifically alleged in the fac that he drove a minimum of miles per day.in his opposition to the demurrer,he asserted that he regularly drove as far as santa monica after checking in with his supervisor in toluca lake.as a result of paying for the gasoline and vehicle maintenance this schedule required,he was effectively being paid less than the minimum wage this left appellant in an untenable position.forced to divert so much of his salary to gasoline and vehicle maintenance,he was unable to pay basic living expenses.see hudgins neiman marcus group,th,section of the labor code reflects the legislature recognition that employees in this state are dependent on receiving a certain minimum salary to purchase the necessities of life.moreover,he was wearing out the very vehicle he needed to maintain his livelihood,either by retaining his employment with respondent or finding another job.had he continued,he would soon have found himself with no job and no vehicle.according to his allegations,he repeatedly informed his supervisors of his dire situation,and implored them to reimburse him.but having effectively passed on a portion of its normal operating expenses to a low wage worker,respondent repeatedly refused.should appellant present evidence establishing these facts at trial,a reasonable trier of fact could find that respondent knowingly permitted working conditions that were so intolerable or aggravated at the time of the employee resignation that a reasonable employer would realize that a reasonable person in the employee position would be compelled to resign.turner,supra,cal th at.accordingly,the trial court abused its discretion in sustaining the demurrer to this cause of action without leave to amend.
public policy 
as explained in foley interactive data corporation cal d foley,the public policy basis for a claim of discharge in violation of public policy must be firmly established,fundamental,and substantial.cal d at,fn.the public policy at issue must also be tethered to fundamental polices that are delineated in constitutional or statutory provisions.gantt,supra,cal th at.although respondent demurrers did not raise the issue,the trial court found that no fundamental public policy was implicated by respondent failure to reimburse appellant for mileage because the failure to reimburse relate d solely to appellant interests and not to the benefit of the public at large.see foley,supra,cal d at where policy at issue serves only the private interest of the employer,the rationale underlying the tortious wrongful discharge cause of action is not implicated gantt,supra,at the policy in question must involve a matter that affects society at large rather than a purely personal or proprietary interest of the plaintiff or employer.to the extent appellant claim is based on failure to pay him the minimum wage,we conclude the trial court erred in finding appellant claim untethered to a fundamental public policy.
