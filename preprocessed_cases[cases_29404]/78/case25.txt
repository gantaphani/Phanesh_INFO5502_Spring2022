this case calls on us in principal part to determine whether the entire amount of a state law settlement covering both disability and death benefits may be credited against an award of death benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act longshoreman act or act,et.for the reasons that follow,we hold that it may not and that only the portion of the settlement funds directed toward state law death benefit claims may be credited.accordingly we remand to the benefits review board board for regarding the allocation of petitioner prior state settlement between death benefits and disability benefits.further,we hold that on remand the burden of proof on the allocation of the state settlement between death and disability benefits lies with the party asserting the credit.
charles barscz barscz worked at electric boat corporation a division of general dynamics corporation electric boat in new london,connecticut from through.during his employment he was regularly exposed to asbestos and in november he was diagnosed with asbestosis.barscz sought compensation for his injuries sustained while working for electric boat under both the longshoreman act and under connecticut workers compensation laws.
on june,barscz and his wife anna barscz barscz entered into a settlement agreement settlement with electric boat and three insurance companies resolving all past,present and future state law claims relating to injuries suffered by barscz during his employment with electric boat.the settlement covered a variety of injuries to barscz including illness associated with exposure to asbestos shoulder,back and neck injuries and hearing loss.it also covered possible claims that barscz had or may have had by virtue of any exposure which barscz had to harmful irritants including but not limited to asbestos 
the insurers agreed to pay to the claimant,of which covered the barsczs attorney fees.pursuant to the terms of the settlement,such payment would be accepted 
as a full and final settlement for all compensation for said injury,and for all results upon the claimant past,present and future,and for all claims past,present and future medical,surgical,hospital and incidental expenses and all compensation which may be due to anyone in case of the death of the claimant,to the end that the payment of such sum shall constitute a complete satisfaction of all claims due or to become due at any time in favor of anybody on account of the claimed injury,or on account of any condition in any way resulting out of the said injury,or on account of the death of the claimant.
the settlement was approved by the compensation commissioner for the second compensation district on june.
barscz also sought compensation for his asbestosis under the longshoreman act.in a decision dated december,administrative law judge chester shatz alj shatz determined that barscz was permanently disabled as of november,and awarded him compensation for permanent total disability from that date forward.alj shatz also determined that barscz had suffered from a partial disability since at least,which was when a chest first revealed to electric boat that barscz had lung abnormalities including emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.alj shatz concluded that electric boat continued to employ barscz despite that partial disability.
because alj shatz determined that barscz had a partial disability when he contracted asbestosis,electric boat was able to obtain the benefit of section f of the longshoreman act.section f provides that an employer need only compensate an employee for two years when an employee with an existing permanent partial disability sustains a injury that results in a permanent,total disability.f see also sealand terminals,gasparic,cir per curiam.after the employer has compensated the employee for two years,the obligation to compensate the employee shifts to a special fund special fund that is administered by the secretary of labor secretary.f see also id.establishing the special fund sealand terminals,at thus,alj shatz ordered electric boat to compensate barscz for weeks after weeks any continuing benefits would be paid by the special fund.the order did not mention the settlement,which had already been approved,but it did provide that t he employer shall receive a credit for all amounts of compensation previously paid to the claimant as a result of his pulmonary injury.despite this statement,electric boat paid the entire weeks of compensation without taking a credit for the settlement.after that time the special fund made disability payments to barscz until his death in september.the special fund did not take any credit for the settlement.
following barscz death,barscz sought death benefits under the longshoreman act.in an order dated june,june order,administrative law judge colleen geraghty alj geraghty concluded that because barscz lung disease hastened his death,barscz was entitled to death benefits.further,alj geraghty determined that because the elements of f had been satisfied and electric boat had covered the first weeks of barscz disability claim,the special fund was responsible for paying barscz death benefits.
electric boat moved for reconsideration of the june order,and for the first time,raised the existence of the settlement.it argued that under section e of the act section e should be credited against the special fund liability to barscz for death benefits.section e provides that n otwithstanding any other provision of law,any amounts paid to an employee for the same injury,disability,or death for which benefits are claimed under this chapter pursuant to any other workers compensation law or the jones act shall be credited against any liability imposed by this chapter.e.
alj geraghty granted the motion and modified her original order to reflect a credit for the entire amount of the settlement.she acknowledged that disability and death benefits are separate claims under the act but noted that barscz had signed the settlement,which specifically mentioned death benefits and concluded that u nder these circumstances,it is appropriate to permit a credit against the death and survivor benefits due under the act for the amounts received in settlement of the state claim for death or survivor benefits.turning to the question of what portion of the settlement to credit against the death benefits,alj geraghty concluded that under prior board decisions,because the settlement resolved multiple claims and the record did not establish how the settlement funds were to be apportioned the employers and the special fund are entitled to offset the entire amount paid to the parties under the state settlement.while conceding that this was a harsh result,she noted that claimants were in the best position to ensure that the settlement agreement specifically apportions the amounts paid in settlement among the various claims.
the director of the office of workers compensation programs director appealed the alj decision to the board because any death benefits would be paid by the special fund,the director was an interested party in both barscz original claim for death benefits and in electric boat motion for reconsideration,but had not appeared in either proceeding.on appeal,the director argued that the burden of proving the apportionment of the settlement should have been placed on electric boat,not barscz,and that placing the burden on barscz was inconsistent with the supreme court holding in director,owcp greenwich collieries,d,that under the administrative procedure act apa a proponent of a rule or order bears the burden of proof.
in a decision and order dated september,a majority of the board affirmed alj geraghty decision.the board focused its analysis on the language of section e,which the board read to provide that an amount paid to an employee for a state claim offsets any liability the employer has under the longshoreman act that is related to that same injury,disability or death.emphasis in original.based on that language,which it viewed as quite expansive,the board held that in the absence of specific evidence of the apportionment of a state settlement the employer is entitled to a credit
