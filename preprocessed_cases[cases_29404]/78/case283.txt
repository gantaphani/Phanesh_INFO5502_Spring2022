kathryn benecke appeals a decision of the district court remanding to the social security administration ssa for additional administrative proceedings instead of an immediate award of disability insurance benefits.because there are no outstanding issues that must be resolved and it is clear from the record that benecke is entitled to benefits,we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to remand to the commissioner for an award of benefits.
background 
benecke suffers from fibromyalgia,previously called fibrositis,a rheumatic disease that causes inflammation of the fibrous connective tissue components of muscles,tendons,ligaments,and other tissue.see,lang disability plan of sponsor applied remote tech,cir brosnahan barnhart,cir.common symptoms,all of which benecke experiences,include chronic pain throughout the body,multiple tender points,fatigue,stiffness,and a pattern of sleep disturbance that can exacerbate the cycle of pain and fatigue associated with this disease.see brosnahan,at cline sullivan,cir.fibromyalgia cause is unknown,there is no cure,and it is within much of the medical community.the disease is diagnosed entirely on the basis of patients reports of pain and other symptoms.the american college of rheumatology issued a set of diagnostic criteria in,but to date there are no laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis.see jordan northrop grumman,cir brosnahan,at.
benecke began experiencing fibromyalgia symptoms in december.in march,she filed an application for disability insurance benefits,alleging disability beginning in april.the ssa denied her claim initially and upon reconsideration,and benecke timely filed a request for a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the alj denied benecke claim,finding that benecke suffers from severe impairments but retains residual functional capacity to perform light or sedentary work,including her past sedentary work as a telemarketer.the social security appeals council denied benecke request for review,and the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner.
benecke filed a complaint in district court challenging the commissioner decision.the district court granted benecke motion for summary judgment in part,holding that the alj committed legal error in discounting benecke pain testimony and the opinions of benecke treating physicians.however,the district court declined to remand for an award of benefits,instead remanding for additional administrative proceedings.benecke timely appealed that holding.because the commissioner did not the district court partial grant of summary judgment in benecke favor,the sole issue in this case is whether the district court abused its discretion by remanding for further proceedings rather than for an award of benefits.

medical history 
the alj received written reports on benecke condition from numerous treating physicians.since benecke first sought treatment in december,her doctors have prescribed a variety of medications,painkillers,and antidepressants,and she has undergone physical therapy,massage treatments,aquatic exercise therapy,and participated in a fibromyalgia support group to help her cope with her condition.benecke worked intermittently from the onset of her disease until april when she stopped working entirely.before the onset of her fibromyalgia,benecke had been employed for more than a decade,except for brief periods between jobs.
as noted above,fibromyalgia is within much of the medical community,which may explain why benecke saw a succession of physicians before being properly diagnosed.in december,benecke was examined by berghoff,an orthopedist.she complained that she had been unable to work due to pain throughout her body,fatigue,and problems with memory and concentration.berghoff prescribed medications and referred her to a physical therapist for her pain.
in february,benecke visited a hand and wrist surgeon who also was unable to diagnose her condition,but who suggested that it might be a rheumatic disease.in april,benecke sought treatment for severe pain at a hospital emergency room.that same month,she reported to another physician that the pain throughout her body was so severe that it interfered with her ability to complete certain routine tasks and caused her to miss work.
in march and june,benecke sought treatment from drazkowski,a neurophysiologist,who concluded that benecke might be suffering from fibromyalgia or connective tissue disease.drazkowski advised benecke that she should not return to work at that time because of her persistent pain.drazkowski referred benecke to a rheumatologist,harris,who diagnosed her with fibromyalgia in july.harris treated benecke for her condition regularly through december.in august,benecke also visited a pain management specialist who confirmed her diagnosis.
in february,pace,a second rheumatologist,began treating benecke fibromyalgia.pace notes from benecke appointments typically state that benecke experienced pain in her hands,wrists,elbows,shoulders,neck,back,hips,knees,ankles,and feet morning stiffness numbness headaches fatigue and decreased sleep,with three to five hours of restful sleep per night.during the course of treatment,pace prescribed benecke a variety of medications for pain and depression and referred benecke for physical therapy,massage,and aquatic exercise therapy.
pace filled out two questionnaires assessing benecke ability to do activities in,after benecke filed her disability benefits application.pace indicated on the form that benecke suffered from symptoms consistent with those described above her pain and fatigue frequently were severe enough to interfere with her attention and concentration and she should not sit,stand,or walk for more than one hour at a time.on the basis of these findings,pace concluded that benecke would not be able to sustain work.
in january,a third rheumatologist,gluck,began treating benecke for fibromyalgia.benecke reported symptoms and received treatment consistent with her previous medical history.in july,gluck completed two questionnaires assessing benecke ability to do activities.gluck reported benecke symptoms and stated that benecke constant pain and fatigue were severe enough to interfere with her attention and concentration.like pace,gluck concluded that benecke would not be able to sustain work.
opinions of physicians 
at the request of the arizona department of economic security ades,benecke visited two physicians who evaluated her condition in connection with her disability application.because they each examined benecke only once,their opinions are given less weight than the physicians who treated her.see lester chater,cir 
in december,cunningham,a practitioner of internal medicine,recorded symptoms consistent with those described above and provided a diagnosis of fibromyalgia.cunningham stated that benecke was able to attend school,drive,and do errands,and he concluded that benecke s ubjective complaints far outweigh objective findings.
in january,breen,a psychiatrist,evaluated benecke mental health.breen noted that benecke was able to take one college course at a time with difficulty.breen observed no psychiatric symptoms of note.breen concluded that some of benecke reported physical symptoms were scarcely credible.he diagnosed her with somatization disorder,a condition in which a patient perceived physical problems are of psychological origin.breen also indicated that benecke was unable or seriously limited in her ability to understand and carry out complex instructions use judgment and deal with stress.
