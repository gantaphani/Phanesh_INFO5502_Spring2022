plaintiff and appellant frank estrada estrada appeals a judgment following a court trial in an action against the city of los angeles the city for disability discrimination under the california fair employment and housing act feha,et.
the essential issue presented is whether the trial court properly held that estrada,formerly a volunteer police reserve officer for the city,was not an employee for purposes of the feha.
although police reserve officers are volunteers who serve gratuitously,the city deems these individuals to be employees for the limited purpose of extending them workers compensation benefits.such benefits are not remuneration rather,they help to make the volunteers whole,in the event they are injured while performing their duties.the city policy decision to extend workers compensation benefits to these individuals,who voluntarily put themselves in harm way on behalf of the community,does not transform the volunteers status to that of employee for purposes of feha.accordingly,the trial court properly concluded estrada was not an employee and therefore could not maintain a cause of action against the city for disability discrimination.the judgment is affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
in,estrada became a reserve officer for the los angeles police department lapd or department.
the los angeles administrative code provides that members of the police reserve corps shall be volunteer workers only and shall not be,or be deemed to be,employees of the city or of the police department for any purpose other than for the purposes of section of this article and shall serve gratuitously except as provided in section of this article.
as an applicant for the reserve officer position,estrada acknowledged in writing that as a member of the police reserve corps,i am not a regularly salaried officer of the department and am not entitled to compensation for services rendered as a police reserve officer.
in,while on duty,estrada was involved in a traffic collision and sustained leg and back injuries.in,while on duty,estrada again was involved in a traffic collision and injured his right shoulder.in both instances,he obtained workers compensation benefits and continued to receive benefits,as his injuries were not fully resolved.
in october,the food and drug administration fda served a search warrant on estrada nutritional supplement company,body basics.thereafter,estrada was the subject of a personnel complaint by the department internal affairs division.the personnel complaint alleged that while estrada was off duty,he inappropriately sold a product containing sildenafil citrate,the active ingredient of pfizer trademark prescription drug viagra.
in may,estrada was suspended from the police reserve corps pending the outcome of the investigation of the personnel complaint.after being served with a notice of proposed disciplinary action,estrada submitted a page skelly response asserting discrepancies in the investigation and proffering additional evidence to exonerate him.the administrative proceedings resulted in estrada termination in december,after years as a reserve officer.
superior court proceedings.
on june,estrada filed suit against the city,alleging disability discrimination under feha,subd.l first cause of action retaliation for filing workers compensation claim,second cause of action and intentional infliction of emotional distress iied third cause of action.
estrada subsequently withdrew the second cause of action,and the third cause of action was eliminated on demurrer.thus,this matter proceeded only on the first cause of action,the feha claim.
the matter was bifurcated.the parties stipulated the threshold issue of estrada employment status was a question of law for the court to decide,in that the pertinent facts were undisputed.the parties filed trial briefs as well as requests for judicial notice of various materials,including benefits information for reserve officers,and various provisions of the city charter and administrative code.
after considering the parties written and oral arguments and evidence in support thereof,the trial court determined as a matter of law that estrada could not prove the elements of his first cause of action for disability discrimination in violation of the feha on the ground that estrada is not an employee for purposes of the feha.the trial court ruled because the city of los angeles is a public agency whose applicable ordinance only permits employment of those appointed pursuant to the city civil service rules and estrada was not so employed,he is not an employee for purposes of the feha.
estrada filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment.
contentions 
estrada contends the trial court erred in concluding the definition of employee for purposes of his feha discrimination claim is governed by the city civil service rules a charter city,such as los angeles,can not opt out of complying with state laws that address statewide concerns feha defines employee broadly and looks to case law for a more useful definition feha reflects matters of statewide concern and can not be trumped by the city civil service rules including the city police reserve officers within the definition of employee is consistent with the public policy expressed in feha and is reasonably related to the statewide concerns addressed in feha.
discussion 
general principles to recover for employment discrimination under the feha,an aggrieved plaintiff must have the status of an employee an uncompensated volunteer is not an employee.
the feha was enacted to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek,obtain,and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of physical disability,mental disability,or medical condition it is the purpose of the feha to provide effective remedies that will eliminate these discriminatory practices.thus the feha prohibits an employer from discriminating because of a disability against employees or applicants for employment in compensation or in terms,conditions,or privileges of employment,subd.a see also.
in order to recover under the discrimination in employment provisions of the feha,the aggrieved plaintiff must be an employee.shephard loyola marymount th,shephard.however,the statutory definition of employee found at section,subdivision c,does not actually define who is an employee under the feha it merely excludes persons employed by close relatives and those employed by nonprofit sheltered workshops and rehabilitation facilities.therefore,the feha definitional provision is not particularly helpful in determining under what circumstances one may be considered to be an employee for purposes of the feha.mendoza town of ross th,mendoza.
more helpful is the definition of employee contained in regulations enacted by the department of fair employment and housing the dfeh to implement the feha.the dfeh,which was created by the feha,defines an employee as a ny individual under the direction and control of an employer under any appointment or contract of hire or apprenticeship,express or implied,oral or written,tit,subd.b.while the interpretation of a statute is ultimately a question of law,appellate courts will defer to an administrative agency interpretation of a statute or regulation involving its area of expertise,unless the interpretation flies in the face of the clear language and purpose of the interpreted provision.citation.far from being in conflict,section,subdivision b of title of the california code of regulations fills a gap in the governing statute,and provides a workable definition of who may be considered an employee and thus entitled to the protection of the feha.thus,on its face,the feha confers employee status on those individuals who have been appointed,who are hired under express or implied contract,or who serve as apprentices.mendoza,supra,th at,italics added.
in mendoza,the plaintiff was a volunteer community service officer with the town of ross town who worked as an uncompensated volunteer and assisted in traffic duties,crime prevention and neighborhood crime watch programs.mendoza,supra,th at.he sued for disability discrimination in violation of the feha after his position as a community service officer was terminated.id.at.he argued he met the dfeh and thus the feha,definition of an employee because he was appointed to his volunteer position.as evidence of this,the plaintiff relie d on his police identification card,which state d,this is to certify that peter mendoza is a duly appointed community service officer.italics added.mendoza,supra,th at,first italics added.
the mendoza court rejected this argument,stating regardless of what verbiage may appear on mendoza identification card,mendoza ignores the controlling local ordinance,which vests the town council with the exclusive authority to make appointments to employment.under section of the town personnel rules in the record before us rule,it is provided appointment to regular,regular,or temporary positions shall be made by the town council with the recommendation of the department heads.italics omitted.thus,the town council has exclusive authority to appoint individuals to employment positions with the town,albeit upon the advice of city department heads.the first amended complaint contains no allegation that such an appointment was made in mendoza case,nor did mendoza make any proffer in response to the town request for judicial notice that he was appointed to his community service officer position in accordance with rule.the town persuasively argues that since the town appointment process was not initiated,mendoza was not appointed,and does not fall under the feha employee category as an appointee.mendoza,supra,th at,fns.omitted.
the mendoza court also relied on labor code section,subdivision i which excludes public agency volunteers from workers compensation coverage.employee excludes a ny person performing voluntary service s for a public agency or a private,nonprofit organization who receives no remuneration for services other than meals,transportation,lodging,or reimbursement for incidental expenses,subd.i.applying the sound rationale utilized in shephard,it would be incongruous to determine that mendoza is an employee under the feha,but not an employee for workers compensation purposes.mendoza,supra,th at.
mendoza continued,absent applicable california case law on the issue of whether the feha applies to volunteers,it is instructive to look to federal law.because the antidiscrimination objectives and relevant wording of title vii of the civil rights act of title vii et and other federal antidiscrimination statutes are similar to those of the feha,california courts often look to federal decisions interpreting these statutes for assistance in interpreting the feha.citation.richards hill,cal th,see fisher san pedro peninsula hospital d.mendoza,supra,th at.
title vii succinctly defines employee as an individual employed by an employer.f.the first prong of the title vii test in determining if someone is an employee requires the plaintiff to prove he or she was hired by the putative employer.city of new york cir.to do so,the courts must look to the thirteen factors articulated by the supreme court in community for creative non violence reid,to determine whether an employment relationship exists.eisenberg advance relocation and storage,cir.city of new york,supra,at.however,to satisfy the hiring prong,a purported employee must establish the existence of remuneration,in some form,in exchange for work.ibid.mendoza,supra,th at,italics added.
for example,the united states court of appeals for the second circuit has held that an unpaid intern could not sue for sexual harassment under title vii because she did not meet the definition of employee for common law agency.davis cir.where no financial benefit is obtained by the purported employee from the employer,no plausible employment relationship of any sort can be said to exist because although compensation by the putative employer to the putative employee in exchange for his services is not a sufficient condition,it is an essential condition to the existence of an relationship.citations.citation.mendoza,supra,th at,italics added.
other courts have agreed with this view.city of fort calhoun collins volunteer firefighters were not employees within the meaning of the nebraska fair employment practice act,which is patterned after title vii haavistola community fire cir,graves women professional rodeo ass,cir,male rodeo barrel racer could not bring title vii claim because association did not have employees since it gave no compensation,which is an essential condition to the existence of an relationship.mendoza,supra,th at.
mendoza observed,even substantial indirect compensation can satisfy the threshold requirement of remuneration for purposes of employee status under title vii.if not direct salary,substantial benefits which are not merely incidental to the activity performed,such as health insurance,vacation or sick pay,are indicia of employment status.city of new york,supra,at.thus,volunteer firefighters in pietras board of fire com rs.of farmingville cir were entitled to employee status,in part,based on their receipt of significant benefits,such as disability pensions,survivors benefits,group life insurance,and scholarships for dependent children of deceased firefighters.ibid.mendoza,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
mendoza found there is nothing within the feha or its legislative history evincing an intent to depart from the requirement that compensation of some sort is indispensable to the formation of an employment relationship.in fact,our legislature tacitly acknowledged that remuneration remains an integral part of an employment relationship when it enacted amendments to the feha extending its coverage to disabled employees.for example,when the feha was amended to clarify the definitions of physical and mental disabilities,the legislature made note of the important public goal that,by providing reasonable accommodations for disabled employees,employers were helping to strengthen our economy by keeping people working who would otherwise require public assistance.assem.com.on judiciary,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.this rationale clearly indicates that the legislature assumed and intended that disabled persons need to be compensated employees in order to benefit from the feha expanded protection.mendoza,supra,th at,italics added.
in mendoza,the plaintiff concede d that his position was unpaid,and did not allege that he received any other type of financial benefit he might have received,such as health,insurance,or retirement benefits.york association of bar of city of new york cir.because the plaintiff position was unpaid and his complaint made no mention of any health,retirement,or other substantial benefits,for this additional reason the plaintiff d id not meet the definition of employee for feha purposes.mendoza,supra,th at.
mendoza conclude d that plaintiff service as a community service officer was not the result of an appointment provided to him pursuant to contract,nor was it an apprenticeship.furthermore,even if he could meet one of these definitional standards,the absence of remuneration prevents him from attaining employee status under the feha.mendoza,supra,th.
trial court properly determined estrada was not an employee of the city within the meaning of feha estrada was appointed to a volunteer position without remuneration.
