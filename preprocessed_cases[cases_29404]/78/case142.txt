for the following reasons,we grant the petition for review,vacate the benefits review board decision,and remand with instructions to reinstate the original decision of the administrative law judge holding respondent trinity marine group,alone liable under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act and to dismiss without prejudice the claims regarding the contractual indemnification provisions for lack of jurisdiction.
factual and procedural background 
petitioner temporary employment services,tesi provides temporary employees and payroll services to various businesses,including shipyards.tesi and respondent trinity marine group,trinity entered into a contract in which tesi agreed to provide temporary workers to trinity.pursuant to this agreement,leroy ricks,a tesi employee,was assigned to work for trinity.
while working for trinity,ricks was injured at trinity shipyard on january.from january,through april,petitioner maryland casualty company maryland tesi workers compensation insurance carrier under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the lhwca,voluntarily paid ricks temporary total disability compensation and medical benefits.thereafter,maryland controverted the claim on the basis of a doctor medical opinion that ricks could return to work.ricks then filed a claim for workers compensation benefits under the lhwca against tesi and maryland.subsequently,at the request of tesi and maryland,trinity was added as an additional alleged employer to the action.
a formal hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj on january.the alj issued a decision on november,awarding ricks certain benefits holding trinity,as ricks borrowing employer,solely responsible for those benefits and ordering trinity to reimburse maryland for benefits that maryland had previously paid to ricks.
trinity appealed the alj decision to the benefits review board the board,and on december,the board issued a decision remanding the matter to the alj and directing him to consider whether a valid contractual obligation between tesi and trinity obligated tesi,rather than trinity,to pay the benefits owed to ricks.on remand,the alj held that tesi had agreed to indemnify trinity and that maryland insurance policy contained a waiver of subrogation in favor of trinity.accordingly,maryland reimbursed trinity for the amounts trinity had paid to ricks and to maryland.tesi and maryland then appealed the merits of this alj decision to the board.the respondent director,office of workers compensation programs,united states department of labor the director challenged the jurisdiction of the administrative tribunal to decide these contractual issues.rejecting the director jurisdictional challenge,the board affirmed the merits of the alj decision on june.subsequently,the board denied a motion by tesi and maryland for reconsideration.
tesi and maryland timely appealed to this court,urging reversal on the merits.the director has also filed in this court urging reversal,but on jurisdictional grounds 
we have jurisdiction over petitions for review of final orders of the board pursuant to c.
ii.standard of review 
the supreme court has instructed us that the preferred starting point in reviewing an administrative order is to satisfy ourselves that the agency whose order we are asked to review had jurisdiction over the matter in dispute.harmar coal,office of workers comp.programs,dep t of labor,cir quoting cardillo liberty mut.ins.jurisdiction is a question of law which we review de novo.groome res,parish of jefferson,cir.
this court reviews the board interpretation of the lhwca,an issue of law,de novo,affording no special deference to the board construction because it is not a policymaking agency.equitable equip,office of worker comp.programs,dep t of labor,cir see also estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d stating that the board is not entitled to any special deference zachry quinones,cir indeed,deference is owed to the director views and not the views of the board.ceres gulf cooper,cir stating that s ubject matter jurisdiction is a question of law,and our review is plenary.
iii.jurisdiction 
due to the maritime character of their employment,longshore workers were precluded from participating in state workers compensation schemes.see,at thomas schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at ed.therefore,in order to protect longshore workers,congress enacted a federal workers compensation lhwca.see schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at in return for compelling the employer to pay compensation without proof of negligence,the lhwca provides a statutory scheme of benefits which are substantially less than tort damages,and grants the employer immunity from tort liability,regardless of how serious its fault may have been.
a fundamental aspect of this system is the expectation that employers will pay compensation promptly and directly,without the necessity of a formal award.schoenbaum,admiralty and maritime law,at.however,when a worker benefits are controverted,a claim for compensation may be filed and heard before an alj,see,and appealed to the board,see id.
under the lhwca,an alj has jurisdiction over a claim for compensation and has full power and authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim.id.a emphasis added see also id.d vesting the powers,duties,and responsibilities of the deputy commissioners with respect to hearings in the alj the threshold issue we must decide is whether the parties claims regarding their indemnification contractual provisions are questions in respect of an lhwca compensation claim and thus questions over which the alj has jurisdiction.as we explain below,we find the contractual issues in this case are beyond the scope of the authority granted to the lhwca administrative tribunals.
a.the question presented 
before addressing the jurisdictional question,we make clear precisely what the parties are asking us to decide in this case.a body of law has developed under the lhwca in response to situations in which multiple employers and carriers possibly played a role in the worker employment.the borrowed employee doctrine deals with one such situation.this doctrine is applicable in cases where one employer loans or lends employees to another employer.
the instant case required application of this doctrine because,as described supra in part i,tesi loaned ricks to trinity.we have determined that the borrowing employer is the employer for purposes of the lhwca and,as such,is responsible for the payment of the worker compensation benefits.see total marine services,office of worker comp.programs,dep t of labor,cir.therefore,trinity,as the borrowing employer,is solely liable for ricks benefits.
this determination was made in the initial alj decision and affirmed by the board.it is not being contested in this appeal.what is at issue here is trinity contention that a contract exists between itself and tesi pursuant to which tesi has agreed to indemnify it from any claims arising from ricks employment,the worker compensation benefits and that maryland insurance policy contains a waiver of subrogation in favor of trinity.in essence,trinity is claiming that,although the lhwca places liability on its shoulders,it has contracted around that rule via the agreement.trinity claims are dependent,therefore,upon contractual provisions that are not governed by the lhwca.these issues are the ones addressed by the alj on remand,an action that the board affirmed.
scope of authority of lhwca adjudicative administrative tribunals in this case 
jurisdictional arguments 
the board held that the alj acted within his authority in resolving the issue of whether maryland is liable for ricks disability compensation,based on his interpretation of the relevant contracts.ricks temp.employment,ben.bd.serv.mb,available at wl,at.to support its holding,the board referenced pilipovich cps staff leasing,ben.bd.serv.mb,available at wl,in which it had held that an alj should resolve contractual indemnity and insurance issues between the lending employer,its insurer,and the borrowing employer.the board also relied on this court holding in total marine,in which we stated w e conclude that a borrowing employer is required to pay the compensation benefits of its borrowed employee,and,in the absence of a valid and enforceable indemnification agreement,the borrowing employer is required to reimburse an injured worker formal employer for any compensation benefits it has paid to the injured worker.at emphasis added.the board stated further that it was not in the interest of judicial economy to defer consideration of the contractual issues to another place and time.ricks,ben.bd.serv.mb at,available at wl,at.
objecting to the board determination,the director argues that the lhwca does not give aljs the authority to determine common law contractual rights and liabilities.he asserts that an alj can decide only whether a valid compensation claim exists and,if so,the amount of that claim and which insurer is responsible for making that payment under the lhwca.in essence,the director maintains that,by its terms,a only grants authority to aljs to determine issues under lhwca law as they relate to compensation claims.the director argues that questions relating to who may be liable under law is beyond the purview of lhwca adjudicative administrative tribunals.in this regard,the director points out that reading a to grant expansive adjudicative powers to lhwca administrative tribunals could violate article iii.the director also states that the principles guiding our decision in equitable equipment director,office of worker compensation programs,department of labor,cir,in which we held that an alj lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate an employer claim against its insurers for attorneys fees,command a finding that no jurisdiction exists in this case.as for the board reliance on its decision in pilipovich and total marine,the director contends that pilipovich was wrongly decided and that the total marine language on which the board relied is dictum,that the panel in the case was merely reserving a question not presented on the facts before it.
in addition,the director points out that placing contractual issues within the ambit of the alj authority will result in an erosion of the objectives of the lhwca.he states that the critical,central theme of the lhwca is to get benefits to which the claimant is entitled to the claimant promptly.this objective would be frustrated when aljs attempt to decide common law contract issues,questions that are beyond their expertise,and when the claimant must rely on entities,which are not set up to make such payments,to produce those disbursements.thus,the director argues that finding that aljs do not have authority to interpret indemnity agreements supports the public policy justification of the ready determinability of who it is that owes lhwca benefits.
the parties all disagree with the director that the alj did not have authority to consider the contractual indemnification dispute in this case tesi and maryland conclusorily state that the alj does have authority to decide their contract issues and that it would be inefficient to have to litigate these issues in another forum.the public policy considerations of avoiding multiplicity of litigation and efficacy underpin tesi and maryland arguments.
trinity argues that the import of total marine is that it is proper for aljs to consider whether a valid and enforceable indemnification agreement exists between the employers.trinity notes that,as in this case,an allocation question,which of two employers is responsible for the compensation benefits was at issue in total marine.trinity also states that consideration of the indemnification dispute conforms to a requirement that the issues are in respect of a compensation claim because the alj would be determining who pays the claimant benefits.finally,trinity objects to the director reliance on equitable equipment,stating that,while attorneys fees are clearly ancillary to the compensation determination,the responsible payer inquiry is not.
analysis of jurisdiction in this case 
we begin,of course,with the text of a.see landreth timber landreth,d it is axiomatic that t he starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.alteration in original citation omitted.the relevant language states that an alj has authority to hear and determine all questions in respect of such claim and the phrase such claim references a claim for compensation.a.thus,a plain reading of the text indicates that the alj authority extends only to questions that are in respect of the lhwca claim of an injured or deceased worker.
the supreme court has not looked beyond the text of a to discern its meaning.in cardillo liberty mutual insurance,the court stated simply that questions as to whether an injury arose out of and in the course of employment necessarily fall within the scope of the administrative tribunal authority.see also crowell benson.finding that the lhwca withstood various constitutional challenges and stating that the such claim language in a meant the claim for compensation under the lhwca and by its explicit provisions is that of an employee,as defined in the lhwca,against his employer.this court has,however,provided some guidelines regarding the jurisdictional reach of a.
in interpreting a,we have explained that the disputed issue must be integral to deciding the compensation claim.equitable equip,at,stating that a does not vest jurisdiction in aljs to decide a contract dispute between an employer and its carriers when the cause of action is wholly unrelated to an underlying claim for compensation.we held,therefore,that a state law breach of contract claim between an insurer and its insured is beyond the jurisdictional reach of a,particularly when the underlying compensation claim has been resolved and no factual dispute regarding the compensation claim itself must be decided.id.at see also restatement second of judgments cmt.g stating that an administrative tribunal ordinarily lacks authority to adjudicate claims arising out of the transaction in question but based upon other substantive legal premises.
equitable equipment essentially echoed the approach to a taken by other courts.for instance,in bethenergy mines,director,office of workers compensation programs,department of labor,the court of appeals for the third circuit held that administrative bodies under the black lung benefits act which incorporates by reference the claim management and adjudication procedures of the lhwca,such as a lacked jurisdiction to resolve disputes regarding interest assessed against employers on reimbursements to the black lung disability trust fund for medical benefits that the fund had previously paid into on behalf of the claimants.see,cir.agreeing with the director construction of a in the case,the court stated that b ecause the claim to which the lhwca sections refer is that of the injured or deceased worker,the administrative procedure is available only to a party who seeks to challenge some aspect of the worker claim,such as the worker eligibility for some or all of the compensation sought or granted.id.at.the court contrasted underlying liability determinations,p roceedings before the alj and the board which center on the evaluation of the claimant entitlement to payments,id.at emphasis added,and interest assessments,which do not benefit the claimant and are not sought on behalf of the claimant.see id.thus,the court concluded that although the demand for interest is predicated in the first instance on the fact that the worker filed the claim,it can not be sa
