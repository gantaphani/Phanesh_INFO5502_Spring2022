david mouser mouser and donald green green together plaintiffs appeal from a final order entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri granting judgment as a matter of law jaml in favor of caterpillar,defendant,on plaintiffs claims stemming from an industrial accident and conditionally granting defendant motion for a new trial.see mouser caterpillar,hereinafter slip op.for reversal,plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in granting jaml in favor of defendant because the rubber mixer that injured them was a dangerous chattel instead of a fixture on defendant real property.plaintiffs argue that because the district court improperly concluded that defendant permanently annexed the mixer to its rubber manufacturing plant,the district court erred in holding that missouri premises liability law applied and that their recovery was limited to workers compensation benefits.plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to amend their pleadings to conform to the evidence at trial and in conditionally granting defendant motion for a new trial.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
jurisdiction in the district court was proper based on.jurisdiction in this court is proper based upon.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
the facts and procedural history are largely drawn from the order of the district court.plaintiffs were employees of topeka machinery exchange tme,an independent contractor hired by defendant to repair a danbury rubber mixer at defendant rubber manufacturing plant in booneville,missouri.the mixer was installed at the booneville plant in as part of a rubber processing system which includes the mixer,the mill,and platforms and mezzanines where operators access different levels of the mixing system.the mixer must be integrated into the plant gas,electric,water,and ventilation systems in order to function.it is approximately twenty feet tall,or approximately fifty feet tall if the rubber mixing hoppers are included,and weighs approximately twenty tons.on march,plaintiffs were injured when the holding a pound floating weight inside the mixer main hopper came loose as the crew was reattaching it to the mixer.as a result,the weight crushed mouser left hand and green right hand.
in,plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in the circuit court for the city of louis,missouri.plaintiffs action was later removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri plaintiffs original complaint brought products liability claims alleging that the safety was defective.in its answer,defendant argued that plaintiffs complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and that plaintiffs remedy was limited to workers compensation benefits.on august,plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint,restating their products liability claim against all defendants and asserting an additional,independent tort claim against defendant captioned premises liability.plaintiffs premises liability claim alleged that the assembly on the rubber mixer constituted a dangerous condition,which created a duty for defendant to warn,remove,or barricade the danger,and that defendant failure to do so caused plaintiffs injuries.defendant answer to the second amended complaint adopted and incorporated the affirmative defenses asserted in its earlier answer.the case proceeded through discovery.
on october,the district court granted defendant motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs products liability claim.the district court,however,denied defendant motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs premises liability claim and permitted plaintiffs to proceed to trial.in their trial brief,plaintiffs summarized their claim against defendant as premises liability,arguing that the safety assembly constituted a dangerous condition on the land for which defendant owed a duty to warn its invitees.in response,defendant argued that the was not unsafe,and that,even if it were,plaintiffs were aware that parts of the mixer might not be functioning properly because they were on the premises to repair the mixer.on october,the case was submitted to the jury,which was unable to reach a verdict,and the district court declared a mistrial.
the case was set for retrial on july.on july,defendant filed a supplemental trial brief arguing for the first time that plaintiffs could not recover on their premises liability claim because landowners are not liable under missouri law to the employees of independent contractors for injuries sustained while working if the employees are covered by workers compensation insurance.the contract between defendant and tme required tme to maintain workers compensation insurance for its employees.on july,plaintiffs filed a supplemental trial brief which argued that defendant newly raised defense was inapplicable because their injuries were caused by defendant negligent bailment of a dangerous chattel,namely the mixer,without warning of the potentially dangerous condition.the case proceeded to trial on july.on august,at the close of plaintiffs case,defendant moved for jaml,arguing that plaintiffs could not recover on their premises liability claim because they were covered by workers compensation insurance.in response,plaintiffs argued that their claim for recovery was based upon the fact that the mixer was a dangerous chattel and defendant premises liability defenses were therefore inapplicable.
on august,at the close of all the evidence,defendant again moved for jaml,and plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint to conform to the evidence.the district court denied defendant motion,and the case was submitted to the jury.plaintiffs proposed verdict director for their premises liability claim was modeled after missouri approved instruction invitee injured.plaintiffs did not submit any additional verdict directors.the jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiffs.defendant then renewed its earlier motion for jaml and in the alternative moved for a new trial.
on march,the district court issued an order granting defendant motion for jaml and conditionally granting a new trial.in its order,the district court stated that the case turned on whether the rubber mixer and its components were a fixture of the real estate,and thus part of the premises,or a chattel that defendant turned over to plaintiffs for repairs.the district court noted that under missouri law a fixture is an article of personal property which has been so annexed to the real estate that it is regarded as part of the land.slip op.at quoting in re marla jean,marla jean additional citations omitted.the district court observed that three elements must be satisfied before an item may be considered a fixture annexation to the realty adaptation to the premises and the annexor intent for the object to become a permanent accession to the property.id.at citing sears,roebuck seven palms motor inn,banc sears.applying this test,the district court found that the mixer was a fixture because it was constructed and installed in defendant rubber mixing plant for the purpose of manufacturing rubber parts for defendant machines.id.at.the district court noted that,under the integrated industrial plant rule,the mixer was considered constructively annexed to the land because of its permanent use and necessary role in defendant plant operations.although the mixer was bolted to the plant floor and its components,including the assembly,could be removed for repairs,the district court concluded that the mixer was nevertheless annexed to the land because the components could not function independently and their removal rendered the mixer inoperable.id.citing sears,at.the district court also concluded that defendant intent to permanently annex the mixer to the realty could be inferred because it was a useful adjunct or convenient accessory to the plant.id.citing leawood bank city bank trust,leawood holding that intent to permanently annex a chattel may be inferred where the affixed chattel becomes a useful adjunct or convenient accessory to the business conducted on the premises.based on the foregoing reasons,the district court concluded that the mixer and its component parts were not chattel,but a fixture on the defendant real estate and thus part and parcel of the premises.id.at.therefore,the district court concluded that it was futile to permit plaintiffs to amend their complaint to convert their premises liability claim to one for dangerous chattel.id.
the district court also held that,because plaintiffs claim was governed by premises liability law,their damages recovery was limited to workers compensation benefits.the district court noted that,under missouri law,where an employee of an independent contractor is injured on a landowner property during the course of working for the independent contractor,the landowner can not be liable to the injured employee if the independent contractor is required to carry workers compensation insurance.id.at.citing matteuzzi columbus,banc matteuzzi.because tme was an employer required by missouri law to provide workers compensation benefits,plaintiffs were precluded from any recovery from defendant on a premises liability claim.id.at.therefore,the district court granted defendant motion for jaml.id.at.
the district court also conditionally granted defendant alternative motion for a new trial pursuant to.c because defendant would have been entitled to a new trial if the mixer were found to be a chattel.id.at.the district court noted that the claim was submitted to the jury with instructions modeled after missouri approved instruction,invitee injured.id.these instructions differed from missouri approved instruction a,negligently supplying a dangerous instrumentality,which requires additional elements of proof id.at.therefore,the district court concluded that,if the mixer were a chattel,defendant was prejudiced by the submission of the premises liability instruction because plaintiffs bore a lesser burden under that instruction.id.at.because the instructional error would have had a prejudicial effect on the merits of the case,the district court held that defendant would have been entitled to a new trial.id.at.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
we review the district court decision to grant jaml de novo,applying the same standards as the district court.hunt ex rel.hunt lincoln county mem l,cir quoting sip top,ekco group,cir.a motion for a judgment as a matter of law should be granted when all the evidence points one way and is susceptible of no reasonable inferences sustaining the position of the nonmoving party.id.quoting neely am.family mut.life ins,cir additional citations omitted.
we first address whether the district court correctly found that the mixer was a fixture of defendant real estate as opposed to a chattel as argued by plaintiffs.plaintiffs contend that the district court incorrectly held that the mixer was annexed to defendant plant.as noted by the district court,under missouri law,annexation requires a showing of annexation to the realty adaptation to the use to which the realty is devoted and the intent of the annexor that the object becomes a permanent accession to the land.sears,at.plaintiffs argue that the district court findings of intent and adaptation are not supported by the record.instead,plaintiffs argue that the evidence supports a reasonable inference that defendant did not intend to permanently annex the rubber mixer.plaintiffs note that a presumption of intent not to permanently annex may be created where a chattel may be easily removed without any material injury to the freehold.marla jean,at.in this case,the mixer was bolted to the floor and could be removed and disassembled for repairs.moreover,plaintiffs argue that the record shows that the rubber mixer was bolted to the floor to prevent movement during operation,not as a mode of permanent annexation.defendant also chose not to install floor pits to accommodate the mixer height,as was suggested in a sales proposal,further supporting the inference that defendant did not intend to permanently annex the mixer to its property.therefore,plaintiffs argue that,based on the record,the only reasonable conclusion was that defendant never considered the mixer permanently annexed to the plant.
plaintiffs similarly contend that the district court erred in holding that the mixer was adapted to the use to which the realty was devoted.plaintiffs argue that defendant failed to meet the adaptation element of the sears test because the mixer was not peculiarly adapted to defendant rubber making facility.plaintiffs note that in another annexation case,rothermich union planters bank,rothermich,the court held that bowling machines were not fixtures in a bowling alley because they were removed and reinstalled in another location,and were not therefore peculiarly adapted to the realty.id.noting a n item usable at other locations is not peculiarly adapted for use on the land in question.similarly,plaintiffs maintain that defendant rubber mixer had been used at a different premises and then rebuilt at defendant plant.moreover,defendant had another danbury mixer at its mossville hose plant that could be used as a replacement.these facts,plaintiffs argue,defeat defendant claims of adaptation because they demonstrate that the mixer was not peculiarly adapted to the realty so as to constitute a fixture.
we review the district court interpretation of missouri law de novo.hammer city of osage beach,cir hammer citing toney wcco television,midwest cable satellite,cir.based on the record,we agree with the district court that the rubber mixer in defendant plant was a fixture because all three elements of the sears test were satisfied.as noted by the district court,missouri has adopted the doctrine of constructive annexation whereby a particular article,although not permanently attached to the land,may be so adapted to the use to which the land is put that it may be considered an integral part of the land and constructively annexed thereto.sears,at citations omitted.when this doctrine applies to machinery in an industrial setting,it is sometimes referred to as the integrated industrial plant rule.id.at.we agree with the district court that,under the integrated industrial plant rule,the mixer and all of its components,including the mechanism,were an integral part of the rubber mixing system,and therefore constructively annexed to defendant plant.similarly,the most important elements in determining whether the mixer was a fixture,intent and adaptation,were both satisfied by the way the mixer was incorporated into the plant operations.see id.at citing crane epworth hotel const.real estate,slight annexation will not prevent an article from becoming a fixture where it is adapted to the realty proper use and the owner intended it to constitute part of the object for which the realty was constructed.although the mixer and its components could be removed without material injury to the freehold,defendant intent to permanently annex the mixer may be inferred because the mixer was a useful adjunct or convenient accessory to the plant.leawood,at.similarly,despite plaintiffs claims that the mixer was not peculiarly adapted to the realty,we agree with the district court that the mixer was constructed and installed in defendant plant for the purpose of manufacturing rubber parts specifically for caterpillar products see heidegger milling,wl,at heidegger holding that everything put into and forming part of the building or machinery for manufacturing purposes,and essential to the manufactory,is part of the freehold citations omitted.thus,we agree with the district court that the rubber mixer and the were fixtures of the real estate and therefore part and parcel of caterpillar real property.slip op.at citing heidegger,wl.
plaintiffs also argue that the district court improperly applied missouri law regarding premises liability.plaintiffs note that the principal case relied on by the district court,matteuzzi,and its progeny all involve construction or renovation of a building.see,matteuzzi,at plaintiff injured during renovation of a rowhouse smart chrysler,plaintiff injured during construction of a steel platform for renovations in an automotive pl
