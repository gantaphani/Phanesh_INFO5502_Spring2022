we have for review the third district court of appeal decision in county aravena,so d dca,which expressly and directly conflicts with the fourth district court of appeal decision in palm beach county kelly,so d dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.the conflict issue is whether county employees who work at different physical locations for different departments,have different supervisors,and perform different duties and functions in their primary assignments fall within the unrelated works exception to workers compensation immunity.we answer this question in the affirmative and conclude that the unrelated works exception was intended to cover this precise set of circumstances.we hold that although no rule governs,the unrelated works exception has both locational and operational components and requires consideration of several factors,which we set forth herein.
facts and procedural history 
county is the largest of florida counties,and its government comprises departments and approximately employees.gregoria vega was employed by county police department as a elementary school crossing guard.her job was to help children cross the street at the intersection of southwest street and avenue.on october,the traffic lights at the intersection were not operating properly.as a result,two vehicles collided in the intersection and one veered off the road,killing vega.vega was standing on the swale of the road at the time of the accident,which occurred at approximately 
julio aravena,vega husband,initiated a wrongful death case against the county,alleging that the accident was caused in part by the negligence of the county traffic signal repair personnel who failed to repair the malfunctioning traffic lights at the intersection.the traffic signal repair personnel worked for the maintenance section of the county public works department,which is located at southwest terrace.the maintenance section receives information from the traffic control section of the public works department,which is responsible for all traffic lights in county and is located at northwest street.
in response to the complaint,the county claimed that aravena action was barred by the portion of florida workers compensation law that accords tort immunity to coemployees acting in furtherance of the employer business and that the exception for employees assigned primarily to unrelated works did not apply.stat.the county filed a motion for summary judgment,which was denied.after a jury verdict in favor of aravena,the county filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict based on workers compensation immunity.the trial court denied the county motion and entered judgment for aravena.the parties did not dispute the facts relevant to the determination of the issue of workers compensation immunity and this issue was never argued to the jury.
the county appealed.the third district reversed the trial court order denying the county motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and remanded for entry of judgment for the county based on workers compensation immunity.see aravena,so d at.noting this court recent decision in taylor school board of brevard county,so d,the third district concluded that vega and the county traffic signal repair personnel were not assigned primarily to unrelated works.see aravena,so d at.the district court explained 
i t can not be said that these worked on entirely different projects.nor can it be clearly demonstrated that the work of the county traffic signal repair personnel,whose job was to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic,was unrelated to the work of the school crossing guard,whose job also was to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at the same intersection.to hold otherwise would contravene the overall legislative intent of the workers compensation law,which was meant to systematically resolve nearly every workplace injury case on behalf of both the employee and the employer.taylor,so d at.
aravena,so d at.
the issue before the court is whether county employees who work at different physical locations for different departments,have different supervisors,and perform different duties and functions in their primary assignments fall within the exception to the general immunity provision of florida workers compensation law,which provides that immunity is not available in cases involving coemployees that are assigned primarily to unrelated works.both the trial court and district court decided this issue as a matter of law based on the undisputed facts.thus,our review is de novo.see generally blanton city of pinellas park,so d.
conflict between aravena and kelly 
initially,we address whether an express and direct conflict exists between the decision reached in this case and the decision reached by the fourth district in kelly.the county asserts that there is no conflict.we disagree.
in kelly,the fourth district held that two coemployees,who began and ended their work days at the same general location but who worked at different locations and performed different job duties,were assigned primarily to unrelated works.see so d at.one employee,kevin kelly,worked as a maintenance equipment operator for the maintenance division at palm beach international airport.kelly began and ended his day at belvedere road,building see id.the other employee,rostant john,was an equipment mechanic for palm beach county fleet management division,who usually worked at the county shell rock pit in boca raton.see id.john began and ended his day at belvedere road,building 
similar to the coemployees in kelly,vega and the traffic signal repair personnel worked at different locations.vega worked for the county police department and was assigned primarily to work at a specific location as a school crossing guard.the traffic signal repair personnel were employees of the county public works department and were assigned primarily to maintain the traffic lights at the numerous intersections throughout county.the third district conclusion that the coemployees had jobs involving the regulation of vehicular and pedestrian traffic in effect defines related works as any jobs that are generally related.the same could be said for the coemployees in kelly who were both engaged in the generally related jobs of maintenance.
further,we note that there was a greater connection between the coemployees in kelly than exists in this case.unlike vega and the traffic signal repair personnel,the coemployees in kelly began and ended their days at the same location.the facts of this case therefore present a stronger argument for concluding that vega and the traffic signal repair personnel were assigned primarily to unrelated works.the holdings of aravena and kelly are irreconcilable,which is one of the tests for conflict jurisdiction.see crossley state,so d,concluding that because the court below reached the opposite result on controlling facts which,if not virtually identical,more strongly dictated the result reached by the alleged conflict case,a conflict of decisions existed that warranted accepting jurisdiction.
florida workers compensation law 
having concluded that an express and direct conflict exists between this case and kelly,we next review florida workers compensation law,chapter,florida statutes.the workers compensation law is a comprehensive scheme that generally provides workers benefits without proof of fault and employers immunity from tort actions based upon the same work place incident.taylor,so d at.the legislature has declared its intent that 
the workers compensation law be interpreted so as to assure the quick and efficient delivery of disability and medical benefits to an injured worker and to facilitate the worker return to gainful reemployment at a reasonable cost to the employer.it is the specific intent of the legislature that workers compensation cases shall be decided on their merits.the workers compensation system in florida is based on a mutual renunciation of rights and defenses by employers and employees alike.in addition,it is the intent of the legislature that the facts in a workers compensation case are not to be interpreted liberally in favor of either the rights of the injured worker or the rights of the employer.additionally,the legislature hereby declares that disputes concerning the facts in workers compensation cases are not to be given a broad liberal construction in favor of the employee on the one hand or of the employer on the other hand,and the laws pertaining to workers compensation are to be construed in accordance with the basic principles of statutory construction and not liberally in favor of either employee or employer.it is the intent of the legislature to ensure the prompt delivery of benefits to the injured worker.
section,florida statutes,provides that t he employer shall pay compensation or furnish benefits if the employee suffers an accidental injury or death arising out of work performed in the course and the scope of employment.emphasis supplied.section,florida statutes,sets forth the employer liability for compensation and section provides that this liability is exclusive and in place of all other liability as to tortfeasors and employees,save for certain legislatively created exceptions.
the immunity afforded to the employer under section also extends to each employee of the employer when such employee is acting in furtherance of the employer business.however,this coemployee immunity does not apply 
to an employee who acts,with respect to a fellow employee,with willful and wanton disregard or unprovoked physical aggression or with gross negligence when such acts result in injury or death or such acts proximately cause such injury or death,or to employees of the same employer when each is operating in the furtherance of the employer business but they are assigned primarily to unrelated works within private or public employment.
emphasis supplied.thus,if one of these exceptions applies,the injured employee can seek remuneration from a coemployee despite the fact that the injury arose out of the scope of employment 
in cases where the employer is a governmental entity such as a county,the coemployee tortfeasor is immune from personal liability for torts under section a,florida statutes,which requires that any civil action for the employee negligence be maintained against the governmental entity.under this provision,any negligence claim arising under the unrelated works exception against a public coemployee must be brought against the governmental entity employer.see holmes county sch.bd.duffell,so d,see also taylor,so d at lewis,concurring in result only explaining that a public employee may seek recovery from the otherwise immune employer,because the employer is not being sued in its capacity as employer,but rather is being sued as a surrogate defendant based on the negligent acts of the public.
case law interpreting the unrelated works exception 
the scope of the unrelated works exception has been addressed by all of the district courts of appeal.see,kelly,so d at taylor sch.bd.of broward county,so d,dca,approved,so d,lopez vilches,so d,dca,disapproved of by taylor sch.bd.of brevard county,so d,dade county sch.bd.laing,so d,dca vause bay med,so d,dca.prior to this court decision in taylor,the district courts had been split as to the appropriate test for determining whether coemployees were assigned primarily to unrelated works.the first,third,and fifth district courts of appeal applied a broad same project test in determining whether coemployees were assigned primarily to unrelated works.see,vause,so d at each individual defendant was assigned to duties related to the purpose and function of decedent job the provision of health care to patients of the medical center.laing,so d at concluding that the unrelated works exception did not apply because the coemployees were both working on the same project,in the sense that they were providing education related services to students taylor,so d at agreeing with the trial court finding that the coemployees were not assigned primarily to unrelated works because they had in common the provision of transportation services to brevard county school children internal quotation marks omitted.
in contrast to the same project test,the second district court of appeal in lopez applied a narrower test that focused on the physical location of the coemployees and the scope of their duties.see so d at.the fourth district has noted the two differing approaches of the other district courts,which it described as a approach,which examines whether were engaged in the same project and were part of a team,and a test based on the physical location where the employees were primarily assigned and the unity of their business purpose.kelly,so d at citation omitted.however,the fourth district has declined to adopt either approach,concluding in the cases before it that the results were the same under either test.see sch.bd.of broward county victorin,so d,dca.
in taylor,this court attempted to resolve a conflict between the second district decision in lopez and the fifth district decision in taylor.we considered whether a school bus driver and a school bus mechanic were assigned primarily to unrelated works.see taylor,so d at.after noting the legislature express admonition that the worker compensation law not be construed liberally in favor of the employee or the employer and the legislature mandate that the ordinary rules of statutory construction be invoked,the court concluded that the unrelated works exception must be interpreted narrowly.id.at.we then set forth the analysis to be used to determine whether the unrelated works exception applies in a given case.in doing so,we did not adopt either the same project test or the test.rather,we concluded that the exception to this scheme for unrelated works should be applied only when it can clearly be demonstrated that a fellow employee whose actions caused the injury was engaged in works unrelated to the duties of the injured employee.id.at emphasis supplied.we explained 
while we would like to be more precise in providing guidance to those initially charged with deciding disputes based upon this exception,we are limited by our lack of precise knowledge of the legislative intent behind the exception and the reality that we could not hope to contemplate the myriad of factual circumstances that may give rise to the issue.
id.emphasis supplied.applying these principles,we held that the school bus driver and the school bus mechanic were not engaged in unrelated works because they shared a common goal of providing safe transportation to the students.id.at.
in reaching the decision in taylor,we disapproved the second district decision in lopez.see id.in lopez,a funeral home worker was injured when the vehicle he was operating malfunctioned.see so d at.the funeral home worker filed suit against three coemployees,alleging that his injury was sustained as a result of their negligent maintenance of the vehicle.see id.the second district held that the undisputed facts did not preclude the unrelated works exception and,thus,reversed the summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants.see id.at.the second district reasoned that t he physical location of the coemployees work appears to be separate and their specific purpose,general funeral home duties versus vehicle maintenance,appear distinct.id.this court disagreed and instead adopted the reasoning of the dissent in lopez,which focused on the fact that all of the employees had duties related to the vehicle 
i disagree and would affirm the trial court determination that the unrelated works exception to the exclusivity of workers compensation benefits is not applicable to this situation.lopez,vilches,brito and kelly work for the same employer.all of them have some duties related to the van in question.lopez drives the van to facilitate the moving of flowers from the chapel to the cemetery.the other employees use the van in their duties of maintaining and repairing the vehicles owned or leased by the employer.under these circumstances,it can not be said that the are engaged in unrelated works.see abraham dzafic,so d dca.
taylor,so d at emphasis supplied quoting lopez,so d at quince,associate judge,dissenting.
in this case,the third district held that the unrelated works exception did not apply because 
it can not be said that vega and the traffic signal repair personnel worked on entirely different projects.nor can it be clearly demonstrated that the work of the county traffic signal repair personnel,whose job was to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic,was unrelated to the work of the school crossing guard,whose job also was to regulate vehicular and pedestrian traffic at the same intersection.
aravena,so d at.
although the third district claimed to adhere to our recent pronouncement in taylor,we conclude that the third district decision is inconsistent with the reasoning of taylor.the third district initially used the,same project analysis despite the fact that we did not approve of this approach in taylor further,to comport with taylor holding that the exception applies only when it can clearly be demonstrated that a fellow employee whose actions caused the injury was engaged in works unrelated to the duties of the injured employee,the third district resorted to an overly broad definition of the coemployees jobs as regulat ing vehicular and pedestrian traffic without considering other factors.
it is true that in taylor this court broadly categorized the duties of the school bus driver and the school bus mechanic by stating that these coemployees shared a more general goal of providing safe transportation to the students.so d at.however,in that case both the school bus driver and the school bus mechanic had duties relating to the same school bus wheelchair lift.see id.at.in addition,both the school bus driver and the school bus mechanic worked out of the same facility.see id.similarly,this court conclusion in lopez that the coemployees were not assigned primarily to unrelated works was supported by the fact that each had duties related to the use of the funeral home vehicle.see so d at.as in taylor,the duties of the coemployees in lopez were linked by the connection to the very equipment that caused the injury.
in this case,unlike the coemployees in taylor,vega and the traffic signal repair personnel did not work out of the same facility or with the same equipment.therefore,the third district reliance solely on a broad definition of the coemployees duties,without regard to any other factors,to conclude that the employees were not engaged primarily in unrelated works is not supported by taylor.
the third district reasoning is also inconsistent with that court most recent decision addressing the unrelated works exception.see lluch american airlines,so d dca.there,lluch was a employed by abm janitorial services,which had a contract with american airlines american to provide cleaning services for american at miami international airport.see id.at.lluch was injured when carlton service,an american baggage handler who was operating an american tractor pulling several baggage carts,hit a trash cart causing the cart to fall on top of lluch,breaking his foot.see id.at.after concluding that american was lluch statutory employer under the workers compensation law,the third district determined that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of american and service based on coemployee immunity.see id.at 
in analyzing the unrelated works exception based on this court decision in taylor,the third district indicated that it was persuaded by justice lewis separate opinion in taylor,in which he proposed applying a consolidated physical purpose test and same project test.id.at applying the physical purpose test,the third district explained that although 
both lluch and service worked at the airport in the area where the baggage is unloaded from the airplanes,lluch job required him to be elsewhere for a significant part of his work day because he had to remove the trash from american offices and haul it away to the garbage dumpsters.he was not required to clean under the baggage carousel on a regular basis.lluch had nothing to do with service and,in fact,had no idea who service was.
lluch,so d at emphasis supplied.the third district also concluded that lluch and service were not part of the same team because 
they had two different employers.lluch is employed by abm,and service is employed by american.service is a baggage handler,and lluch cleans and removes trash.lluch testimony reveals that the two men had never met each other before the date of the accident.they received different instructions from different people,unlike the scenario in sanchez dade county school board,so d,dca,review dismissed as improvidently granted,so d.the affidavit of clifford coll stated that abm has responsibility for keeping the baggage loading area and conveyor belt in clean debris free condition.in opposition,lluch stated that he has nothing to do with the operation,cleaning or maintenance of the baggage carousel,although sometimes abm requested that he clean the floor area adjacent to the carousel.lluch and service were not true fellow employees.
id.at emphasis supplied.
similar to the facts presented in lluch in which the coemployees worked for different employers,in this case vega worked for the county police department and the traffic repair signal personnel worked for the county department of public works,each of which are headquartered at different locations.vega and the traffic signal repair personnel were not supervised by the same individuals and did not have similar duties.in addition,vega neither knew nor had any interaction with employees of the department of public works.we note that even at the time of the tragic accident,vega responsibilities of ensuring safe passage for school children had nothing to do with the regulation of the traffic lights.
in fact,the only significant distinction between the factual scenarios in this case and lluch is that unlike the coemployees in lluch,vega and the traffic signal repair personnel did not work at the same location.although location is not dispositive,the fact that the coemployees in this case worked primarily at different locations further supports a conclusion that the coemployees in this case were not assigned to related works.
finally,the third district conclusion in this case is inconsistent with all of the other district court decisions that addressed this question.the district courts have consistently focused on the physical business location and the coemployees job duties in determining whether the unrelated works exception applies.until the third district decision in this case,no district court of appeal had held that coemployees that were neither assigned to work at the same location nor assigned similar job duties were engaged in related works.
by using overly broad definitions of the same project and the coemployees job duties,the third district ignored the other factors considered in lluch.its analysis also ignores the fact that the exception assumes that the coemployees are operating in furtherance of the employer business,and,thus,are all working on the same general project.accordingly,we conclude that the third district erred in holding that vega and the traffic signal repair personnel were engaged in related works.
factors governing the unrelated works analysis 
although we declined to adopt a specific test for determining the applicability of the unrelated works exception in taylor,we recognize that we should provide further guidance to the trial courts and the district courts of appeal.we held in taylor that the exception should be narrowly tailored.however,we did not intend to eviscerate the exception.thus,we must return to the statutory language employed in section to determine the scope of the exception and its application.
in deciding more precisely what the legislature intended by the term assigned primarily to unrelated works,we focus on the use of the words assigned primarily.we conclude that the phrase assigned primarily to unrelated works in section has both an operational and a locational component.thus,where coemployees are assigned primarily to different departments and different locations,and are assigned primarily to different job functions,the fact that the coemployees may have some broad overlapping responsibilities is not d
