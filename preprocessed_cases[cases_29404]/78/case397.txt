introduction 
respondent manuel aguilar sustained specific and cumulative injuries to both of his knees,shoulders and wrists,and to his right ankle while working as an auto washer for petitioner hertz corporation hertz.due to aguilar injuries and his inability to read and write english,the workers compensation judge wcj found him to be for vocational rehabilitation and thus permanently totally disabled.respondent workers compensation appeals board the board affirmed the wcj decision and award.hertz petitions for review of the board decision,contending that an employer should not be liable for permanent total disability benefits when an injured worker inability to participate in rehabilitation is due,in part,to nonindustrial causes.
in analyzing hertz claim we first determine that aguilar permanent disability should be rated using the rating schedule rather than the rating schedule.we then determine that a finding of permanent total disability is not appropriate in this case.under our revised worker compensation system,even when the rating schedule is used,an employer is liable for only the portion of an injured worker permanent disability that is directly caused by the industrial injury.the finding of permanent total disability in aguilar case is based in part on the finding that vocational rehabilitation is not feasible,and the finding of is due in part to nonindustrial factors.therefore,we conclude that hertz is not liable for that portion of aguilar permanent disability that is caused by nonindustrial factors.we will reverse the decision of the board and remand the matter for a redetermination of aguilar permanent disability rating.
background 
aguilar was born in mexico in,and lived there until approximately,when he came to this country.in or,he obtained employment with hertz as an auto washer,regularly working hours a week.he was working in that capacity when he sustained a specific injury to his left knee on march,a cumulative injury to both wrists and shoulders and his right ankle from january,through january,and a specific injury to his right knee on november.he received medical treatment,including surgery,for his injuries,and temporary disability indemnity during broken periods beginning may.he last worked on january.he filed three separate applications for adjudication of his workers compensation claim for permanent disability indemnity,the first for the left knee injury,the second for the cumulative shoulder,wrist and ankle injuries,and the third for the right knee injury.he also requested vocational rehabilitation services.
on august,gordon levin submitted a report finding that aguilar injuries were permanent and stationary,so aguilar was referred to the simon group for vocational rehabilitation services.on january,aguilar rehabilitation counselor at the simon group issued a report stating in pertinent part aguilar presents as someone who describes himself as in chronic pain,both with respect to the bilateral upper extremities and both of his legs.therefore,from a physical standpoint,even the positions i felt might be physically appropriate for aguilar,such as security officer or school crossing guard,did not appear to be work he felt he could perform.the other complication,of course,is that aguilar does not read and write in english.even for positions such as crossing guard,the following was indicated ability to read,write,and speak english.thus,from a physical standpoint,given aguilar presentation of his chronic pain and subsequent limitations,and the fact that even very light duty jobs such as security officer do require the ability to read and write in english,at this point,i do not believe he is feasible for vocational rehabilitation services.
at a hearing on september,independent certified rehabilitation counselors james westman and lei huff testified,and various medical and rehabilitation reports were admitted into evidence.the submitted reports of the parties qualified medical evaluators qmes,levin and carson,agreed that aguilar suffered both specific and cumulative injuries and had substantial work preclusions.according to the wcj,both qmes indicated a permanent disability rating of around percent.carson found that aguilar is precluded from working at or above shoulder height and has lost percent of his capacity for lifting with the upper extremities.t here is a prophylactic preclusion from heavy lifting and also preclusions from climbing,walking over uneven ground,squatting,kneeling,crouching,crawling,pivoting,or other activities of comparable physical effort with respect to both lower extremities.aguilar is not able to return to his full duties at hertz and is a qualified injured worker levin found that the limitations regarding aguilar left knee should be no squatting,no kneeling,no prolonged walking,and no heavy lifting.aguilar should have no repetitive work with either shoulder.the limitation as to his left wrist should include no heavy gripping and no repetitive use of the left hand.levin further found that aguilar will not be able to return to his normal job as a car detail person.
aguilar testified in english at the hearing with some assistance from a interpreter.after discussions on some of the issues in the case,the wcj granted the parties requests to submit letter briefs prior to submission of the matter.both parties filed their briefs on september,and the wcj issued his findings and award on september.the wcj found aguilar to be percent permanently disabled and awarded him indemnity payments of per week and further medical treatment.
in his opinion in support of the award,the wcj stated that he agrees with qmes levin and carson that aguilar is significantly disabled with respect to his knees and upper extremities.the wcj found that the two independent rehabilitation experts who testified at the hearing agreed that aguilar educational background,his native intelligence,and his level of skill in the english language together with his physical impairment render him permanently unemployable.it is proper to apportion disability brought about by causes.the normal variations in native aptitude found among human beings are not the same as disability that is part of the meaning of leboeuf workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,leboeuf.an employer takes the employee as he finds him.with all his perceived shortcomings,aguilar was able to compete in the open labor market before his injury.as a result of his injury,that ability is gone.
hertz petitioned for reconsideration of the permanent disability award,arguing in part that aguilar limited english language skills,virtual illiteracy even in his native spanish,and his lack of academic training and aptitude should be reflected by providing him with an appropriate partial,rather than total,permanent disability rating.hertz contended that where an otherwise eligible worker can not benefit from provision of rehabilitative services due to the effects of the injuries,leboeuf does indeed remain good law to the extent that a permanent disability rating even including a total permanent disability award is appropriate.however,where,as here,the applicant inability to return to any employment even with provision of the full panoply of rehabilitation services results from factors unrelated to the effects of the injury,such an award is inappropriate.hertz cited espinoza workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied espinoza,in support of its claim.
in his answer to the petition for reconsideration,aguilar argued that the finding of percent permanent disability was a correct and proper application of the principles set forth in leboeuf.he argued that the primary reasons that he can not benefit from vocational rehabilitation are the multiple and severe factors of permanent disability resulting from the work injuries,and that his education,aptitudes and language skills were only secondary factors.
in his report and recommendation on the petition for reconsideration,the wcj found that the testimony of both rehabilitation experts established that aguilar is for vocational rehabilitation and permanently unemployable.hertz is attempting to obtain apportionment to factors which are not disability.all of the disability awarded in this case is due to the industrial injury but for the injury,there would be no disability at all.hertz protestations to the contrary are akin to the regret one might feel after a pat on the head of the proverbial fellow with the skull.aguilar deficiencies may have rendered him especially vulnerable to physical disability,but they did not cause it.accordingly,the wcj recommended that the petition for reconsideration be denied.
on november,the board denied reconsideration for the reasons stated in the wcj report which we adopt and incorporate.
on may,we granted hertz petition for writ of review of the board decision.
discussion 
the parties contentions 
hertz contends here,as it did below,that an employer should not be liable for total permanent disability benefits where the determination that an injured worker is not feasible for vocational rehabilitation is due,in part,to nonindustrial causes.hertz argues that there is a distinction between a finding due to the physical effects of a worker industrial injury and the inability to benefit from rehabilitation services for reasons unrelated to that injury.w here an otherwise eligible worker can not benefit from provision of rehabilitative services due to the effects of the injuries,leboeuf does indeed remain good law to the extent that a permanent disability rating even including a total permanent disability award is appropriate.however,where,as here,the applicant inability to return to any employment whatsoever even with provision of the full panoply of rehabilitation services,results,in part,from factors unrelated to the effects of the injury,such an award is inappropriate.
aguilar again contends that the finding of percent permanent disability in his case is a correct and proper application of the principles set forth in leboeuf.he argues that substantial evidence in the record supports the finding that it is primarily the effects of his work injuries that prevent him from benefiting from vocational rehabilitation and,therefore,this court must affirm the board decision.in addition,aguilar argues that there is no reasonable basis for hertz petition,and he requests that we remand the matter to the board for a supplemental award of attorney fees.
relevant law 
permanent disability 
with few exceptions,all california employers are liable for the compensation provided by the state workers compensation system to employees injured or disabled in the course and scope of their employment.cal.const.art.xiv,see also.labor code section provides that issues of compensation for injured workers shall be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending their benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment.department of rehabilitation workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,department of rehabilitation.this rule is binding upon the board as well as this court.lamb workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,department of rehabilitation,supra,cal th at d.moreover,a ll aspects of workers compensation law are to be liberally construed in favor of the injured worker.citation.department of rehabilitation,supra,at d.matea workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
an employee who suffers disability as a result of an industrial injury is entitled to disability indemnity.gamble workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.temporary disability indemnity provides interim wage replacement assistance to an injured worker during the period he or she is healing.id.at,d.the right to temporary disability indemnity continues until the employee recovers or becomes permanently disabled.id.at,d.t he right to permanent disability compensation does not arise until the injured worker condition becomes permanent and stationary.department of rehabilitation,supra,cal th at,d,citing leboeuf,supra,cal d at,fn.a disability is considered permanent when the employee has reached maximal medical improvement,meaning his or her condition is well stabilized,and unlikely to change substantially in the next year with or without medical treatment,tit.
permanent disability is expressed in percentages.permanent disability of percent is considered permanent total disability,which requires weekly indemnity payments to the injured worker for life.permanent disability of less than percent is permanent partial disability,which entitles the injured worker to a certain number of weeks of indemnity payments based on the percentage of the rating.lifetime benefits are also payable to permanent partially disabled workers whose disability is percent or higher payment of the lifetime benefits begins after the final payment of the benefits payable for the worker percentage of permanent disability.in determining the percentages of permanent disability,account shall be taken of the nature of the physical injury or disfigurement,the occupation of the injured employee,and his or her age at the time of the injury,consideration being given to an employee diminished future earning capacity,subd.a.prior to the revision of our workers compensation system effective april,permanent disability considered the employee diminished ability to compete in an open labor market rather than the employee diminished future earning capacity.see stats,ch.
apportionment 
apportionment is the process employed by the board to segregate the residuals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries,or to nonindustrial factors,in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.citation.brodie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,brodie marsh workers comp.appeals bd.th,d marsh.prior to the revision of our workers compensation system effective april,apportionment was concerned with the disability,not its cause or pathology.marsh,supra,at,d.apportionment based on causation was prohibited.citation.brodie,supra,at,d.instead,a disability resulting from industrial and nonindustrial causes was apportionable only if the b oard finds that part of the disability would have resulted from the normal progress of the underlying nonindustrial disease.citation.this rule left employers liable for any portion of a disability that would not have occurred but for the current industrial cause if the disability arose in part from an interaction between an industrial cause and a nonindustrial cause,but the nonindustrial cause would not alone have given rise to a disability,no apportionment was to be allowed.citations.under these rules,in case after case courts properly rejected apportionment of a single disability with multiple causes.citations.in short,so long as the industrial cause was a proximate cause of the disability,the employer would be liable for the entire disability,without apportionment.ibid.
the plain language of new sections and demonstrates they were intended to reverse these features of former section thus,new sections,subdivision a and,subdivision a eliminate the bar against apportionment based on pathology and asymptomatic causes citations brodie,supra,cal th at,d.that is,under our revised workers compensation system,a pportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation,subd.a,and t he employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment,subd.a italics added see brodie,supra,at,d.
the apportionment provisions under new sections and apply to this case,regardless of the dates of injury,as the case was pending at the time the revisions became effective.kleemann workers comp.appeals bd.th,d marsh,supra,th at,d rio linda union school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
any physician who prepares a report addressing the issue of permanent disability due to a claimed industrial injury shall in that report address the issue of causation of the permanent disability,subd.b.in order for a physician report to be considered complete on the issue of permanent disability,the report must include an apportionment determination.a physician shall make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries,subd.c italics added.
the permanent disability rating schedules 
pursuant to revised section,a new permanent disability rating schedule was adopted effective january.section,subdivision d,provides that the new schedule shall apply to and govern only those permanent disabilities that result from compensable injuries received or occurring on and after the effective date of the adoption of the schedule for compensable claims arising before january,the schedule as revised shall apply to the determination of permanent disabilities when there has been either no comprehensive report or no report by a treating physician indicating the existence of permanent disability,or when the employer is not required to provide the notice required by section to the injured worker.section requires an employer to provide notice to an injured employee,when the employer stops paying temporary disability indemnity,that permanent disability either may be or is payable,or that the employer alleges no permanent disability has resulted from the industrial injury,subd.a.
vocational feasibility 
vocational rehabilitation services may be provided to an employee who suffered an industrial injury prior to january,if the employee is determined to be medically eligible to participate in such services.the selected rehabilitation counselor then determines the employee vocational feasibility,subd.a.as part of that determination,the rehabilitation counselor considers,in part,both the employee current physical limitations and work restrictions and any factors that may prevent the employee participation in vocational rehabilitation services.ibid.
for employees injured on or after january,if the rehabilitation counselor determines that rehabilitation services are vocationally feasible,the resulting rehabilitation plan must be completed within consecutive months,subd.h.vocation rehabilitation plans for employees who lack english language proficiency may include english language training when necessary to return the employee to suitable gainful employment,subd.l.
if the rehabilitation counselor determines that rehabilitation services are not vocationally feasible,the counselor must submit a report that identifies the specific factor s preventing the employee from benefiting from the provision of vocational rehabilitation services.the report shall further identify any recommended action the employee should pursue in order to attain vocational feasibility,subd.c.
in leboeuf,our supreme court held that,when there is a finding of no vocational feasibility,that fact should be taken into account in the assessment of the injured employee permanent disability rating.leboeuf,supra,cal d at.in that case,the employee was working as a bus driver when he was attacked and beaten by four youths.he sustained multiple contusions and abrasions,and also developed an anxiety neurosis.as a result of his condition,he was unable to return to work and a wcj found him to be percent permanently disabled.he was later found to not qualify for rehabilitation services because few,if any,jobs would be open to him given his condition.leboeuf,supra,cal d at.the worker petitioned to reopen his permanent disability award,but the board denied the petition.id.at,d.the supreme court annulled the board decision and held that a determination that an injured worker can not be retrained for any suitable gainful employment should be considered in any determination of a permanent disability rating.id.at,d.
in leboeuf,the finding of no vocational feasibility was entirely due to the disability directly caused by the employee industrial injury.id.at.and,at the relevant time,an injured worker permanent disability rating took into consideration the injured worker diminished ability to compete in an open labor market.former,subd.a leboeuf,supra,cal d at,see also gill workers comp.appeals bd.d.gill the rehabilitation counselor report of no vocational feasibility is relevant and admissible at the hearing regarding the determination of worker permanent disability rating.
hertz relies on espinoza,supra,writ denied.we recognize that because espinoza and other cases cited here are summaries of decisions by the board,they have no stare decises effect.however,the board has approved the citation of summaries published in california compensation cases.accordingly,courts may and do cite them in published decisions.see,robertson workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.in espinoza,the injured worker was found to have a percent permanent disability due to an industrial knee injury.the wcj took into account the injured worker for vocational rehabilitation due to her failure to learn to read or to write,but determined that this factor did not increase the worker permanent disability rating.espinoza,supra,at.the board denied the injured worker petition for reconsideration.the injured worker petitioned this court for a writ of review,relying on leboeuf and gill.the employer filed an answer contending that leboeuf and gill were distinguishable and did not mandate a higher permanent disability award whenever the injured employee can not benefit from vocational rehabilitation services in both leboeuf and gill,the injured employee vocational unfeasibility was directly related to the medical effects of their injuries,whereas espinoza vocational was due in part to nonindustrial factors.on september,this court summarily denied the petition for writ of review.espinoza,supra,at.
in the case before us,the board found that aguilar is percent permanently disabled,and that all of the disability is due to his industrial injury.our review of the board factual determinations is limited to determining whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record.lamb workmen comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.however,the interpretation of a labor statute is a legal question which we review independently,and the board erroneous interpretation or application of the law is a ground for annulment of the board decision.matea workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
in this case,aguilar was not found to be permanent and stationary as to all of his industrial injuries until august,after the effective date of the revisions to our workers compensation system.however,he had received temporary disability indemnity for some of his industrial injuries for broken periods prior to his last date of work on january.therefore,hertz was required to provide the notice required by section,subd.d to aguilar prior to january,when it first stopped paying temporary disability indemnity and hertz admittedly provided the notice under section in case no.prior to january.accordingly,the exception in section,subdivision d,applies and aguilar total permanent disability must be rated using the,rather than the,rating schedule.vera workers comp.appeals bd.th,d accord,energetic painting drywall,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d zenith insurance workers comp.appeals bd.th,d costco wholesale workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
even though aguilar permanent disability rating should be determined using the rating schedule,the rating must consider aguilar diminished future earning capacity rather than his diminished ability to compete in an open labor market,subd.a.in addition,the rating must consider what approximate percentage of aguilar disability was the direct result of his industrial injuries,and what approximate percentage was caused by other factors,including any conditions,subd.d.apportionment of permanent disability is based on causation,and is not limited to prior disabilities,subd.a.this is because hertz is liable only for the percentage of aguilar permanent disability directly caused by his industrial injuries,subd.a.s ection,subdivision a authorizes apportionment by causation,and section,subdivision a confines an employer liability to the percentage of disability directly caused by the current industrial injury brodie,supra,cal th at,d.
we find no evidence in the record to support the
