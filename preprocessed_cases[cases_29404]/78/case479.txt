stanley marsh marsh petitions this court to review the lawfulness of an opinion of the workers compensation appeals board wcab.cal.rules of court,rule.we are called upon to determine the applicability of the new apportionment provisions enacted by the workers compensation reform legislation under senate bill sb to a decision pending before the wcab on reconsideration.
after a workers compensation judge wcj found marsh employer fully liable for marsh disability award,the wcab granted reconsideration and ordered a rehearing to consider the applicability of the new apportionment provisions under sb,enacted as urgency legislation days after the wcj issued the findings and award.stats,ch.agreeing with kleemann workers comp.appeals bd.th,d kleemann we conclude the apportionment provisions of sb must be applied to all cases such as marsh not yet final at the time of the legislative enactment on april,regardless of the earlier dates of injury and any interim decision.
background 
on august,marsh injured his back while working as a welder for stanley bostitch in visalia in september,the parties stipulated the injury caused marsh to suffer a percent level of permanent disability based on arthur holmboe agreed medical examination.the stipulation provided stanley bostitch would compensate marsh a total of,less attorney fees,plus future related medical treatment.a wcj approved the agreement and issued an appropriate award in march.
in november,marsh timely petitioned the wcab to reopen his disability claim by alleging the industrial injury caused new and further disability.marsh alleged his primary treating physician removed him from all work activities as a result of a marked increase in back pain.at a february hearing,the parties submitted the issues of permanent disability,apportionment,and attorney fees on the written record.
on april,the wcj findings and award concluded that,in accord with holmboe medical opinion,marsh level of permanent disability increased to percent,amounting to plus a life pension.the wcj noted that holmboe report suggests marsh increased disability was caused equally by the industrial injury and by osteopenia and that holmboe thought marsh sustained subsequent compression fractures however,stanley bostitch failed to present supporting medical evidence sufficient to meet its burden of proof in establishing apportionment under section or former section as then in effect.accordingly,the wcj declined to apportion the award and found stanley bostitch liable for the full amount of marsh percent disability.
on april,days after the wcj determination,the legislature enacted a series of reforms to the workers compensation system as part of sb.significantly,the legislature repealed and replaced the apportionment statutes relied upon by the wcj.
stanley bostitch petitioned the wcab to reconsider the wcj decision in light of the new apportionment laws.over the wcj objection,the wcab granted reconsideration and returned the case to the trial level to consider whether sb should be applied to the wcj decision and,if so,whether the new provisions required a different outcome.preempting the wcj from readdressing the matter,marsh petitioned this court for a writ of review,which we granted to examine the applicable effective date of sb apportionment statutes.
discussion 
apportionment is the process employed by the wcab to segregate the residuals of an industrial injury from those attributable to other industrial injuries,or to nonindustrial factors,in order to fairly allocate the legal responsibility.fresno unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d fusd,brackets in original,citing ashley workers comp.appeals bd.th,d see also hanna,law of employee injuries and workers compensation ed.generally,an employer is held responsible in the workers compensation system only for the disability of an injured employee arising from the particular employment with that employer,but not for disability fairly attributable to periods of employment elsewhere or to nonindustrial conditions.fusd,at,d.
at the time of the wcj original findings and award on april,three statutes primarily governed apportionment 
two sections,and,appl ied to antecedent injuries.section relieve d an employer from the burden of compensating an injured worker for disability attributable to a preexisting permanent disability or physical impairment.section did the same when an injured worker disability is partially attributable to a preexisting disease or condition.the third,section,deal t with subsequent injuries.fusd,supra,th at,d.
before the enactment of sb,apportionment was concerned with the disability,not its cause or pathology.fusd,supra,th at,d.apportioning an employee level of permanent disability required the wcab to consider the open labor market as compared to the worker age,occupation,nature of physical injury or disfigurement,and ability to be rehabilitated.ibid.because the statutes focused on disability,an employer could be liable to the full extent an industrial injury accelerates,aggravates,or lights up a nondisabling preexisting disease,condition,or physical impairment.pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,ballard workmen.bd.cal d,franklin workers comp.appeals bd.d.
as part of sb,the legislature repealed sections,and and enacted new sections and.stats,ch.under the revised workers compensation system,apportionment of permanent disability shall be based on causation,subd.a.an employer is now only liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment,subd.a,emphasis added.
citing the law then in existence,the wcj prefaced the april,findings and award by noting in california,apportionment of permanent disability can not be attributed to causation nor to pathology.the wcj then appropriately analyzed whether marsh disability partially resulted from naturally occurring oesteopenia under section or unrelated subsequent compression fractures under section.concluding stanley bostitch failed to prove either theory with substantial medical evidence,the wcj found stanley bostitch liable for the full extent of marsh resulting disability.
marsh contends the wcab exceeded its powers by remanding the matter to the wcj to determine whether sb applied under the express terms of the legislation.section of sb provides 
the amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award of the workers compensation appeals board.stats,ch.
as an urgency statute,sb became effective immediately upon chaptering on april,i n order to provide relief to the state from the effects of the current workers compensation crisis at the earliest possible time stats,ch.
marsh contends the wcj april,findings and award assessing full liability against stanley bostitch constitutes an existing order,decision,or award specifically prohibited from retroactive application of sb under section.marsh asserts the wcj reading of the legislation comports with the declared public policy and the constitutional directive for the legislature to create a workers compensation system so as to accomplish substantial justice in all cases expeditiously,inexpensively,and without incumbrance of any character.cal,art.xiv.
to facilitate this constitutional policy,marsh asks this court to rely on the wcab en banc decision in scheftner rio linda school district,wl scheftner,decided after marsh petitioned this court for writ review.scheftner specifically addressed whether the recent apportionment reforms apply to cases pending at the time of the enactment of sb.in scheftner,the majority of the wcab commissioners concluded that the legislative prohibition against reopening,rescinding,altering,or amending any existing order,decision,or award as a result of the passage of sb encompassed nonfinal interim orders,such as orders closing discovery and submittal orders.scheftner,supra,at,wl.over strongly worded dissen
