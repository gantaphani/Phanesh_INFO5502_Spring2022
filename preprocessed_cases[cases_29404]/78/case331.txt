where an employee is injured in the course and scope of his or her employment,workers compensation is generally the exclusive remedy of the employee and his or her dependents against the employer,subd.a.the exclusivity rule is based upon a presumed compensation bargain t he employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.shoemaker myers cal d.
there are,however,limited statutory exceptions to the exclusivity rule that authorize the injured worker to seek to augment the workers compensation benefits by bringing an action at law for damages against the employer.see.one such exception is found in section,the power press exception.section authorizes an injured worker to bring a civil action for tort damages against his or her employer where the injuries were proximately caused by the employer knowing removal of,or knowing failure to install,a point of operation guard on a power press,where the manufacturer had designed,installed,required or otherwise provided by specification for the attachment of the guards and conveyed knowledge of the same to the employer,subds.b c.
in this case,a worker injured while operating a power press without a point of operation guard brought a civil suit against his employer under the power press exception that included a claim for loss of consortium on behalf of his spouse,predicated on the facts allegedly establishing the section violation.the issue before us on review concerns only the viability of the spouse loss of consortium claim.section contains express language limiting standing to bring an action under the power press exception to the employee or his or her dependents in the event of the employee death,subd.b.here,the worker injuries did not result in his death.the court of appeal recognized the spouse claim for loss of consortium fell outside the express language of section and was therefore unauthorized under the power press exception to the exclusivity rule.the court further recognized the claim was barred at law by the derivative injury doctrine because it was derivative of,and therefore dependent on,the employee physical injury or disability,and was for that reason subject to the workers compensation law broad exclusivity rule.snyder michael stores,cal th,snyder.
the court of appeal nonetheless concluded the spouse loss of consortium claim as pleaded in the civil action remained viable.the court believed that because section authorized the injured worker to sue his employer in a court of law for his power press injuries,the claims of both the worker and his dependent spouse fell outside the workers compensation system altogether,and accordingly,the exclusivity rule did not apply or bar the spouse loss of consortium claim.we granted the employer petition for review to determine whether the spouse of an injured worker may claim damages for loss of consortium in an action at law brought by the injured worker against the employer pursuant to section.
as we shall explain,notwithstanding the availability of a civil cause of action for workers who suffer power press injuries,claims arising from the industrial accident that caused those injuries fundamentally remain compensable under the workers compensation system.consequently,under settled principles of workers compensation law,the exclusivity rule bars a dependent spouse claim for loss of consortium.the employer demurrer to the loss of consortium cause of action below therefore should have been sustained.accordingly,we shall reverse that portion of the judgment of the court of appeal denying the employer petition for writ of mandate to overturn the order overruling its demurrer to the loss of consortium claim,and otherwise affirm.
factual and procedural background 
watrous employee or worker and nidia watrous spouse collectively,plaintiffs filed a civil action against lefiell manufacturing company employer or petitioner for injuries suffered by employee while operating a fenn swaging machine while working for employer.the swaging machine is a power press machine within the meaning of section 
the operative complaint seeks damages for negligence first cause of action,products liability second cause of action,and a violation of section fourth cause of action.in the third cause of action,employee spouse seeks damages for loss of consortium.she incorporated all the other causes of action alleged in the complaint,and alleges she has been deprived of employee services in the care and management of their home and family,and of his necessary duties as a husband.
employer filed a demurrer to the complaint,asserting the employee causes of action for negligence and products liability were barred by the exclusivity rule of the workers compensation laws.employer also contended employee spouse lacked standing to pursue or join in any cause of action for tort damages arising from the power press injury,and that her loss of consortium claim for damages was likewise barred by the exclusivity rule,subd.a,and did not fall within any of the recognized statutory exceptions to that rule.
the trial court overruled employer demurrer to employee causes of action for negligence and products liability.as to employee spouse,the trial court sustained the demurrer to all causes of action except her claim for loss of consortium,concluding that because employee had pleaded sufficient facts under section to support the power press exception to the exclusivity rule,his spouse likewise could properly assert a claim at law for loss of consortium in the employee section action.
employer petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate to compel the trial court to sustain its demurrer to employee causes of action for negligence and products liability without leave to amend,based on the holding in award metals,superior court d award metals.that decision holds that under the language of the power press exception of section,an injured employee is not permitted to bring an action at law on causes of action that require a lesser showing than that required to establish all the elements of the power press exception under section,because i f such action can not be brought on its own where the facts fail to establish all the elements of the power press exception under section,it follows that individual causes of action against an employer such as negligence or products liability which do not meet the stricter proof requirements of section can not be bootstrapped onto a civil action for damages which is properly brought under the power press exception to the exclusivity rule.award metals,at.
agreeing with employer argument based on the holding in award metals,supra,d,the court of appeal issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order overruling employer demurrer to employee negligence and products liability causes of action,and to enter a new order sustaining employer demurrer to those causes of action without leave to amend.that aspect of the court of appeal judgment is not contested,and as such,shall be affirmed.
employer further petitioned the court of appeal for a writ of mandate to command the trial court to sustain the demurrer to employee spouse claim for loss of consortium damages without leave to amend,because that cause of action is barred by the exclusivity rule in the workers compensation laws,and the cause of action does not fall within the power press exception.the court of appeal disagreed,concluding spouse may plead a claim at law for damages for loss of consortium because such a claim,like the employee own civil action for his power press injuries under section,fell outside the workers compensation laws and hence was not barred by the exclusivity rule.
we granted the employer petition for review,limited to the question whether the spouse of an injured worker may claim damages for loss of consortium in an action at law brought by the injured worker under section.
discussion 
we begin with the statutes establishing the exclusive jurisdiction of the workers compensation system.generally speaking,businesses,like other actors,must bear the costs of accidents caused by the negligent conduct of their activities when the injured person is not an employee,and the person claim does not derive from an employee injury,the costs are assessed and recovered through the civil justice system,subd.a.snyder,supra,cal th at.section,in turn,establishes the exclusive jurisdiction of the workers compensation system by furnishing an employer immunity from civil liability for any injury sustained by an employee and his or her dependents arising out of and in the course of his or her employment.
section,subdivision a,setting forth the conditions of compensation under the workers compensation system,provides liability for the compensation provided by this division,in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person except as otherwise specifically provided,shall,without regard to negligence,exist against an employer for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment and for the death of any employee if the injury proximately causes death,in those cases where the following conditions of compensation concur section provides,in relevant part,a where the conditions of compensation set forth in section concur,the right to recover such compensation is,except as specifically provided in this section and sections and,the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee or his or her dependents against the employer in terms similar to those of section,section provides that,for a covered injury,the employee generally does not have a civil cause of action against a fellow employee.
a fundamental condition of compensation under section and,hence,a fundamental premise of the exclusivity provided in all three sections,is that the compensation sought is for an injury to an employee.in some circumstances,however,the bar on civil actions based on injuries to employees extends beyond actions brought by the employees themselves.the employer compensation obligation is in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person,italics added,including,but not limited to,the employee dependents for injuries to the employee.this statutory language conveys the legislative intent that the injury engender a single remedy against the employer,exclusively cognizable by the compensation agency.williams state compensation ins.fund d.
based on the statutory language,california courts have held workers compensation proceedings to be the exclusive remedy for certain third party claims deemed collateral to or derivative of the employee injury.courts have held that the exclusive jurisdiction provisions bar civil actions against employers by nondependent parents of an employee for the employee wrongful death treat los angeles gas,by an employee spouse for loss of the employee services gillespie northridge hospital foundation d,or consortium cole fair oaks fire protection dist.cal d,casaccia green valley disposal d,williams state compensation ins.fund,supra,d at,and for emotional distress suffered by a spouse in witnessing the employee injuries cole fair oaks fire protection,supra,cal d at williams schwartz d.snyder,supra,cal th at see also caso nimrod productions,th,loss of consortium colombo state of california th,same.
as a factual matter,spouse claim for loss of consortium is unquestionably derivative of,and dependent on,employee industrial injuries.such a claim at common law has four elements a valid and lawful marriage between the plaintiff and the person injured at the time of the injury a tortious injury to the plaintiff spouse loss of consortium suffered by the plaintiff and the loss was proximately caused by the defendant act.hahn mirda th,fn,citing levy et,cal.torts loss of consortium,section,at.a cause of action for loss of consortium is,by its nature,dependent on the existence of a cause of action for tortious injury to a spouse.hahn mirda,at.
the court of appeal below recognized that spouse claim for loss of consortium was barred by the derivative injury doctrine because it was derivative of,and therefore necessarily dependent on,the employee physical injury or disability,and for that reason was subject to the workers compensation law exclusivity rule.snyder,supra,cal th at casaccia green valley disposal,supra,d at williams state compensation ins.fund,supra,d at.
the court of appeal also recognized that the power press exception to the exclusivity rule created in section itself contains express language limiting standing to bring an action under that section to the employee or his or her dependents in the event of the employee death,subd.b.here,employee injuries did not result in his death.accordingly,the court properly recognized that spouse claim for loss of consortium fell outside the express language of section and was therefore unauthorized by that section.
the court of appeal nonetheless went on to conclude,since employee injury is outside the workers compensation bargain,his spouse dependent claim also falls outside the compensation bargain of section.the loss of consortium claim,however,is only viable if employee establishes his power press injury.thus,employee spouse must plead the power press injury as the tortious conduct element of her loss of consortium claim.see hahn mirda,supra,th at,fn.italics added.
the court of appeal conclusion that the availability of an action at law pursuant to section for employee power press injuries results in all of his claims falling outside the workers compensation system,and its further conclusion that,consequently,spouse derivative loss of consortium claim also falls outside the compensation bargain of section,and is thus not barred by the exclusivity rule,were in error.what the court of appeal appears to have overlooked is that,notwithstanding the availability of a civil action at law for his power press injuries,employee claims arising from his industrial accident remain compensable under the workers compensation system.
in analyzing statutory language,we seek to give meaning to every word and phrase in the statute to accomplish a result consistent with the legislative purpose citations.california teachers governing bd.of rialto unified school dist.cal th.section was enacted as part of an extensive overhaul of the workers compensation system designed to address perceived inadequacies in the rules.employees claimed benefits were too low,while employers and their insurers felt the system was too costly,particularly due to the increasing number of exceptions to the workers compensation exclusive remedy rule.the resulting legislation reflected a carefully crafted compromise among employer,employee and insurer groups providing increased benefits for injured workers and their families and the potential for decreased expenses for the employer by strengthening the exclusive remedy rules.in the final legislative package there were only four circumstances under which a worker could bring a civil action against the employer,including the power press exception at issue here.the language of section reflects the legislature careful drafting of the terms triggering the application of the statute.jones keppeler d.accordingly,the power press exception to the workers compensation exclusivity rule in section must be narrowly construed.
section is an exception to the workers compensation exclusivity rule only to the extent that it authorizes an employee who suffers a power press injury to seek to augment his or her recovery under the workers compensation system.the section does not purport to supplant recovery under the workers compensation system with an action at law for damages where facts establishing the elements of a power press injury cause of action under section can be alleged and proved.this is made clear in subdivision b of section,which provides,where an employee,or his or her dependents,receives the workers compensation provided by this division and secures a judgment for,or settlement of,civil damages pursua
