introduction 
after she was injured while at work in the dominican republic,plaintiff gina tucci brought a personal injury action in california against her employer,defendant club med once the case was at issue,the parties filed competing motions for summary judgment.in her motion,tucci relied on the provision in the california workers compensation law,et allowing her to avoid the law exclusivity to sue for damages in tort.tucci claimed she was entitled to summary judgment on the issue of her employer negligence.in its motion,club med acknowledged the jurisdiction of the california courts but contended that under applicable choice of law principles,the law of the dominican republic governed and precluded tucci tort action against her employer.ruling that the law of the dominican republic applied,the trial court granted club med summary judgment and denied tucci motion.we conclude,pursuant to established choice of law principles,that the trial court was correct.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are undisputed.tucci,a california resident,accepted by telephone the offer to work for four months as an aerobics instructor for the club med resort in punta cana,the dominican republic.
while at work in punta cana,tucci injured her eye.on april,on her ride back from an eye doctor office in santo domingo,in a truck owned by club med and driven by a club med employee,she suffered pelvic injuries.after being treated locally,she was airlifted to a hospital for further treatment.
pursuant to dominican republic law,club med maintained worker compensation insurance for its employees with axa courtage a french insurance company.axa courtage is not authorized to write compensation insurance in california.club med had not secured a workers compensation policy with an insurer licensed in california.axa courtage paid tucci in excess of in medical benefits.she rejected all additional benefits offered by club med and its insurer.
tucci filed for benefits with the workers compensation appeals board wcab,which action is not part of this lawsuit.simultaneously,she brought this personal injury suit in superior court seeking declaratory relief and damages for breach of club med statutory duty to carry worker compensation according to california law,and for negligent operation,maintenance,and entrustment of a motor vehicle.
in due course,tucci moved for summary judgment on the grounds,because she was a resident of california at the time of her injury and the employment contract was entered into in california,that she was entitled to workers compensation benefits from california.she then asserted,because club med failed to carry a workers compensation policy with an insurer duly authorized and licensed to write compensation insurance in this state,subd.a see,that she was entitled further to avoid the exclusivity of the workers compensation law and sue club med in tort for damages,subd.a,including attorney fees,and to invoke the applicable presumption of employer negligence.
club med opposed tucci motion and claimed its entitlement to summary judgment on the ground of an absolute defense.rather than to contest jurisdiction,club med urged that choice of law principles required application of the law of the dominican republic whose workers compensation and social security systems provided the exclusive remedy for tucci injury.
the trial court granted club med summary judgment motion and denied tucci motion.applying california choice of law rules,the trial court concluded that dominican republic law governed this case.in particular,the court found while club med did not have a california policy,as defined under the labor code,the axa courtage insurance policy provided tucci with proper coverage under dominican law.italics added.that is,the court noted,all medical treatment that plaintiff had undergone by the time of the judgment,totaling well over,was fully paid for by axa courtage pursuant to the worker compensation policy purchased by tucci employer.the court noted that tucci did not claim that her employer had failed to provide her coverage or that the benefits were inadequate.rather,the court observed,tucci position was that she should be allowed to sue her employer for tort damages because club med did not purchase a california worker compensation insurance policy.after all of her claims were dismissed,tucci filed her appeal.
discussion 
standard of review.
summary judgment is granted when there is no triable issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.citation.we review the trial court decision to grant club med summary judgment de novo.citation.citation.an appellate court is not bound by the trial court stated reasons,if any,supporting its ruling we review the ruling,not the rationale.citation.prilliman united air lines,th,d.there being no dispute as to the operative facts here,the question is purely a legal one for us to resolve by de novo review.code.
jurisdiction of the california courts is not at issue in this case.
initially,we address tucci contention that section requires application of california substantive law in this case.section is a jurisdictional statute and has no impact on choice of law principles.that section declares the jurisdiction of the california workers compensation act and the wcab over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered outside california to employees who are residents of california at the time of the injury when the employment contract was made in california.travelers ins.workmen.bd.cal d,disappr.on another point in levesque workmen.bd.cal d.as a california resident who contracted in california for employment with club med,and who was injured in the course of her employment outside california,tucci falls within the class of people whom the legislature intended to protect under the comprehensive california workmen compensation statute.travelers ins.workmen,supra,cal d at.there is thus no doubt that the wcab has subject matter jurisdiction over tucci workers compensation claim in california.tucci right to workers compensation benefits,however,is not at issue here that is before the wcab elsewhere the point here is that because it is a jurisdictional statute involving the wcab and the workers compensation act,section does not determine whether california law or the dominican republic rule of decision governs the substantive issues in an action for damages at common law.
as contrasted with the claim for workers compensation benefits,a california superior court does have both subject matter and personal jurisdiction over tucci common law action for damages.club med has submitted to the jurisdiction of the california courts over it.once in a california forum,the question for our resolution is what rule of decision controls the substantive issues in this case.see janzen workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
applicable legal principles and the parties contentions.
we turn then to an overview of the relevant principles of workers compensation law.nearly every workers compensation statute in this country contains an exclusive remedy provision under which an employee who receives an award of statutory benefits is foreclose d from any other type of compensation for the injury,including damages in tort.citation.employees trade their tort remedies for a system of compensation without contest,thus sparing them the cost,delay and uncertainty of a claim in litigation.citation.conversely,workers compensation statutes typically allow a damages remedy against employers who fail to assume the statutory compensation burdens.garcia american airlines,supra,at huffman city of poway th,d.the employer who avoids sharing the burdens of the system is not entitled to enjoy its primary benefit,the immunity from liability.garcia american airlines,supra,at.this is the workers compensation quid pro quo.id.at.
this quid pro quo works thusly for a california resident injured elsewhere an employee,who was hired here and who suffered accidental injury in the course of employment outside this state,is entitled to seek california workers compensation benefits,subd.a the injured employee may also avoid the workers compensation exclusivity provision and seek damages at common law,against the employer who fails to assume the statutory burdens by fail ing to secure the payment of compensation,italics added.as applicable here,employers obtain security for payment of compensation pursuant to section,subdivision a,by obtaining insurance through an insurer that is duly authorized to write compensation insurance in this state.italics added.
by contrast,the dominican republic workers compensation law provides the exclusive remedy for an employee injured there.the workers compensation insurer in the dominican republic is obligated,upon receipt of proof of an injury,to disburse funds irrespective of negligence.additionally,all employees in the dominican republic have access to the state social security system,which operates as a pension plan and health care provider.otherwise,employees in the dominican republic may not file a negligence action against the employer independent from an action to recover workers compensation insurance.punitive or exemplary damages are also unavailable to employees there.
tucci position is essentially,because she was hired in california and injured in the course of employment outside of this state,that california law governs and she is entitled to california compensation benefits.continuing,she argues,because club med was not insured by a company licensed to write insurance in california,subd.a,section allows her to avoid the workers compensation exclusivity provision and to seek additional recovery in tort.stated differently,even though she may obtain all california worker compensation benefits that exceed her recovery under dominican republic law see fn,supra,tucci aims additionally to render inapplicable the exclusivity of the california worker compensation act on the ground that axa courtage is not an insurance company duly authorized to write compensation insurance in this state,subd.a.
club med argues,under applicable choice of law rules,that the law of the dominican republic governs and prohibits tucci from obtaining any recovery beyond worker compensation benefits and that country social security system.
thus,our task is to determine which law applies.
conflict of laws analysis.
when it is the forum,california resolves questions in disputes arising out of a tort using the governmental interest analysis,which balances the interests of the involved states and parties.offshore rental continental oil cal d,applying louisiana law in tort action.california applies its own rule of decision unless a party litigant properly invokes the law of a foreign state.a party advocating application of foreign law must demonstrate that the foreign rule of decision will further the interest of that foreign state and therefore that it is an appropriate one for the forum to apply to the case before it.citations.mcghee arabian american oil company cir.
this governmental interest analysis involves three steps.the court determines whether the foreign law differs from that of the forum.if there is a difference,the court examines each jurisdiction interest in the application of its own law to determine whether a true conflict exists.mcghee arabian american oil company,supra,at,citing offshore rental continental oil,supra,cal d at.when both jurisdictions have a legitimate interest in the application of its rule of decision,the court analyzes the comparative impairment of the interested jurisdictions.mcghee,supra,at.the court applies the law of the state whose interest would be the more impaired if its law were not applied.citations,italics added,quoting from offshore rental,supra,cal d at.with these rules in mind,we turn to a comparison of the laws of these two jurisdictions.
a.the laws of california and the dominican republic differ.
with respect to the exclusivity of workers compensation,the laws of california and the dominican republic are clearly different.as explained above,under california law,when an employer is not insured by a company authorized to write insurance in california,the injured employee may obtain compensation benefits and also sue for damages in tort by contrast,an employee in the dominican republic may not file a negligence claim independent of an action to recover workers compensation benefits.
b.a true conflict exists between california interests and those of the dominican republic.
turning to the respective interests of california and the dominican republic in providing recovery under each state laws,we conclude they are divergent,although both jurisdictions have recognized substantial interests in the welfare and subsistence of disabled workers.thomas washington gas light,supra,at.
california has clearly expressed its interest in swiftly compensating its own residents for injuries state comp.ins.fund.acc.com.cal d,in triggering industrial safety,encouraging employers to obtain adequate insurance,and in shifting the cost of injury onto the cost of goods rather than onto society.borello sons,department of industrial relations cal d.more important,california has a strong interest in assuring that its employers are adequately insured.cal.const.art.xiv.the quid pro quo,above described,allowing an injured employee to avoid the workers compensation exclusivity,provides an incentive for employers to secure adequate insurance.huffman city of poway,supra,th at,d,quoting from hernandez chavez roofing d.rideaux torgrimson,supra,cal d at,neighbours buzz oates enterprises d.penalties for failure to insure are incentive to employer to secure payment of compensation.
the dominican republic interest in applying its laws lies not only in making certain that workers are adequately insured for workplace injuries,as in california,but also in assuring that businesses in that country face limited and predictable financial liability for injuries,and in predictably defining the duties and liabilities of an employer doing business within its borders,all with the goal of encouraging business investment and development there.the dominican republic has a particular interest in applying its law to incidents occurring within its borders,where claims are based largely on the alleged acts of the employer in that country.offshore rental continental oil,supra,cal d at,finding this same interest to be vital to louisiana.in short,both of the jurisdictions have legitimate interests in applying their own laws.
c.the dominican republic interests will be more impaired by not applying its laws.
we next look at whose interest would be most impaired if its law were not applied.in workers compensation law,the united states supreme court has long recognized that the state where an injury occurs,the state where an employment relationship is created,and the state where an injured employee resides all have the significant contacts necessary to justify application of their own workers compensation laws.citations.dailey dallas carriers,supra,th at,d,italics added.hence,both the dominican republic where the injury occurred,and california where tucci resides and the employment relationship was created,have sufficient connection to this case to justify tucci receipt of workers compensation benefits.
however,california interest in assuring that tucci receive maximum workers compensation benefits travelers ins.workmen,supra,cal d at,because she is a resident and the contract of hire was created here,does not in and of itself justify applying california law to enable her to seek additional recovery in tort.
applying california law to provide tucci with a common law remedy would both contravene the quid pro quo around which american workers compensation systems are designed garcia american airlines,supra,at,and defeat the dominican republic policy of providing limited and predictable legal liability and financial responsibility for employers.under the quid pro quo,employees secure a practical and expeditious remedy for their industrial accidents,citation,while employers secure a limited and determinate liability,citation when a worker second claim is for damages rather than additional benefits,however,most states,on grounds of comity and
