plaintiff and appellant ernest leep appellant appeals from a summary judgment in favor of defendant and respondent american ship management,llc respondent in appellant action for unearned wages.appellant claims that he was injured aboard respondent vessel,the president truman truman,during a employment engagement and that respondent owes him unearned wages for the entire period.appellant relies on a memorandum of understanding between respondent and appellant union,stating that second assistant engineer and third assistant engineer rotary assignments shall be for ninety days.appellant was assigned to respondent vessel as a third assistant engineer pursuant to a union dispatch slip stating that his assignment was for a day rotary.respondent asserts that the collective bargaining agreement provides for maintenance and cure as customary and that customarily an injured seaman is only entitled to wages to the end of a voyage.respondent argues that there was no voyage due to a labor dispute,and that appellant was properly paid the correct amount through the date he left the vessel because of an injury.
we hold that the provision of the memorandum of understanding concerning rotary assignments raises a triable issue of material fact as to whether appellant employment on respondent vessel was for a period,and that respondent evidence of what is customary is insufficient to support the summary judgment.we accordingly reverse the judgment.
background 
appellant is an engineer and a member of the marine engineers beneficial association meba.respondent is the owner of the truman,the vessel on which appellant was injured while working as a third assistant engineer.respondent executed a meba collective bargaining agreement dated that governs the employment of meba members aboard dry cargo vessels.the evidence suggests that other shipping companies are parties to the collective bargaining agreement.respondent and meba executed various memoranda of understanding,including a memorandum of understanding.there is no indication that these memoranda of understanding were applicable to,or to be executed by,other shipping companies.paragraph of the memorandum of understanding states second assistant engineer and third assistant engineer rotary assignments shall be for ninety days.it is understood that the length of rotary assignments on foreign to foreign shuttle vessels shall remain unchanged.
meba issued a relief clearance card to appellant,stating that he was assigned to the truman for an approx.no.of relief days for a day rotary.appellant commenced working aboard the truman on october.at that time,the truman was berthed at terminal island for an indefinite period of time because of a labor dispute between the pacific maritime association pma and the international longshoremen and warehousemen union ilwu.the truman had been engaging in foreign voyages from oakland,california to japan,china,hong kong,and taiwan and returning to san pedro,california and had been scheduled to depart from san pedro to oakland on october.because of the dispute,however,the vessel was unable to depart,and the crew members were employed coastwise aboard the truman.
on october,appellant was injured while operating a portable crane aboard the truman.he left the vessel that day to receive medical treatment and was unable to return to work until january.appellant was paid through october.
the truman departed from san pedro on october,and arrived in oakland on october.respondent paid the coastwise crew through october.on october,the vessel departed from oakland for its foreign voyage to the orient.seamen aboard the truman executed foreign voyage articles before departing from oakland.appellant was not aboard the truman when the ship departed on october,and did not execute foreign voyage articles.
on november,appellant filed his complaint in the instant action,alleging causes of action for negligence,unseaworthiness,and maintenance and cure,seeking,among other damages,the unearned wages that are the subject of this appeal and his attorney fees.appellant waived his right to a jury trial 
appellant moved for partial summary judgment on his maintenance and cure cause of action,arguing that his assignment to the truman had been for a period and that he was entitled to unearned wages for the entire days.the trial court denied the motion on the ground that an issue of material fact existed as to whether appellant had been guaranteed employment aboard the truman for days.
respondent subsequently brought its own motion for summary adjudication of appellant maintenance and cure claim,arguing that respondent had paid all wages owed to appellant under federal maritime law and the collective bargaining agreement with appellant union or alternatively,that appellant could not establish a definite period of employment for days.respondent contended that section of the collective bargaining agreement with meba provided for the payment of maintenance and cure as customary,and that it was respondent custom and practice to pay a crewman employed coastwise through the date of his departure from the vessel and to pay a crewman employed for a foreign voyage through the end of that voyage.respondent filed in support of its motion the collective bargaining agreement the subsequent memoranda of understanding the declaration of ron mccauley,a crewing manager employed by respondent or by respondent predecessor in interest for years and a separate statement of undisputed material facts.mccauley stated in his declaration in part asm respondent has never paid unearned wages to any seaman beyond the date of a foreign voyage.in situations where seamen are employed coastwise aboard asm vessels and they become injured,the practice is to pay wages through the day in which the seaman leaves the vessel.paragraph of respondent separate statement states plaintiff did not sign ship articles,and october,he was employed coastwise at terminal island,solely due to the labor dispute and related lockdown of california ports.asm did not agree plaintiff would be employed coastwise for any definite period of time,as the time period in which the strike would remain in effect necessarily remained uncertain.
appellant argued in opposition to respondent motion that his period of employment was established by paragraph of the memorandum of understanding that provided,third assistant engineer rotary assignments shall be for ninety days and by a relief clearance card issued by meba assigning appellant to the truman for a day rotary.appellant opposition was supported in large part by his own declaration,in which he asserted that his assignment to the truman had been pursuant to meba dispatch procedures and the terms of the memorandum of understanding between meba and respondent that relief assignments typically cover more than one actual voyage and that the captain of the truman would not have permitted appellant aboard had the captain disagreed with the assignment specified on his relief clearance card.
respondent filed evidentiary objections to appellant declaration on the grounds that appellant lacked personal knowledge and any foundational basis to attest to meba dispatch procedures,the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement between respondent and meba,the typical length of meba assignments aboard respondent vessels,and the intent of the truman captain in permitting appellant aboard.appellant did not respond to the evidentiary objections.the trial court sustained the objections and thereby excluded from evidence portions of the declaration to which respondent had objected.the court did not exclude from evidence the memorandum of understanding or the union dispatch slip issued by meba assigning appellant to the truman for a day rotary.the trial court granted respondent motion for summary adjudication and dismissed appellant third cause of action for maintenance and cure.appellant then dismissed with prejudice his remaining causes of action,and the trial court granted summary judgment in respondent favor.appellant appeals from the summary judgment but has not challenged the trial court evidentiary rulings.
we requested supplemental briefing from the parties as to whether appellant failure to dispute paragraph of respondent separate statement of undisputed material facts precluded appellant from contending there was an agreement that he was employed aboard respondent vessel for any definite period of time,and,if not,whether paragraph of the memorandum of understanding raised a triable issue of fact.in his supplemental brief,appellant stated that his failure to dispute respondent statement that there had been no agreement to employ appellant coastwise for any definite period of time did not preclude him from arguing that he had been assigned to respondent vessel for a period of employment that the period encompassed both coastwise and overseas employment and that his assignment did not distinguish between coastwise and overseas periods of employment.
respondent contended that appellant was bound by failing to dispute in his separate statement the contention that there was no agreement for a definite period of employment.respondent also argued that appellant entire period of employment,including the coastwise portion,was indefinite because respondent could discharge appellant for cause appellant could unilaterally terminate his foreign voyage employment in a united states port upon hours notice appellant could be laid off in any united states port if the ship was inactive for any reason appellant could leave the ship without notice when working coastwise in any united states or puerto rican port both appellant and respondent could mutually terminate his employment for any reason and appellant could fail to join the ship in a timely manner before it departed from a port.

unearned wages claim 
vessel owners owe unique obligations to employees who become sick or injured.without regard to fault,a vessel owner must pay an injured or ill seaman a remedy known as maintenance and cure.t he elements of the common law maintenance and cure action included a living allowance during the recovery period maintenance,reimbursement for medical expenses cure,and unearned wages for the period from the onset of injury or illness until the end of the voyage.gardiner service,cir.maintenance is compensation for room and board expenses incurred while the seaman is recovering from the illness or injury.the vessel owner is also obliged to pay the seaman medical expenses until he reaches maximum recovery,or cure.the vessel owner must pay unearned wages for a limited period unearned wages,a component of maintenance and cure,are different from lost wages.the term refers to the actual wages the seaman did not earn because of his injury or illness.citation.generally speaking,whether the employment is for a voyage or for a definite time,it is the shipowner obligation to pay a seaman who falls ill or is injured while in service of the vessel,full wages throughout the period of employment.citations.berg fourth shipmor associates cir,berg see schoenbaum,admiralty maritime law ed,schoenbaum baptiste superior court d.thus,the extent of a vessel owner obligation to pay unearned wages depends on the duration of the injured seaman employment.
the length of a seaman employment is determined by the seaman shipping articles or other evidence of the seaman term of employment.schoenbaum,supra.shipping articles are a type of engagement agreement between the seaman and the shipowner,in which the owner agrees to pay wages for services rendered by the seaman blainey american steamship cir,blainey.they constitute the contract of employment between the ship and the crew,as well as the individual contract with each seaman.schoenbaum,supra.when a seaman and vessel owner sign voyage articles,the determination of unearned wages is easy.under voyage articles,the seaman signs on for one voyage,which may last for several months.if he is injured,his employer owes him wages to the end of that voyage or to the date that he reaches maximum cure,whichever is sooner.berg fourth shipmor associates,supra.here,respondent and appellant did not enter into shipping articles.
the terms of employment may also be governed by a collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the seamen union with a shipowner.see berg fourth shipmor associates,supra,at shipping articles may be an unnecessary technicality if the seaman in question is covered by a comprehensive collective bargaining agreement that serves the same function and a court may be receptive to the argument that a collective bargaining agreement is the functional equivalent see also blainey,supra,at.in this case,appellant union and respondent did enter into a collective bargaining agreement.
at issue in this case is appellant entitlement to unearned wages,which entitlement depends upon his period of employment aboard respondent vessel.appellant claims he was assigned to the truman for a period that he was paid only through the date of his october,injury and departure and that respondent owes him in unearned wages from october,through january,the remainder of the employment period.he contends the trial court erred in granting summary judgment because an issue of material fact exists as to whether he was employed for a definite period.
appellant relies on paragraph of the memorandum of understanding between respondent and meba,which paragraph states that,second assistant engineer and third assistant engineer rotary assignments shall be for ninety days.this provision appears to apply to this case.appellant was assigned to the truman as a third assistant engineer,and appellant union dispatch slip states that his assignment to the truman was for a day rotary.
appellant failure to dispute paragraph of respondent separate statement normally would be construed for purposes of the summary judgment motion as a concession that there was no contract for a specified term.see weil brown,cal.practice guide,civil procedure before trial the rutter group.because the duty to provide maintenance and cure requires payment of unearned wages only through the period of employment and disability the osceola,the absence of a fixed period of employment would rule out any duty to pay unearned wages.berg
