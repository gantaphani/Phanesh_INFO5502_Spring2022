charles hall died of burns he suffered in a refinery explosion.his wife sued his employer,diamond shamrock refining,a subscriber under the texas workers compensation act,its parent,ultramar diamond shamrock collectively diamond shamrock,and others for gross negligence to recover exemplary damages as permitted by article xvi,section of the texas constitution and section of the texas labor code the trial court rendered judgment for the plaintiff for a portion of the damages assessed by the jury,and she and diamond shamrock both appealed.a divided court of appeals reversed and remanded the case for a new trial the plaintiff and diamond shamrock have both petitioned this court for review.the dispositive issue for us is whether any clear and convincing evidence supports the jury finding that diamond shamrock was grossly specifically,that diamond shamrock was actually,subjectively aware of the risk to hall and was nevertheless consciously indifferent to his welfare.applying the standard of evidentiary review adopted in southwestern bell telephone garza we conclude that there is no such evidence.accordingly,we reverse and render judgment for diamond shamrock.
the explosion that resulted in charles hall death occurred when a reciprocating gas compressor at diamond shamrock crude oil refinery in dumas ruptured.the compressor,located in the feed prep unit fpu,compressed vapors like hexane produced in other parts of the plant so that their hydrocarbon constituents like propane and butane could be extracted and used rather than burned at the torch.the compressor could not compress liquids liquids,of course,can not usually be compressed,and the injection of even a small amount of liquid into the compressor cylinder could cause it to fracture,releasing highly combustible hydrocarbons that could ignite and explode.that had happened twice at the refinery some thirty years earlier,before the fpu was built,when exceptionally cold weather caused liquid hydrocarbons to condense out of the vapor stream in the compressor suction line on the way to the fpu.to prevent such problems from recurring,the fpu was designed to include a large suction drum to collect liquid hydrocarbons from the line entering the fpu and drain them to an underground accumulator drum.the suction drum had a sight glass to allow the compressor crew to see if liquids were present,a alarm to warn if the drum was filling with liquids,and an automatic shutoff switch for the compressor.
circumstances leading to the explosion at issue here began when the hydrocracker unit hcu was restarted following a routine maintenance shutdown.although the hcu crew was attempting to follow the same restart procedures that had been used many times before,the hcu began to overheat,causing excessive vaporization of liquid hydrocarbons in the hcu.this vapor was sent to the fpu,but on its way it cooled,causing the liquids to condense and flow through the vapor line into the suction drum.as the suction drum began to fill,the alarm sounded,prompting the fpu operator to ascertain that the liquids were coming from the hcu.when the operator saw in the sight glass that liquids were filling the suction drum faster than it would drain,he insisted that the hcu operator stop the flow.the hcu operator requested permission from a plant foreman to divert the flow from the hcu to the torch or to storage,but permission was refused.recognizing the danger of sending liquids to the fpu compressor,the hcu operator disobeyed the instructions he had been given and diverted the flow to storage.meanwhile,the automatic shutoff switch on the suction drum failed to operate,and the fpu crew shut down the compressor manually.
liquids draining from the suction drum into the accumulator drum were pumped from there to the compressor discharge line.this took several hours,and while it was in progress,there was a shift change.a new crew,including charles hall and two other men,finished the process.after some barrels had been pumped out,the crew checked the sight glass on the suction drum and opened bleeder valves on the compressor suction line to be sure no more liquids were present.none were,and the crew then began the process of restarting the compressor.
to understand what happened next,one must understand the system of lines and valves around the compressor,as illustrated in this schematic diagram 
the numbers indicate where valves were positioned on the lines.just past the suction drum not shown,valve,the suction valve,regulated the input to the compressor,and valve,the discharge valve,regulated the output.valve regulated the flow through a recirculating line that connected the discharge end of the compressor to its intake.all three were block valves that had to be manually operated by the crew.when the compressor was shut down,they were all closed.valve was a bleeder valve that if opened would release the contents of the discharge line into the open air just outside the compressor building.it may have been installed so that the system could be hydrostatically tested when it was first constructed,and it had not been used since.valve was a check valve with a flapper that operated automatically.vapor flow from the compressor would push the flapper up when the flow stopped,the flapper would fall by force of gravity to block any backflow in the discharge line toward the compressor.check valves are not generally designed to be,and at some earlier time the record is not clear exactly when an fpu operator thought this check valve leaked and had written it up that is,asked that it be repaired.it never was.crew members were not instructed to inspect valve before restarting the compressor,and hall and his did not do so.unbeknownst to them,the valve flapper inside the line had become detached,rendering the valve inoperable.
liquids pumped from the accumulator drum entered the discharge line beyond valve,as shown at the upper right of the schematic.when the compressor was running and valves,and were open,vapor flow from the compressor flushed any liquids pumped from the accumulator drum down the discharge line.but when the compressor was stopped and valve was closed,there was a on the discharge line.the line also sloped toward the compressor.diamond shamrock knew that without valve,and gravity would force liquids pumped into the discharge line while the compressor was stopped to run down toward valve,and when it was opened,they would be sucked into the compressor.that is in fact what happened the day of the explosion.because valve was broken,it did not block the liquids being pumped into the discharge line from flowing back toward valve.
the compressor had been shut down and restarted many times since the fpu was constructed fifteen years earlier,and the restart procedures were clearly prescribed.following those procedures to the letter,hall opened valve and started the compressor engine.with valves and both closed,vapor simply recirculated without putting any load on the compressor until its engine had warmed up.an open torch line,not shown in the schematic,also reduced pressure on the system during startup.the crew was then required first to open valve,next to open valve,and finally to close valve,at which point the compressor would be back on line.restart procedures did not call for the crew to check for liquids on the discharge side of the compressor,and they did not do so.had they been instructed to open valve,liquids would have escaped,revealing their presence in the discharge line.but valve,as already noted,had not been used to test for the presence of liquids and apparently had not been installed for that purpose.because it was never used,over the years it had become covered up with dirt.some fpu crew members knew where it was,but hall and his did not.
as valve was opened,gravity and on the discharge line pushed the accumulated liquids that had moved down the line from the broken check valve into the recirculating line where they were pulled up into the suction of the compressor.seconds later,the compressor began to make loud,knocking noises,which one crew member described as sounding like cannon fire.hall quickly tried to close valve,but the
