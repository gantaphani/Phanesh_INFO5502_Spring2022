the question here is whether the presumption established by subdivision b of labor code section section b is conclusive or rebuttable.that statute,which is one of the workers compensation statutes enacted in to govern apportionment of permanent disability stats,ch,provides that i f the applicant has received a prior award of permanent disability,it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.
petitioner ed kopping contends this statute is internally inconsistent,because the second sentence means the section b presumption is actually rebuttable,not conclusive as the first sentence says it is.kopping contends the statute must be construed liberally in his favor and thus interpreted to create a rebuttable presumption of the continued existence of a prior permanent disability that can be rebutted by proof of medical rehabilitation prior to the subsequent industrial injury.
for reasons we will explain,we conclude the legislature intended the section b presumption to be conclusive,not rebuttable,notwithstanding the second sentence of the statute.that means the workers compensation appeal board board correctly determined that kopping is not entitled to prove he was medically rehabilitated from his prior permanent disability when he sustained a subsequent industrial injury.however,the board incorrectly determined that kopping has the burden of disproving overlap between his current permanent disability and his previous disability in order to establish his claim to permanent disability benefits.instead,we conclude state compensation insurance fund state fund,the adjusting agency for kopping employer,has the burden of proving overlap between the current disability and the previous disability in order to establish its right to apportionment of kopping permanent disability.accordingly,we will annul the board decision and remand the matter for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
in,kopping injured his spine while working as a traffic officer for the california highway patrol chp.the parties stipulated that the injury caused permanent disability of percent,and kopping was awarded in permanent disability benefits.at the time,the agreed medical examiner described kopping factors of disability as restrictions in spinal motion and subjective complaints of intermittent to frequent slight to moderate pain.
in december,kopping sustained another back injury while working for the chp.the parties stipulated that kopping level of permanent disability is now percent,based on factors of disability described by another agreed medical examiner barber as approximating halfway between a disability precluding repetitive motions of the back and a disability precluding heavy lifting.in his report,barber concluded there should be no apportionment of kopping permanent disability to the injury based on kopping remarks that he completely recovered from this prior low back industrial injury with no ongoing physical limitations.
state fund,the adjusting agency for the chp,argued that notwithstanding kopping claim of rehabilitation from the prior injury,the permanent disability resulting from that injury had to be treated as still existing because of the conclusive presumption of section b.the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj agreed and concluded that kopping was not entitled to any permanent disability benefits for his injury because the level of disability percent resulting from the injury exceeded the level of disability percent resulting from the injury 
kopping filed a petition for reconsideration with the board challenging the wcj construction of section b.kopping also argued that even if the presumption of section b is conclusive,the wcj still erred in deducting the prior percentage of permanent disability from the current percentage of disability to the extent the factors of disability did not overlap.
the board granted reconsideration.in its decision after reconsideration,the board rescinded the wcj decision and returned the matter to the trial level to allow the parties to further develop the record,if necessary,and for the wcj to reconsider the matter in light of two recent en banc decisions by the board on the issue of apportionment sanchez county of los angeles,wl sanchez and strong city county of san francisco,wl strong.
in sanchez and strong,the board held that w hen the employer has established the existence of any prior permanent disability award s,the permanent disability underlying any such award s is conclusively presumed to still exist,the applicant is not permitted to show medical rehabilitation from the disabling effects of the earlier industrial injury or injuries.sanchez,supra,at strong,supra,at.the board further held that in such cases,the percentage of permanent disability from the prior award s will be subtracted from the current overall percentage of permanent disability,unless the applicant disproves overlap,the applicant demonstrates that the prior permanent disability and the current permanent disability affect different abilities to compete and earn,either in whole or in part.sanchez,supra,at.thus,the board returned this case to the wcj to determine whether kopping had disproved or could disprove overlap,not to allow kopping to prove medical rehabilitation from the disabling effects of his earlier injury.
kopping petitioned this court for a writ of review of the board decision after reconsideration,which we granted to consider the intended meaning of section b 
discussion 
the fundamental rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature in enacting the statute.citation.we construe the workers compensation scheme as a whole and consider the words used in their usual,commonsense meaning.citation.we liberally construe all aspects of workers compensation law in favor of the injured worker.henry workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.t he liberality rule,however,which is found in section can not supplant the intent of the legislature as expressed in a particular statute.fuentes workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.if the legislature intent appears from the language and context of the relevant statutory provisions,then we must effectuate that intent,even though the particular statutory language is contrary to the basic policy of the workers compensation law,quoting earl ranch,industrial acc.com.cal d.
read in isolation,the first sentence of section b is clear if the applicant has received a prior award of permanent disability,it shall be conclusively presumed that the prior permanent disability exists at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.italics added.where the law makes a certain fact a conclusive presumption evidence can not be received to the contrary.estate of mills cal.thus,if section b creates a conclusive presumption of the continued existence of a prior permanent disability,then upon proof that the applicant received a prior award of permanent disability,evidence can not be received that the prior permanent disability associated with that award did not exist at the time of any subsequent industrial injury.here,that would mean kopping would be forbidden from proving he was medically rehabilitated from the permanently disabling effects of his back injury when he injured his back again in 
had the legislature stopped with the first sentence of section b,this case would not be here.the legislature,however,did not stop there instead,it saw fit to add a second sentence to the statute,explaining that t his presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.
without reference to the evidence code,this provision can be readily explained.under workers compensation law before the enactment of section b,the burden of proving apportionment fell on the employer,because i t is the employer who benefits from a finding of apportionment.pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.thus,the employer had the burden of proving the applicant had a prior industrial injury and that the present level of permanent disability was apportionable,in whole or in part,to that injury,for which the employer was not responsible.this would have included proving an overlap between the prior disability and the current disability,since overlap is part of apportionment.see mercier workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.accordingly,without reference to the evidence code,the two sentences of section b can be reconciled as follows the conclusive presumption of section b is a presumption affecting the burden of proof because it affects the employer burden of proving apportionment by conclusively establishing that the permanent disability resulting from a previous industrial injury still existed at the time of the subsequent injury.of course,under this reading of the statute,the employer would still have to prove that the previous disability,which was conclusively presumed to still exist,overlapped with the current disability.
if we turn to the evidence code,however,we can see a potential conflict in the two sentences of section b.this is so because evidence code section provides that a presumption is either conclusive or rebuttable.every rebuttable presumption is either a a presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence or b a presumption affecting the burden of proof.further,evidence code section provides that t he effect of a presumption affecting the burden of proof is to impose upon the party against whom it operates the burden of proof as to the nonexistence of the presumed fact.
thus,the evidence code gives the phrase presumption affecting the burden of proof a technical meaning,using it to describe a type of rebuttable presumption that imposes on the party against whom it operates the burden of proving the nonexistence of the presumed fact.read in light of these provisions,the second sentence of section b can be understood to say that the presumption of that statute is rebuttable.under this reading of the statute,upon proof of a prior permanent disability award it would be presumed that the permanent disability on which that award was based still existed at the time of the subsequent injury,unless and until the applicant carried his or her burden of proving that it did not,by proving medical rehabilitation from the earlier injury.
the problem with reading the second sentence of section b in light of evidence code sections and is that this reading of the statute appears to utterly negate that aspect of the first sentence which plainly identifies the presumption as conclusive in nature.as evidence code explains,a presumption is either conclusive or rebuttable italics added it can not be both.under this reading of the statute,either the first sentence is what the legislature intended the presumption is conclusive,and the second sentence is meaningless,or the second sentence read in light of the evidence code is what the legislature intended the presumption is rebuttable,and the word conclusively in the first sentence is meaningless.
in sanchez,supra,at pages to,the board purported to harmonize the two sentences to avoid this dilemma.the board analysis on this point,which we set out at length,is as follows w e conclude that,once an employer has established the existence of a prior award of permanent disability relating to the same region of the body,then the percentage of permanent disability found under the prior award will be subtracted from the current overall percentage of disability,unless the applicant disproves overlap by establishing that the prior permanent disability does not overlap the current permanent disability,either in whole or in part.
this interpretation of section b harmonizes its first sentence with its second sentence that is,consistent with the first sentence,the prior permanent disability still will be conclusively presumed to exist,and the applicant can not show that he or she has medically rehabilitated from it.nevertheless,consistent with the second sentence,the applicant will have the opportunity to disprove or negate apportionment,in whole or in part,by showing that his or her most recent injury caused some new permanent disability that did not previously exist,that the new injury has produced separate and independent permanent disability that does not overlap the permanent disability because the new disability affects different abilities to compete and earn.if,however,the applicant fails to disprove overlap,then the applicant can not avoid the application of the conclusive presumption that the prior permanent disability still exists and,therefore,the prior percentage permanent disability rating will be deducted from the current overall percentage permanent disability rating where the disabilities are in the same region as described in section c.
further,the phrase prior permanent disability in section b does not mean the factors of disability upon which the prior permanent disability award was based.to so interpret section b would mean that,before the conclusive presumption could attach,the employer would have both the burden of proving the existence of a prior permanent disability award and the burden of proving the nature of the permanent disability upon which that award was based.as noted earlier,the trigger for the conclusive presumption is the existence of a prior award of permanent disability,not the factors of permanent disability underline sic such an award.
additionally,if an employer were required to establish the prior factors of permanent disability as well as the existence of the prior permanent disability award,this effectively would cause the second sentence of section b to be read out of the statute once more,the second sentence of section b provides,in essence,that the conclusive presumption that the prior permanent disability exists is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.a presumption affecting the burden of proof requires the party against whom the presumption operates to establish the nonexistence of the presumed fact.citation.reading the first and second sentences of section b together,as we must,the conclusive presumption of the existence of prior permanent disability in the first sentence of section b operates in favor of the employer.therefore,any interpretation of the second sentence must require applicant to disprove something,while at the same time not nullifying whatever has been conclusively established.
both of these aspects of section b are fulfilled by requiring the applicant to disprove the existence of overlap by establishing the nature of the permanent disability upon which the prior permanent disability award was based,rather than by requiring the employer to prove the existence of overlap by establishing the nature of that permanent disability.this is because,once the character of the permanent disability underlying the prior permanent disability award is established,the determination of apportionment is essentially a mechanical a burden of proof,it is determined using substantially the same overlap principles that have been historically applied thus,if an employer had to prove not only the existence of a prior permanent disability award,but also the character of the permanent disability upon which the prior award was predicated,there would be nothing left for the applicant to disprove,in contravention to the second sentence of section b.
moreover,a conclusive presumption is a substantive rule of law adopted to further some particular public policy or purpose.citations.similarly,a presumption affecting the burden of proof is intended to implement some public policy other than to facilitate the determination of the particular action in which the presumption is applied.citation.it appears that the public policies behind the twofold conclusive and rebuttable presumptions of section b are that apportionment of disability will occur,the disability will be deducted,unless some showing is made other than medical rehabilitation why apportionment should not occur.to interpret section b to mean that,once a prior permanent disability award has been established,the prior permanent disability percentage will be deducted unless applicant shows that the present and disabilities do not overlap,in whole or in part,is consistent with these policies.sanchez,supra,at,fn.omitted.
understandably,kopping rejects the board interpretation of section b because it precludes him from rebutting the continued existence of the prior disability through evidence of medical rehabilitation.in contrast to the board,kopping contends that the only reasonable interpretation of the meaning of this statute,applying established rules of statutory construction,is that where the employer proves the existence of a prior permanent disability award,section b operates to shift the burden of proof to the injured worker to demonstrate that the prior disability no longer exists or has diminished.to interpret this statute any other way would render useless the second sentence of the statute.
the primary flaw in this argument is that kopping interpretation of section b contravenes the very principle he urges us to i nterpretive constructions which render some words surplusage are to be avoided.california mfrs.public utilities com.cal d.if kopping is correct,and section b simply operates to shift the burden of proof to the claimant to prove the prior disability no longer exists or has diminished,then there is nothing at all conclusive about the presumption that the prior disability continues to exist,and that word in the first sentence of the statute is rendered meaningless.
in any event,the rule that kopping urges us to which the board attempted to follow in been described elsewhere as the cardinal rule of statutory construction that in attempting to ascertain the legislative intention effect should be given,whenever possible,to the statute as a whole and to every word and clause thereof,leaving no part or provision useless or deprived of meaning.weber county of santa barbara cal d,italics added.thus,while every reasonable attempt should be made to give meaning to every part of a statute,this rule recognizes that sometimes it is impossible to achieve this goal.the question for us is whether this is one of those times.
turning back to the board interpretation of the statute,kopping complains that the board he characterizes as creating a single,presumption find s no support in any of the actual statutory language.we tend to agree.as we have noted,a presumption is either conclusive or rebuttable it can not be both.moreover,to the extent sanchez can be read as finding two presumptions in section b one conclusive regarding the continued existence of the prior disability and one rebuttable regarding whether the prior disability and the new disability overlap that approach is not supported by the language of the statute.the reference in the second sentence of the statute to t his presumption is clearly a reference to the conclusive presumption set out in the first sentence of the statute.while we laud the board attempt to give meaning to both sentences in the statute,we do not believe the statute can be reasonably interpreted as creating two different,but related,presumptions that apply in apportionment cases.section b creates only a single presumption,which is either conclusive or rebuttable.the question is,which is it 
kopping contends that construing section b as creating a rebuttable presumption would harmonize the statute with the remainder of the apportionment statutes created by sb the bill that modified the workers compensation law in he first points to subdivision a of section section a,which provides that t he employer shall only be liable for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment.according to kopping,t o interpret section b as a conclusive presumption resulting in deduction of prior disability awards by operation of law is inconsistent with the mandate of section a that the employer shall be liable for the percentage of disability caused by the injury.
we disagree.if permanent disability is understood as the irreversible residual of an injury cal.workers compensation practice ed,italics added as contrasted with temporary disability,then it is anomalous that an injured worker who was determined to have a permanent disability could prove,at a later date,that he actually recovered from that disability.if section b is understood as representing the legislature common sense recognition that there can be no recovery from a permanent disability,then there is no inconsistency between that statute and section a.this is so because a new industrial injury can not be the cause direct or otherwise of a preexisting permanent disability.thus,the presumption that a permanent disability continues to exist throughout the claimant lifetime is perfectly consistent with the provision in section a that limits an employer liability to the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by the new injury.the employer should not be liable for a preexisting disability because the injury for which the employer is liable can not be the cause of that disability.
kopping next points to subdivision c of section section c,which provides as follows in order for a physician report to be considered complete on the issue of permanent disability,it must include an apportionment determination.a physician shall make an apportionment determination by finding what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by the direct result of injury arising out of and occurring in the course of employment and what approximate percentage of the permanent disability was caused by other factors both before and subsequent to the industrial injury,including prior industrial injuries.if the physician is unable to include an apportionment determination in his or her report,the physician shall state the specific reasons why the physician could not make a determination of the effect of that prior condition on the permanent disability arising from the injury.the physician shall then consult with other physicians or refer the employee to another physician from whom the employee is authorized to seek treatment or evaluation in accordance with this division in order to make the final determination.
kopping asks,i f the legislature intended section b to create a conclusive presumption requiring deduction of prior awards by operation of law,what would be the purpose of requiring physicians to calculate the percentage of current permanent disability caused by prior industrial injuries one answer to that question is that section b creates a presumption arising from a prior award of permanent disability,not from a prior industrial injury.it is possible that an applicant may have had a prior industrial injury,but never applied for or received an award of permanent disability resulting from that injury.in such a case,in the event of a subsequent industrial injury,the presumption of section b would have no effect,but a physician could still determine,as a matter of fact,that the applicant present level of permanent disability was partially caused by the previous industrial injury.
kopping next contends that his interpretation of section b benefits employers,compared to the prior law,because under his interpretation of the statute the claimant bears the burden of proving medical rehabilitation from the prior disability.kopping cites no authority for the proposition he under prior law it was the employer burden to disprove rehabilitation.in any event,even if we assume that deeming the presumption in section b to be rebuttable would have some benefit for employers,that does not compel us to read the word conclusively out of the statute,as kopping would have us do.we can do that only if we are left with no other reasonable choice,which,as we will explain,we are not.
this brings us to kopping reliance on the rule of liberality.in essence,he suggests that because section b must be liberally construed by the courts with the purpose of extending its benefits for the protection of persons injured in the course of their employment,we should interpret section b as creating a rebuttable presumption,rather than a conclusive one,because the rebuttable presumption is more favorable to claimants.if the apparent conflict in the statute could not be resolved any other way,kopping arg
