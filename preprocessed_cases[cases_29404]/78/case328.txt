labor code section establishes a presumption that an injury is compensable under the workers compensation system if the employer does not deny liability for a worker claim within days after the date the claim form is filed,subd.b.departing from this clear and unambiguous language,the workers compensation appeals board wcab ruled the period is also triggered when the employer knows or should know of an industrial injury or claim and breaches its duty to provide the claim form.
like the court of appeal,we conclude the wcab erred in this regard.the employer knowledge of an injury satisfies the worker duty to provide notice within days of the injury,subd.a and triggers the employer duty to provide a claim form within one working day,subd.a.but absent circumstances creating an equitable estoppel,the period for the employer to deny liability runs only from the date the worker files a claim form with the employer,subd.b.neither the wcab nor this court can alter the clear statutory command.
factual and procedural background 
our summary of the facts and procedure is drawn primarily from the court of appeal opinion,which the parties agree accurately states the case background.
william wagner,a sheet metal specialist for honeywell formerly allied signal aerospace company for over years,claims injuries to his body and psyche due to employment from january,through october.
wagner company medical record contains a july,entry reflecting wagner statements that management was prejudiced against him and hampered his promotion and transfer,that he ca take it anymore,and that his doctor had prescribed him medications for work stress.
on october,wagner wife,linda wagner,left a message with honeywell disability coordinator,nyssa hawkins,that wagner had been admitted to a psychiatric facility with a nervous breakdown and that his work supervisor and others had pushed her husband over the edge with their head games.linda wagner also asked for disability forms.on october,hawkins confirmed receipt of a doctor note verifying disability and told linda wagner disability forms would be sent.the hospitalization records indicate wagner was depressed and suicidal they mention stress and aspects of his family and personal history,as well as identifying work problems as a subject for continued work in aftercare.
on january,in response to wagner january submission of a medical leave request form on which a box was checked that the injury was work related,linda wood,who handled workers compensation for honeywell,wrote wagner that she had received the information from the medical department and was enclosing a claim form and a pamphlet explaining workers compensation.
on january,wagner served a completed claim form on honeywell.honeywell denied the claim by letter of march.
in support of his injury claim,wagner obtained a medical report from his treating psychiatrist,thomas curtis.curtis diagnosed major depression with anxiety and panic attacks that were industrially caused.honeywell obtained a rebuttal medical opinion from psychologist mory framer,who concluded wagner psychiatric condition was caused by nonindustrial factors or by good faith personnel actions 
the matter was first submitted to the workers compensation judge wcj without testimony,for determination whether the injury should be presumed compensable under section.the wcj found that honeywell had sufficient information to require provision of the claim form,at the latest,on october,following the contact with linda wagner.the period under section had therefore ended on january,the wcj found,and the psychiatric injury was presumed compensable unless rebutted by evidence not available by that date.
the wcab granted honeywell petition for reconsideration and issued an en banc decision.it held that section period begins either when the employee files a claim form or when an employer is reasonably certain of an industrial injury or claim and breaches the duty to provide the claim form.the wcab rescinded the wcj decision and remanded the matter for application of the reasonably certain standard,which it stated is satisfied when the employer has been made aware of facts which would lead a reasonable person to conclude with some certainty that an industrial injury has occurred or is being asserted.wagner allied signal aerospace.
on remand,nyssa hawkins,the honeywell disability coordinator,testified she was reasonably certain that linda wagner was reporting a work injury in october.hawkins reported the facts she had learned from linda wagner,but not her own conclusion,to linda wood within a few days.wood said she would take care of the matter.in her own testimony,wood stated that she knew william wagner had been hospitalized in october of and heard either then or earlier from the medical department that he was out on stress,possibly because of work events,but that wagner did not himself report any industrial injury to her.wood did not recall hawkins reporting in october that wagner had received an injury,though she acknowledged that was hawkins normal practice.
the wcj again found that the period under section had expired on january,and honeywell failure to deny liability before that date rendered the psychiatric injury presumptively compensable.a claim form should have been provided no later than october,when hawkins received information that made her reasonably certain of the industrial injury,information she also reported to wood.at this point,honeywell reasonably should have known an emotional injury arising from events at work was being claimed.
the wcab adopted the wcj findings and denied reconsideration.the wcab concluded that the legislative policy of encouraging prompt investigation and processing of claims was facilitated by applying the presumption of compensability where the employer is reasonably certain that an injury has occurred and fails to timely provide a claim form.
the court of appeal granted honeywell petition for writ of review and annulled the wcab decision.the appellate court held the wcab adoption of a reasonable certainty trigger for running of the period was contrary to the statutory language,under which the period runs only from the filing of a claim form.egregious conduct by the employer designed to frustrate the employee pursuit of compensation could estop the employer from denying the period had commenced,but a merely negligent failure to provide the employee a claim form,in the court view,could not start the period running and create a presumption of compensability.the court of appeal remanded for the wcab to determine whether honeywell conduct falls into the egregious category or was merely a negligent omission.
we granted the wcab petition for review.
discussion 
a brief review of the pertinent statutes is in order.
under section,an injured worker can not maintain a claim unless he or she has given the employer written notice of the injury within days of its occurrence but under section,subdivision a,the employer knowledge of the injury,or knowledge that a claim of injury is being asserted,substitutes for the written notice required by section 
when the employer receives either written notice or knowledge of an injury that has caused lost work time or required medical treatment,the employer is to provide the employee,within one working day,with a workers compensation claim form and notice of potential eligibility for benefits,subd.a.the injured employee may then file the claim form with the employer the claim is deemed filed when it is personally delivered to the employer or received by the employer by or certified mail,subd.c.
filing the claim form allows the injured worker to begin receiving certain payments and to request a medical evaluation,and tolls the limitations period of section,subd.d.it also begins a new,period for the employer to investigate and evaluate the claim if the employer does not reject liability within that period,the injury is presumed compensable,a presumption rebuttable only by evidence,subd.b.
under these provisions,the employee bears the initial burden of notifying the employer of an injury,unless such notice is unnecessary because the employer already knows of the injury or claimed injury from other sources.the employer then bears the burden of informing the worker of his or her possible compensation rights and providing a claim form,but it is up to the employee whether and when to initiate a claim for compensation by filing the prescribed form with the employer.only when the form has been filed is the employer or its insurer put to the additional burden of promptly investigating the claim and determining whether to contest liability,an investigation that must be completed within days.
in ruling that the period begins as soon as the employer knows of the injury or claim,the wcab collapsed this process into two,the formal claim process required for running of the period under sections and.the legislature has not provided that an employer must,at the risk of having the injury presumed compensable,begin investigating liability whenever an injury comes to its attention,but rather that the employer must at that point give the employee the information and means by which a claim may be formally made.the legislature specifically prescribed,by an amendment enacted in,the manner of filing a claim form and the date it would be considered filed,subd.c at the same time,it specifically mandated the investigation period would run from the date the claim form is filed under section,subd.b we can not ignore that plain statutory language.
in interpreting the workers compensation statutes,we give great weight to the construction of the wcab,unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.wilkinson workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.ultimately,of course,our fidelity must be to the legislative intent as best shown by the legislatures use of clear and unambiguous statutory language.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.we conclude the wcab construction of the statutes not only contravenes the clear and unambiguous command in section,subdivision b that the period run from the date the claim form is filed under section,but also,as explained below,fails to implement the legislative intent behind the statutes.
the provisions in sections and for filing of a claim form and an ensuing period for investigation by the employer were initially added as part of the greene workers compensation reform act of stats,ch.that law was the result of efforts by representatives of organized labor,management and the insurance industry following several years of negotiation intended to streamline and improve the workers compensation benefit delivery system increase benefit levels for injured workers and reduce costs to employers.of industrial relations,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess.prepared for governor deukmejian,see state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the purpose of the amendment to section was to expedite the entire claims process in workers compensation by limiting the time during which investigation by the employer of a claim by an injured worker could be being penalized for delay.the penalty provided for delay was that a rebuttable presumption of compensability would attach to the claim.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals,supra,at,d.
the wcab was thus correct to say,in its january,decision denying reconsideration,that section reflects a legislative policy of encouraging prompt investigation of claims,but clearly incorrect in assuming that the legislative policy encourages such investigation prior to the filing of a claim form.the requirement of a claim as part of a reform law designed to make the system more manifestly intended to relieve the employer and its insurer from having to investigate and evaluate every possible claim,some of which might never ripen into actual claims for benefits.the policy of prompt investigation was thus tempered by considerations of efficiency and the avoidance of unnecessary costs these too form part of the legislative policy we must,in construing the statutes,seek to effectuate.
the wcab argues that unless an employer breach of its duty to provide a claim form upon learning of an injury,subd.a is deemed to trigger section period,employers will have no incentive to fulfill their obligation to provide the claim form.we disagree.in a case decided before the reform law added a claim procedure,we held that when an employer with knowledge or notice of a injury fails to inform the injured worker of his or her compensation rights,to the worker prejudice,the statute of limitations for seeking benefits is tolled until the worker learns of those rights.kaiser foundation hospitals workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,martin see also reynolds workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.under the current law,both the notice of potential eligibility and the claim form are to be provided to the worker within one working day of the employer learning or receiving notice of the injury,subd.a.moreover,the notice of potential eligibility for benefits and the claim form are to be,as far as practical,contained in a single document,subd.b.the employer who fails to comply with the duty to provide a claim form would thus ordinarily also fail to provide the notice of potential eligibility and would,under martin,suffer tolling of the limitation period.the possibility of such tolling creates a significant incentive to provide the form promptly.certain failures to provide a claim form could,as well,subject the employer to administrative sanctions.see,tit,subd.d penalty of up to for claims administrator failure to provide claim form on employee request.if,as the wcab suggests,additional incentives are needed to ensure the prompt investigation of claims,they must be provided by the legislature.
the wcab cites authority to the effect that ambiguous workers compensation laws should be construed in favor of coverage.see,state farm fire casualty workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.but section,subdivision b is not ambiguous it unequivocally gives the employer days from the date the claim form is filed under section to investigate the claim.nor does a reading of the statute deny wagner coverage for his claim it merely denies him the benefit of a presumption of compensability,leaving him free to prove in the ordinary manner his injury industrial causation.
in light of the plain statutory language and other indicators of legislative intent,we agree with the court of appeal that section period for denial of liability runs only from the date the employee files a claim form,not from the date the employer receives notice or knowledge of the injury or claimed injury.the court of appeal also noted,however,that certain egregious,intentional violations of the duty to provide a claim form can estop the employer from relying on the employee failure to file the form,and remanded for a determination of whether such an estoppel arose here.specifically,the court of appeal held an estoppel would arise only in cases of a deliberate or intentional refusal to provide the required claim form to the employee or false statements made to the employee,all for the purpose of preventing or delaying the completion and filing of a claim form by the employee.a mere negligent failure to provide a timely claim form is not sufficient.
honeywell agrees with the court of appeal that in a proper case,involving an egregious violation,the wcab may assert an estoppel,but the wcab insists its reasonably certain standard is more fair and reasonable than one focusing on the employer intent.it describes the reasonably certain standard as impos ing on the employer a duty to investigate when he or she has been made aware of facts which would lead a reasonable person to conclude with some certainty that an industrial injury has occurred or is being asserted.wagner allied signal aerospace,supra,at.although appellate decisions have addressed estoppel to assert the statute of limitations none has addressed the circumstances under which equitable principles would permit a determination that section period began to run before the employee filed a claim form.support for either position can be found in prior panel decisions of the wcab we briefly address the estoppel issue to provide guidance to the wcab on remand and in future cases.
