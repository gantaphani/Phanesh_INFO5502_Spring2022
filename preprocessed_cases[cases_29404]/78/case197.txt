william killman worked for years for the sahara coal company sahara,eventually rising to the position of foreman.he retired from mining at the end of september,about six months later,he began his quest for black lung disability benefits under the black lung benefits act.after several hearings,appeals to the benefits review board the board,remands,and rehearings,an alj ultimately denied benefits and the board affirmed.killman petitions for review of this decision.because the alj never definitively resolved what the exertional requirements of killman job were,and he never ensured that the physicians on whom he relied had based their opinions on the correct exertional requirements,we grant the petition for review and vacate and remand the board decision.
for fourteen years of his tenure with sahara,killman worked as a mine foreman.along the way,he developed unspecified respiratory problems and apparently suffered a heart attack.on february,more than twenty years ago,killman filed a claim for black lung disability benefits.the department of labor denied the claim,leading to a hearing before an alj in.
in a decision,the alj ruled in killman favor,crediting the testimony of physicians who had concluded that killman was disabled as a result of black lung disease.the alj ordered sahara whose liabilities in this respect later were transferred to the sahara coal trust to pay benefits under the black lung benefits act retroactive to.the alj determined that medical test results alone did not support a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis black lung disease,but correctly noted that notwithstanding negative,a diagnosis may be confirmed by a physician exercising sound medical judgment.the alj credited the testimony of three doctors,each of whom diagnosed killman with black lung disease,and accordingly found that killman had established the existence of pneumoconiosis.the alj further found that killman disability was total,noting that all of the testifying physicians agreed that killman was disabled in that he could not perform the tasks of his last job as foreman with sahara.
sahara and the department of labor appealed the alj decision to the benefits review board,which in partly vacated the order and remanded the case for further consideration on the question whether killman was totally disabled because of pneumoconiosis.the board found fault with the alj reliance on medical testimony that did not consider killman smoking habit or history of heart disease as potential causes of disability.based on these errors,as well as other concerns over the alj use of medical testimony,the board sent the case back to the alj to reconsider the evidence and first determine whether claimant has established a totally disabling respiratory impairment resulting from pneumoconiosis.
on remand,the alj reviewed the medical testimony and concluded that some of the medical tests underlying the earlier result were invalid.relying on the changed factual background,he denied killman claim for benefits.the alj acknowledged that the medical testimony on which he had relied in his earlier order was not well reasoned because there was no indication of how the doctors who found killman disabled could have reached their conclusion without using the faulty tests.this time around,the alj credited the testimony of two doctors who opined that killman suffered from at most a mild respiratory impairment that would not prevent him from carrying out his tasks as foreman.killman appealed this decision,and in the board affirmed.the board found that the alj properly considered all relevant evidence of record and properly relied on the medical testimony indicating that killman ailment was not totally disabling.
in,killman filed a new claim for benefits.a different alj handled this filing and characterized it as duplicative.this meant that,in order to be awarded benefits,killman would have to show that there had been a material change in his condition.see sahara coal owcp,of labor,cir.because the earlier decision had established that killman was suffering from pneumoconiosis,this alj determined that killman would have to establish a material change in condition with respect to disability.practically speaking,killman had the burden of showing that he had become totally disabled in the time since his original claim was denied in order to qualify for black lung benefits.
under the relevant regulations,a claimant can show total disability if a physician exercising reasoned medical judgment concludes that the claimant respiratory or pulmonary condition prevents or prevented the miner from engaging in employment as described in paragraph b of this section.c.the regulation specifies that a miner is totally disabled if his respiratory or pulmonary condition is in itself enough to prevent him from performing his or her usual coal mine work.c.the alj decision therefore turned on medical opinions on the question whether killman respiratory problems prevented him from working in the job of mine foreman that he had held.
the testimony of four doctors was particularly important to the case.these doctors based their opinions on medical tests and examinations done both before and after the previous hearings.while many doctors provided testimony and reports over the history of this case,the alj relied principally on the testimony of tuteur,dahhan,renn,and cohen.each of these doctors examined killman at various times during the adjudication of his claim for benefits.moreover,these doctors shared consultative reports with each other and reviewed each others conclusions.in the end,tuteur,dahhan,and renn concluded that killman was not totally disabled only cohen determined that he was.
tuteur,dahhan,and renn each diagnosed killman with a mild obstructive defect attributable to smoking rather than pneumoconiosis.cohen,in contrast,found that killman was totally disabled,and attributed this primarily to coal dust exposure.cohen thought that killman smoking habit was at best a contributory factor.the alj was impressed by tuteur,dahhan,and renn,describing their opinions as well reasoned,well documented,supported by the evidence,and entitled to substantial weight.in contrast,the alj conceded that cohen has some expertise in this area,but he declined to credit cohen opinion in the face of the assessment of the other three and the fact that none of the medical tests produced results that clearly qualified killman as disabled under b i,ii.the alj concluded,after weighing all of the new medical evidence and placing greater weight on the three opinions by tuteur,dahhan,and renn,i find that the evidence does not establish a material change in condition.accordingly,the alj denied killman claim for black lung benefits.
killman again appealed the denial to the board,which vacated the order after finding that the alj did not address the contention below that renn,dahhan,and tuteur did not understand the exertional requirements of the job that all three agreed he would be able to perform.the board found that killman duties as foreman included inspecting eight different mine faces,which required him to walk feet in minutes while bent over in low coal and carrying approximately thirty pounds of equipment.in addition,the board noted that killman was responsible for assisting with a variety of tasks around the mine site,such as lifting oil barrels and changing tires.the board was troubled by the failure of tuteur,dahhan,and renn to demonstrate an awareness of these duties.according to the board,these physicians either did not discuss killman duties or were under the impression that those duties were light.the board also noted that the alj did not make a finding about the range of killman duties as a foreman.the board held that the alj should not have assessed the physicians reasoning based solely on the nature of the claimant objective tests,citing poole freeman united coal mining,cir.the board remanded the case to the alj to consider the evidence regarding the exertional requirements of claimant usual coal mine work as a foreman,to make a finding as to the nature of that work,and then to reweigh the new medical opinion evidence to determine whe
