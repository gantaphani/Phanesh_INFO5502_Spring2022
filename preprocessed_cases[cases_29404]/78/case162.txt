timothy moon filed suit under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico,as well as state tort law,alleging that his employer colluded with an insurance provider,an insurance adjuster,and a physician,to deny him workers compensation benefits.the district court dismissed moon suit for failure to state a claim under federal rule of civil procedure b,or,in the alternative,because the suit was under the act,b.because moon failed sufficiently to allege a pattern of racketeering activity for purposes of rico,we affirm the district court judgment with respect to moon rico claim.however,because deciding moon claim was unnecessary,we reverse the district court exercise of pendent jurisdiction,and remand with instructions to dismiss those claims without prejudice.
background 
according to his first amended complaint the complaint,timothy moon was an employee of harrison piping supply harrison,who was injured at work on october.although he initially received workers compensation benefits,moon alleges that harrison colluded with the michigan tooling association workers compensation fund the fund,the michigan tooling association service company the service company,and asit ray to terminate those benefits.moon named as defendants harrison,his employer the fund,which is harrison insurer the service company,which was the fund adjuster and ray,an independent physician.
moon alleges that the defendants collectively formed an enterprise for purposes of rico and engaged in a pattern of racketeering in the form of mail fraud and.specifically,moon claims that the fund sent him a notice of dispute the notice via united states mail on july,which stated that moon was capable of fully resuming his job responsibilities even though defendants knew that examining doctors had determined that moon was still disabled.the notice terminated moon benefits.
after receiving the notice,moon brought a workers compensation claim before the michigan workers disability compensation bureau the bureau.according to moon,the defendants reinstated his benefits on the eve of his hearing before the bureau.on the same day,march,the fund and the service company sent notice to moon that he was to be examined by ray.according to moon,the other defendants gave ray express or tacit instructions to issue a report,a medical report that could form the basis for terminating moon benefits.ray,who moon claims has a reputation for rendering medical opinions supporting rejection of claimants benefits,examined moon on april,and issued an allegedly fraudulent report opining that moon was no longer disabled.the report was mailed to various persons and entities,including the bureau.finally,on april,the fund mailed a second notice of dispute the second notice,which,according to moon,falsely claimed that he was no longer disabled 
moon filed a rico claim in district court,as well as a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress iied under michigan common law.the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for,inter alia,failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted under rule b.the district court granted the defendants motion in an amended opinion and order,dismissing with prejudice moon rico and iied claims.this timely appeal followed.

iii.discussion 
moon rico claims 
moon asserts a claim under rico,a federal statute that affords a civil remedy to an individual who is injured by virtue of certain types of unlawful activity.rico provides in relevant part 
it shall be unlawful for any person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,or the activities of which affect,interstate or foreign commerce,to conduct or participate,directly or indirectly,in the conduct of such enterprise affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.
c.thus,to state a rico claim,moon must plead the following elements conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.sedima,imrex,d.because we conclude that the complaint lacks facts establishing a pattern of racketeering activity,and thus fails to state a rico claim,we do not address any of the other rico elements.
moon has failed to allege adequately a pattern of racketeering activity 
a predicate acts 
to establish a rico violation under c,a plaintiff must allege that the rico enterprise engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of at least two predicate acts of racketeering activity occurring within a period.the alleged predicate acts may consist of offenses which are indictable under any of a number of federal statutes,including the mail and wire fraud statutes.
here,the district court concluded that moon pleaded five predicate acts of racketeering activity with the requisite particularity.see bender southland,consistent with rule b,rico plaintiffs must allege the time,place and contents of the misrepresentations.these alleged acts include the fund july,mailing to moon of the notice terminating his benefits on the fraudulent grounds that moon was capable of resuming his job responsibilities the fund march,mailing of a notice of examination to be performed by ray,which examination was part of defendants scheme to fraudulently deprive moon of his benefits ray mailing,between april,and april,of his medical report,which fraudulently opined that moon was no longer disabled defendants agent attorney felker april,mailing of ray fraudulent medical report to moon counsel and the fund april,mailing to moon of the second notice terminating moon benefits,which again fraudulently stated that moon was not disabled.
the district court correctly concluded that moon adequately pleaded a minimum of two predicate acts although necessary to sustain a rico claim,the pleading of two predicate acts may not be sufficient because assumes that there is something to a rico pattern beyond the number of predicate acts involved,northwestern bell tele,d.in,the supreme court held that the term pattern itself requires the showing of a relationship between the predicates and of the threat of continuing activity.it is this factor of continuity plus relationship which combines to produce a pattern.id.at.internal citations omitted.continuity and relationship constitute two analytically distinct prongs of the pattern requirement.vild visconsi,cir,cert.denied,d.
b relatedness 
moon has satisfied the relatedness requirement because he has alleged predicate acts that have the same or similar purposes,results,participants,victims,or methods of commission,or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics and are not isolated events,at.the predicate acts pleaded in the complaint had the same purpose of depriving moon of his benefits,the same result in that moon periodically lost his benefits,the same participants in harrison and the fund,the same victim in moon,and the same method of commission in mail fraud.
c continuity 
in addition to relatedness,the predicate acts pleaded must have sufficient continuity.continuity is both a closed and concept,referring either to a closed period of repeated conduct,or to past conduct that by its nature projects into the future with a threat of repetition.id.at.whether a pattern of racketeering activity satisfies the continuity requirement depends on the particular facts of each case.id.at.continuity may be established at the pleading stage by alleging facts of either closed or racketeering activity.
a closed period of continuity may be demonstrated by proving a series of related predicates extending over a substantial period of time.id.at.here,the predicate acts set forth in the complaint cover a period from july to april.although there are no rigid rules regarding what amounts to a substantial period of time,racketeering activity lasting only a few weeks or months and threatening no future criminal conduct is insufficient.id.at.see also vemco,camardella,cir,cert.denied,d predicate acts over months did not satisfy the closed period analysis vild,at predicate acts over six or seven months not sufficient under analysis.
moon argues that the district court erred by failing to consider the allegations in his second amended complaint when it concluded that he failed to allege a closed period of racketeering activity.the second amended complaint is virtually identical to the complaint,the first amended complaint except that the former pleads that moon benefits were first unlawfully terminated in september and that this constituted the first predicate act in the defendants racketeering scheme.had the district court taken into account the additional facts pleaded in his second amended complaint,contends moon,the pattern of racketeering would have extended for years,rather than nine months,and therefore would have satisfied the closed period requirement.
moon is mistaken.the second amended complaint was not properly before the district court,nor is it before this court.the magistrate judge granted moon motion to file a second amended complaint subject to the district judge denying the motions to dismiss,which the district judge did not do.moon did not appeal the order of the magistrate judge to the district judge.even though moon notice of appeal to this court includes the magistrate judge order,this court lacks jurisdiction to review that order where the magistrate judge did not have plenary jurisdiction over moon case the district judge merely referred to the magistrate judge moon motion for leave to file his second amended complaint and moon failed to seek review before the district judge first see mcqueen beecher cmty,cir declining to entertain appeal of magistrate judge order denying a motion for a default judgment where the magistrate did not exercise plenary jurisdiction and the appellant did not appeal to the district judge.
in any event,even if the racketeering activity lasted for years,as moon insists,facts establishing a closed period of continuity are still lacking.moon has pleaded that the defendants embarked upon a coordinated scheme to wrongfully terminate his workers compensation benefits.all of the predicate mailing of the notice and second notice cutting off his benefits and the mailing of ray fraudulent medical keyed to defendants single objective of depriving moon of his benefits.no other schemes,purposes,or injuries are alleged,and there are no facts suggesting that the scheme would continue beyond the defendants accomplishing their goal of terminating moon benefits.in circumstances such as these,the purported racketeering activity does not bear the markings of the criminal conduct about which congress was concerned when it enacted rico,at.
this court prior decisions compel the conclusion that moon has not pleaded a period of continuity.for instance,in vemco,the parties entered into a contract under which the defendant agreed to build a paint finishing system in the new facility of the plaintiff manufacturer.id.at.displeased with the defendant repeated demands for payment beyond that specified in the contract and defendant performance under the contract,the plaintiff brought suit alleging predicate acts of fraud and extortion under rico.id.at.this court held that a single scheme emanating from a dispute over an ordinary construction contract did not possess the requisite rico continuity 
vemco has alleged a single fraudulent scheme by flakt to misrepresent a guaranteed price in a building contract,and later to extort a higher price from vemco.the total scheme,from the time of contract negotiations until the last threat alleged,lasted only seventeen months.the goal of the single criminal episode,as the district court accurately characterized it,was to get vemco to pay the cost of one paint system.there are no facts pleaded suggesting anything but that once flakt received the money it was requesting in the billing statements,its scheme would be over,and it would end its association with vemco.
similarly,in thompson paasche,cir,the plaintiff landowners asserted rico claims against the defendant seller on the grounds that the seller fraudulently represented that the purpose of his reservation of oil and gas rights as part of the terms of the sales was to ensure that the land remained unspoiled.id.at.in fact,claimed the plaintiffs,the seller had arranged to lease the oil and gas rights to a third party who would undertake drilling.id.at.this court reversed the rico verdict for the plaintiffs,concluding that the alleged rico scheme ended once the defendant had sold all of his lots to the plaintiffs,and therefore it was insufficiently protracted to qualify as a rico violation.id.at see also efron embassy suites puerto rico,cir,cert.denied,d where the plaintiff alleged a pattern of racketeering acts focused on coercing him into relinquishing his ownership interest in a real estate development project,the court characterized the alleged racketeering activities as finite in nature and occurring over a relatively modest period of time,thus foreclosing a finding of continuity edmondson gallagher alban towers tenants,we think that the combination of these factors single scheme,single injury,and few victims makes it virtually impossible for plaintiffs to state a rico claim.
as in the foregoing cases,moon allegations center around a single rico scheme with a single object stemming from a dispute about whether moon is impaired by a workplace disability entitling him to benefits.even assuming a period of years of racketeering activity,these allegations do not give rise to continuity.
moon allegations also do not give rise to a finding of continuity.this inquiry turns on whether the plaintiff has pleaded facts suggesting the threat of continued racketeering activities projecting into the future.in,the supreme court held that continuity could be pleaded through facts showing a distinct threat of racketeering activity,or by showing that the predicate acts or offenses are part of an ongoing entity regular way of doing business,at.
here,moon argues that continuity exists because there is nothing to stop the defendants from persisting in their cycle of fraudulently terminating his benefits,restoring them,and then fraudulently terminating them again.the district court was not persuaded,finding that there is no risk of ongoing racketeering activity where moon petitioned the bureau for a resolution of his dispute with defendants.we agree.a final decision of the bureau once all appellate options have been exhausted is binding on the parties and,if favorable to moon,would prevent the defendants from withdrawing benefits in the absence of further action by the bureau.see.comp.laws serv.in other words,the defendants could no longer suspend moon benefits through issuing notices of dispute,but would instead have to file a petition with the bureau to stop their payments to moon and prove that he is no longer entitled to them.admin.code.
we do not hold that a rico action for fraudulent termination of workers compensation benefits could never occur alongside a state administrative proceeding before the bureau,but merely that under the continuity inquiry,moon has not alleged facts sufficient to establish a pattern of racketeering activity 
finally,moon has not pleaded any allegations to the effect that the fraudulent termination of workers compensation benefits is defendants regular way of doing business,at.see also vild,at plaintiff who asserted rico violatio
