fred hatfield filed for benefits under the black lung benefits act,act.his last employer,arch of kentucky,arch,raised several challenges to his claim.adjudicators for the department of labor office of workers compensation programs owcp granted his claim and the department benefits review board brb affirmed on appeal.
arch petitions this court to reverse.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
hatfield worked as a coal miner for twenty years,ending in.he filed a claim for benefits under the act in and identified arch as his last employer for which he worked at least one year claim.arch,a company,owns and operates coal mines in a number of states,including kentucky.under the act,arch is the responsible operator and is liable for any benefits awarded.
in connection with the claim,twelve physicians submitted reports.five of the reports indicated the presence of pneumoconiosis,while the remaining seven did not.giving greater weight to the more recent reports,both of which were positive,administrative law judge alj kichuk found that hatfield had pneumoconiosis.the alj also found that hatfield was totally disabled.as to whether the disability was due to the pneumoconiosis,the alj relied primarily upon the medical opinion of bruce broudy,whose qualifications were described as superior including board certification in internal and pulmonary medicine and who had most recently examined hatfield.in broudy opinion,hatfield disability arose from the claimant chronic bronchitis caused by his long history of smoking.although one physician,john myers,had opined that hatfield disability resulted from his pneumoconiosis there was no indication that the physician was board certified and the physician examination occurred eight months before broudy.thus,based on broudy better qualifications and his more recent examination,the alj concluded that hatfield was not totally disabled by pneumoconiosis and denied his claim.hatfield did not appeal the ruling.
the initial finding 
hatfield filed a subsequent claim for benefits in june claim.a claims examiner with the owcp notified arch of the claim in july.arch counsel responded in august,indicating that the company was the responsible operator.
on december,a claims examiner informed arch that the office had made a preliminary finding that hatfield was entitled to benefits on the claim.the examiner further explained that if arch wished to contest the finding,it must file a controversion a merits challenge within thirty days.if the company failed to respond within thirty days,the company would be deemed to have accepted the initial finding,and this failure shall be considered a waiver of the company right to contest this claim unless good cause is shown to excuse such failure cfr.ja.the company received the examiner notice by certified mail on december.
through its,arch submitted its controversion on february.the company did not contest the timeliness of hatfield claim,but did contest whether a he had pneumoconiosis b he was totally disabled c any disability was caused by the condition and d the miner death was due to the condition note hatfield was not deceased.
the owcp director informed the company that the office had not received a timely response to its earlier notice of initial finding.the director treated the lack of a timely response as a default,explaining,arch of kentucky,is deemed to have accepted the initial finding of the district director and shall not,except as provided in,be permitted to raise issues or present evidence with respect to issues inconsistent with the initial finding in any further proceeding conducted with respect to the claim.ja.
arch counsel replied on march.he acknowledged that the company had not filed its controversion within the allotted time period.he sought to establish good cause for the delay,however,explaining in full,
d ue to some person n el changeovers in the last two months or so in this office,a very few things got miscal e ndared or not cal e ndared at all.this was one.the person n el problem was resolved nevertheless,a problem in this case remains.there is no doubt that it is my responsibility that the controversion was late,but in fairness,a clerical error under these circumstances should not be interposed to prevent arch from defending this claim.
ja.the director denied the request to accept the untimely controversion,but informed the company that it could appeal the adverse finding,which the company did.
subsequent appeals and remands 
hatfield claim then went through numerous rounds of appeals and remands spanning over a decade.only those rulings with direct bearing on the instant petition for review are summarized below.
alj rippey awarded benefits to hatfield based on the director initial award,finding that arch controversion was untimely.the brb affirmed.
arch requested a modification of the award pursuant to,as incorporated at a and.modification permits the to reconsider prior decisions,whether based on previously developed or newly developed evidence.arch argued that the award was based on erroneous findings of fact.
the brb determined that the modification procedure did not provide arch with an alternate avenue for attacking the merits of the award.it explained that if a party fails to contest timely an initial finding,the party can not raise an issue or present evidence inconsistent with that finding in a subsequent proceeding unless it first demonstrated good cause for the untimely response.the brb remanded the matter for further consideration of the issue.
on remand,alj wood found that arch had failed to show good cause for its tardy controversion.the alj acknowledged that hatfield had likely not suffered any prejudice by the delay.she noted that arch counsel original explanation was,in essence,that the notice of initial award got.the alj,however,placed considerable emphasis on the failure by arch counsel to provide any additional detail of that original explanation or any evidence to support it.the company also argued that the initial award had not been sent by registered or certified mail,but the alj found that assertion to be plainly rebutted by the copy of the receipt in the record.
on appeal,the brb affirmed.arch then raised a new argument before the brb whether hatfield claim was itself untimely under the statute of limitations applicable to any claim filed after a miner is given a positive diagnosis of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.the director argued before the brb that arch could not raise the timeliness of hatfield claim at this late stage.the brb reasoned,however,that under its of the statute of limitations in,the limitations period did not apply to subsequent claims,only to initial claims.there being no question that hatfield timely filed his initial claim,it would have been futile for arch to have raised the timeliness issue in.since then,however,several federal courts including this one have applied the statute of limitations to subsequent claims.see.consol.coal kirk,cir.the brb remanded the issue for further proceedings.
on remand,alj phalen found that the claim was timely.the alj held that any positive diagnosis filed in support of the claim was to be deemed a misdiagnosis because that claim was ultimately denied.alternatively,the alj found that a positive diagnosis had not been communicated to hatfield prior to his filing the claim.on appeal,the brb rejected the former holding of alj phalen,but adopted the latter.it affirmed the award of benefits to hatfield.
arch petitioned this court for review of the brb rulings.

arch default 
to begin,it is undisputed that arch prior counsel failed to submit a timely controversion to hatfield claim.the regulation in force at the time,b,required that any failure to contest an initial finding of entitlement to benefits within thirty days be deemed an acceptance of that finding without further recourse to raise issues or present evidence inconsistent with that finding,absent a showing of good cause.arch submitted its controversion days after the initial finding and did not attempt to show good cause until almost a month after submitting its controversion.
on petition before this court,arch first takes a wide swing at the rule.the company maintains that the rule violates both federal due process and the administrative procedure act apa.in essence,arch argues that there is nothing fair about precluding it from obtaining a full hearing on the merits of the claim.this argument suffers from a couple of defects.the company due argument consists of five sentences.it cites only one case in support,and does so for the unremarkable proposition that procedural due process is applicable to the adjudicative administrative proceeding.richardson perales,d.an argument calling into question the very constitutionality of an agency regulation requires more development than what arch provides here.see indeck energy servs.consumers energy,cir holding that issues only adverted to in a perfunctory manner,unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation are waived.
more fundamentally,the rule,akin to the rule in federal court,does not itself violate federal due process or the apa.the basic elements of procedural due process are notice and opportunity to be heard.see mullane cent.hanover bank trust.congress incorporated these principles into the apa.see.the regulation at issue here provided both notice of the initial finding and the opportunity to be heard,as well as an opportunity to file an untimely controversion if the employer could establish good cause for the delay.see b.d ue process generally does not entitle parties to an evidentiary hearing where the federal agency has properly determined that a default summary judgment is appropriate due to a party failure to file a timely response.father sons lumber.supplies,nlrb,cir citing nlrb aaron convalescent home,cir.arch broad attack on the rule fails.
as to the question of good cause,the alj started off by acknowledging that hatfield had not been prejudiced by the delay.however,while explaining that personnel problems could justify a late filing under certain circumstances,the alj correctly noted that counsel failed to offer any details of what exactly happened to cause the attorney to miss the deadline.to this day,arch has offered little to support its are no affidavits or other evidence in the record that would provide some detail to the attorney vague assertion of a personnel problem.the lack of record evidence distinguishes this case from the decision relied upon by arch,george harms construction,chao,cir,where the court held that a party had established excusable neglect through,among other things,testimony about the party procedures.here,without any evidence explaining why or how the purported personnel problems caused the missed deadline or any evidence of counsel diligence once the problem was identified,it can not be said that the alj abused her discretion in denying arch request to file an untimely controversion.
arch continues to contend,as it did during the administrative proceedings,that the director did not properly serve the company with the december,initial findings.this argument is contradicted by the record evidence,which includes a copy of the return receipt of certified mail.arch has not explained how this receipt is erroneous or offered any evidence contradicting the clear inference to be drawn from the receipt.
arch next argues that because the examiner did not set forth an explicit finding of a material change in condition from the earlier claim,the initial finding of liability on the subsequent claim is legally insufficient.under,a subsequent claim for benefits under the act must show a material change in conditions since the prior claim denial.grundy mining flynn,cir internal quotation marks omitted.because there was no finding to controvert,its tardiness should have no effect on whether it can challenge the award based on the lack of that finding,according to arch.
the initial finding did not include a section detailing the examiner analysis of each element for liability.instead,the correspondence simply explained,we have made an initial finding based upon the submitted evidence that the claimant is entitled to benefits.yet,the initial finding did clearly put arch on notice that if the company failed to respond within thirty days,then the company silence would be deemed an acceptance of the initial entitlement to benefits beginning in would waive its right to contest this claim.importantly,the waiver was not limited to the right to contest specific findings,but rather to contest the entire claim.thus,whether the examiner made detailed findings on all of the elements of a subsequent claim are beside the point when considering what exactly arch gave up by failing to controvert within the specified time period.
finally,arch maintains that its request for modification should have permitted it to attack the merits of hatfield claim regardless of the timeliness of its controversion.this argument is,as there would be little use in having a default provision in the first place if everything could be reopened by a subsequent request for modification.section b makes clear that the default provision does not just fade away upon a modification party is prohibited from contesting the initial award in any further proceedings conducted with respect to the claim.emphasis added.a request to modify the award of a claim is clearly a further proceeding conducted with respect to that claim and is,therefore,precluded under the default rule.
accordingly,we reject both arch challenge to the brb ruling that the company defaulted the claim and its argument that a request for modification required the adjudicator to address the merits of its controversion,irrespective of the default.
c.the timeliness of hatfield subsequent claim 
next,arch challenges the brb ruling that hatfield timely submitted his claim there is a rebuttable presumption that any claim made for benefits is timely.c.title f provides,any claim for benefits by a miner under this section shall be filed within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis the implementing regulations similarly provide,a claim for benefits filed under this part by,or on behalf of,a miner shall be filed within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis which has been communicated to the miner or a person responsible for the care of the miner a.the employer has the burden to show that the miner claim was outside the statute of limitations period.id.the limitations period applies to both initial and subsequent claims.kirk,at applying statute of limitations to subsequent claim of a miner.
myers diagnosed hatfield with pneumoconiosis from mining in january.if myers positive diagnosis was sufficient to start the limitations period and if that period did not get reset by the denial of hatfield claim,then the subsequent claim was untimely.
the parties disagree on when the statute of limitations generally begins to run.there are at least two possible starting points.one point would be when a diagnosis is first made by a medical professional and that diagnosis is communicated to the claimant or his caregiver,regardless of whether the diagnosis turns out to be a valid one or a misdiagnosis.another point would be when a diagnosis is first made by a medical professional and it is effectively communicated,but only if that diagnosis turns out to be a valid one.if,for example,an alj found that a positive diagnosis by one physician was mistaken or otherwise outweighed by one or more negative diagnoses of other physicians and on that basis denied the claim,the positive diagnosis would be considered a misdiagnosis and would not start the clock for the limita
