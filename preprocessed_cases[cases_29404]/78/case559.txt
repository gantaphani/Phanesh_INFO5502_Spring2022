the doctrine of workers compensation exclusivity is a frequent subject of judicial tweaking.like the law of search and seizure,the variety of fact patterns seems neverending,and each variation presents yet another opportunity for judicial review.this time we examine whether a claimant may sue her employer insurance carrier in superior court for what amounts to the insurer purported mishandling of its lien on the claimant settlement with a third party tortfeasor.we conclude she may not and accordingly affirm the judgment of dismissal.
background 
as this appeal comes to us from a judgment of dismissal following the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend,we accept the material allegations of the complaint as true.aubry hospital dist.cal th,d.the third amended complaint of appellant michelle hughes reveals the following hughes was an employee of southern auto supply.respondent argonaut insurance company argonaut provided workers compensation insurance to the employer.on december,while on the job,hughes was in an automobile accident with a third party.argonaut paid hughes workers compensation benefits in the amount of.
thereafter,hughes pursued a personal injury claim against the third party she did not sue.the parties settled for the sum of.
argonaut asserted a lien against the settlement the settlement check was endorsed to hughes,argonaut and hughes attorney.hughes tendered to argonaut,representing the full value of the insurer workers compensation lien reduced by withheld for attorney fees.
argonaut refused the tender,insisting on its right to collect the lien in full.hughes offered to place the disputed difference in escrow,pending resolution of the matter.argonaut refused.
argonaut refusal to negotiate the check led to litigation,with hughes asserting causes of action for insurance bad faith,intentional interference with contractual relations,interference with prospective economic advantage,wrongful assertion of lien and declaratory and injunctive relief.in her representative capacity hughes also challenged argonaut practices on behalf of the general public,asserting violations of california unfair competition law ucl.bus,et.
after initiation of the lawsuit,argonaut agreed to distribute the settlement funds,while holding the disputed in a trust account.
the trial court sustained argonaut demurrer without leave to amend,ruling that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over hughes complaint,and that such jurisdiction resided exclusively with the workers compensation appeals board wcab.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
this case presents the central question which tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute over allocation of attorney fees incurred in reaching settlement with a third wcab or the superior court hughes has staged a lineup of arguments against wcab jurisdiction not one can overcome the hurdles of sections and of the labor code 
statutory framework 
article xiv,section of the california constitution vests the legislature with plenary power to create,and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,by appropriate legislation pursuant to this authority,the legislature promulgated a complete statutory scheme governing compensation to employees for injuries sustained in the course and scope of their employment.et,or workers compensation act wca.
an employer liability for compensation under the wca is in lieu of any other liability whatsoever to any person and exists for any injury sustained by his or her employees arising out of and in the course of the employment in those cases where the conditions of compensation concur,subd.a.when the conditions of compensation concur,the right to recover such compensation is the sole and exclusive remedy of the employee against the employer,subd.a.the veil of protection cloaking employers by virtue of this exclusivity policy extends to workers compensation insurance carriers as well,subd.b.
although the employee is limited to workers compensation benefits from his or her employer,when the injury is caused by a stranger to the employment relationship the employee may also recover personal injury damages from the third party.summers newman cal th,d.however,to foreclose a double recovery while also enabling the employer to shift its financial burden for compensation benefits to the responsible third party,the wca affords employers subrogation rights against third party tortfeasors.quinn state of california cal d,see service,workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.thus,an employer has a right of reimbursement for workers compensation benefits it has paid or become obligated to pay when its employee recoups damages from a third party tortfeasor by way of judgment or settlement.additionally,the employer may redeem its outlay for benefits by suing the tortfeasor directly,or by joining an action brought by the employee.
in turn,upon payment of benefits for injuries caused by a third party,the workers compensation insurer can also recoup its expenditures by suing the third party intervening in the employee suit or asserting a lien on any recovery the employee obtains from the third party,subd.b,subd.b new plumbing contractors,nationwide mutual ins.th,d.
the availability of statutory subrogation rights spawns rival claims to the common fund of damages secured from the third party.now the interests of employers,insurers and attorneys whose efforts aid judgment or settlement compete against the interest of the injured employee in maximizing his or her recovery.section and its companion,section,set forth the priorities for distributing funds obtained through settlement with the third party tortfeasor or by way of judgment when settlement is effected,with or without suit,proceeds from the recovery are to be used first to pay costs of settlement,including reasonable attorney fees second,to refund the employer reimbursable compensation costs and finally any balance to the employee.summers newman,supra,cal th at,d.
where,as is alleged here,settlement is prompted solely through the labors of the employee attorney,then the settlement costs including reasonable attorney fees,are deducted from the amount of settlement prior to reimbursing the employer,subd.c.because the employer is a passive beneficiary in this situation,its reimbursement rights are subject to reasonable fees and expenses for the services that created the common fund.quinn state of california,supra,cal d at,gapusan jay,supra,th at,d.
the statutory priority scheme also addresses who determines the amount of expenses and attorney fees.these amounts shall,on settlement of suit,or on any settlement requiring court approval,be set by the court.in all other cases these amounts shall be set by the appeals board,subd.f,italics added.
our supreme court has explained how the fee setting process works under the analogous situation detailed in section when an action against a third party tortfeasor is prosecuted successfully to judgment by the employee attorney alone.under such circumstances the employer must bear its fair share of attorney fees.quinn state of california,supra,cal d at.the court job is to first calculate a reasonable fee,and then having fixed that fee,to make a reasonable apportionment of it between the parties benefitted by the recovery.id.at,fn.omitted.
against this background,we treat hughes contentions on appeal.
section accords the wcab exclusive jurisdiction over hughes claim 
the core activity upon which all causes of action hinge is argonaut purportedly wrongful assertion of the full value of its lien,in derogation of the section duty to apportion attorney fees.that statute situates jurisdiction to determine the reasonable amount of attorney fees to be deducted from hughes settlement with the wcab.where settlement occurs after suit is filed,or if the settlement requires court approval,the court sets the amount of litigation expenses and attorney fees.otherwise,the wcab will make these decisions,subd.f summers newman,supra,cal th at,d.hughes did not sue the third party,nor does the complaint suggest that the settlement required court approval.therefore,the wcab,not the superior court,decides the amount and allocation of fees to be paid to hughes attorney.
yet,hughes asserts that her dispute with argonaut was about shady lien practices,not compensation,and since there was no ongoing worker compensation claim,the conditions essential to liability for compensation benefits enumerated in section did not exist.therefore,she concludes there was nothing to which wcab jurisdiction can attach.
this attempt to transform the conditions essential to liability for compensation into conditions essential to wcab jurisdiction proceeds from credulity,not authority.section has nothing to do with wcab jurisdiction.it does not even mention the term jurisdiction,let alone the wcab or any other tribunal.instead,the jurisdictional parameters of the wcab are laid out in section,which mandates that certain enumerated proceedings shall be instituted before the appeals board and not elsewhere these include proceedings f or the recovery of compensation,or concerning any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto,subd.a,italics added.
the terms of section,subdivision f belie hughes proposition that the conditions of jurisdiction do not exist.vesting the wcab with exclusive authority to set and allocate fees in all cases resulting in settlement on a nonlitigated claim except where the settlement requires court approval,this statute applies on all fours to the case at hand.the only conditions essential to exercise of the wcab section jurisdiction is the settlement of a nonlitigated claim against a third party that includes the employee claim,as well as the employer or carrier subrogated claim against the tortfeasor.all conditions are present here.committing jurisdiction to the wcab in such circumstances makes common and consummate sense and advances the public policy to repose in the wcab as much as possible resolution of problems and alleged claims arising out of worker compensation matters.fremont indemnity superior court d.why enmesh the civil courts in determining reasonable attorney fees for the mutual benefit conferred on employer and employee when they have had no connection to or involvement with the settled claim 
section does not conflict with section 
hughes further contends that construing section to confer jurisdiction on the wcab to set and allocate attorney fees runs afoul of section.that statute makes it a misdemeanor for an employer to exact or receive from any employee any contribution,or make or take any deduction from the earnings of any employee,either directly or indirectly,to cover the whole or any part of the cost of compensation,subd.a.as near as we can discern,hughes reasons as follows she entered into a standard contingent fee agreement with her attorney.if the wcab decides that the reasonable fee to be deducted from argonaut share of the settlement is less than one third,then she will end up absorbing part of the cost of her workers compensation benefits.
hughes labors under the misguided assumption that she can determine the issue of a reasonable attorney fee and argonaut share thereof.section,subdivision f assigns that task to the wcab or the court as the case may be,not the employee.hughes private agreement with her attorney can not and does not abrogate the wcab authority in this case to calculate reasonable attorney fees and charge argonaut with its fair share.
we are mindful that the cost of recovering a judgment or settlement may accurately be characterized as part of the cost of compensation.summers newman,supra,cal th at,d.however,what section forbids is shifting the employer fair share of attorney fees to the employee.where instead employer and employee equitably share such expenses according to the benefit derived by each,there is no conflict between the two provisions.see id.at,d,where employee and employer have separate attorneys whose efforts jointly contributed to a settlement,the employer fair share of attorney fees is deducted from its reimbursable compensation costs.
argonaut is not estopped from asserting the wcab jurisdiction 
hughes also maintains that argonaut is estopped from asserting the wcab jurisdiction.she points to the fact that argonaut filed a civil action against the third party tortfeasor after the third party issued its settlement check payable to hughes,her attorney and argonaut,notwithstanding that the check was purportedly sufficient to pay all potential claimants she accuses argonaut of knowingly and voluntarily availing itself of the civil justice system when it knew the settlement would cover its lien,even though argonaut could have filed an application for adjudication of claim with the wcab if it really believed that the wab had exclusive jurisdiction over the apportionment issue.from this hughes concludes that argonaut waived,or is estopped to urge,objection to the jurisdiction which it invited the superior court to exercise.
hughes reasoning is illogical.first,argonaut sued the third party for damages.the wcab has no jurisdiction over such a claim,any more than it would over a third party claim prosecuted by the employee.on the other hand,jurisdiction over the present dispute concerning apportionment of attorney fees does repose in the wcab.
second,an insurer may sue the third party directly and also apply for reimbursement from the employee recovery against the third party.pac.emp.ins.hartford.ins.d.satisfaction of the insurer lien from the employee judgment or settlement would simply diminish the insurer claim against the third party.id.at.
third and more fundamentally,what we are talking about here is subject matter jurisdiction.the only point of jurisdictional concurrency between the wcab and civil courts is jurisdiction to determine jurisdiction.once determined,jurisdiction is exclusive,not concurrent,and civil courts have no power to grant relief in matters concerning the workers compensation remedy.see scott industrial acc.com.cal d.finally,subject matter jurisdiction can not be conferred by waiver,consent or estoppel upon a tribunal otherwise lacking such jurisdiction.summers superior court cal d.
section vests exclusive jurisdiction in the wcab over this dispute 
irrespective of section,the wcab is the exclusive forum for resolving employee claims arising out of or incidental to payment of workers compensation benefits.the wca sets out an elaborate and complete scheme for adjudicating claims of employees against employers and their insurers.its underlying purpose is to facilitate a quick,simple and accessible process for claiming and receiving compensation.santiago employee benefits services d.in keeping with this purpose,proceedings which in any manner concern the recovery of compensation or any right or liability arising out of or incidental thereto must be instituted before the wcab,subd.a.section and its exclusive jurisdiction provisions thus play an essential role in the exclusivity scheme.see marsh mclennan,superior court cal d.
our supreme court has recently clarified and refined the analysis courts must engage in when determining the sweep of the exclusivity doctrine.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,d,vacanti.the question considered in vacanti was whether the exclusive remedy provisions of the wca preempted statutory and tort claims asserted by medical providers.the providers alleged that the insurers conspired to put them out of business by intentionally mishandling their lien claims they sought only to recover damages to their businesses.discerning which causes of action filtered through the exclusivity barrier,our state high court articulated a inquiry first,is the alleged injury collateral to or derivative of an injury compensable by the exclusive remedies of the wca id.at,d.injuries that arise out of and in the course of the workers compensation claims process come within the exclusivity rules because this process is tethered to a compensable injury.id.at,d.
second,if the injury meets the collateral to or derivative of test,then courts examine whether the alleged acts or motives that establish the elements of the cause of action fall outside the risks encompassed within the compensation bargain citation.where the acts are a normal part of the employment relati
