facts and procedural history 
on december,plaintiff was injured at defendant building site in ridgecrest,california,when he fell from a ladder while painting and doing paint preparation work.on november,plaintiff filed a complaint in kern county superior court against defendant,seeking the recovery of damages for his personal injuries.the complaint included causes of action for premises liability and general negligence,and alleged as supporting facts that while plaintiff was working for defendant as an unlicensed he sustained serious personal injuries as a result of defendant negligent failure to provide a safe work environment.
defendant filed an answer consisting of a general denial and several affirmative defenses.the affirmative defenses included a ninth affirmative defense,which asserted that plaintiff exclusive remedy for his injuries was workers compensation benefits.
on october,plaintiff filed a first amended complaint.the first amended complaint specified that the injury occurred when plaintiff fell from a ladder and suffered a severe fracture of the right femur.the amended pleading also alleged that plaintiff was not covered by defendant workers compensation insurance policy that he was informed that such coverage would not apply to him defendant answer to the first amended complaint once again asserted as a ninth affirmative defense that plaintiff exclusive remedy was to seek benefits available to him under the workers compensation system.
the case came on regularly for trial on november.before proceeding to other issues in the case,the trial court convened an evidentiary hearing or to determine the merits of defendant ninth affirmative defense and to exercise its inherent power to inquire into its subject matter jurisdiction.after hearing evidence that included a number of exhibits and the testimony of several witnesses,the trial court found that defendant ninth affirmative defense was meritorious.specifically,the trial court held that plaintiff injuries were sustained within the course and scope of his employment with defendant,no exemption to workers compensation coverage applied,and plaintiff was covered by defendant workers compensation policy.therefore,workers compensation was plaintiff exclusive remedy,the matter came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the workers compensation system,and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.in the trial court written order filed on december,the action was dismissed based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction.a judgment of dismissal was thereafter entered.

defendant met statutory criteria for entitlement to cost award 
the right to recover costs is entirely a creature of statute murillo fleetwood enterprises,cal th,and section is the fundamental authority for awarding costs in civil actions.scott blount,cal th.section establishes the following rule except as otherwise expressly provided by statute,a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding,subd.b.as defined by the statute,a p revailing party includes a defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered,subd.a.therefore,upon dismissal of an action in a defendant favor,that party is entitled to an award of costs under the clear authority and mandate of these statutory provisions.no qualifications or conditions are imposed.he or she is entitled to costs as a matter of right sealand inv.shirley d.
in the present case,defendant was the prevailing party because a judgment of dismissal was entered in its favor,subd.a.since no other statute expressly provided to the contrary defendant was plainly entitled to recover its costs as a matter of right,subd.b.

we begin with the procedural context in which the issue at hand was raised.defendant properly raised the jurisdictional issue of workers compensation coverage by asserting it as an affirmative defense.generally speaking,in a lawsuit for personal injury damages,a defendant has the burden of pleading and proving,as an affirmative defense,the existence of the conditions of compensation under the workers compensation law.doney tambouratgis cal d.based on the allegations of the first amended complaint and defendant answer,the disputed factual issues before the trial court relating to this jurisdictional defense included whether plaintiff,as an unlicensed contractor,was an employee of defendant,and if so,whether defendant satisfied its obligation of securing workers compensation insurance coverage that applied to plaintiff depending on how the trial court resolved those issues,subject matter jurisdiction would either be exclusively in the workers compensation system or exclusively in the trial court.jurisdiction,once determined,is exclusive and is not concurrent.rowland county of sonoma d.
