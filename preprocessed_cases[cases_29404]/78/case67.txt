mae ann sharpe,the widow of deceased coal miner william sharpe,petitions for review of the adverse decision and order of the benefits review board the brb decision,affirming the decision and order of an administrative law judge the alj decision in the alj decision,the alj retroactively denied sharpe claim for black lung lifetime disability benefits the living miner claim,which had been approved eleven years earlier.benefits had been paid to sharpe,however,until his death in april.the alj also denied sharpe related survivor claim for black lung benefits the survivor claim,filed on april,a week after sharpe death.the alj denial of those claims resulted from a modification request filed by westmoreland coal company on june,seeking to reopen and alter sharpe award of benefits the modification request.in her petition for review,sharpe contends,inter alia,that the adjudicators erred in granting the modification request on sharpe living miner claim 
as explained below,we agree that the alj erred in granting the modification request and that the brb consequently erred in affirming it,in that he failed to exercise the discretion accorded to him with respect to such proceedings in so ruling,the alj failed to assess whether reopening the case would render justice under the act,in light of the various factors pertinent to a proper modification request ruling,including accuracy,the requesting party diligence and motive,and the potential futility of a favorable modification award.we therefore vacate and remand for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.
william sharpe worked for years in the coal mines of southern west virginia and western virginia,and was employed by westmoreland coal company for at least eight of those years.sharpe last worked for westmoreland as a manager in and around underground coal mines,and he retired in.sharpe had previously worked in various mining operations as a general superintendent,a foreman,a section foreman,a rock driller,and a coal loader.in march,sharpe filed his claim for living miner benefits,maintaining that he suffered from black lung disease,or pneumoconiosis an alj denied sharpe living miner claim on may,concluding that he had failed to establish total disability due to pneumoconiosis.sharpe appealed that decision to the brb,which,on march,affirmed the alj in part,but vacated the finding that sharpe did not suffer from complicated coal workers pneumoconiosis.the living miner claim was then remanded to a different alj,who,after finding that sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis,approved the claim and awarded black lung benefits to him on august,the alj decision westmoreland appealed the alj decision to the brb,which affirmed the award of benefits on september,the brb decision.significantly,westmoreland did not pursue its right to seek judicial review of the brb decision sharpe thus received black lung benefits under his living miner claim from until his death on april.
after her husband died,sharpe promptly filed,on april,her survivor benefits claim with the director of the office of workers compensation programs the director on june,nearly two months after sharpe nearly seven years after the brb filed its modification request on sharpe living miner claim,pursuant to.in the modification request,westmoreland alleged that sharpe had never suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis and that a mistake of fact had been made in that regard in the alj decision on november,the director determined,after conducting an informal conference on the modification request,that no such mistake of fact had been made in the alj decision,and thus denied modification the director decision.see on november,westmoreland rejected the director decision,and the modification request was referred to the office of administrative law judges.see id.at.by decision dated july,the alj also ruled against westmoreland,concluding that it had failed to present sufficient new evidence to establish that the alj found that sharpe suffered from complicated in error the alj decision.the alj thus denied the modification request and awarded benefits to sharpe on her survivor claim.neither the director decision nor the alj decision assessed the factors,other than factual accuracy,that are pertinent to such a ruling,and both decisions concluded that no mistake of fact had been made in.westmoreland appealed the alj decision to the brb,which,by decision of august,the brb decision,vacated the alj decision.the brb decision ruled that the alj could not rely on any findings of fact made in the alj decision,and directed that,on remand,he assess de novo the previously submitted evidence as well as the newly submitted evidence.
on remand,the alj,by decision of april,the alj decision,reversed himself and concluded that a mistake of fact had been made when the alj decision ruled that sharpe suffered from complicated pneumoconiosis the alj thus modified sharpe living miner claim more than four years after his death and denied both that claim and sharpe survivor claim.the alj again only assessed the factual accuracy of the complicated pneumoconiosis finding and failed to evaluate the other pertinent factors.in so doing,he failed to adhere to the regulatory mandate,found in,that a proper assessment of a modification request is committed to the sound discretion of the adjudicator.the brb affirmed the alj decision by its decision of june,the brb decision,likewise assuming that westmoreland had a right to modification of the living miner claim upon simply establishing a mistake of fact.thus,none of the decisions on the modification request addressed the fact that westmoreland waited nearly seven years to file the request,none questioned westmoreland motive in filing it in apparent response to the survivor claim,and none otherwise addressed whether a reopening of the matter would render justice 
sharpe now seeks our review of the brb decision,contending,inter alia,that the alj decision erred in granting the modification request on sharpe living miner claim,and that the brb erred in affirming it.we possess jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to c.
on january,we heard oral argument on sharpe petition.by order of january,we directed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing,inter alia,what relief if any westmoreland could secure from its modification request in their supplemental briefs,the director and sharpe maintain that the modification request is futile,in that westmoreland can not recover any overpayments made to sharpe because no estate ever existed for him,and,in any event,any collection action against such an estate would be time barred.see fed.resp t supp.br.absent an estate,there is no opposing party on the miner claim from which westmoreland could seek repayment of benefits.thus,it is not apparent that the employer has established its modification petition is not moot.westmoreland also conceded that it has never sought to collect any overpayment from sharpe estate.
we review for abuse of discretion a decision to grant a modification request on a living miner claim.see parker,cir see also betty b coal,owcp,cir w e have no quarrel with encouraging aljs to exercise their discretion to reopen when doing this would promote justice and we would not hesitate to correct abuses of that discretion.such an exercise of discretion by an alj,however,is not boundless and subject to automatic affirmance.see westberry gislaved gummi ab,cir.in reviewing a discretionary administrative decision,we are obliged to assess the full record and the reasons assigned,and we will reverse if the decision was guided by erroneous legal principles,or if the adjudicator committed a clear error of judgment in the conclusion it reached upon a weighing of the relevant factors.see id.internal quotation marks omitted.an abuse of discretion can flow from a failure or refusal,either express or implicit,actually to exercise discretion,deciding instead as if by general rule,or even arbitrarily,as if neither by rule nor discretion.james jacobson,cir.
