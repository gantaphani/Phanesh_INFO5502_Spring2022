under an exception to the exclusivity of workers compensation remedies,an injured employee may bring a civil action against another employee w hen the injury or death is proximately caused by the willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression of the other employee,subd.a.the question we address is whether,as a general rule,a trial court properly may instruct the jury that the injured employee must prove that the other employee had an intent to injure in order to satisfy section,subdivision a we conclude the answer is yes.
factual and procedural background 
the facts are taken largely from the court of appeal opinion.
manuel torres worked for parkhouse tire service,parkhouse,repairing and installing tires.roy naas,a sales representative for parkhouse,approached torres from behind while he was on his knees working on a tire.naas grabbed torres back support belt,lifted him off the ground several times,and finally dropped him on his knees suffering a back injury,torres did not return to work for parkhouse.torres claimed the incident was malicious,while naas countered it was innocent horseplay.
torres and his wife plaintiffs sued parkhouse and naas seeking damages for personal injury and loss of consortium.the complaint alleged that naas committed a willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression against torres so as to render naas subject to civil suit under section,subdivision a.the complaint also alleged that employer parkhouse condoned and ratified naas tortious actions,making it also subject to suit the trial court instructed the jury that in order to impose liability,the jury must find that torres injury was caused by a willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression on the part of naas,and naas committed the act with the intent to cause injury.
the jury returned a special verdict finding that naas did not commit a willful and unprovoked act of physical aggression against plaintiff manuel torres with the intent to cause injury.
plaintiffs appealed.reversing the trial court judgment,the court of appeal majority held that plaintiffs were not required to prove naas specific intent to injure in order to recover damages under section,subdivision a.the majority found that this statutory exception to workers compensation exclusivity does not state that the injury must be intentionally or willfully caused by the physical act of aggression.the majority expressly disagreed with soares city of oakland th,d soares,which held to the contrary.the dissenting justice kremer,however,concluded that an intent to injure requirement comported with this court decision in mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,mathews.
we granted review.several days before the scheduled oral argument,naas counsel informed the court that the parties had reached a settlement.however,no party requested dismissal of the appeal.although the settlement may have rendered this case technically moot,we instead follow the line of judicial authority recognizing an exception to the mootness doctrine,and permitting the court to decline to dismiss a case rendered moot by stipulation of the parties where the appeal raises issues of continuing public importance.lundquist reusser cal th,fn,d.
discussion 
exclusivity rule 
as a general rule,an employee who sustains an industrial injury arising out of and in the course of the employment is limited to recovery under the workers compensation system,subd.a fermino fedco,cal th,d,fermino.we have observed that this rule of exclusivity is based on the presumed compensation bargain,pursuant to which the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.fermino,supra,cal th at,d,quoting shoemaker myers cal d.
to prevent employees from circumventing the exclusivity rule by bringing lawsuits for injuries against coemployees,who in turn would seek indemnity from their employers,the legislature in provided immunity to coemployees,subd.a,as amended by stats,ch,amending to substantially its current version.in other words,the purpose of the exclusivity rule would be defeated if employees could bring actions against fellow employees acting in the scope of employment such that the fellow employees negligence could be imputed to their employers.saala mcfarland cal d.therefore,workers compensation was also made the exclusive remedy against fellow employees acting within the scope of employment.ibid.the words acting within the scope of his or her employment should be interpreted in light of the purpose of section,so as not to extend immunity beyond respondeat superior situations.cal d at,hendy losse cal d,d.for conduct committed within the scope of employment,employees,like their employers,should not be held subject to suit.see also larson,workers compensation law,because employees give up the right to sue for industrial injuries as part of the compensation bargain,employees should also be entitled to freedom from suit for industrial accidents in which employees are at fault.
there are,however,statutory exceptions to coemployee immunity.as relevant here,a civil suit is permissible when an employee proximately causes another employee injury or death by a willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression,subd.a or by intoxication,subd.a.if an employee brings a lawsuit against a coemployee based on either of these exceptions,the employer is not held liable,directly or indirectly,for damages awarded against,or for a liability incurred by the other employee,subd.b.this provision is consistent with the view that a coemployee is immune from suit to the extent necessary to prevent an against the employer under the exclusivity rule.saala mcfarland,supra,cal d at.it is that labor code section did not establish or create a new right or cause of action in the employee but severely limited a preexisting right to freely sue a fellow employee for damages.miner superior court d.
with this background in mind,we address whether the trial court properly instructed the jury that plaintiffs were required to prove that naas acted with the intent to cause injury in order to establish that naas had committed a willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression against torres under section,subdivision a.
section,subdivision a 
in interpreting a statute where the language is clear,courts must follow its plain meaning.droeger friedman,sloan ross cal d.however,if the statutory language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,courts may consider various extrinsic aids,including the purpose of the statute,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme encompassing the statute.wilcox birtwhistle cal th,d.in the end,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.id.at,d.
like the court of appeal,plaintiffs assert that the exception language is plain and expressly does not include an intent to injure element.see,subd.a.thus,they assert that a court may only instruct a jury on the words of the statute without defining its terms,and without recognizing an intent to injure requirement.
we disagree that the meaning of section,subdivision a statutory language is clear on its face.the labor code does not specifically define the phrase willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression,subd.a.indeed,past decisions demonstrate that the facts of a particular case may raise questions as to the proper interpretation and application of this statutory language.for example,issues have included whether a physical act of aggression applies only in instances in which the coemployee makes physical contact with the injured employee,iverson atlas pacific engineering d.iverson mathews,supra,cal d at,or whether a coemployee engages in a willful physical act of aggression only when the coemployee acts with an intent to injure as in soares,supra,th,d,and the present case.
contrary to the dissent suggestion,a jury instruction that clarifies the application of statutory language in a particular context does not add to the words of a statute.dis,post,d.it is a court duty and responsibility to determine the meaning and scope of statutory language that is ambiguous.an instruction in the language of a statute is proper only if the jury would have no difficulty in understanding the statute without guidance from the court.citations.it is not proper if reasonable men might differ as to the construction of the statute,for it would delegate to the jury the function of statutory interpretation that belongs to the court.citation.people thomas cal d.in considering the proper interpretation of the statute,we look to both the statutory phrase as a whole willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression,and the legislative purpose behind the provision,subd.a.
in iverson,the court of appeal found that the willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression exception was similar to section,former subdivision g now subdivision a barring compensation for injuries to an initial physical aggressor.iverson,supra,d at.relying on our decision in mathews,supra,cal d at page,iverson observed that an initial physical aggressor was defined as one who first engages in physical conduct which a reasonable man would perceive to be a real,present and apparent threat of bodily harm.iverson,supra,d at.the aggressor need not commit a battery because bodily contact is not a significant factor.ibid.under certain circumstances,clenching a fist or pointing a gun may be sufficient to trigger section,subdivision a.iverson,supra,d at.thus,the iverson court concluded that a willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression under section,subdivision a is obviously intended to permit a civil action for damages whenever a coemployee commits an intentional tort by aggressive physical conduct.iverson,supra,d at.
although we found that iverson was overbroad insofar as it suggested that all intentional torts are categorically excepted from the exclusivity rule fermino,supra,cal th at,d,we find persuasive its reliance on the definition of an initial physical aggressor,subd.a to interpret,in part,the willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression exception here,subd.a.the provisions similar language strongly suggests that they are complementary and should be construed consistently.indeed,an employee may bring an action against another employee for a willful physical act of aggression only if it is unprovoked,subd.a.this is consistent with section bar of compensation for an initial physical aggressor who first introduces an element of physical violence into the confrontation,thus creating the risk of injury.mathews,supra,cal d at.w hen words used in a statute have acquired a settled meaning through judicial interpretation,the words should be given the same meaning when used in another statute dealing with an analogous subject matter this is particularly true,where both statutes were enacted for the welfare of employees and are in harmony with each other.citation.ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th,fn,d.
consistent with these authorities,we conclude an unprovoked physical act of aggression,subd.a is unprovoked conduct intended to convey an actual,present,and apparent threat of bodily injury.mathews,supra,cal d at.a threat,of course,is commonly understood as an expression of intention to inflict evil,injury,or damage webster new collegiate dict.ed see also american heritage dict.new college ed and as a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another black law dict.ed.thus,unprovoked physical act of aggression,subd.a logically contemplates intended injurious conduct.by adding the term willful,the legislature has underscored the need for an intent to bring about the consequences of that expression,an intent to inflict injury or harm.see industrial acc.com.cal d,w hile the word wilful implies an intent,the intention referred to relates to the misconduct and not merely to the fact that some act was intentionally done.
standing alone,aggression is itself a powerful term defined as a n unprovoked attack the first attack in a quarrel an assault an inroad oxford english dict.ed,and as a forceful action or procedure as an unprovoked attack esp.when intended to dominate or master.webster new collegiate,supra.indeed,at least one decision has required evidence of some offensive action or hostile attack to prove aggression.kearney denker idaho,citing idaho code willful or unprovoked physical aggression exception to workers compensation exclusivity requires an intention to injure the employee.the term aggression,therefore,suggests intentional harmful conduct.
contrary to the court of appeal analysis,the legislature use of the term intentionally and the phrase willfully and deliberately in other provisions of the workers compensation scheme does not alter our conclusion.these provisions exclude compensation to employees whose injuries were intentionally,subd.a,or whose deaths were willfully and deliberately caused by themselves,subd.a.the fact that the legislature used these words in those provisions and not in section,subdivision a,does not necessarily indicate that it intended to omit from this section the requirement that the coemployee intentionally or willfully injured another.unlike the term willful in section,subdivision a,intentionally and willfully and deliberately do not modify an already intentional or deliberate act,such as a physical act of aggression,but describe the manner in which the employees own injuries or deaths are caused,subd.a.thus,the legislature use of the modifying word willful,rather than intentional or willful and deliberate,in section,subdivision a does not mandate a contrary conclusion.
we conclude,as a general rule,that a willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression includes an intent to injure requirement,subd.a.
in general,if an employer condones what courts have described as horseplay among its employees,an employee who engages in it is within the scope of employment under section,subdivision a,and is thus immune from suit,unless exceptions apply.oliva heath th,d but see pacific emp.ins.acc.com.cal d,holding a nonparticipating employee injury from a coemployee horseplay is compensable under.
although horseplay in the workplace is characterized by a lack of animosity,it may be committed under circumstances involving an obvious and significant risk of injury.see,pacific emp.ins.acc,supra,cal d,busboys throwing hard rolls at each other and striking another employee oliva heath,supra,th at,d employees lowering coemployee chair as a prank hodges workers comp.appeals bd.d.employees friendly sparring match argonaut ins.workmen.bd.d.ranch employees chasing each other around bunkhouse.thus,by defining willful and unprovoked physical act of aggression in terms of an intent to injure element,the legislature has ensured that section,subdivision a reach would not extend to acts traditionally viewed as horseplay that are otherwise subject to exclusive coverage under the workers compensation system.
given the the propensities and tendencies of mankind and the ordinary habits of life,it must be admitted that wherever human beings congregate,either at work or at play,there is some frolicking and horseplay.pacific emp.ins.acc,supra,cal d at.we doubt the legislature intended to permit employees to sue each other based on conduct arguably inherent in the workplace.indeed,that result would be inconsistent with section aim to severely limit a preexisting right to freely sue a fellow employee for damages.miner superior court,supra,d at.
at oral argument,however,plaintiffs asserted that the horseplay doctrine is irrelevant in this case.they emphasized that jurors understand the distinction between horseplay and aggression,and that imposing an intent to injure requirement is unwarranted and unnecessary.to that end,they argued that the exception requires only a hostile intent,which th
