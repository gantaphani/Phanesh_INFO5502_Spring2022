mark and tawana mclaurin the mclaurins appeal the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of noble drilling us,noble drilling corporation,noble drilling services,and john does collectively referred to as noble drilling.the mclaurins specifically challenge the district court finding that their tort claims against noble drilling were preempted by b of the longshore and harbor workers compensation act lhwca.for the following reasons,we reverse the decision of the district court.
facts and proceedings 
mark mclaurin mclaurin,an employee of friede goldman halter,friede goldman,was injured in friede goldman shipyard while working as a scaffold carpenter supporting construction work on the clyde boudreaux,a vessel owned by noble drilling.the vessel,a mobile offshore drilling unit,was moored in friede goldman shipyard and was in the process of being converted for use.as an employee of friede goldman,mclaurin worked approximately feet from the vessel to fabricate pontoon extensions to be used in the conversion.mclaurin was injured when a shell of one of the pontoon extensions,suspended by a crane that was left unattended,fell on him and crushed his left hand and arm.
mclaurin received medical benefits and disability compensation from friede goldman under the lhwca.the mclaurins then sued noble drilling as the vessel owner,alleging negligence claims under mississippi law,general maritime law,and b of the lhwca.they claimed that noble drilling had assumed substantial control,through its personnel in the shipyard,over the work on the pontoons and the sequence in which it was performed,and failed to exercise due care to ensure the observation of proper safety practices.
noble drilling moved for summary judgment,arguing that the mclaurins tort claims were preempted by the last sentence of b of the lhwca,which states the remedy provided in this subsection shall be exclusive of all other remedies against the vessel except remedies available under this chapter.b.in opposition to summary judgment,the mclaurins argued that b only governs claims against the vessel for vessel negligence.citing richendollar diamond m drilling,cir en banc internal quotations omitted,in which this court noted that a vessel is viewed as a separate entity distinct from its owner,the mclaurins argued that they were not just pursuing an in rem negligence claim against the vessel but were also pursuing separate claims against the vessel owner.

the mclaurins appeal only the dismissal of their tort claims,arguing that if they can not state a cognizable claim under b,then the language of that section does not preempt their tort claims.

iii.discussion 
the mclaurins acknowledge that the district court did not err in finding that their b claim fails on the merits.they argue,however,that this should not preclude their tort claims because their claims do not implicate noble drilling negligence as owner of a vessel.noble drilling counters,arguing that the district court correctly found that it qualifies as a vessel under the lhwca and,therefore,b exclusivity provision preempts mclaurin tort claims.whether noble drilling qualifies as a vessel under the lhwca,however,is irrelevant for analysis under these facts.we hold that the district court was correct in finding that the mclaurins b claim fails as a matter of law,but it erred in finding that b exclusivity provision preempts the mclaurins tort claims against noble drilling.
a.the mclaurins b claim 
the lhwca was created to establish a compensation scheme for injured maritime workers.under the lhwca,those persons injured while working in or near harbor facilities as longshoremen,shipbuilders,ship repairers,and various harbor workers,such as carpenters,cleaners,or painters are limited to compensation claims against their employers.the lhwca covers a worker for any injury if he is engaged in maritime employment,provided that he meets a test his injury must occur within an area adjoining navigable waters of the united states,known as the situs test,and the nature of the work performed by him must be maritime in nature,known as the status test.see ne.marine terminal caputo,d 
an injured maritime worker may bring an action under the lhwca against his employer for workers compensation,see,and against an owner for its vessel negligence,see b mclaurin received workers compensation from his employer,friede goldman,under but the district court dismissed his b claim for vessel negligence against noble drilling.if mclaurin had been entitled to recover for vessel negligence under b,then he would not have been able to sue the vessel in tort because t he remedy provided in b shall be exclusive of all other remedies against the vessel b.
