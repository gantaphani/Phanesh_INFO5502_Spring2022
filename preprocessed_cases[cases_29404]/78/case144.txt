defendant mark lay appeals his fraud convictions related to a hedge fund investment by the ohio bureau of workers compensation.lay primarily argues that the jury instructions were improper and that insufficient evidence supports the jury verdict because,as a hedge fund adviser,lay had a fiduciary relationship only with the hedge fund,not with its investors.lay also seeks a new trial based on three of the district court evidentiary rulings and its restitution and forfeiture determinations.because a hedge fund adviser can,in some circumstances,have a fiduciary relationship with an investor,the jury instructions were correct and sufficient evidence supports lay conviction.we also reject lay challenges to the district court evidentiary rulings and its restitution and forfeiture determinations.
background 
the facts of this on the indictment and the evidence presented by the government in support of the allegations in the set out in careful detail in the district court opinion denying lay motion for judgment of acquittal.united states lay,d.a brief summary is sufficient here.in lay began serving as investment adviser to the ohio bureau of workers compensation when lay company,capital management,began managing the bureau investment in a bonds fund,the long fund.the bureau remained lay client as to its long fund investment from onward.in,lay founded the active duration fund,a hedge fund.in september of,the bureau shifted million from the long fund to the active duration fund.the hedge fund agreement governing the bureau active duration fund investment set a leveraging guideline,but in fact lay consistently leveraged active duration fund assets far over.in march of,the active duration fund lost million.in may of,after bureau officials discussed the loss with lay,the bureau invested an additional million in the active duration fund.the active duration fund value continued to decline.in september of,the bureau invested an additional million in that fund to avoid losing its entire investment,and then terminated its interest in the fund.the bureau recovered only about million from its million active duration fund investment.
a federal grand jury indicted lay on one investment adviser fraud count and multiple mail and wire fraud counts.the investment adviser fraud count tracked the following investment advisers act provisions,codified at,which make it unlawful for an investment adviser to use the mails or the instrumentalities of interstate commerce 
to employ any device,scheme,or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client 
to engage in any transaction,practice,or course of business which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client 
to engage in any act,practice or course of business which is fraudulent,deceptive,or manipulative.
the superseding indictment charged that lay acted to 
a employ devices,schemes,and artifices to defraud,the client,the bureau and thereby the active duration fund b engage in transactions,practices and courses of business which operated as a fraud and deceit upon,the client,the bureau and thereby the active duration fund and c engage in any act,practice and course of business which was fraudulent,deceptive and manipulative,to wit exercising leverage in excess of in the active duration fund,in violation of the hedge fund agreement,and concealing and failing to disclose to the full extent his exercise of leverage in excess of.
the superseding indictment also alleged that lay conduct constituted mail fraud and wire fraud because lay sent interstate emails,faxes,and trade confirmations to carry out these trades.
at trial,terry gasper,the bureau chief financial officer and the person who initially decided to invest bureau money in the active duration fund,testified that his understanding of the active duration fund and long fund investments was that if lay felt that bond prices in general were going to decline the active duration fund would be used to hedge those bonds so that if the bond market did,in fact,go down in value,we would make some money in the active duration fund to offset the unrealized losses we would have suffered in the long fund.gasper indicated that his experience with lay and the long fund was one of the primary reasons he invested in the active duration fund,that he felt the active duration fund investment was very conservative and low risk,and that the bureau was simply diversifying the product under a current manager when it invested long fund assets already under lay management in the active duration fund.gasper testified that in the first half of,before the bureau invested in the active duration fund,lay told gasper that the active duration fund would be using leverage only to reflect the value of what he had in the fund and that gasper had viewed the leveraging guideline in the hedge fund agreement as a way to give lay some flexibility in running money and moving monies around.gasper testified that when the bureau had invested a second million in the active duration fund,he had assumed that lay was acting in an appropriate fiduciary way that the leverage in the active duration fund was exactly what we agreed to,that maximum of percent of fund value.
james mclean,the bureau chief investment officer,testified that he and lay had agreed in april of,after the initial million loss and before the second million investment,that the fund was intended to be more of a net positive rate of return fund meaning that lay is investing in high quality fixed income securities,and if they yielding a rate of return of say five percent on an interest bearing basis,then that fund,all things being equal and nothing else being done,would earn a five percent rate of return.as to leverage,mclean testified that he and lay agreed that the active duration fund was allowed to use a bit of leverage to take positions to enhance that five percent rate of return when lay saw opportunities within the marketplace,but that with this modest leverage,even if that account were to lose a little bit based upon the leveraging of a bet that lay placed on the short position you still earn one or two percent based upon the core of the hedge fund portfolio.lay had regularly reported to mclean in writing regarding the long fund performance,and these reports had included a summary of the active duration fund value under the heading other assets.
fbi special agent jeremy durgin testified that,of the bureau million total loss,approximately million was due to trades that had leveraged active duration fund assets over.durgin testified that lay had begun leveraging those assets over in early,that of lay active duration fund trades involved leveraging over,that over of those trades involved leveraging over,and that some trades involved leveraging over.
over lay objection,the district court also permitted the jury to hear lay deposition testimony from a previous civil case.in that deposition,lay repeatedly stated that his company,capital management,was the investment adviser for the active duration fund and provided a service to the active duration fund.lay also stated in that deposition that the bureau was capital management,client and that the bureau,as a client,pays the fees.
the district court instructed the jury that,in order to find lay guilty of investment adviser fraud,the government had to prove each element of either or or.d at emphasis in original.with respect to,the court instructed that 
in order to establish that lay committed investment adviser fraud under these provisions,the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the bureau was mark lay client with respect to its investment in the active duration fund 
a client is an individual or entity which compensates an investment adviser to provide advice directly or through publications or writings about the value of securities or the advisability of investing in,purchasing,or selling securities 
it is for you to determine as a matter of fact whether mark lay had an investment relationship with the bureau with respect to its investment in the active duration fund.there are two possible outcomes of your determination on this issue.
first,you could find that the government failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that mark lay had an investment relationship with the bureau with respect to its investment in the active duration fund.
second,you could find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that mark lay did have an investment relationship with the bureau with respect to the bureau investment in the active duration fund.you could make this finding in one of two ways.the defendant does not dispute that he was the investment adviser and the bureau was his client with respect to the long fund which continued throughout the period of time at issue in the superseding indictment.therefore,you could find that lay established a second investment relationship with the bureau and he was the investment adviser to the bureau with respect to both the long fund and the active duration fund,or that the investment between lay and the bureau regarding the long fund was based on the investment of the monies in the long fund wherever it was invested and was not severed when long fund monies were invested in the active duration fund.
the court also instructed with respect to that if the jury found that the bureau was not lay client with respect to the active duration fund,the jury was to determine as a matter of fact whether lay nonetheless had a fiduciary duty with regard to the active duration fund.id.at.the district court rejected lay objection to this instruction.
to find lay guilty of mail or wire fraud,the district instructed the jury that it had to find beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a scheme to defraud lay knowingly participated in the scheme the scheme included a material representation or concealment of a material fact lay had the intent to defraud and lay used the mail or caused another to use the mail in furtherance of the scheme.
after deliberations began,the jury asked to rehear lay deposition testimony.the district court permitted a,but first cautioned the jury not to accord undue influence to that testimony.
the jury found lay guilty on all counts and found in a special verdict form that lay had obtained in proceeds from his mail and wire fraud offenses.lay moved for judgment of acquittal and argued that insufficient evidence supported his convictions because he did not owe the bureau a fiduciary duty and the bureau was not his client as to its active duration fund investment.lay also moved for a new trial based on,among other reasons,alleged error in the district court jury instructions and its limiting instruction upon the of lay deposition testimony,and cumulative error.
the district court denied lay motion for judgment of acquittal.the court held that sufficient evidence supported the existence of a fiduciary relationship between lay and the bureau as to its active duration fund investment because lay had a fiduciary relationship with the bureau as to its long fund investment,the bureau intended its active duration fund investment to provide lay with flexibility and investment management alternatives for half of the long fund monies in order to reduce the overall risk to the bureau monies under lay control,the bureau was not a passive investor in the active duration fund,the bureau had regular and direct communication with lay about the active duration fund,and the bureau was the sole shareholder in the active duration fund.d at.the district court denied lay motion for judgment of acquittal as to the mail and wire fraud counts.id.at.the district court also denied lay motion for a new trial and held that the jury instructions were proper,that the court had issued a proper limiting instruction before lay deposition testimony was to the jury,and that no cumulative error had occurred.id.at.the district court directed that be forfeited and imposed million in restitution.on appeal,lay challenges the district court jury instructions and its denial of his motions for judgment of acquittal and a new trial.
ii.and challenges 
investment adviser fraud 
lay central argument is that,as to the hedge fund,he owed no fiduciary duty to the bureau.the duty of a hedge fund adviser,the theory goes,is to the hedge fund and can not be to the various investors in the fund.if the theory is correct,then various instructions to the jury,permitting the jury to find such a fiduciary duty,were in error and,indeed,acquittal should have been ordered.the theory fails,however,for the reasons carefully stated by the district court below.id.at.permitting the jury to determine the existence of a fiduciary relationship was proper and,on the facts of this case,a reasonable jury could find that lay owed the bureau a fiduciary duty with respect to the active duration fund.lay challenges to the jury instructions and to the denial of the acquittal motion in this regard are therefore both without merit.
as explained by the district court,there is evidence in the record that the characteristics of an relationship were present between defendant and the bureau regarding the active duration fund.id.at.lay has never disputed that he had an investment therefore a fiduciary the bureau as to its long fund investment,and the evidence supports the conclusion that this relationship continued through the existence of the active duration fund and encompassed the bureau active duration fund investment.as gasper testified,the bureau invested in the active duration fund to diversify existing investments,achieve positive returns regardless of market conditions,and increase returns above those the bureau could achieve with the long fund alone.capital management,inclusion of the active duration fund as other assets in its long fund reports indicates that the active duration fund and the long fund were part of a single investment strategy and therefore part of the bureau single relationship with lay.unlike a typical hedge fund investor,the bureau was the only investor in the active duration fund at the relevant time and the bureau had an active role in its active duration fund investment,as indicated by mclean meetings with lay regarding that investment.the jury could therefore reasonably find,as a matter of fact,that lay owed the bureau a fiduciary duty as to the active duration fund investment.
lay categorical argument to the contrary is primarily based upon reading too much into the holding of the district of columbia circuit in goldstein sec,regarding the investment advisers act iaa.that case precluded the securities and exchange commission from treating all hedge fund investors as clients of a hedge fund adviser for purposes of circumventing a registration exemption.the case did not hold that a hedge fund investor could never be a client of a hedge fund adviser,or be owed a fiduciary duty by one,for purposes of the criminal fraud provisions of the iaa.
in goldstein,the circuit considered an sec rule change related to the iaa registration exemption for investment advisers with fewer than fifteen clients in the past twelve months.see id.at.under the sec prior rule,a hedge fund adviser client for registration purposes was the fund,not the fund investors.id.at.under the sec new rule,however,a hedge fund adviser clients would include the fund investors.id.at.the court held that the sec had not adequately explained how the relationship between hedge fund investors and advisers justifies treating the former as clients of the latter and vacated the new rule.id.at.the court reasoned that,based on the iaa definition of investment adviser,a client relationship results when the investor receives investment advice directly from the adviser,and because hedge fund investors do not always receive direct investment advice from hedge fund advisers,the iaa does not support treating all hedge fund investors as clients of hedge fund advisers.id.at.as the court stated,a hedge fund adviser does not tell the investor how to spend his money the investor made that decision when he invested in the hedge fund.having bought into the fund,the investor fades into the background his role is completely passive.id.at.
goldstein did not hold that no hedge fund adviser could create a client relationship with an investor,but rather held only that the
