deborah katz pueschel was employed by the federal aviation administration faa as an air traffic controller between and,when the faa fired her for participating in an illegal strike.she appealed her removal to the merit systems protection board mspb,seeking reinstatement.after finding that she had not participated in the strike,the mspb ordered her reinstated with back pay.katz dep t of.her back pay award was offset by deductions for,among other things,outside earnings during the period between her firing and her reinstatement,reimbursement of a lump sum annual leave payment,and a refund that pueschel received from her retirement account.
while pueschel mspb appeal was pending,she sought workers compensation benefits from the office of workers compensation programs owcp of the department of labor.the secretary of labor has designated owcp to administer the federal employees compensation act feca,which provides workers compensation coverage to federal employees for injuries and occupational diseases.
the first step in the process of claiming feca benefits for a injury or occupational disease is to report it to owcp using form.see.after receiving a form,owcp analyzes the employee claim and decides if the claim should be accepted.acceptance of a claim,however,does not automatically mean that owcp will pay disability benefits.a condition for which medical benefits are payable may not prevent an employee from working.compensation for wage loss due to disability is available only for periods during which an employee medical condition prevents him or her from earning the wages earned before the injury.a.whether disability benefits are payable depends on the medical evidence submitted by the claimant.accordingly,once a claim is accepted,the claimant is advised to file for medical benefits and lost wages using form.see.
pueschel submitted a form to owcp on october.owcp accepted pueschel claim for disability status on april,retroactive to march,and advised her to file a form to claim disability compensation.on october,owcp orally amended its ruling to extend the retroactivity date back to january.
pueschel submitted a form to owcp on november,seeking benefits for the period of january,to april.in her cover letter,she noted that those dates included leave without pay lwop during,and,the years between her removal from the faa and her reinstatement.in a handwritten attachment to her form,pueschel provided information about the applicable pay rates during the entire time period and information about the amounts of sick leave and annual leave she used each year.in addition,she provided information about lwop and set forth calculations of the amount she believed was due from the department of labor attributable to that period,adjusted for the taxes and various deductions that had been assessed on her back pay award.she also submitted a copy of her claim to the faa,which acknowledged its receipt on november.
on november,pueschel filed suit in the court of federal claims,seeking monies owed to plaintiff by defendant as the result of a decision by the office of worker compensation programs,department of labor.specifically,she alleged that her reinstatement award had been improperly classified as back pay,rather than workers compensation benefits,and that she was entitled to a refund of that had been improperly deducted from her award.
the government moved to dismiss pueschel complaint for lack of jurisdiction.the court of federal claims granted the motion on the ground that b precludes judicial review of a decision of the secretary of labor allowing or denying payments pursuant to feca.while acknowledging that no previous case had addressed the specific factual situation presented by pueschel complaint,the trial court determined that discretionary classifications of the type pueschel requested appear to be within the scope of decisions as to which review is barred by section b.in addition,the court held that pueschel suit was by,the statute of limitations for tucker act claims.
with respect to the trial court ruling that the action is barred under b because it challenges a workers compensation decision by the secretary of labor,pueschel contends that section b is inapplicable to her,because congress never intended that statute to apply to united states citizens.in the alternative,pueschel argues that section b is inapplicable to this case because she is not seeking judicial review of a decision by the secretary of labor regarding disability compensation.instead,she argues that she is challenging faa refusal to reclassify her back pay award as disability pay.we conclude that under either theory of the case the court of federal claims properly dismissed pueschel action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
at the outset,we note that it is by no means clear that the owcp has addressed and rejected pueschel claim for the payment of disability benefits.the owcp sent pueschel a letter dated december,which rejected a claim for leave,but pueschel counsel contends that the letter did not pertain to the claim that is at issue in this case.it may be,therefore,that owcp has not yet issued a decision with respect to pueschel claim for additional payments attributable to her period of disability,and that pueschel remedy is to press owcp for a decision on that claim.because the trial court treated the claim as having been finally rejected,we will address the legal issue of the trial court jurisdiction to review such a decision by owcp.our decision should not be taken,however,as a legal determination that the owcp has in fact rejected pueschel claim since,based on the analysis set forth below,we conclude that the court of federal claims would lack jurisdiction whether or not the owcp has finally rejected her claim.
the court of federal claims viewed pueschel complaint as challenging owcp failure to reclassify her back pay award as a disability payment under feca.claim disputes under feca are resolved administratively,and decisions by the secretary of labor regarding disability compensation are protected from judicial review by section b,which contains strong language 
the action of the secretary or his designee in allowing or denying a payment under this subchapter is 
final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact and 
not subject to review by another official of the united states or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.
b.our predecessor court repeatedly held that section b precludes judicial review of disability compensation decisions.see chapman united states,landman united states,collins united states,nolen united states.in addition,all other courts that have addressed the issue have held that,at least in the absence of a constitutional claim,section b precludes judicial review of such decisions.see,czerkies united states dep t of labor,cir en banc stephens office of worker compensation program,cir dipippa united states,cir.
notwithstanding the clear and unambiguous statutory language of section b and the unbroken line of cases construing that language in accordance with its plain meaning,pueschel argues that the legislative history of section b shows that congress did not intend to bar judicial review of challenges to disability compensation decisions brought by united states citizens.although acknowledging that the language appears clear on its face,she argues that the legislative history of section b indicates that that language arose as an unintended result of a amendment and a subsequent recodification of title.pueschel contends that the decisions cited above are not binding on us because the courts in those cases failed to address the argument that pueschel makes based on the legislative history.we address that argument on the merits,but in the end we are not persuaded that the argument based on the legislative history trumps the clear,preclusive language of the statute.
the statute that granted workers compensation to federal employees provided that compensation decisions would be made by an employment compensation commission.the statute was silent with respect to judicial review of the decisions of the commission.see
