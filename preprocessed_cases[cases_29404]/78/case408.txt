introduction 
we granted the petition of the california insurance guarantee association ciga for a writ of review,filed after the workers compensation appeals board wcab or board denied ciga petition for reconsideration of an award of benefits to injured worker david carls ciga contends the board erred in rejecting its statute of limitations defense ciga admits that the statutory period was tolled by the employer failure to advise carls of his rights under the workers compensation law however,it contends that carls had actual knowledge of his rights more than one year before carls filed a claim for benefits,causing the statutory period to run.ciga also challenges the board finding that ciga was estopped to assert the statute of limitations due to its delay in determining that the injury was a covered claim.because ciga has failed to show that it carried its burden to prove actual knowledge sufficient to end the tolling of the statute of limitations,we reject its first contention.we also reject ciga substantial evidence challenge to the estoppel finding.we conclude that on the record presented,the board did not err in rejecting ciga statute of limitations defense,and we affirm the order denying reconsideration.
background 
the material facts are undisputed.after we issued the writ of review,injured worker david carls filed an answer admitting all material allegations of the petition,and adopting the petition statement of facts as his own.our summary is taken from the admitted allegations and the administrative record provided by the wcab.
carls was employed by claremont colleges as a sign painter.in,he sustained a work injury to his left shoulder and neck,filed a workers compensation claim and received temporary disability payments.in,carls injured his back after arriving at work two hours early.although he notified his employer,the employer did not advise him of his potential eligibility for workers compensation,and did not furnish him with a claim form,as required by law in,carls retained an attorney,larry rosenstein,who filed an application to adjudicate carls right to additional benefits relating to the injury.carls did not file a claim for workers compensation benefits for the injury until.
in august,when the claim for additional benefits for the injury was called for trial,the workers compensation judge wcj placed the matter off calendar to allow carls to file a new or amended claim for the injury,but no new claim was presented until march,when carls filed an application for adjudication of his claim for the injury.as a defense to the claim,ciga raised the statute of limitations set forth in section,subdivision a.
the and claims were consolidated for trial,which went forward in october.carls testified that when he injured his back in,he reported the injury to steve his supervisor,who did not provide him with a claim form.carls also spoke to belinda ochoa apparently the employer workers compensation manager,who questioned why he had come to work so early.because ochoa gave him a hard time,carls went to his own doctor for treatment.he never received a letter from his employer advising him of his right to file a workers compensation claim.
the reports and deposition of jon greenfield,the physician who conducted the agreed medical examination ame,were admitted into evidence.in his july,ame report,greenfield noted that in,carls had injured his back and reported the injury to his employer.a notation on the signature page of the ame indicated that a copy of the ame report was sent to rosenstein.greenfield also reviewed and summarized carls medical records relating to treatment for the injury by edward amorosi and ronald perelman 
also in evidence were several of perelman reports.as early as perelman sent a report to rosenstein,in which he wrote in the latter part of,while at work,carls states that he stepped in a hole and twisted his body,which caused severe pain in his low back and right lower extremity.he states that this occurred about two hours before the start of his shift.he went to the office,laid sic on the floor and propped his legs up in a chair thereafter,he reported the injury to his foreman and an injury report was completed.apparently,he was told this injury took place prior to his shift and this was not considered work related.
in may,the wcj issued his findings and award,ruling that the claim was not barred by the statute of limitations.ciga filed its first petition for reconsideration of that decision.before it was heard,the wcj rescinded the order,conducted further proceedings,and in april,issued his amended findings and award.ciga filed a second petition for reconsideration,which was granted.finding the record inadequate to allow meaningful review,the board rescinded the award and findings,and returned the matter for further proceedings.
after considering additional evidence,the wcj again rejected ciga statute of limitations defense and entered an award.ciga again petitioned the board for reconsideration.in his report and recommendation regarding the petition for reconsideration,the wcj found that although carls had filed his claim for benefits more than one year after his workplace injury,the statute was tolled by the failure of the employer,insurer or ciga to notify carls of his right to claim benefits.citing testimony by carls that he was not sure that he had seen greenfield reports attributing his back pain to the injury,the wcj found that ciga had not met its burden to prove that carls had actual knowledge of his right to claim workers compensation benefits for the injury.in addition,the wcj concluded that ciga was estopped from raising the statute of limitations because its conduct in failing to admit coverage for the injury until may ultimately delayed applicant filing of the application for adjudication 
the wcab adopted the wcj report and recommendation,and incorporated them into its order denying reconsideration.on january,the wcj entered a compensation award for the injury,and after the wcab denied ciga petition for reconsideration of that order,ciga timely filed its petition for review by this court.we granted the petition and issued the writ january.
discussion 
ciga contentions 
ciga contends that the statute of limitations barred carls claim for benefits for his back injury.as ciga acknowledges,the statute is tolled by an employer failure to notify its injured employee of a potential right to benefits,as required by section,subdivision a.see kaiser foundation hospitals workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,kaiser.however,ciga contends that any such tolling in this case ended because carls gained actual knowledge of the potential for workers compensation benefits more than one year before he filed his claim 
ciga contends that the evidence showed three events by which carls gained the requisite knowledge.first,ciga contends that carls knew from the moment of his injury in that he might have been entitled to workers compensation benefits,because he had received benefits relating to his injury.second,ciga contends that carls awareness of his workers compensation rights by was demonstrated by his having personally signed the application for the adjudication of benefits for the injury and his retention of counsel in to represent him in that adjudication.third,ciga contends that carls was aware of his rights no later than,when the wcj continued the trial as to the injury,in order to permit the filing of a new or amended application covering the injury.
the applicable statute of limitations and tolling under kaiser 
within one working day of receiving notice or knowledge of an industrial injury result ing in lost time beyond the employee work shift at the time of injury or which results in medical treatment beyond first aid,the employer shall provide,personally or by mail,a claim form and a notice of potential eligibility for benefits to the injured employee,subd.a.california code of regulations,title,section,provides that the notice required by section must be in a writing worded in nontechnical terms,and must set forth specified information 
the statute of limitations applicable here is one year from the date of an industrial injury,subd.a.thus,an employee must submit a claim for compensation within one year of his or her injury.however,i f the employer breaches its statutory duty to notify an employee unaware of his workers compensation rights,the limitations period is tolled for the period of time that the employee remains unaware of his rights.no tolling occurs if the employee has actual knowledge of his rights before the employer breach.the employer has the burden of proving when the injured employee gained actual knowledge of his workers compensation rights.the employee must know that he may be entitled to relevant benefits under the workers compensation system.kaiser,supra,cal d at,see also honeywell workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,tolling analysis of kaiser still applies under amended statutes.
petitioner correctly notes that in kaiser,the supreme court held that the tolling due to the employer failure to give the required notice was not automatic,but arose only if the employee was prejudiced by the breach,and continued only while such prejudice existed.see kaiser,supra,cal d at.however,the court made clear that prejudice means ignorance,and ignorance is presumed until the employee is given the requisite notice or otherwise gains actual knowledge that he may be entitled to workers compensation.id.at,fn,we presume martin was ignorant of those rights sidders workers comp.appeals bd.d.sidders.the court explained if between the date of injury and the date the employer breaches,an employee gains the requisite actual knowledge of his workers compensation rights,he will not be prejudiced by failure of his employer to notify him of those rights if the employee remains ignorant of his rights past the time the employer breaches its duty to notify,the employee will be prejudiced from the date of breach until the employee gains actual knowledge that he may be entitled to benefits under the workers compensation system.kaiser,at.thus,our supreme court has concluded the employer has an affirmative burden to establish either written notice was given to the employee or the employee had,in fact,actual notice of his workers compensation rights.sidders,at.
standard and scope of review 
review of a decision of the wcab is limited to whether the board acted without or in excess of its powers,whether the order,decision or award was unreasonable or procured by fraud or whether,under applicable legal principles,the board conclusions are supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record.citations.granite construction workers comp.appeals bd.th,d,subds.a e.we can not reweigh evidence or decide disputed questions of fact.keulen workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.it is within the province of the wcab to make the factual determination as to whether an employee has knowledge of an industrial related injury and,if so,when that knowledge arose.citation.an appellate court will not interfere with the board factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence or by reasonable inferences drawn from the testimony adduced.citations.citation.galloway workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.where facts are undisputed,the application of the statute of limitations is one of law,which we determine de novo.martino workers comp.appeals bd.th,d applying the statute of limitations of.
carls filed his claim for benefits when he applied in for adjudication of the injury,admittedly more than one year after the injury.see,subd.a.because the statute was tolled by the employer failure to provide carls with the notice required by section,it was ciga burden to prove when carls gained actual knowledge of his workers compensation rights.kaiser,supra,cal d at.to carry its burden,ciga was required to overcome a rebuttable presumption that carls was ignorant of his compensation rights.sidders,supra,d at.as the parties do not claim that any material facts remain disputed,our task is to determine whether the undisputed facts show that ciga met that burden.
first event receipt of compensation for injury 
ciga contends that because carls had already received workers compensation benefits for his injury,he knew when he was injured in that he could claim compensation for workplace injuries.past experience may show an awareness of the right to make a workers compensation claim and receive benefits,but ciga was required to show that carls knew the injury was a potentially compensable industrial injury.see reynolds workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,employee with prior claim failed to realize heart attack was industrially caused.
there was no substantial evidence that carls was actually aware that the injury was potentially compensable as an industrial injury.carls suffered the injury on the employer property,but his shift had not yet started and was not scheduled to start for two hours.carls testimony suggests that his employer had convinced him that his injury was not work related.he testified that because he had been on campus so early,his employer gave him a hard time,which resulted in his seeking treatment from his own physician.
under such circumstances,the injury may or may not have been compensable under the workers compensation system,as it was suffered prior to the start of carls shift.see seymour setzer forest products,d,garcia yedor d.whether it was compensable depended upon whether at the time of the injury,carls was performing service growing out of and incidental to his employment and was acting within the course of his employment,subd.a see also witkin,summary of cal.law ed.workers compensation.the record contains no evidence suggesting that carls had any reason to doubt his employer implication that the injury was not compensable.on the contrary,carls testified that he sought treatment from his own physician.
thus,carls awareness of his right to compensation for the injury did not necessarily inform him of his potential right to compensation for the injury.we conclude that such evidence was insufficient to overcome the presumption that carls was ignorant of his compensation rights.see kaiser,supra,cal d at,sidders,supra,d at.
second event retention of counsel to adjudicate the injury 
ciga contends that carls became aware of his workers compensation rights in,when he retained counsel in connection with the injury and signed the application for adjudication of benefits for the injury.by signing the application,ciga argues,carls demonstrated an awareness of the existence of the workers compensation system.
we have already rejected ciga suggestion that its burden was merely to prove that carls had a general awareness of the existence of the workers compensation system.past experience with workers compensation is not sufficient to prove knowledge of potential eligibility for a particular injury.see reynolds workmen comp.appeals,supra,cal d at.ciga fails to explain how carls signature on an application relating to the injury imparts actual knowledge of his potential eligibility for the injury.
nor has ciga explained how the retention of legal counsel in imparted the requisite actual knowledge.petitioner argument assumes that carls knew what his attorney knew or should have known.as a general rule,an attorney knowledge is imputed to his client.stalberg western title ins.d.however,knowledge is not imputed where actual knowledge is required.herman los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,fn,d where notice to a party is required,notice to the party lawyer does not impart actual knowledge.in kaiser,the supreme court held that where an employer failed to provide the statutorily required notice,the statute of limitations was tolled until the employer demonstrated the employee had actual knowledge of his right to bring a claim.kaiser,supra,cal d at,fn.city would have had to prove martin had actual knowledge that he might be entitled to relevant benefits under the workers compensation system.imputed knowledge is constructive,not actual knowledge.actual notice is n otice given directly to,or received personally by,a party.nelson superior court th,d,quoting black law dict.ed.to read actual notice as imputed notice would stand civil code section on its head.rosenthal garner d.thus,counsel knowledge does not satisfy kaiser requirement of actual knowledge 
ciga contends that proof of carls knowledge comes from perelman report,prepared for the adjudication of the injury,because perelman stated there that carls suffered the injury while at work.we have found no indication in the record that carls ever saw the report,and ciga does not claim that he did.moreover,perelman also noted apparently he was told this injury took place prior to his shift and this was not considered work related.such a comment may have placed counsel on notice that additional research was warranted,but as there is no evidence in the record that counsel discussed the matter with carls,it did not prove carls actual knowledge 
event request for continuance 
ciga contends that carls was aware of his rights no later than august,when his attorney apparently requested a continuance of the trial as to the injury,in order to file a claim for the injury.the record does not reflect that carls was present at that hearing or otherwise knew why the continuance was sought thus,at most,the request for continuance shows counsel belief that the injury may have been a compensable injury.as noted above,however,ciga burden was to show carls had actual knowledge of his worker compensation rights for the injury.kaiser,supra,cal d at,fn,sidders,supra,d at.it failed to do so.
ciga contends the board erred in adopting the wcj finding that ciga conduct delayed the filing of the claim,resulting in an estoppel to assert the statute of limitations in particular,ciga contends that the finding is unsupported by substantial evidence because the wcj minutes and summaries of evidence failed to mention evidence of a misrepresentation of any fact by ciga or of reliance by carls upon any representation by ciga,or other fact showing that ciga failure to timely admit coverage misled carls or his attorney to his detriment.
the wcj expressly found that ciga conduct delayed the applicant filing,and ruled that ciga was thus estopped to assert the statute of limitations.specifically,the board found that the conduct of defendant ciga,which failed to admit that it had coverage for the injury until sometime in may of,ultimately delayed applicant filing of the application for adjudication in the instant case.the wcj thus found,as a matter of fact,that ciga conduct contributed to the delay in the filing of the application herein.ciga did not request more specific findings in its petitions for reconsideration.

conclusion 
we conclude the board did not err in finding ciga had failed to meet its burden to prove that carls gained actual knowledge of his potential eligibility for workers compensation benefits for the injury more than one year prior to filing his claim.we also reject ciga alternative ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the finding of estoppel.
disposition 
the board decision is affirmed.
the majority opinion affirms the order of the workers compensation appeals board appeals board rejecting the statute of limitations defense raised by petitioner california insurance guarantee association ciga.it does so on two grounds.the first is that the failure of the employer to furnish the employee applicant with the statutory notice of his right to proceed under the workers compensation law tolled running of the period within which a claim must be filed.see,subd.a,subd.a all further statutory citations are to this code.the second is that ciga conduct in failing to acknowledge coverage for the accident at issue estops it from asserting the limitations defense.based on the record before us and,more particularly the absence of a further record on the issue,i agree that we must uphold the ruling of the appeals board on estoppel.but i can not accept the conclusion of my colleagues that the limitations period continued to be tolled once the applicant attorney took action on his behalf before the appeals board hearing officer with respect to the claim at issue.
the basic facts are amply and fairly set out in the majority opinion.as pertinent here,they show that the applicant suffered an industrial injury in,for which he filed a timely workers compensation claim,and that he suffered another injury in for which he did not file a claim until.his employer never sent him the notification required by section.on august,at a hearing on the injury,the applicant attorney asked that the matter be continued so that he could file an amended application to assert a claim based on the injury.this request was granted,and the matter was taken off calendar so that the amended application could be filed.it was finally filed more than a year and later.both sides agree that the limitations period was tolled until the august hearing.the issues in this case are whether there was a tolling after that,and whether ciga is estopped to assert the statute of limitations.
estoppel due to conduct of ciga 
the order from which ciga prosecutes this appeal arose from a majority decision of the appeals board upholding the findings and award of the workers compensation judge.that decision and its affirmance by the appeals board were entirely based on estoppel against ciga for failing to admit coverage until shortly before the amended application was filed.the record we have is sparse as to how the applicant was prejudiced by ciga failure to acknowledge coverage.but what we have does not negative the existence of sufficient grounds to support an estoppel.as the majority points out,it is ciga burden,as the party seeking to overturn the final adjudication,to demonstrate that the decision is unsupported with respect to estoppel.ciga has failed to do so,an omission that compels affirmance of the appeals board order it attacks.it is for that reason that i concur in the majority opinion on estoppel against ciga,and the resulting adjudication affirming the order.
failure to provide notice of workers compensation rights 
in kaiser foundation hospitals workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,kaiser,our supreme court dealt with then recent changes in the workers compensation law with respect to limitations periods as they applied to the mandatory notification of rights to employees claiming injury.it held that failure to provide the notification results in a tolling of the limitations period until the applicant gains actual knowledge that he or she may be entitled to benefits under the workers compensation system,so long as the employee is prejudiced by the failure to give notice.prejudice is presumed from lack of notification.as the majority points out,the court used the phrase actual knowledge,in contrast to constructive knowledge,several times over the course of the opinion.from this,the majority concludes that knowledge by the applicant attorney can not be imputed to the applicant.
ciga advanced three theories why the tolling should have ended no later than the august,hearing.i agree with my colleagues that two of applicant receipt of bene
