the workers compensation appeals board wcab found that petitioner,honeywell,formerly known as allied signal aerospace company honeywell,was reasonably certain in that its employee,respondent william wagner,was psychiatrically injured or was claiming psychiatric injury under labor code section the wcab therefore determined that honeywell had a duty to provide a claim form under section which it failed to do.the wcab concluded that by honeywell breach of its duty to provide the claim form,the period to deny the injury under section began and expired without rejection of wagner claim as a result,his claimed psychiatric injury is presumed compensable.
section,subdivision a,however,expressly requires that an employer have notice or knowledge of injury under section or before the duty to provide a claim form is triggered the employer period in which to reject an employee claim does not even commence to run until the completed claim form has been filed with the employer in this case,the wcab has held that it is enough,in order to commence the running of the period,for the employer to simply be reasonably certain of the employee injury and to have failed to provide the required claim form.
the wcab had no legal authority to substitute reasonably certain for the statutory language enacted by the legislature.therefore,in the absence of a finding that honeywell was precluded under the doctrine of estoppel,from asserting that the period could not begin to run until it had been served with the completed claim form,the wcab could not properly find that the period had commenced to run at an earlier time.
we therefore annul the decision of the wcab.
factual and procedural background 
william wagner,a sheet metalist for honeywell for over years,claimed headaches and injuries to his psyche and skin due to employment from january,through october.
honeywell provided an medical clinic which recorded medical information reported by employees.wagner medical record dated july,indicates he informed the clinic that management was prejudiced against him and hampered his promotion and transfer.such record also reflects that wagner stated he could not take it anymore,his wife wanted him to quit due to stress,he had lost pounds,he was anxious and agitated and his doctor had prescribed medications for work stress.
on october,wagner was admitted into a psychiatric hospital,and his wife,linda wagner,called honeywell and left a message with the human resources disability coordinator,nyssa hawkins,to the effect that her husband had been hospitalized,and that his supervisor,mike rawlings,and others at work continued their head games and had pushed her husband over the edge linda wagner also related there was concern about her husband job and asked for disability forms.on october,hawkins phoned linda wagner to confirm receipt of a doctor note verifying disability,and that disability forms would be sent.
on or about january,wagner faxed to honeywell a medical leave request form,on which a box was checked that the injury was work related.in a letter to wagner dated january,linda wood,who was in personnel and handled workers compensation,wrote that she had received the information from the medical department and was enclosing a claim form and pamphlet explaining workers compensation.
on or about january,wagner retained an attorney and completed a claim form,which was served on honeywell on january.honeywell then denied the claim by letter of march.
in support of his injury claim,wagner obtained a medical report from his treating psychiatrist,thomas curtis,curtis diagnosed major depression with anxiety and panic attacks,which were industrial.curtis concluded that wagner had permanent mental impairment ranging from slight to slight to moderate,with a need for future medical care and vocational rehabilitation.
honeywell obtained a rebuttal medical opinion from psychologist,mory framer.framer concluded wagner psychiatric condition was caused by good faith personnel actions,and thus was not compensable or factors.
at trial,the matter was submitted to the workers compensation judge wcj without testimony in order to determine whether the injury should be presumed compensable under section.the wcj found that the period under section had ended on january,and the psychiatric injury was therefore presumed compensable unless rebutted by evidence not available by that date.the wcj explained that honeywell had sufficient information and notice as of july,to require provision of the claim form.even if that were not so,the very latest the claim form should have been provided by honeywell was following the contact with linda wagner on october.the wcj further stated that his decision was supported by principles of estoppel,citing zenith ins.cal.workers comp.rptr.or the duty that arose upon demand,citing janke state of.cal.workers comp.rptr.janke.
in janke,the employer and insurer refused to provide a claim form when requested by an employee who was claiming psychiatric injury.the employee retained an attorney as recommended by the insurer,and a completed claim form was served on the employer.the employer denied the claim within days of being served with the completed claim form.the wcab panel held,however,that the period allowed to the employer under section had already expired because it had commenced to run when the employer received knowledge of the injury claim and had deliberately refused to provide the claim form to the employee the wcab panel found such conduct to be egregious and stated that it would not allow claim procedures to be manipulated intentionally or negligently so as to extend the period in which a claim must be accepted or rejected.
in this case,honeywell filed for reconsideration with the wcab.it requested that the wcab issue an en banc decision resolving the issue as to whether the period begins before the claim form is filed with the employer,and if so,under what circumstances.honeywell argued that its denial of compensability under section was timely because it was within days of the date when the claim form was actually delivered by wagner.
honeywell also argued that there was no egregious conduct to justify estoppel as in janke.moreover,according to honeywell,actually supports the proposition that before the period can begin to run,the completed claim form must be filed with the employer.alternatively,honeywell contended that even if the period begins with knowledge of an injury or claim,the evidence in this case did not establish the requisite knowledge since were aware of the stresses documented in the medical records.finally,honeywell urged,the documentary evidence lacked foundation that an employee with sufficient authority had received or recorded the contacts with wagner and his wife.
in the report on reconsideration,the wcj recommended that the wcab affirm the decision en banc,because honeywell was twice placed on notice of the industrial injury or claim thus creating a duty to investigate and timely provide the claim form.
the wcab granted reconsideration and issued an en banc decision in wagner allied signal aerospace,wl wagner.it held that the period alternatively begins when an employer is reasonably certain of an industrial injury or claim and breaches the duty to provide the claim form,citing janke and thompson county of stanislaus cal.workers comp.rptr.no breach of duty to provide claim form because employer not reasonably certain of industrial injury or claim.the wcab further held that when the employer belatedly provides the claim form,the period is tolled until the completed claim form is filed by the employee.the wcab indicated it was persuaded by comments in janke that sections and were intended to encourage employers to promptly provide benefits or investigate claims,which should not be circumvented by the failure to provide the claim form.
the wcab rescinded the wcj decision and remanded the matter for application of the reasonably certain standard.the reasonably certain standard was basically defined as awareness of facts that would lead a reasonable person to conclude,with some certainty,rather than by guess or speculation,an industrial injury as set forth in section,subdivision a,had occurred or was being asserted.the wcab also remanded for the record to be further developed,if needed,to determine whether the employees involved had sufficient authority to impute notice or knowledge to honeywell.
the parties again proceeded to trial before the wcj.linda wagner testified regarding the messages she left at honeywell and her conversations with nyssa hawkins.hawkins testified that she was reasonably certain that linda wagner was reporting a work injury,which hawkins communicated to linda wood of personnel within a few days.wood denied that hawkins reported an injury concerning wagner,nor did wood recall being informed about a phone call from linda wagner.wood further testified that she would not provide a claim form if an injury was reported by a third party unless informed it was.wood also stated that she knew wagner had been hospitalized in october of,and although she heard from the medical department that he was out on stress,possibly due to events at work,he did not report an injury to her.
the wcj found that the period under section had expired on january.in the opinion,the wcj explained that hawkins,who was reasonably certain of the industrial injury,had reported it to wood and a claim form should have been provided no later than october.therefore,the psychiatric injury was presumed compensable.
honeywell filed for reconsideration by the wcab.honeywell alleged that the reasonably certain standard was contrary to the plain language of sections and,which also require that the claim form actually be filed with the employer in order for the period to begin.even if the reasonably certain standard is valid,argued honeywell,it was incorrectly applied because hawkins was not the proper person to receive notice of the injury or claim and wood testified she was not informed.honeywell also asserted that its conduct did not justify estoppel under janke.
in the report on reconsideration,the wcj added that wood admitted she knew that wagner was out on stress,possibly due to events at work.he also reasoned that hawkins was the disability coordinator and it was not an employee burden to ferret out the precise person,among many,to whom a claim should be made.
the wcab adopted the wcj findings and denied reconsideration.the wcab concluded that the legislative policy of encouraging prompt investigation and processing of claims was facilitated by applying the presumption of compensability where the employer is reasonably certain that an injury has occurred and fails to timely provide a claim form.
honeywell filed a petition for writ of review.we granted review and set the matter for oral argument 
contentions of the parties 
honeywell contends that the wcab application of the reasonably certain standard and presumption of compensability must be reversed because it violates the plain language of sections and.honeywell further argues that the wcab decision promotes compensability of psychiatric claims contrary to the legislature expressed intent in section,subdivision c honeywell adds that,absent evidence of egregious conduct as involved in janke,the imposition of a presumption of compensability is unnecessary because an employer failure to timely provide a claim form can be addressed by administrative disciplinary action including fines.see california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision d.
honeywell also asserts that wagner was not a final adjudication requiring appeal,because the wcab remanded to the wcj for a new decision whether honeywell was reasonably certain and the alleged injury should be presumed compensable.
wagner disputes each of these arguments and contends that the wagner decision finally decided application of the reasonably certain standard and the presumption of compensability,because these were threshold issues which were not timely appealed by honeywell 
wagner also analogizes the wcab application of the reasonably certain standard to the supreme court tolling of the statute of limitations for the employer failure to advise an injured employee of workers compensation rights.see reynolds,supra,cal d.wagner further contends that the wcab decision promotes the legislature policy of facilitating claims as expressed in scif.he asserts there is no requirement that the employer conduct be egregious,but rather the mere failure to provide required information to the uninformed employee is sufficient.wagner also argues that there is substantial evidence to support the wcj finding that honeywell was reasonably certain wagner had sustained injury,and a claim form was required.
finally,wagner requests attorney fees for answering a writ petition without a reasonable basis.see section.
discussion 
honeywell petition for writ of review is timely 
at the outset,we reject wagner argument that honeywell petition for writ of review is untimely because wagner was not appealed.
in maranian workers comp.appeals bd.th,d maranian,the wcab granted the employer petition for reconsideration and ordered the record more fully developed as to the date the claim form was received to establish the period under section.after additional evidence,the wcab reversed the wcj and determined that the injury claim was denied within the period.maranian appealed even though the only issue decided was that the presumption of compensability under section did not apply.
the court of appeal held that the question as to whether the presumption under section applies was itself a threshold issue because it was basic to maranian entitlement to benefits.maranian,supra,th at,d.the court also concluded that the wcab decision was appealable because it was a final determination that the presumption did not apply.however,the court distinguished as not appealable the wcab initial grant of reconsideration and remand for further development of the record,because the decision was not final as to whether section applied.maranian,supra,th at,d.
the same reasoning applies in this case.wagner was not a final,appealable decision.the wcab simply rescinded the wcj original decision and remanded the matter to determine whether the presumption of section applied under the reasonably certain standard,and for further development of the record.
standard of review 
interpretation of governing statutes is decided de novo by the appellate court,even though the wcab construction is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous.boehm associates workers comp.appeals bd.th,d williams workers comp.appeals bd.th,d ralphs grocery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.when interpreting a statute,the legislature intent should be determined and given effect.moyer workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,williams,supra,th at,d.the best indicator of legislative intent is the plain meaning of the statutory language,when clear and unambiguous.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,moyer,supra,cal d at,boehm,supra,th at,d williams,supra,th at,d.effect also should be given to the statute every word and clause,thereby leaving no part or provision useless,deprived of meaning or contradictory.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,moyer,supra,cal d at.finally,the statute should be interpreted consistently with its intended purpose,and harmonized within the statutory framework as a whole.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,webb,supra,cal d at.
the reasonably certain standard is inconsistent with the express statutory language of sections and 
in essence,it appears that the wcab has simply created the term reasonably certain,and substituted it for the statutory language notice or knowledge of injury under section or set forth in section,subdivision a.we find that the plain language of section,however,is a clear and unambiguous expression of legislative intent.dubois,supra,cal th at,d,moyer,supra,cal d at,boehm,supra,th at,d williams,supra,th at,d.the notice or knowledge that requires a claim form by the employer under section,subdivision a,is the written notice of injury in section,or the knowledge of injury or assertion of a claim of injury sufficient to afford the employer opportunity to make an investigation into the facts in section.this interrelated and detailed language indicates that the legisl
