in executing the standard preprinted form used to settle workers compensation claims,does an injured worker also release causes of action that are not exclusively subject to the workers compensation law or are not within the scope of that law the answer is no.those causes of action,however,may be the subject of a separate settlement and release.
from february until her resignation in september,carolyn claxton worked as an office assistant for defendant pacific maritime association pma.claxton supervisor was ray waters.
on december,claxton filed a claim with the workers compensation appeals board wcab against pma for an injury to her left lower extremity and psyche from a slip and fall on may.on january,claxton filed a second and separate workers compensation claim against pma for injury to psyche due to sexual harassment.
on september,claxton filed this civil action against pma and waters alleging,as relevant here,sexual harassment in violation of the fair employment and housing act,et.on november,defendants filed their answer to the complaint.
on february,claxton and pma settled the workers compensation claims for.as part of the settlement,claxton executed a preprinted compromise and release form wcab form.the use of this form is mandatory,tit.the form had only the case numbers for claxton two claims for workers compensation it made no reference to the pending civil action against pma and waters.
in preprinted paragraph,wcab form states upon approval of this compromise agreement by the workers compensation appeals board or a workers compensation judge and payment in accordance with the provisions hereof,said employee releases and forever discharges said employer and insurance carrier from all claims and causes of action,whether now known or ascertained,or which may hereafter arise or develop as a result of said injury,including any and all liability of said employer and said insurance carrier and each of them to the dependents,heirs,executors,representatives,administrators or assigns of said employee.
on march,a workers compensation judge approved the compromise and release.the order approving the settlement contained the case numbers for both of claxton workers compensation claims,but not the case number for the civil action.
thereafter,in the civil lawsuit alleging sexual harassment,defendants pma and waters moved in the superior court for leave to file an amended answer adding,among other things,an affirmative defense that the execution of the workers compensation compromise and release also extinguished claxton claims in her civil action against pma and waters.the court granted the motion.claxton then moved for summary adjudication of,among other things,the affirmative defense.
in support of that motion,claxton submitted declarations by herself and by the attorney who had represented her in the workers compensation proceedings.claxton declaration stated that she thought the workers compensation release related only to her knee injury and did not include her claim for damages in the civil action alleging sexual harassment by her employer,that the preprinted workers compensation release form said nothing about the settlement of her civil action alleging sexual harassment,and that she had not authorized her workers compensation attorney to settle her civil action.
the declaration of claxton workers compensation attorney stated that the workers compensation settlement was intended to cover only plaintiff knee injury claim and did not include the applicant claim for civil damages for injuries as a result of the sexual harassment which is the subject of her civil action against her employer the declaration pointed out that the preprinted release form had no reference to the pending civil action for sexual harassment,and said claxton had not authorized settlement of the civil lawsuit by means of the workers compensation compromise and release.
while claxton motion was pending in the superior court,defendants moved for summary judgment,asserting that in executing the workers compensation compromise and release form claxton extinguished any recovery for emotional distress damages in her civil lawsuit against defendants.
the trial court granted defendants motion for summary judgment,took plaintiff motion for summary adjudication off calendar as moot,and awarded defendants in attorney fees.
after a reversal by the court of appeal,we granted defendants petition for review.
california workers compensation scheme was developed early in the century as a result of the inadequacy of the common law that often denied injured workers any recovery for injuries.western indemnity pillsbury cal,see generally mathews workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,describing the history and development of california workers compensation law.
the workers compensation law applies to employee injuries arising out of and in the course of the employment when the statutorily specified conditions of compensation concur.generally,it is the exclusive remedy for such injuries,subd.a.but some claims,including those based on sexual or racial discrimination or other conduct contrary to fundamental public policy,are not subject to the exclusivity provisions of the workers compensation law.city of moorpark superior court cal th,d.thus,such claims may be the subject of both workers compensation proceedings and civil actions.id.at,d.for convenience,we will here refer to claims outside the workers compensation system as meaning claims that are either not within the scope of workers compensation law or not subject to the exclusivity provisions of that law.

the concerns just discussed are even stronger when the employer seeks to apply the standard preprinted workers compensation release language to claims outside the workers compensation scheme.of note here is the court of appeal decision in lopez sikkema d.lopez.there,the surviving family members of a worker shot and killed by strike breakers hired by the employer brought a civil lawsuit against the employer and the individuals that killed the worker,alleging personal injury,wrongful death,conspiracy to violate civil rights,and violation of civil rights.id.at.the employer moved for summary judgment on the ground that the standard workers compensation release executed by the family members barred the civil claims arising out of the worker death.the trial court granted the motion.
the court of appeal reversed.it noted that there was no evidence that civil claims were discussed in connection with the workers compensation settlement,and that there was nothing in the record to indicate that the workers compensation judge was aware of the civil action or had sufficient information to determine the desirability of releasing the civil claims or the adequacy of the compensation for approving such a release.lopez,supra,d at.in the words of the lopez court if the mandatory compromise and release form executed by appellants was intended to cover claims which are not compensable under the workers compensation act,it should have contained express language to that effect.id.at.
in asare hartford fire ins.th,d asare,the court of appeal took a similar view.there,the worker brought a civil action against his employer alleging racial discrimination.while that lawsuit was pending,the plaintiff executed a workers compensation compromise and release form.the trial court granted a defense motion for summary judgment,ruling that the compromise and release barred the civil action.the court of appeal reversed.the court considered it significant that the parties had separate counsel in the two proceedings that the release was negotiated by the workers compensation attorneys and,perhaps most importantly,that although the parties attorneys knew of the discrimination cause of action,there was no reference to it in the workers compensation release.id.at,d.
in yet another decision,delaney superior fast freight th,d delaney,the court of appeal rejected an attempt to extend the workers compensation release to bar causes of action outside the workers compensation system.there,an employee brought a civil lawsuit against his employer alleging employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.while the civil action was pending on appeal,the plaintiff worker and the employer settled his workers compensation claim.thereafter,the employer contended in the court of appeal that the workers compensation settlement barred the plaintiff worker civil claim for emotional distress.the court of appeal disagreed.it pointed out that the mandatory compromise and release form used in settling workers compensation claims was preprinted and made no specific reference to potentially independent civil rights or remedies.id.at,d.therefore,the court concluded,it may reasonably be understood as releasing only those claims which traditionally fall within the scope of the workers compensation system.ibid.
while this case was pending before us,yet another court of appeal decision addressed the issue of an employer attempt to extend a workers compensation release form to bar a civil lawsuit.in that case,mitchell union central life insurance company th,d mitchell,the employee sued her employer alleging sexual and racial discrimination in violation of the fair employment and housing act.she then filed a workers compensation claim alleging injury based on the same conduct as in her civil lawsuit.while an offer by the employer to settle the civil lawsuit for was outstanding,the parties settled the workers compensation claim for.id.at,d.after execution of the workers compensation release,the employer increased to its offer to settle the civil lawsuit.the plaintiff rejected the offer.id.at,d.the employer then moved for summary judgment in the civil action,arguing that the release in the workers compensation proceeding barred the civil action.id.at,d.the trial court granted the motion.id.at,d.
the court of appeal reversed.it relied on the decisions of the courts of appeal in lopez,supra,d,asare,supra,th,d,and delaney,supra,th,d.and it quoted this court observation in jefferson department of youth authority cal th,d,jefferson that the court of appeal decisions that have considered the issue have been consistent in their view that the preprinted language in a workers compensation compromise and release form should be narrowly construed to apply only to workers compensation claims.mitchell,supra,th at,d.in concluding that the evidence left no doubt that the workers compensation settlement was not intended to include the civil claims,the mitchell court noted that the plaintiff had different attorneys representing her in the different proceedings as here,and that there was no mention in the workers compensation release form of the pending civil lawsuit as here.id.at,d.
defendants insist,however,that in jefferson,supra,cal th,d,this court effectively disapproved the court of appeal decisions in delaney,supra,th,d,and in lopez,supra,d.they construe jefferson as holding that,in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,an employee execution of the preprinted workers compensation compromise and release form,with its standard language releasing all claims and causes of action,also releases claims that fall outside the workers compensation system.we disagree.
in jefferson,supra,cal th,d,the preprinted workers compensation compromise and release form had an attachment expressing the parties intent to have the release also apply to the employee civil action alleging sex discrimination.we held that the release did encompass the civil claims.our reasons were the attachment to the workers compensation release form clearly stated the parties intent to also settle claims outside the workers compensation law,and the plaintiff had not offered extrinsic evidence establishing the parties contrary intent.id.at,d.that is not the situation here.there is no attachment to the workers compensation release form here.and,contrary to defendants contention,jefferson did not disapprove the court of appeal decisions in delaney,supra,th,d,and in lopez,supra,d.w e need not consider whether lopez and delaney were correctly decided,and we neither approve nor disapprove their holdings.jefferson,supra,cal th at,d.
to summarize,we hold that the standard language of the preprinted form used in settling workers compensation claims releases only those claims that are within the scope of the workers compensation system,and does not apply to claims asserted in separate civil actions we turn now to the question of whether extrinsic evidence is admissible to show that the parties intended the release to also apply to claims outside the workers compensation system.
as discussed below,case law has allowed the use of evidence extrinsic to the language of the preprinted workers compensation compromise and release form to show whether the parties intended to also release claims outside the workers compensation system.
in a decision,sumner,supra,cal d at page,this court stated that a claim for death benefits,which fell within the workers compensation system,might be barred by the executed workers compensation release form if the employer could show that the parties did intend the release to include,as part of their settlement,a claim for death benefits.thereafter,however,the courts of appeal extended the use of extrinsic evidence to show whether the parties intended the release to include claims outside the workers compensation system.delaney,supra,th at,d asare,supra,th at,d lopez,supra,d at.
we are now convinced that extrinsic evidence should not be admissible to show that the standard preprinted workers compensation release form also applies to claims outside the workers compensation system.to allow such evidence would unduly burden our courts.illustrative of this point are the court of appeal decisions discussed earlier lopez,supra,d.asare,supra,th,d delaney,supra,th,d and mitchell,supra,th,d.in those cases,as here,the employer relied on standard language in the preprinted workers compensation release form as an affirmative defense in the worker civil lawsuit and later as the basis for a motion for summary judgment in that action.in each case,the appellate court determined that there were triable issues of fact as to whether the parties intended the workers compensation settlement to also apply to claims outside the workers compensation system,thus requiring further proceedings.this necessitated the presentation of evidence on that issue,and ultimately required resolution of disputed issues of fact as to what occurred in negotiations at the workers compensation proceedings.thus,allowing such extrinsic evidence would require our trial courts,which currently are under severe budgetary restraints,to expend their already scarce resources to divine and reconcile the parties intentions in signing a standard preprinted workers compensation release form.and parties too would have to spend time and money in presenting this evidence.
moreover,allowing such extrinsic evidence would create a trap for the unwary worker.it is highly unlikely that an injured employee settlement of a workers compensation claim,by signing the mandatory standard preprinted workers compensation release form,would alert the worker that the release also applies to claims outside the workers compensation system.to hold that the standard language of the release would also apply to the injured worker civil claims outside of the workers compensation scheme,regardless of whether a civil action has been filed at the time of the execution of the workers compensation release,would run counter to the public policy of protecting the injured worker against the unintentional loss of workers rights.jefferson,supra,cal th at,d,sumner,supra,cal d at,johnson workmen.bd.cal d.
to disallow such extrinsic evidence would not be unfair to the parties.it would be a simple matter for parties who have agreed to settle not only workers compensation claims but also claims outside the workers compensation system to execute another document expressing that agreement.thus,execution of the mandatory standard preprinted compromise and release form would only establish settlement of the workers compensation claims the intended settlement of claims outside the workers compensation system would have to be reflected in a separate document.see jefferson,supra,cal th,d,attachment to workers compensation form documented release of claims outside of workers compensation delaney,supra,th at,d parties should augment workers compensation form to expressly refer to release of claims outside of workers compensation.as is true with settlements in civil actions generally,the separate document need not identify precise claims it would be sufficient to refer generally to causes of action outside the workers compensation law in clear and language.sumner,supra,cal d at.
our holding changes existing law on the admissibility of evidence extrinsic to the workers compensation release to try to show that the release included causes of action outside the workers compensation system.lopez,supra,at.asare,supra,th at,d see sumner,supra,cal d at.we therefore must determine whether our holding should be applied retroactively or only prospectively.we now consider that question.
although as a general rule judicial decisions are to be given retroactive effect citation,there is a recognized exception when a judicial decision changes a settled rule on which the parties below have relied.citations.c onsiderations of fairness and public policy may require that a decision be given only prospective application.citations.particular considerations relevant to the retroactivity determination include the reasonableness of the parties reliance on the former rule,the nature of the change as substantive or procedural,retroactivity effect on the administration of justice,and the purposes to be served by the new rule.citations.smith law group cal th,d,accord,woods young cal d.
we conclude that our holding should apply only prospectively.the rule we are changing is one that parties in this and other cases may have relied on in settling claims.in particular,employers may have refrained from proposing and executing separate documents expressly releasing claims outside the workers compensation system because they were confident they could prove by extrinsic evidence a mutual intent to release such claims.our holding barring the admission of extrinsic evidence for this purpose has a substantive effect because it may,in individual cases,effectively alter the legal consequences of executing the standard compromise and release form.although barring the use of extrinsic evidence will preserve judicial resources,denying retroactive application will not unduly impact the administration of justice because it will merely permit a gradual and orderly transition accordingly,we conclude that considerations of fairness and public policy require prospective application,and that for any preprinted workers compensation settlement form executed before the finality of this decision see sumner,supra,cal d at,extrinsic evidence may be admitted to prove the parties intended to release claims outside the workers compensation system 
the judgment of the court of appeal is affirmed.
i agree with the majority decision to affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.but that is the only portion of the majority opinion with which i am in accord.in reaching the correct result,the to resist the bureaucratic propensity for and unnecessarily creates an exception to our rules of contract interpretation for a preprinted compromise and release form used in workers compensation cases.because i believe that generally applicable rules should govern here,i write separately.
under civil code section,a ll contracts,whether public or private,are to be interpreted by the same rules,except as otherwise provided by this code.our courts have consistently applied this maxim to releases and determined the scope of a release using our rules of contract interpretation.see,hess ford motor cal th,d,hess solis kirkwood resort th,d solis.indeed,we purportedly applied these rules to preprinted release forms used in workers compensation cases just two years ago in jefferson department of youth authority cal th,d,jefferson.
these rules provide that a contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting,so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.when a contract is reduced to writing,the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone,if possible.but w hen,through fraud,mistake,or accident,a written contract fails to express the real intention of the parties,such intention is to be regarded,and the erroneous parts of the writing disregarded.
the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense,rather than according to their strict legal meaning unless used by the parties in a technical sense,or unless a special meaning is given to them by usage,in which case the latter must be followed.if the terms of a promise are in any respect ambiguous or uncertain,it must be interpreted in the sense in which the promisor believed,at the time of making it,that the promisee understood it.moreover,a contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made,and the matter to which it relates.thus,a n ambiguity can be patent,arising from the face of the writing,or latent,based on extrinsic evidence.solis,supra,th at,d.and,if an ambiguity exists,extrinsic evidence may be admitted in interpreting the contract.winet price th,d winet.
although these rules govern all contracts absent a statutory provision to the contrary,the majority refuses to apply them.first,the majority ignores the language of the release see,and holds that the standard language of the preprinted form used in settling workers compensation claims releases only those claims that are within the scope of the workers compensation system,and does not apply to claims asserted in separate civil actions,ante,d at,at.second,it bars consideration of extrinsic evidence to show that the standard preprinted workers compensation release form also applies to claims outside the workers compensation system.id.at,at.
the majority,however,identifies no civil code or workers compensation statute that creates an exception to our rules of contract interpretation for preprinted release forms used in workers compensation cases.indeed,it provides no statutory basis for its holding,and my review of california law reveals no statutory support for this exception.as such,i see no legitimate ground for creating it.see.
the majority stated grounds for creating such an exception are not compelling.
likewise,the court of appeal cases cited by the sikkema d.lopez,asare hartford fire ins.th,d asare,delaney superior fast freight th,d delaney,and mitchell union central life ins.th,d mitchell are not persuasive.labor code former section,subdivision a,does not support the majority proposed exception to our rules of contract interpre
