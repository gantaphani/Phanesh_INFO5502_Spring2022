conwed corporation appeals the district court application of comparative fault to reduce conwed damages in its subrogation action to recover workers compensation benefits paid and payable to its employees.union carbide,claiming that the action was collaterally estopped,and that the court incorrectly included certain damages and erroneously dismissed its counterclaim for equitable contribution.we affirm in all but one respect.
conwed used asbestos purchased from union carbide to manufacture ceiling tiles.employees of conwed,a employer,contracted diseases,and conwed paid them workers compensation benefits.the employees also sued union carbide in tort based on a theory of product liability,and all of the employees entered into settlements with union carbide for damages not compensated through minnesota statute governing workers compensation.conwed then sued union carbide in subrogation,seeking recovery for the workers compensation benefits that were paid and payable,benefits paid.union carbide counterclaimed for contribution and indemnity.the district court certified five questions to the supreme court of minnesota,and after receiving guidance on certain matters of state law,conwed union carbide chemicals plastics,the district court proceeded to try the claims.
the court divided the claims into three disease groups and then tried the first group,consisting of mesothelioma claims.the first trial resulted in a jury verdict for union carbide.conwed agreed to a dismissal of claims for the employees in the second disease group lung cancer,and the parties then tried the consolidated claims of eleven employees with a third disease,asbestosis,in a bifurcated trial.the jury found both conwed and union carbide at fault for causing injuries to six of those employees,and awarded common law damages,including general disability and loss of future earning capacity.
in accordance with tyroll private label chemicals,a special master determined the amount of benefits paid and payable by conwed to the employees.the district court reviewed and partially adopted the special master findings,and determined the amount of subrogation damages to which conwed was entitled the lesser of the amount of benefits actually paid and payable through workers compensation or the percentage of the jury award of damages attributable to union carbide fault.for five of the six employees,the amount of workers compensation benefits paid and payable was less than the tort damages attributable to union carbide,so the court reduced the amount of benefits paid by the percentage of fault attributable to conwed.for the sixth employee,the tort damages attributable to union carbide were less than the benefits paid,so the court reduced the tort damages attributable to union carbide by conwed percentage of fault.the remaining asbestosis claims were stayed pending the appeal.
conwed appeals,claiming that the district court improperly applied the jury common law allocation of fault to the benefits paid and payable to determine conwed subrogation award.conwed argues that the court instead should have applied the allocation of fault only to the common law damages determined by the jury,and then awarded as subrogation damages the lesser of the resulting common law damages amount or the amount of the workers compensation benefits paid and payable.union carbide,arguing that the second jury trial was barred by collateral estoppel,because the issue of whether union carbide warnings regarding its asbestos were adequate already had been conclusively established in the first trial concerning mesothelioma.alternatively,if the action was not barred,union carbide claims the district court improperly allowed the jury to award disability damages,damages for loss of future earning capacity,and damages for the predicted progression of existing conditions.the district court denied union carbide claim against conwed for equitable contribution to offset the jury award of subrogation damages,and union carbide appeals that decision as well.
we address first whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred the second jury trial.in the first trial concerning mesothelioma,the district court provided the jury with a special verdict form.the first question asked,was the calidria asbestos union carbide sold to conwed in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the users of that asbestos because union carbide failed to provide adequate warnings and instructions for the safe use of that asbestos if the jury answered in the affirmative,the verdict form then asked whether the defective condition of union carbide asbestos was a direct cause of mesothelioma in each of the six employees,whether conwed was negligent with respect to the safety of the workers,and what amount of money would compensate the employees.the jury instructions accompanying the first question directed the jury as follows 
in deciding whether the manufacturer warnings and instructions were reasonably adequate,consider all the facts and circumstances,including,among others the likelihood that harm would result from use of the product the seriousness of the harm that would result the cost and ease of providing warnings and instructions that would avoid the harm.
instructions to the jury doc,at.the jury answered no to the first question on the verdict form,and,in accordance with the instructions,did not answer the remaining questions.
union carbide argues that the jury negative answer to this first question precludes conwed from challenging the adequacy of union carbide warnings in the second jury trial concerning employees affected with asbestosis.the district court held that despite the broad language of the first question,because the employee claims were grouped by disease and the jury was instructed to consider all the facts and circumstances,the jury reasonably could have assumed that the harm described in the jury instructions was limited to mesothelioma.the district court noted that conwed did not present all of its evidence with respect to claims involving lung cancer or asbestosis,and held that union carbide had not met its burden of showing that the issue of the adequacy of union carbide warnings with respect to mesothelioma plaintiffs was identical to the issues to be determined in the remaining claims by employees afflicted with different diseases.the court further held that that conwed did not have a fair opportunity to litigate the adequacy of the warnings with respect to the claims of employees not before the first jury.we agree with the district court that conwed is not collaterally estopped from litigating the adequacy of union carbide warnings with respect to asbestosis,because this issue was not necessarily determined in the first trial.

issue identity requires the party asserting it to establish that the precise question was in fact presented and necessarily determined by the verdict in the former trial.brooks realty,aetna ins.a determination of the identical issue must be necessarily implied in the verdict of the earlier action.gollner cram.minnesota courts do not apply collateral estoppel rigidly,but instead focus on whether an injustice will be worked upon the party upon whom estoppel is urged.nelson am.family ins.group.union carbide claims that because the jury special verdict form separated the question of the adequacy of the warnings from the question of whether union carbide asbestos caused mesothelioma,the jury negative answer to the first question necessarily implies that it found the warnings adequate with respect to all potential hazards.
as noted,the district court divided the cases into three trial groups based on the type of injury claimed mesothelioma,asbestosis,or lung cancer.conwed was required to assert and prove separate claims for each of its former employees,and the divided trial structure limited the evidence presented in the first trial largely to the disease of mesothelioma.
the arguments of counsel likewise focused on mesothelioma,and suggested that whether the asbestos caused mesothelioma was part of the analysis in determining whether the warnings were adequate.in closing argument,union carbide argued that it was not fair to criticize its product warnings for failing to warn that the asbestos may cause mesothelioma,because there was any scientific basis for saying that calidria could cause mesothelioma.closing arg.tr.at.conwed similarly urged the jury to consider the likelihood that harm would result from use of the product when evaluating the adequacy of the warnings,and equated harm with mesothelioma once you have got mesothelioma it is incurable,you going to die.this harm is as bad as it can be.closing arg.tr.at.
union carbide argues that under the jury instructions in the first trial,the question whether asbestos was likely to cause mesothelioma was relevant only if the jury first found that the product warnings were inadequate.we are not persuaded,however,that the questions of adequate warnings and causation were wholly independent.the jury instructions contained ambiguities.by incorporating the likelihood that harm would result from the use of asbestos into the question whether warnings were adequate,the broadly worded instruction on warnings permitted a reasonable jury to conclude that warnings were adequate because the asbestos was not likely to cause the harm that was the subject of the first.both parties addressed the adequacy of warnings by debating whether the warnings were sufficient to inform users of the dangers of contracting mesothelioma.thus,viewing the jury instructions as a whole in the context of the trial,we conclude that the first jury verdict did not necessarily imply that union carbide warnings were adequate for all purposes,including to warn against the possible harm of asbestosis.therefore,the doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar the second trial.
the remaining issues relate to whether the district court correctly determined workers compensation subrogation damages under minnesota law.we review questions of state law de novo.salve regina coll.russell,d.
conwed argues that the district court misapplied the jury allocation of fault and incorrectly calculated its subrogation award.in minnesota,workers compensation claims are regulated by statute.if an employee elects to receive benefits from his or her employer,the employer has a right of indemnity against any tortfeasor whose action many have contributed to the employee injury,subd.any recovery against the third party is divided according to a procedure.after collection costs are deducted,one third of the remainder belongs to the injured employee without any right of subrogation by the employer.out of the remaining balance,the employer is reimbursed the amount of workers compensation benefits paid,less a proportionate share of the collection costs.any amount remaining is paid to the employee and is a credit against any benefits the employer is obligated to pay in the future,subd.
if the employer is apportioned any fault,the liable tortfeasor may assert a right of contribution against the employer in an amount proportional to the employer fault,but not to exceed the amount of benefits paid and payable by the employer.lambertson cincinnati.this contribution claim is essentially an equitable against the employer recovery of workers compensation benefits paid from the tortfeasor.
instead of proceeding with a trial,the employee also may choose to settle with the tortfeasor for all claims outside of the workers compensation scheme and thus not subject to the employer subrogation claim.in minnesota,such a settlement is known as a naig settlement,based on the decision in naig bloomington sanitation,which described the process.after a naig settlement,the employer may still assert a subrogation claim to recover workers compensation benefits paid and payable from the tortfeasor,but the employee gives up his or her statutory right to of any recovery.id.at.the employer also has no liability to contribute to the settlement agreement between the employee and the tortfeasor.kempa coons.
once an employee has entered into a naig settlement with the tortfeasor,the employer steps into the shoes of the employee and asserts a subrogation claim in tort against the third party to recover benefits paid.this subrogation recovery is not subject to the statutory formula,and is limited to the type of compensatory damages awarded under workers compensation.tyroll,at.the district court holds a hearing to determine the amount of benefits paid and payable,and any tort damages the employer recovers in the subrogation action apply to this amount.if the tort damages exceed the amount of workers compensation benefits paid and payable,then the employer maximum recovery is limited to the benefits paid and payable.if the tort damages are less,the employer may only recover the amount of the jury verdict.id.
minnesota courts,however,have not indicated how the jury allocation of fault to the employer applies to this determination of subrogation damages following a naig settlement.the supreme court of minnesota in tyroll stated that u nder this method,comparative fault when an issue may diminish or defeat liability for the subrogation claim.at.but because the jury in tyroll did not find the employer negligent,the court had no occasion to indicate precisely how the employer fault would diminish the subrogation damages.id.at.
union carbide entered into a naig settlement with the employees.conwed then proceeded against union carbide to recover subrogation damages,and the court appointed a special master to determine the amount of benefits paid.in the second phase of the bifurcated asbestosis trial,however,the jury found both conwed and union carbide liable for causing injuries to six employees,and apportioned fault to both companies.conwed fault ranged from to percent,while union carbide fault ranged from to percent.none of the six employees was found to be at fault.the district court held that the allocation of fault should apply to the lesser of the benefits paid or the percentage of common law tort damages attributable to union carbide.it adopted a procedure,under which the court first determined the employer subrogation damages the lesser of the benefits paid and payable as determined in the hearing or the percentage of the jury award attributable to union carbide fault.the court then reduced the total subrogation damages proportionately by the percentage of fault attributable to conwed and entered judgment against union carbide in this amount.
conwed disagrees with this method.it contends that the jury allocation of fault should reduce the jury award of damages first,and then the lesser of this reduced verdict or the benefits paid should be the amount of the judgment.conwed urges that under kempa and tyroll,the employer subrogation damages must be recovered out of the common law tort damages for which the third party tortfeasor is first found responsible.tyroll,at.because the jury allocation of fault is part of the common law jury verdict,conwed argues,it should be applied to the verdict first.this reduced verdict,in conwed model,may be recovered up to the cap of benefits paid.
union carbide relies on a competing principle in minnesota law,namely,that tortfeasors should not be forced to bear the costs o
