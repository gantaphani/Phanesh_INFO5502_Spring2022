factual background 
tessan swartz swartz seeks review of the denial of her workers compensation claim.at the time of her injury,swartz was an employee of mcdonald corporation mcdonald.although swartz lived in orlando,she commuted to tampa for training as a human resources consultant,a position she assumed in december.swartz filed an initial worker compensation claim on september,which,in combination with petitions filed february,and february,was heard on april.at the workers compensation hearing,barbara lenco,a human resource consultant in the tampa office,testified concerning her employment duties.those duties included interviewing,hiring,and recruiting management personnel for mcdonald.carolyn jones,the human resource manager,corroborated lenco testimony.
the job requires consultants to travel to various events,including job fairs.as part of her training,swartz accompanied lenco to various functions.when traveling,consultants utilize a company car,and mcdonald subsidizes the gas payments.according to jones,to of swartz time was spent in the tampa office,and was outside of the office.when a trainee becomes a human resource consultant,such as lenco,that percentage would change to of the time in the field and of the time in the office.if nothing was planned outside the tampa office,the consultant would report to the tampa office.if,however,an event was scheduled,the consultant could commute directly to the site.although the standard business hours for the tampa office were from to,swartz had no fixed hours of employment.
at job fairs,consultants set up booths that indicate mcdonald presence at the event.as swartz testified,the booth is an integral part of attending job fairs because it easily identifies employers.once the consultants open up the booth,they attach a which displays the name of the company and pictures of mcdonald employees who have been recruited.the booth is stored in the stockroom in the tampa office.it is unrefuted that the consultant is responsible for transporting the booth from tampa to the site of the job fair.
on friday,march,swartz and lenco attended a regional meeting in tampa,which was scheduled by the regional vice president.on march,swartz and lenco were scheduled to attend a job fair in orlando.after the tampa meeting and before leaving for orlando,swartz checked her voice mail,picked up short term disability paperwork that she was going to deliver to someone in orlando,and spoke with lenco concerning the job fair in orlando that following monday.swartz and lenco loaded part of the booth into lenco vehicle,along with some recruitment information for the job fair.swartz placed part of the booth in her back seat because it did not fit in lenco car.
swartz testified that in order for her to bring the booth to any job fair,she would have to go to tampa to pick up the booth,unless she was picking it up from another consultant.swartz also testified that she was expected to bring the booth,and there were no other alternative arrangements.jones,lenco,and jill wolf,a human resource coordinator,all confirmed that the transport of the booth was one of swartz employment duties.jones further testified that job fairs typically require of the booth.
after swartz loaded the recruitment booth in her car,she left the tampa office and started driving to orlando,but was on the highway around.after contacting other supervising employees,swartz went to the hospital where she received treatment and returned home.swartz returned to work that monday and attended the scheduled job fair.swartz and lenco brought and assembled the booth,placed the printed materials on the background,and set up the table with the literature they needed to distribute.
as of may,swartz doctor advised her that she could not continue to drive,due to injuries sustained in the accident,and that she could not undertake any prolonged sitting.swartz continued to work for mcdonald until june,at which time she resigned.according to swartz,she resigned because her physical condition no longer permitted her to continue working.she experienced spasms,fainting,and headaches,and could no longer tolerate the travel necessary for her job.
procedural history 
after swartz filed a petition for workers compensation benefits,mcdonald denied the claim,contending that the accident did not arise out of and in the course and scope of her employment.after a hearing,the judge of compensation claims jcc made several findings in a june,order.as a threshold matter,the jcc found that attending the regional meeting in tampa did not expose swartz to additional travel risks,and there was no special trip involved in attending the meeting.rather,swartz had received prior notice of the meeting for scheduling purposes to ensure that she could attend.in addition,the jcc rejected swartz contention that her delivery of disability forms to another hospitalized employee constituted an employment duty.instead,the jcc concluded that swartz was merely doing a personal favor for a friend,in light of swartz delivery of the forms several days after the accident and the employee departure from mcdonald normal procedure for requesting human resource forms.the jcc further concluded that the accident was not compensable because swartz was merely returning home,not performing an employment duty.as such,swartz claim was barred by the going and coming rule.the jcc further opined that swartz transport of the booth did not transform her trip into a compensable event.on the contrary,swartz made no special trip to tampa to secure the booth,her journey was regular and frequent,not prompted by a sudden request from her employer,and her transport of the booth was minor when viewed in light of her other employment responsibilities and route home.
swartz appealed the jcc decision to the first district court of appeal.the first district affirmed on all issues,but addressed only one in its written opinion whether swartz transport of the recruitment booth transformed her trip home into a compensable event.see swartz,so d at.the court held that swartz accident did not fall within the ambit of the special errand or mission exception to the going and coming rule.see id.at.the court noted that swartz was merely performing a minimal job duty,and that her trip on the day of the accident was not made pursuant to a request by her employer.id.in so doing,the court distinguished schoenfelder winn jorgensen,so d dca,in which the court held that the accident was a compensable event where he was struck by a vehicle before getting in his car to drive to a deposition.in contrasting the two cases,the court noted the claimant in schoenfelder established that travel to various locations was a necessary part of his job,and that he was not simply commuting,but was within the time and place of his employment at the time of his injury.id.
the first district also held that swartz accident did not fall within the parameters of the dual purpose doctrine.see swartz,so d at.in articulating the scope of the doctrine,the court stated that the business purpose must involve the performance of a service essential to the business of the employer such that the travel would be required to be undertaken by someone on the employer behalf if it had not coincided with the claimant personal journey.id.in interpreting nikko gold coast cruises gulliford,so d,the first district concluded that the focus should not simply be on whether the travel might have included an incidental employment responsibility,but rather whether the concurrently undertaken task is so important to the business of the employer that the trip would have been required in any event.id.at.the first district also interpreted this court precedent as adopting judge cardozo rationale in marks dependents gray,which reiterated that t o establish liability,the inference must be permissible that the trip would have been made though the private errand had been canceled.swartz,so d at quoting marks dependents,at.the court concluded that swartz was not performing a necessary or essential part of her employment duties.see id.in so doing,it recognized that mcdonald could have participated in the job fair without the booth,and that a special trip to procure the booth would not have been required if swartz failed to bring it.see id.the court further stated,merely carrying paraphernalia or tools of her employment does not convert the claimant trip from personal to employment travel.id.
the dissent stated,however,that the record clearly established that transporting the booth was a business purpose.see id.benton,dissenting.as such,swartz had both a business and personal purpose when driving home on the day of the accident,thereby satisfying the requirements of the dual purpose doctrine.see id.at.the dissent further stated that someone would have been required to transport the booth to the job fair,and that transporting the booth was not merely a minimal job duty.see id.at.judge benton also opined that the statutory codification of the going and coming rule did not abrogate the dual purpose exception.see id.at.the dissent further recognized that the majority decision conflicted with both nikko and cook,in which the court held that the business purpose need only be a concurrent,not dominant,purpose.see id.at.thereafter,swartz sought review of the first district decision,and this court accepted jurisdiction based on express and direct conflict with nikko and cook.
generally,claimants injuries must arise out of and in the course of their employment to be compensable.the going and coming rule provides that injuries sustained while traveling to or from work do not arise out of and in the course of employment and,therefore,are not compensable.see bechtel constr.lehning,so d dca george woodville lumber,so d,dca.stat.this rule governing compensability of workers compensation claims is codified in section,florida statutes.section provides 
an injury suffered while going to or coming from work is not an injury arising out of and in the course of employment whether or not the employer provided transportation if such means of transportation was available for the exclusive personal use by the employee,unless the employee was engaged in a special errand or mission for the employer.
stat.the applicability of the going and coming rule,along with its exceptions,depends upon the nature and circumstances of the particular employment,and no exact formula can be laid down which will automatically solve every case.see sweat allen,so,superseded on other grounds by,ch,laws of.
despite the broad application of the going and coming rule,section delineates several exceptions because the term dual purpose doctrine does not appear in section,the respondents question whether the statutory phrase special errand or mission incorporates both the special errand exception and the dual purpose doctrine.the special errand exception includes employees who,at the time of injury,were on a special errand in response to a call from their employers,and is usually characterized by irregularity and suddenness.see eady medical personnel pool,so d.the dual purpose doctrine provides that an injury which occurs as the result of a trip,a concurrent cause of which was a business purpose,is within the course and scope of employment,even if the trip also served a personal purpose,such as going to and coming from work.see nikko,so d at.
swartz contends that the language special errand or mission retains the dual purpose doctrine because the only way to reconcile the special errand and dual purpose lines of cases is to conclude that there is a distinct difference between special errand and mission.to buttress this argument,swartz emphasizes that the statutory language uses or,instead of and,thereby recognizing a distinction between the two words.
mcdonald,by contrast,asserts that the statute reference to special errand or mission does not incorporate the dual purpose doctrine.mcdonald further contends that the maxim expressio unius est exclusio mention of one thing is the exclusion of that since the dual purpose doctrine does not appear within one of the exceptions specified in the statute,the court can not infer that the legislature intended that exception to remain operative.
we conclude,based on the prior usage of the terms,that the special errand or mission language contained in the statute encompasses both the special errand and the dual purpose exceptions to the going and coming rule.although the special errand exception and the dual purpose doctrine can be applied independent of each other,they have also become interconnected in caselaw.in determining whether to apply the special errand exception,courts consider various factors,including the relative burden of the journey on the employee in light of his or her employment duties,the irregularity of the timing and nature of the journey,the suddenness of the employer request,the time and length of the journey,and any other special circumstances.see eady,so d at.applying these factors,the court in el viejo arco iris,luaces,so d dca,held that an employee trip home,after picking up plumbing supplies at the request of his employer,did not fall within the special errand exception because his journey was regular and frequent,the employer request was not sudden,the burden of the request was minor in light of his route home,and he had already completed the employer request at the time of the accident.in new dade apparel,de lorenzo,so d,dca,the court held that an injured employee who returned early from vacation to work at the special request of his employer fell within the special errand exception.in determining compensability,the court recognized that irregularity and suddenness were essential elements of the special errand exception.see also eady,so d at as a practical matter,the irregularity and suddenness of a call from the employer will almost always qualify it as a special errand exempt from the going and coming rule.susan loverings figure salon mcrorie,so d dca.
despite the fact that the special errand exception can be an independent basis for finding an injury compensable under the workers compensation laws,several cases applying this exception have also used this exception when referring to the dual purpose doctrine.for example,in spartan food systems hopkins,so d dca,the court concluded that the special errand exception applied to an employee who received a sudden call requiring her to pick up supplies and was injured after she resumed her normal route to work.in determining whether to apply the special errand exception,the court concluded that the concurrent business and personal purposes rendered the employee trip compensable.see id.at.in so doing,it applied the dual purpose doctrine to buttress its conclusion that the employee fell within the special errand exception.similarly,in moore sons wadkins,so d,dca,the court explained the special errand exception by noting that concurrent personal and business purposes may establish liability.in so doing,the court did not distinguish between the special errand and dual purpose exceptions.likewise,in tampa airport hilton hotel hawkins,so d dca,the court simultaneously applied special errand and dual purpose principles,noting that because the employee was responding to a request by her employer,and she had both business and personal purposes,she fell within an exception to the going and coming rule.
nevertheless,other cases apply the dual purpose doctrine without regard to the special errand exception in nikko,the employee had been taking cash home and returning it to the store for several years.there was no finding of suddenness and irregularity,as is required to trigger the special errand exception.nonetheless,we applied the dual purpose doctrine to determine compensability.similarly,in cook,the employees were performing business duties,but not in response to a sudden or irregular request.in determining whether the employees injuries were compensable,we merely discussed the existence of both business and personal purposes,and did not discuss factors typifying special errand cases.thus,cook,like nikko,involved a straightforward application of the dual purpose doctrine.in krause west lumber,so d,we applied the dual purpose doctrine to provide compensation without discussing the special errand exception.see also hages hughes,so d dca applying dual purpose rationale to facts not involving suddenness or irregularity.
in short,the foregoing cases indicate that the special errand exception and dual purpose doctrine can operate either in tandem or independently.as mcdonald correctly points out,in some cases courts have used the phrases special errand and special errand or mission interchangeably in cases that were exclusively applying the special errand exception.see eady,so d at new dade apparel,so d at susan loverings,so d at gray dade county school,so d dca.nevertheless,other courts have used that term when concomitantly applying both the special errand exception and the dual purpose doctrine.see spartan,so d at moore,so d at tampa airport hilton,so d at.indeed,the application of these exceptions is often dependent upon similar principles.consequently,the varied use of the phrase special errand or mission clearly indicates that the statute incorporates both the special errand exception and the dual purpose doctrine.our conclusion renders resort to other interpretive aids suggested by the parties unnecessary.
in light of our conclusion that the dual purpose doctrine still exists,we must determine whether it is applicable in the present case.this court first addressed whether dual purpose trips were compensable in cook,noting that the rule in marks dependents was the prevailing authority on this issue.see cook,so d at.the marks dependents rule provided,in part,that t o establish liability,the inference must be permissible that the trip would have been made though the private errand had been canceled.id.quoting marks dependents,at.we further recognized that in applying this rule,some courts required that the business purpose be the dominant purpose,but other courts merely required that the business motive be a concurrent cause of the trip.see id.at.we ultimately concluded the latter formulation was a approach and more in keeping with the remedial purpose of the workmen compensation statute.accordingly,we rejected the more stringent rule articulated in marks dependents.see id.as a result,we agreed with the mississippi court in brookhaven steam laundry watts,so d,rev on other grounds,so d when we said no nice inquiry will be made to determine the relative importance of a concurrent business and personal motive.so long as the business purpose is at least a concurrent cause of the trip,the employer may be held liable for workmen compensation.cook,so d at.
after cook,we reiterated its basic principle,that a court need only find a current business and personal purpose for the journey,in krause and levine builders alum.stone,so d.thereafter,in nikko we outlined the parameters of a sufficient concurrent cause for dual purpose trips and distinguished united states fidelity guaranty rowe,so d,which involved an employee who was injured in an accident while carrying money belonging to her employer.in so doing,we noted that the employee in rowe did not have an understanding with her employer regarding a storage place for the money,was not required to return the money the next day,was not performing a duty that was necessary,or even helpful,to the operation of the employer business,and was not paid overtime or reimbursed for the cost of transporting the money.see nikko,so d at.in contrast,the employee in nikko had a clear understanding with his employer regarding the arrangements for safeguarding the money,performed a task that was essential to the employer business,and received compensation for transporting the money.see id.in effect,our analysis identified factors relevant to whether a purported business motive is a sufficient concurrent cause to satisfy the dual purpose doctrine.moreover,we reaffirmed our rejection of the marks dependents rule,stating,we find that under the instant facts the inference would be permissible that the trip would have been made even if gulliford had not intended to go to work that day.therefore,even under the more strict rule of marks,which we rejected in cook,liability has been established.nikko,so d at.
in determining the applicability of the going and coming rule,several courts have also relied on larson treatise on workers compensation,which elucidates the dual purpose doctrine.larson explains that the marks dependents court defined concurrent cause as a cause which would have occasioned the making of the trip even if the private mission had been cancelled.arthur larson lex larson,larson workers compensation law,at.larson further explains 
i t is not necessary,under this formula,that,on failure of the personal motive,the business trip would have been taken by this particular employee at this particular time.it is enough that someone sometime would have had to take the trip to carry out the business mission.perhaps another employee would have done it perhaps another time would have been chosen but if a special trip would have had to be made for this purpose,and if the employer got this necessary item of travel accomplished by combining it with this employee personal trip,it is accurate to say that it was a concurrent cause of the trip,rather than an incidental appendage or afterthought.
once this test is satisfied,there is no occasion to weigh the business and personal motives to determine which is dominant.
id.footnotes omitted.larson further indicates that the question becomes was the business mission of such character or importance that it would have necessitated a trip by someone if this employee had not been able to handle it in combination with the homeward journey id,at.
according to mcdonald,the concurrent cause test inquires whether someone,at some time,would have had to make the trip in order to accomplish the business mission if this particular claimant failed to do so.to this end,mcdonald asserts that courts must assess the necessity and essentiality of the task to determine whether the concurrent cause test is satisfied,as evidenced by nikko and cases from other jurisdictions.interestingly,swartz does not contest mcdonald formulation of the concurrent cause standard.rather,swartz contends that the transport of the booth satisfies this test.however,swartz asserts the jcc finding that transport of the booth imposed a minor burden in light of swartz route home was erroneous as a matter of law because courts can not weigh the employee business and personal motives.
as a threshold matter,we must resolve the ambiguity concerning the proper test to apply.in cook,we expressly rejected the marks dependents rule,which required that the trip would have been made even though the private errand had been canceled.see cook,so d at.larson explains that this rule means that some employee,at some time,would have had to make the journey to accomplish the business mission.both mcdonald and swartz cite larson definition of the concurrent cause test.however,we have previously rejected the marks dependents rule in cook.
in cook,we held that only concurrent purposes were necessary to satisfy the dual purpose doctrine.see id.at.in so doing,we interpreted the marks dependents rule as inquiring into the dominant purpose of the trip,although larson asserts that this is an erroneous construction.larson maintains that a sufficient business motive exists when the trip would have been made by someone at some time and,once this test is satisfied,courts should not weigh the relative importance of the personal and business motives.in effect,we concluded in cook that the marks dependents inquiry necessarily requires courts to weigh the business and personal purposes.moreover,in nikko we articulated factors constituting a sufficient business purpose while simultaneously reaffirming our rejection of the marks dependents rule.we accepted jurisdiction because the fi
