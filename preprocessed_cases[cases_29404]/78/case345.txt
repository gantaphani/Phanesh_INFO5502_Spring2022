petitioner marinwood fire protection district,also known as marinwood community services,marinwood,seeks to set aside the decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab holding that firefighter pete romo was entitled to the benefit of the rebuttable presumption under labor code section that his cancer arose out of his employment.the writ raises two legal issues of interpretation of workers compensation statutes.while our review of such issues is de novo,in light of the wcab expertise we give weight to its interpretations of workers compensation statutes unless they are clearly erroneous or unauthorized.brodie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th.while neither of the statutes at issue is a model of clarity,the wcab interpretations of both are reasonable and we therefore affirm the wcab decision.
background 
romo worked as a firefighter for three different fire departments.he was a volunteer firefighter for marinwood from to and the san antonio volunteer fire district in sonoma county san antonio from to.from through trial,he was employed full time as a paid firefighter for the city of mill valley mill valley.while working for mill valley,romo was diagnosed with prostate cancer 
marinwood was established in the as an fire department.by the,it had a paid fire chief and two paid professional firefighters for each shift.at the time romo was a volunteer firefighter there,marinwood had a total of seven paid firefighters and volunteer firefighters.
when romo was serving as a volunteer firefighter for marinwood,he fought multiple fires,participated in mandatory weekly drill nights and was required to live within a certain distance from the firehouse,keep certain gear in his car or bedroom,and keep a paging device with him so he could be paged when needed for a fire.marinwood provided him with a thick coat,pants,a hood,a helmet,goggles,boots and gloves.
romo and other volunteers also worked at the fire station,cleaning equipment,refueling tools,sweeping and mopping.volunteers were considered on duty all the time and were required to respond to percent of the calls.marinwood paid for him and other volunteers to obtain training and certification in cpr and basic life support.marinwood also trained him on fire suppression for different kinds of fires and on other subjects,such as bleeding control,rope rescue and vehicle extrication.
volunteer positions with marinwood were sought after by those who wanted to become firefighters,and the hiring process was competitive.if a volunteer failed to meet the demands of the position,he would be counseled and,if that failed,terminated.volunteers did most of the firefighting work while romo was there,taking direction from the company officer.
marinwood fire captain and training officer considers the volunteer firefighters to be employees.when they go on a call,members of the public do not know whether they are volunteers or paid.marinwood currently provides workers compensation benefits for volunteers 
romo filed a claim for workers compensation benefits with each of the three fire departments for which he had worked.mill valley and san antonio stipulated that the statutory presumption that cancer suffered while employed as a firefighter arises out of the employment would apply to them if the elements set forth in section were proven.marinwood contested the application of the presumption.two issues pertaining to marinwood were tried before a workers compensation judge wcj in september whether romo was an employee volunteer firefighter of marinwood entitled to workers compensation benefits under sections,subdivision i,and health and safety code section whether the presumption under section applies against marinwood where romo was not a public safety employee from the time he stopped volunteering at marinwood sometime between and and the year,which is more than months following the date he last worked for marinwood.
after receiving trial briefs,hearing testimony from romo and marinwood fire captain john bagala and admitting various exhibits,the wcj issued findings of fact and an order.she concluded that romo was an active volunteer firefighting member of marinwood from to early within the meaning of labor code sections and and that he is entitled to the extension of the presumption under labor code section,since he is within months of the last date actually worked in the specified capacity.
seeking reconsideration of the wcj decision by the wcab,marinwood argued it was not a regularly organized volunteer fire department within the meaning of section,and thus that firefighters who volunteered for it were not employees for workers compensation statutes under that statute and that the extension of the presumption under section began to run as to marinwood on the date romo last worked for marinwood.the wcj recommended against reconsideration,on the ground,among others,that marinwood had waived the first argument by failing to assert it until after trial.she also opined that the evidence supported a finding that marinwood was a regularly organized volunteer fire department,because the fire chief had testified it was a combination department and it had far more volunteers than paid staff.she again interpreted section to extend the presumption from the last day worked by a firefighter in the capacity as such,not the last day worked for a particular employer.
in january,the wcab denied marinwood motion for reconsideration,b ased on our review of the record,and for the reasons stated in the wcj report,which we adopt and incorporate.
discussion 
wcab determination that romo was an employee of marinwood was based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutes.
section excludes certain categories of persons from the term e mployee as used in the workers compensation statutes.subdivision i of that section generally excludes volunteers a person performing voluntary service for a public agency or a private,nonprofit organization who does not receive remuneration for the services,other than meals,transportation,lodging,or reimbursement for incidental expenses.section is an exception to this exclusion.it provides each member registered as an active firefighting member of any regularly organized volunteer fire department,having official recognition,and full or partial support of the government of the county,city,town,or district in which the volunteer fire department is located,is an employee of that county,city,town,or district for the purposes of this division,and is entitled to receive compensation from the county,city,town or district in accordance with the provisions thereof.see county of kern workers comp.appeals bd.th,county of kern.
marinwood contends it is not and was not when romo was a volunteer firefighter there a regularly organized volunteer fire department within the meaning of section,and romo therefore can not claim the status of employee under that section if romo does not fall within section,he is excluded from the status of employee by section,subdivision i.
marinwood asserts that a volunteer fire department is one comprised solely of volunteer firefighters.this is distinguishable from a professional,or a combination fire department,which consists of both volunteers and paid career firefighters.volunteer fire departments,though more common in the past,are now rare entities.marinwood cites county of kern for the proposition that the requirements for a nonprofit organization to be classified as a volunteer fire department are stringent.
county of kern does not address whether the phrase regularly organized volunteer fire department in section means only fire departments comprised entirely of volunteers or encompasses a department like marinwood that is comprised of some professional firefighters and some volunteers.see county of kern,supra,th at kern agrees scvfd is a regularly organized volunteer fire department.nor does county of kern support marinwood contention that the requirements for classification as a volunteer fire department are stringent.the language marinwood quotes from county of kern at page is simply a recitation of the facts pertaining to the volunteer fire department that was the subj
