factual and procedural background 
on february,janelle scheftner,a third grade teacher at rio linda union elementary school,slipped on a piece of food as she was walking out of her classroom.she stumbled and fell forward,hitting her shoulder and lower back on a desk or table.
scheftner had some history of back problems prior to this injury.she had a back strain in,which had resolved by the time she was hired by the school in.she experienced soreness again in december and sought medical and chiropractic treatment in january.at the end of january scheftner said the constant pain in her lower left side of her back affected her sleep,work and daily activities.she reported the problem was worsening.scheftner estimated her pain to be a on a scale of to with being unbearable pain.she had chiropractic treatments on february,february,february,and february,the day before her school injury.on february,the day after her school injury,scheftner told her chiropractor her pain was down to a level or and her problem was improving.
on february,scheftner went to see her kaiser physician regarding her school injury.she received medical treatment for the next several months.by june of,scheftner shoulder was back to normal.
in october scheftner changed treating physicians.scheftner continued physical therapy and by december of,scheftner described her pain severity as being a to on a scale of.
by february scheftner physician considered her to be permanent and stationary.it was downs opinion that further medical care on an industrial basis was not appropriate.he attributed all of scheftner residual disability to her preexisting health status.with regard to the february school injury,he stated she should be considered discharged as being back to her previous baseline status.
at the request of her attorney,scheftner was evaluated by another physician who concluded her injury was work related from the specific injury of february.nijjar found scheftner condition permanent and stationary,noted subjective and objective factors of disability and work exclusions,and found no apportionment.
a mandatory settlement conference was held on scheftner workers compensation claim on november.the case was set for trial on december.on december,the parties agreed to further discovery consisting of a further report following examination by downs and a further report following additional record review by nijjar.the trial was continued to february.
after nijjar completed his additional review of records,he reported he found no reason to change his previously expressed opinions.
downs conducted an evaluation of scheftner on december.downs opined scheftner disability would be present to the same degree absent her reported industrial injury,she acquired no disability secondary to this injury,and percent of her disability was reflective of her underlying health status.there was no need to provide disability or further medical care on an industrial basis.
the case proceeded to trial on february.on march,the wcj served on the parties minutes of the hearing and a summary of evidence.under the heading of disposition it was noted this matter may be referred to the disability evaluation unit if it is not referred to the disability evaluation unit,then it will be submitted as of today march.the case was not referred to the disability evaluation unit.
bill became effective on april.
on april,the wcj issued findings and an award.the wcj found scheftner had sustained a injury on february,the injury caused permanent partial disability after adjustment for age and occupation of percent,and she needed further medical treatment.an award of permanent partial disability,attorney fees,and further medical treatment was entered in favor of scheftner and against the rio linda union school district district.the opinion of the wcj,which accompanied the findings and award,stated reliance on nijjar opinion was more in line with the overall statutory workers compensation scheme since downs opinion was not in keeping with the law holding the employer responsible for all disability that is lit up by an industrial injury.
the district filed a petition for reconsideration.one of the arguments put forward by the district was the application of section,as added by sb,to this case.the district contended nijjar report did not comply with the applicable new requirements for apportionment based on causation whereas downs report did.
the wcj submitted a report and recommendation on the district petition for reconsideration.the wcj concluded new section was not applicable to this case,which had been tried and decided or at least submitted,before the effective date of sb.
the wcab granted reconsideration.because of the important legal issue presented as to the application of sb and in order to secure uniformity of decision in the future,the case was assigned to the wcab as a whole for an en banc decision to be binding precedent on all appeals board panels and wcjs,tit,gee workers comp.appeals bd.th,fn,d.
a majority of the commissioners of the wcab four to two held that submission orders and orders closing discovery,that issued prior to the enactment of sb on april,are existing orders that can not be reopened due to the prohibition set forth in section of sb.the majority also held absent existing orders as so defined the amendments,additions,or repeals of sb apply prospectively on or after april,to all cases,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified in sb.
commissioner brass concurred and dissented.he agreed with the majority that sb must be applied to all cases after april,regardless of the date of injury unless there is an existing order,decision,or award,but disagreed that procedural orders,such as orders closing discovery or of submission,could qualify as such existing orders.he concluded only final orders,decisions,or awards were exempt from the new law.
commissioner cuneo dissented.he contended the majority was delaying and preventing application of sb directly contrary to legislative intent.he concluded sb should be applied immediately to all pending cases.he suggested the only exception would be for cases in which there was a prior existing order,decision or award,that affected substantive rights of the parties and with regard to which a party had exhausted all of its appellate rights or had chosen not to proceed with those appellate rights.
we granted the district petition for a writ of review.
discussion 
contentions asserted by parties and amicus curiae 
petitioner district contends on review the wcab was incorrect in holding the apportionment provisions of sb do not apply to pending cases where there has been an order of submission or an order closing discovery district claims the legislature intended the new apportionment laws to take immediate effect on april,the effective date of sb,and to apply to all pending cases except those in which there is an existing order,decision or award of the wcab that affects substantive rights of the parties and that is not subject to further appeal rights,cases that have been concluded subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the wcab under labor code sections and.according to the district,this application of the new apportionment laws is consistent with the rule that workers compensation benefits are a statutory right and do not vest until a final award is entered.
scheftner contends the wcab correctly ruled sb is inapplicable to her case because discovery had been mainly closed and the issues submitted for decision prior to the effective date of sb.
amicus curiae california workers compensation defense attorneys association and california workers compensation institute cwci support district interpretation of the applicability of the new apportionment laws.they contend such interpretation best fits the legislature interest in addressing the workers compensation system crisis by reducing costs in the key area of apportionment.cwci claims such an interpretation is actually a prospective application of sb.
amicus curiae california applicants attorneys association caaa makes numerous arguments,including that the standard presumption against retroactivity should apply,particularly as the legislature in section of sb stated sb should be applied prospectively.caaa contrasts the clearly retroactive intent expressed in section of sb regarding the repeal of the personal physician or chiropractor presumption of correctness with the language of intent in section of sb to argue something different from retroactive application was intended by section.caaa argues the wcab interpretation gives meaning to every part of section by making the new apportionment provisions apply to those cases in which workers were injured prior to april,but had not received an order,decision or award applying the law of apportionment by that date.according to caaa,the wcab interpretation is consistent with the plain language of section,the past interpretations of the labor code and the realities of workers compensation practice.it implements the intent of sb to achieve economic savings by expediting cases and cutting down on litigation costs.caaa asserts alternate interpretations may render the application of sb unconstitutional.caaa denies sb abolished statutory rights,contending instead the legislature only amended an existing statute and added a new one.
analysis of sb 
the rule under the law prior to sb was an employer takes the employee as he finds him at the time of the employment.accordingly,when a subsequent injury lights up or aggravates a previously existing condition resulting in disability,liability for the full disability without proration is imposed upon the employer,and the appeals board may apportion the disability under former section only in those cases in which part of the disability would have resulted,in the absence of the industrial injury,from the normal progress of the preexisting disease.citations.ballard workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d.that is,the wcab was required to allow compensation not only for the disability resulting solely from the employment,but also for that which results from the acceleration,aggravation,or lighting up of a prior nondisabling disease.pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.apportionment was allowed in limited situations,but could not be based on the cause of the disease pathology could not be apportioned.franklin workers comp.appeals bd.d.former.
sb repealed former section.sb added a new section and section affirmatively requiring among other things,apportionment of permanent disability based on causation and limiting the employer liability under certain circumstances.stats,ch,repealed,added new,added.
whether the new apportionment requirements apply to pending cases in the workers compensation system and if so,to which pending cases,have divided the parties before us,the commissioners of the wcab,and the various amicus curiae in large part the disagreements,a number of which have been outlined above,focus on the language of an uncodified portion of sb,section 
in section,the legislature stated the amendment,addition,or repeal of,any provision of law made by this act shall apply prospectively from the date of enactment of this act,regardless of the date of injury,unless otherwise specified,but shall not constitute good cause to reopen or rescind,alter,or amend any existing order,decision,or award of the workers compensation appeals board.stats,ch,italics added hereafter section.
the principles which guide our analysis are well settled.although the wcab findings on questions of fact are conclusive,the construction of a statute and its applicability to a given situation are matters of law that are reviewable by the courts.rex club workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the wcab administrative construction of statutes that it is charged to enforce and interpret is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous.citation.ralphs grocery workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.an erroneous interpretation or application of law by the wcab is a ground for annulment of its decision.citations.citations.pacific gas electric workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.that is,although the board interpretation of a labor code statute is entitled to respect,if it is wrong,it is wrong,and we are not bound by it.stores,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
we believe the question of the appropriate application of the new apportionment requirements is answered by a consideration of the nature of the workers compensation system,the nature of the legislature action regarding apportionment in sb,and the language of section.
the nature of the workers compensation system was well described in graczyk workers comp.appeals bd.d.graczyk.california workers compensation law,et is a statutory system enacted pursuant to constitutional grant of plenary power to the legislature to establish a complete and exclusive system of workers compensation.citations.it is an expression of the police power,and has been upheld as a valid exercise of the police power.citations.the right to workers compensation benefits is wholly statutory citations,and is not derived from common law.citations.this statutory right is exclusive of all other statutory and common law remedies,and substitutes a new system of rights and obligations for the common law rules governing liability of employers for injuries to their employees.citations.rights,remedies and obligations rest on the status of the relationship,rather than on contract or tort.citations.graczyk,supra,at.see dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d,see northstar at tahoe workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
given the complete statutory nature of the workers compensation system,it is apparent the specific right to compensation under such system for any industrial injury resulting in permanent disability because of the acceleration,aggravation,or lighting up of a prior nondisabling disease pullman kellogg workers comp.appeals,supra,cal d at,former was a purely statutory right.sb did not purport to amend this right.sb repealed former section.stats,ch.in its place,the legislature substituted a new statutory right to compensation for the percentage of permanent disability directly caused by an industrial injury.
it is an established canon of interpretation that statutes are not to be given a retrospective operation unless it is clearly made to appear that such was the legislative intent.aetna casualty surety industrial acc.com.cal d,see evangelatos superior court cal d.a statute has retrospective effect when it substantially changes the legal consequences of past events.citation.western security bank superior court cal th,d.the theory against retroactive application of a statute is that the parties affected have no notice of the new law affecting past conduct.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.
however,the repeal of a statutory right or remedy triggers the application of rules distinct from the traditional law regarding the prospective or retroactive application of a statute.a line of authority holds the unconditional repeal of a special remedial statute without a saving clause stops all pending actions where the repeal finds them.if final relief has not been granted before the repeal goes into effect it can not be granted afterwards,even if a judgment has been entered and the cause is pending on appeal.the reviewing court must dispose
