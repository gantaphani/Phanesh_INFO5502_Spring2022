in this claim for benefits under the black lung benefits act the act,west supp,daniels company,daniels seeks review of the benefits review board determinations that it is the coal mine operator responsible for any award of benefits to claimant james mitchell mitchell and that mitchell is entitled to benefits under the act for the reasons that follow,we grant daniels petition for review,vacate the challenged decisions of the board,and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
mitchell worked for daniels from september until february,with the exception of a period from through november.during this time,daniels operated a fabricating shop in bluefield,west virginia,engaged in the business of building systems for various coal processing plants,including design,procurement,project management,construction,commissioning,and of the systems.however,daniels did not operate a coal mine or coal tipple or provide services or perform work at or near any such facility.all construction related to its business was performed by subcontractors.in june,daniels group,which owns daniels,purchased mesa engineering mesa.mesa provided maintenance and repair services on tipple machinery,but all work was performed when the mines and tipples were shut down.
although mitchell never worked at coal tipples in his capacity as a daniels employee,mitchell was at times offered the opportunity to work for mesa maintaining and repairing equipment at the tipples.the work generally fell on weekends and holidays,providing mitchell an opportunity to earn wages at and rates.in addition,daniels was unionized under the united steelworkers union,whereas mesa was governed by the united mine workers union.hence,mitchell was paid a higher base rate of pay for his mesa work.according to daniels,mesa exist ed for the purpose of employing and paying daniels company shop employees on all jobs in which shop workers travel to and work at a client work site.it was necessary for mesa to employ the workers so that they could be paid the united mine workers wage rate and be compatible with other umw workers at the client site.in sum,it is clear that all work performed by mitchell at the tipples was paid by mesa and that mitchell exposure to coal dust was limited to the time that he performed such work as a mesa employee.
the primary dispute in this case involves the amount of time that mitchell worked at the coal tipples and,in particular,the method by which that time should be computed for the purpose of determining whether mitchell is entitled to black lung benefits and whether daniels can be held liable for such benefits under the act.mitchell contends that he should be credited under the regulations with twelve years of coal mine employment,which represents the entire time he worked for daniels.daniels contends that mitchell should only be credited with the time he actually worked at the coal tipples as a mesa employee.
according to mitchell social security records,mitchell first worked for mesa in and,a time frame which substantially predates his employment with daniels and daniels group acquisition of mesa.it was,in any event,a brief and sporadic period of employment mitchell earned only in the last two quarters of and in the first quarter of from through,mitchell earned no wages from mesa,and the social security records and mitchell testimony confirm that he was employed exclusively in employment during this period.
mitchell began working for daniels in september.during the years to,which also daniels group acquisition of mesa,mitchell was again paid a small amount of wages by mesa,earning in,in,in,and in.beginning in,and coinciding with daniels group purchase of mesa,mitchell earned the following wages from mesa in in in in in in in in and in.
employment records from mesa were also introduced.initially,they indicated that mitchell had worked a total of hours for mesa while also an employee of daniels.additional records were later found that raised that figure to hours.according to daniels,mitchell worked for mesa for four days in,eight days in,five days in,days in,eleven days in,five days in,one day in,and one day in.
mitchell testimony was largely consistent with the documentary evidence.he was unable to estimate the percentage of time he worked at the tipples during his employment with daniels,but confirmed that he was not at coal mining sites on a regular bas is during his fourteen year period of employment with daniels.he testified that he only worked at the tipples when work there was offered and that mesa paid him for the work at tipple wages.he also confirmed that coal was not being processed during his work,but testified that coal dust present in the machines was often disturbed during the job.
in february,mitchell suffered an unrelated injury when a hammer fell three stories and struck his head,ending his employment.shortly thereafter,mitchell began experiencing persistent fevers,fatigue and headaches.he underwent several hospitalizations and was diagnosed variously with meningitis,sarcoidosis,and possible tuberculosis.although his skin test for tuberculosis was negative,medical evidence indicated that active tuberculosis could exist despite a negative reading.in june,mitchell was treated with medications and responded favorably.he never returned to work at daniels.
in january,nearly nine years later,mitchell filed a claim for black lung benefits under the act.mitchell alleged that he had worked for daniels from september to february,in the repair and maintenance of coal tipple equipment,and requested an examination by rhett jabour.the department of labor designated daniels as the responsible coal mine operator liable for the payment of any black lung benefits which may be due under the act.daniels responded and denied liability,asserting that it was an company with a fabricating shop for spare parts and construction of proprietary equipment and not an operator of a mine or other covered facility.
in connection with his claim,mitchell received the requested physical examination by jabour,as well as,a ct scan of his chest,pulmonary function studies,and arterial blood gas studies.jabour,who appears to have been provided with a twelve year history of coal mine work,diagnosed mitchell with complicated pneumoconiosis.several readings by other physicians confirmed the presence of radiological evidence consistent with pneumoconiosis.
on july,following an initial determination denying benefits,an informal conference was held at mitchell request before the district director.for reasons not apparent from the record,daniels did not appear.however,the district director subsequently issued a memorandum of conference finding that a ll parties agreed that mitchell was a coal miner within the meaning of the act and regulations,agreed to years of employment as a coal miner,and agreed that the daniels company meets all requirements for designation as responsible operator.the district director also found that mitchell had established the existence of pneumoconiosis and that,based upon the employment presumption contained in the regulations,the pneumoconiosis arose from coal mine employment.see if a miner who is suffering or suffered from pneumoconiosis was employed for ten years or more in one or more coal mines,there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the pneumoconiosis arose out of such employment.see.however,benefits were denied because mitchell had failed to establish total disability.see.
pursuant to mitchell request,a hearing was held on october,before administrative law judge alj stuart levin.daniels personnel director and a shop foreman appeared at the hearing without legal representation.although alj levin initially questioned the propriety of holding the hearing without legal representation present for daniels,he ultimately proceeded and allowed the daniels employees to testify regarding mitchell employment history with daniels and mesa and the extent of mitchell actual exposure to coal dust during his employment.
on may,alj levin awarded benefits to mitchell.the alj found that daniels company and mesa engineering were one and the same employer,and that daniels had previously stipulated to its status as the responsible operator and to mitchell history of twelve years of coal mine employment.the alj also found that mitchell had established complicated pneumoconiosis by radiographic evidence,entitling him to an irrebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis.see b.
daniels obtained legal counsel and filed a petition for review with the board,challenging the propriety of the hearing being conducted without its being specifically informed of the right to legal counsel,as well as the determination that it was the responsible operator and that mitchell was entitled to benefits.on june,the board rejected the attorney representation claim and affirmed the responsible operator designation because daniels had not timely objected to the finding and,alternatively,because it was supported by substantial evidence.however,the board vacated and remanded the award of benefits because the alj had failed to weigh conflicting medical evidence on the issue of complicated pneumoconiosis.on remand,alj levin rejected daniels assertion that the medical reports failed to take into account mitchell history of tuberculosis and found that mitchell had established complicated pneumoconiosis entitling him to benefits.
daniels filed a petition for review,but shortly thereafter filed a petition for modification and moved to remand the claim to the district director for modification proceedings.see a providing that u pon his or her own initiative,or upon the request of any party on grounds of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact,the district director may,at any time before one year from the date of the last payment of benefits,or at any time before one year after the denial of a claim,reconsider the terms of an award or denial of benefits.consequently,the board dismissed the petition for review subject to reinstatement,and remanded the matter to the district director.
in modification proceedings,daniels submitted additional information regarding the structure of daniels and its relationship to mesa,as well as more comprehensive records and testimony detailing mitchell work history at the tipples.daniels also submitted medical reports from zaldivar,meyer,fino,branscomb,wiot,and spitz,who,by way of summary,collectively opined that mitchell pulmonary impairments were the result of his history of tuberculosis,sarcoidosis,and cigarette smoking,and could not be the result of coal workers pneumoconiosis given his limited actual exposure to coal dust.the details of the medical opinions,as well as those submitted in support of mitchell,are exhaustively discussed in the underlying decisions.for our purposes,it is sufficient to note that the parties agree that mitchell and ct scan show significant abnormalities in his lungs,including opacities greater than one centimeter,but disagree as to the cause of the abnormalities.mitchell claims they are the result of complicated pneumoconiosis caused by coal dust exposure.daniels asserts they are the result of sarcoidosis and tuberculosis,and that mitchell coal dust exposure was insufficient to have resulted in simple,much less complicated,coal workers pneumoconiosis.the district director denied daniels request for modification without explanation.
a hearing was thereafter held before alj linda chapman.with regard to daniels challenge to its designation as the responsible operator,alj chapman found that alj levin mitchell had worked as a miner for daniels for twelve years and that daniels was properly designated the responsible law of the case and could not be challenged in modification proceedings.with regard to the entitlement claim,alj chapman found no mistake of fact in alj levin determination that mitchell had established complicated pneumoconiosis by the evidence.in her ruling,however,alj chapman refused to consider the additional medical reports submitted by daniels because she viewed them as having been based solely on the assumption that mitchell had only hours of coal dust exposure,contrary to its earlier stipulation of years,when in fact daniels has not established that there were no significant periods of coal dust exposure,and thus has not rebutted the regulatory presumption that mitchell was regularly and continuously exposed to coal dust during the course of his employment with daniels.given the stipulated history of twelve years of regular and continuous coal dust exposure,alj chapman found that the new medical opinion evidence does not affirmatively show that the opacities on mitchell are not there,or are not what they seem to be,that is,complicated pneumoconiosis.
daniels thereafter sought board review of alj chapman decision,as well as reinstatement of its appeal of alj levin decision.the board affirmed alj levin decision and denied the claim that alj levin had erred in failing to notify daniels of its right to counsel.with regard to alj chapman decision,the board vacated the determination that alj levin findings could not be challenged under the law of the case doctrine and remanded for a determination of whether the stipulations were fairly entered into at the informal conference and therefore binding upon the parties.if so,the parties could be bound on modification by them.if not,the alj was directed to render findings on whether daniels meets the requirements of being named the responsible operator under the regulations and the length of mitchell coal mine employment.footnote omitted.with regard to alj chapman finding that mitchell was entitled to benefits,the board affirmed by a split decision.
on remand,alj chapman found that daniels had fairly entered into the stipulations and was bound by them.in the alternative,she found that the record supports the original findings of judge levin regarding those issues.on review,the board reversed alj chapman finding that daniels had fairly entered into the stipulations because daniels was not present at the informal conference.see wellmore coal stiltner,cir noting that the informal conference contemplated by the regulations can not take place without all parties present.nor can a valid or meaningful memorandum of conference be issued when the issues were not discussed by the parties and the deputy commissioner.however,the board affirmed alj chapman alternative finding that the record sufficiently supported daniels designation as the responsible operator.with regard to the entitlement issue,the board believed it unnecessary to address whether alj chapman finding that mitchell had twelve years of coal mine employment was supported by substantial evidence because the alj finding that mitchell had complicated pneumoconiosis was not based upon a presumption of causation and,consequently,the award of benefits wa s not tainted by findings regarding the years of coal mine employment.
daniels now seeks review of the board decisions,challenging its designation as the responsible operator,its determination that mitchell is entitled to black lung benefits,and its rejection of the attorney representation challenge.
on a petition for review of an order of the board affirming an alj decision,we undertake an independent review of the record,as in the place of the board,see dehue coal ballard,cir,to determine whether the decision is in accordance with the law and supported by substantial evidence,collins pond creek mining,cir.in doing so,we confine our review to the grounds upon which the board based its decision.id.we review the board conclusions of law de novo.see id.
we begin with daniels challenge to its designation as the responsible coal mine operator liable for the payment of the black lung benefits awarded to mitchell under the act.
under the act,liability for the payment of black lung benefits is imposed upon the coal industry.for claimants who worked as coal miners on or after january,the act places liability upon individual responsible operator s.see armco,martin,cir see also west supp.
the responsible operator is the operator which is determined liable for the payment of benefits under the regulations.a.it is the director burden to identify the responsible operator,see,and to develop evidence sufficient to support the conclusion that a potentially responsible operator is liable for benefits.see,owcp trace fork coal,cir holding that the applicable regulations give the director,not the designated responsible operator,the power to develop evidence on the responsible operator issue 
for the purposes of determining whether an employer is or was an operator or other employer covered by the act which may be found liable for the payment of benefits,there is a presumption that during the course of an individual employment,such individual was regularly and continuously exposed to coal dust during the course of employment.c.this presumption may be rebutted by a showing that the employee was not exposed to coal dust for significant periods during such employment.id.in addition to meeting other conditions specified in which are not at issue here,the regulations also provide that the operator or other employer with which the miner had the most recent periods of cumulative employment of not less than year,as determined in accordance with paragraph b of section shall be the responsible operator.a emphasis added.section b,in turn,provides as follows 
from the evidence presented,the identity of the operator or other employer with which the miner had the most recent periods of cumulative employment of not less than year and,to the extent the evidence permits,the beginning and ending dates of such periods,shall be ascertained.for purposes of this section,a year of employment means a period of year,or partial periods totalling year,during which the miner was regularly employed in or around a coal mine by the operator or other employer.regular employment may be established on the basis of any evidence presented,including the testimony of a claimant or other witnesses,and shall not be contingent upon a finding of a specific number of days of employment within a given period.however,if an operator or other employer proves that the miner was not employed by it for a period of at least working days,such operator or other employer shall be determined to have established that the miner was not regularly employed for a cumulative year by such operator or employer for the purposes of paragraph a of this section.a working day means any day or part of a day for which a miner received pay for work as a miner see a.
b emphasis added if the responsible coal mine operator is in capable of assuming its liability for the payment of continuing benefits,a,and there is no successor operator liable for the payment of continuing benefits,a,the next most recent employer satisfying the definition of responsible operator will be considered the responsible operator,see a.i f no responsible operator can be identified,benefits are paid by the black lung disability trust fund.d.
in armco,we interpreted the responsible operator provisions and held that they provide for a distinct inquiry for determining operator liability.armco,at.first,the court must determine whether a miner worked for an operator for a period of one year,or partial periods totaling one year.id.quoting b.second,the court must determine whether a miner employment during that one year was regular,whether,during the one year,the miner was regularly employed in or around a coal mine.id.quoting b emphasis added.the determination of whether the miner was regularly employed,in turn,is the subject of the remaining three sentences of section b.
the next sentence explains that r egular employment may be established on the basis of any evidence presented,including the testimony of a claimant or other witnesses,and shall not be contingent upon a finding of a specific number of days of employment within a given period.the sentence thereafter establishes that if this evidence reveals that the miner was not employed by the operator for a period of at least working days,such operator or other employer shall be determined to have established that the miner was not regularly employed for a cumulative year.finally,for establishing the day minimum for regular employment,the subsection defines a working day to be all or part of a day for which a miner received pay.all three sentences thus define regular employment and do not undermine the threshold requirement of one year of employment.
id.at quoting b internal citations omitted.in summary,in order to establish that a particular operator is properly designated the responsible operator under b,
it must be shown that a miner worked for the coal mine operator for one year or partial periods totalling one year and the miner worked regularly during that period.to fulfill the requirement of working regularly,the subsection imposes a minimum of working days.thus,the regulations provide that responsible operator liability does not arise unless an operator employed a miner for one calendar year during which the miner regularly worked for that operator,defining regularly worked to be a minimum of work days.
id.at emphasis added.
in the proceedings below,alj chapman found that mitchell was exposed to coal dust when he worked at the coal tipples for daniels,entitling him under c to a presumption of regular and continuous exposure to coal dust during the course of his entire employment with daniels.she rejected daniels attempt to rebut the presumption through its records of mitchell actual coal dust exposure because the evidence supplied by daniels indicated that mitchell worked a minimum hours at the tipples from to and contradicted the social security earnings records which show that mitchell began his employment in,and ended in.concluding that daniels had failed to establish that claimant had no significant periods of coal dust exposure,alj chapman ruled that daniels had failed to rebut the presumption set forth in c.
having found that mitchell was entitled to a presumption of years of regular and continuous coal dust exposure during his employment with daniels under,alj chapman then turned to and concluded that daniels had been properly designated the responsible operator because mitchell had worked at least one cumulative year as a coal miner for mesa.the alj arrived at this conclusion,however,by applying revised regulation a iii and finding,based upon mitchell employment by mesa in,and,that mitchell had worked well over days in or around the coal mines for mesa.because mitchell met the minimum days requirement of,alj chapman held,daniels ha d not established mitchell was not regularly or continuously exposed to coal dust.
daniels petitioned for review arguing,inter alia,that alj chapman erred in applying revised regulation a iii to calculate mitchell working days for purposes of the responsible operator inquiry and erred in finding it to be the responsible operator under and of the regulations.
as correctly noted by daniels,substantial revisions to the black lung regulations were promulgated in and became effective on january.with specified exceptions,including those provisions which govern the responsible operator inquiry,the revised regulations apply to all claims pending on that date.see c.as a result,the revisions to the black lung regulations govern the issue of whether mitchell is entitled to black lung benefits under the act but not the issue of whether daniels was properly designated the responsible operator liable for the payment of benefits under the act.see noting that the revised regulations apply to the adjudication of claims pending on january,with the exception of,among others,the responsible coal mine operator provisions set forth in.
under the revised regulations,a n operator may be considered a potentially liable operator with respect to a claim for benefits if,among other things,t he miner was employed by the operator for a cumulative period of not less than one year as defined in a.c.section a,which provides general definitions for various terms used in the regulations,now includes a definition at subsection a for a year,as a period of one calendar year days,or days if one of the days is february,or partial periods totaling one year,during which the miner worked in or around a coal mine or mines for at least working days.a subsection iii of section a,upon which alj chapman relied,provides that 
if the evidence is insufficient to establish the beginning and ending dates of the miner coal mine employment,or the miner employment lasted less than a calendar year,then the adjudication officer may use the following formula divide the miner yearly income from work as a miner by the coal mine industry average daily earnings for that year,as reported by the bureau of labor statistics bls.a copy of the bls table shall be made a part of the record if the adjudication officer uses this method to establish the length of the miner work history.
on review of the alj determination,the board acknowledged that a iii is inapplicable to the responsible operator inquiry,but nevertheless affirmed.specifically,the board held that use of the formula as a guide was permissible because provides no suggested method of calculation and the alj had the discretion to apply any reasonable method.the board also rejected daniels assertion that remand was required due to the alj failure to explain her calculation and provide a copy of the bls average daily earnings table as required by a iii,because daniels,in the context of applying the same calculation to the entitlement issue,had calculated working days with mesa.the board then affirmed the alj finding that daniels had failed to prove that the miner was not employed by it for at least working days pursuant to section b,and the related finding that,based on a finding of over working days,employer did not rebut the presumption of section c requiring proof that the miner was not exposed to coal dust for significant periods during such employment.
we hold that the alj had insufficient evidence to sustain the designation of daniels as the responsible operator liable for the payment of black lung benefits to mitchell under the act and that the alj and board erred as a matter of law in its application of the regulations governing the proper designation of the responsible operator.
daniels,which is unionized under the united steelworkers union,does not operate a coal mine or coal tipple and does not perform coal mine or coal tipple work.it was designated the responsible operator under the act by the director because mitchell,in his original claim filed in january,asserted that he worked for daniels repairing and maintaining coal tipples from september to february not to as found by the alj.the evidence,however,does not support even the former assertion,nor has mitchell maintained as much in these proceedings.mitchell was employed by daniels from september to february,but not as a miner.thus,standing alone,daniels could not be designated a responsible operator under the act because it is not engaged in coal mine or coal tipple work,nor did mitchell technically perform any such work or receive wages for it from daniels.mitchell did,however,work sporadically in the tipples from to,while also employed by daniels,on a and basis repairing and maintaining equipment located at various tipple sites as an employee of daniels sister company,mesa,which is unionized under and subject to the united mine workers union.
notwithstanding this undisputed evidence of a much more limited exposure to coal tipple work,the alj found that mitchell was entitled to a presumption of regular and continuous exposure to coal dust during his entire tenure of employment with daniels and that daniels had failed to rebut that presumption.this determination was based upon the alj finding that mitchell history of hours of coal tipple employment covered only the years to,and did not account for the fact that the social security records contained a work history from to.
the alj finding that mitchell was employed by daniels from to is clearly unsupported by the evidence in the record.indeed,the evidence in this regard is uncontradicted.however,even if one attributes mitchell coal tipple work for mesa to daniels and concludes that he was entitled to the presumption of regular and continuous exposure to coal dust during his actual years of employment with daniels,daniels has rebutted the presumption of regular and continuous coal dust exposure during those years through the uncontradicted evidence that mitchell actual exposure was limited to the relatively small amount of time he was technically working for and paid by mesa.
the director has likewise failed to demonstrate that daniels meets the criteria for designation as the responsible operator under.although it is not entirely clear from the analysis,it appears that the alj found that mitchell had worked at least one cumulative year as a coal miner for mesa because he had worked for mesa in or around the coal tipples for a period of at least working days.emphasis added.and,the alj also arrived at the finding of greater than working days by applying a iii.hence,it appears that the alj may have viewed daniels to be a responsible operator based upon the general presumption of,and viewed mesa to be a responsible operator based upon the specific criteria of.
in any event,an employer liability as the responsible operator for payment of any award of black lung benefits to a miner does not arise unless the evidence establishes that the employer employed the miner for one calendar year during which the miner regularly worked in or around a coal mine or tipple in this case,defining regularly worked to be a minimum of working days.see armco,at.a working day means any day or part of a day for which a miner received pay for work as a miner.it is a distinctive inquiry.see armco,at.
if we view mitchell as an employee of only mesa when he was working as a miner,the first step of the responsible operator inquiry is not met.the alj found that mitchell worked at least one cumulative year as a coal miner for mesa,based upon her finding,under the revised regulation,that mitchell worked well over days in or around the coal mines.this finding,however,conflates the two inquiries and relies upon an inapplicable regulation,rendering it erroneous as a matter of law.it is also unsupported by substantial evidence as no one claims that mitchell worked for mesa for a period of one year or partial periods totaling one year.
if we view mitchell as an employee of daniels and attribute his time in the coal tipples as a mesa employee to daniels,as apparently the board did,then the evidence is sufficient to establish the first step of the inquiry.mitchell was employed by daniels for the minimum period of one year.the evidence is insufficient,however,to establish the second step of the mitchell was regularly employed in or around a coal mine by the operator or other employer during his employment.b.
the alj found that mitchell worked well over days in or around the coal mines based upon a purported calculation of working days under revised regulation a iii.the board acknowledged that the revised regulation was inapplicable,but held that its use as a guide was permissible and affirmed the finding that mitchell had more than working days for purposes of.this was error.
first,even if it would be generally appropriate to use a iii formula as a guide to calculate working days in cases which precede its effective date,it was not appropriate to apply it as a guide in this case.by its terms,the regulation may be used in situations where the miner employment lasted less than one year or the beginning and ending dates of the miner coal mine employment can not be established.see a iii.here,the record contains documentary evidence of mitchell employment by mesa,including payroll registers listing the specific dates on which the miner was dispatched to the coal mine tipples,his hours,and his pay.the formula calculation is also to be based upon bls average daily earnings for the coal mine industry,and any calculation thereunder shall be accompanied by a copy of the bls table.here,the alj did not attach the table and did not explain her calculation.nor does it appear that she took into account the undisputed evidence that mitchell,by virtue of the character of his work for mesa,was paid tipple wages at inflated overtime rates.in short,a iii is not applicable to the responsible operator inquiry in this case,nor would we affirm its use as a guide given the multiple deficiencies present in its application its use as a guide in this case could not help but yield an unreliable and unfair result.
second,even if we thought the calculation to be appropriate and representative of mitchell actual work days in the tipples,the finding that mitchell worked well over days in or around the coal mines or days as calculated by the daniels in the entitlement context does not translate to a finding that daniels has been properly designated a responsible operator in order for daniels to be liable as the responsible operator under b,the director was required to show that daniels employed mitchell for one calendar year during which the miner regularly worked for daniels,defining regularly worked to be a minimum of work days.armco,at emphasis added.however,because mitchell worked approximately days in coal tipples over the course of his entire career as a daniels employee,the board held that he was properly deemed to have worked regularly as a coal miner in coal mine employment.under the view of the board and director,regular employment under b is established if an employee works a total of days over the course of his entire period of employment,even if that employment lasts for a decade or more.so long as the employee worked a total of at least days in or around a coal mine or tipple at any time during his employment,he will be deemed to have been regularly employed in or around a coal mine.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.we have not interpreted in such a manner nor,as we noted in armco,do the intervening amendments to the regulations support such an interpretation 
in c,the department of labor states that an operator is a responsible operator only if the miner at issue was employed by the operator for a cumulative period of not less than one year.the section then references a,which defines a year as a period of one calendar year days,or days if one of the days is february,or partial periods totaling one year,during which the miner worked in or around a coal mine or mines for at least working days.although these later revisions do not bind our interpretation of the regulations as they stood at the time of the claim resolution,they do inform our analysis of what the earlier,less clearly written regulations were intended to mean.
id.at emphasis added.
to conclude,in order to designate daniels as the responsible operator liable for the payment of any benefits due under the act,it was incumbent upon the director to show that daniels employed mitchell for one calendar year during which mitchell regularly worked for daniels,defining regularly worked to be a minimum of work days.id.at emphasis added.the director was not put to this task and substantial evidence does not support the determination.accordingly,we grant daniels petition for review of the decision of the benefits review board and reverse the board decision affirming daniels designation as the responsible operator under the act 
we now turn to daniels challenge to the alj determination that mitchell is entitled to black lung benefits under the act.
in order to establish an entitlement to black lung benefits,a claimant must prove that he has pneumoconiosis the pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mine employment he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary condition and pneumoconiosis is a contributing cause to his total respiratory disability.see milburn colliery hicks,cir.
with regard to the second element,of the regulation sets forth two methods by which a claimant may establish that his pneumoconiosis arose at least in part out of his coal mine employment.napier,owcp,cir per curiam.if a miner who is suffering or suffered from pneumoconiosis was employed for ten years or more in one or more coal mines,there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the pneumoconiosis arose out of such employment.b see also same.but i f a miner who is suffering or suffered from pneumoconiosis was employed less than ten years in the nation coal mines,it shall be determined that such pneumoconiosis arose out of that employment only if competent evidence establishes such a relationship.c.the presumption appl ies only if a miner worked in one or more coal mines for the number of years required to invoke the presumption,and t he length of the miner coal mine work history must be computed as provided by a.
with regard to the element of total disability,of the regulation provides for an irrebuttable presumption of total disability due to pneumoconiosis if a an of the miner lungs shows at least one opacity greater than one centimeter in diameter b a biopsy reveals massive lesions in the lungs or c a diagnosis by other means reveals a result equivalent to a or b.associated coal,owcp,cir footnote omitted.the condition described by these criteria is frequently referred to as complicated pneumoconiosis,although that term does not appear in the statute.associated coal,at.
in this case,mitchell and ct scan showed significant abnormalities in his lungs,including opacities greater than one centimeter in diameter,which could be consistent with pneumoconiosis and entitle him to the irrebuttable presumption of total disability.it is not enough,however,for the miner to prove that he has radiographic findings consistent with complicated pneumoconiosis and,thereby,that he is entitled to the irrebuttable presumption of total disability.the presumption of only establishes the third requisite element of proving total disability.the miner must also independently establish the second his pneumoconiosis arose at least in part out of coal mine employment.a.
early in these proceedings,the director found that the parties had stipulated to years of employment as a coal miner at the informal conference and that,based upon the employment presumption contained in,mitchell had established that the pneumoconiosis arose from coal mine that were upheld by alj levin and alj chapman.in modification proceedings,alj chapman also refused to consider the expert opinions of zaldivar,wiot,banscomb,fino,meyer,and spitz,who concluded that the abnormalities were not the result of coal dust exposure because the hours of exposure upon which their opinions were based was contrary to daniels earlier stipulation of years,and did not take into account the years to,and and,when mitchell social security earnings records reflect that he worked for daniels.accordingly,alj chapman ruled that the new medical opinion evidence does not affirmatively show that the opacities on mitchell are not there,or are not what they seem to be,that is,complicated pneumoconiosis.
albeit through a tortured procedural history,the board ultimately ruled that daniels had not fairly entered into the stipulations at the informal conference and were not bound by them,but affirmed the alj alternative finding that mitchell was entitled to benefits because he had established the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis under and because the new medical opinion evidence regarding causation did not refute that finding.the board declined,however,to endorse the alj finding that mitchell had twelve years of coal mine employment 
r eview of the administrative law judge decision reveals that the stipulation form reflecting twelve years of coal mine employment had no bearing on her decision she relied upon the evidence in the record to find that the abnormalities shown on were complicated pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment 
t he determination that claimant established the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment was made without benefit or application of the ten year presumption at section b.accordingly,we need not address whether the administrative law judge on remand erred in finding that the record supported a finding of twelve years of coal mine employment.in sum,since both aljs analyzed the evidence of record to find that claimant established the existence of complicated pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mine employment,the award of benefits is not tainted by findings regarding the years of coal mine employment.
the dissenting judge disagreed.she would have r
