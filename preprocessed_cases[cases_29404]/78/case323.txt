martha locke filed suit against her employer,suntrust bank,for injuries she sustained when a robber shot her during a bank robbery of the suntrust branch where she worked.the district court dismissed locke complaint with prejudice,concluding that locke negligence claim against her employer was barred by the exclusivity provisions of florida workers compensation laws and that locke complaint failed to state a claim for an intentional tort by her employer.after review and oral argument,we affirm.
locke complaint 
locke complaint alleges that on january,she was working as a manager at suntrust recker highway bank branch in winter haven,florida the bank.two men entered the armed with a can of mace and one armed with a proceeded to rob the bank.the gunman stood by the teller window,while the other robber stood by the vault door.the gunman eventually fired twice at two women behind the teller window.because the teller window glass was bulletproof,the bullets ricocheted off the glass.according to locke complaint,this enraged the gunman,and he walked toward locke in anger and shot locke in the face.the gunman then stepped on locke and stole her purse.
locke complaint also alleges that prior to the january,date she was shot,suntrust was aware that a teller at the same bank had been by a bank robber.locke asserts that several unspecified incidents of aggravated assault had taken place at this bank branch prior to january.locke further alleges that after the incident,suntrust hired a security guard for the bank branch.locke was told that suntrust had hired a security guard and that the security guard would be in place at the bank branch.on january,there was no security guard in place at the branch,because suntrust had decided to eliminate the security guard for economic reasons.
locke complaint contains two counts negligence and intentional tort.count alleges that suntrust had a duty to protect locke and breached its duty by failing to provide sufficient security at its bank branch.count alleges that suntrust knew of the presence of unsafe working conditions at its bank branch,failed to provide sufficient security despite that knowledge,and thereby engaged in conduct so outrageous as to go beyond all bounds of decency,and to be regarded as odious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.
dismissal order 
suntrust filed a motion to dismiss locke complaint,which the district court granted with prejudice.as to count negligence,the district court concluded that locke claim was barred by the exclusivity provisions of the florida workers compensation laws because her injuries were causally related to her employment as a bank manager.as to count intentional tort,the district court concluded that locke allegations,even if proven,would not support an intentional tort claim against suntrust.the district court determined that because locke did not allege any additional facts to support a cause of action leave to amend would be futile.locke appealed.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
preliminarily,we address our jurisdiction over locke appeal.the parties do not dispute that locke notice of appeal was filed more than thirty days after the entry of the district court dismissal order on april.see fed.a a rule.locke notice of appeal was due on or before may.
on may,locke filed a motion to extend time to appeal,in which her counsel asserted that a legal assistant at his firm had miscalculated the deadline.on may,seven days later,the district court granted locke motion to extend time,finding excusable neglect.locke then filed this appeal on the same day.
under fed.a a,a district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if i a party moves to extend no later than thirty days after the time originally prescribed expires and ii the movant shows excusable neglect or good cause.locke moved for an extension five days after the original deadline expired.this court previously has recognized that the phrase excusable neglect may include,when appropriate,late filings caused by inadvertence,mistake,or carelessness under certain circumstances.see advanced estimating riney,cir.further,suntrust does not explain on appeal why it contests the district court finding of excusable neglect accordingly,we conclude that suntrust has not established that the district court abused its discretion in granting locke an extension of time to file her appeal or that we lack jurisdiction over locke appeal.
count negligence 
under florida law,an employer shall pay an employee workers compensation benefits if the employee suffers an accidental injury or death arising out of work performed in the course and the scope of employment.stat.ann.as a general matter,the workers compensation liability of an employer shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer id.this is sometimes known as the workers compensation exclusivity bar.see.power light huwer,so d.
the florida courts have established a,test for whether the exclusivity bar applies,which requires that a injury must both arise out of and occur in the course of employment.byrd,so d,strother morrison cafeteria,so d,bituminous cas.richardson,so d.t o be compensable,an injury must arise out of employment in the sense of causation and be in the course of employment in the sense of continuity of time,space,and circumstances.strother,so d at.
the parties do not contest that the second part of florida test is met here,insofar as it is undisputed that locke was shot in the face at her bank branch and while working.instead,locke contends that the first part of the test is absent here.after a review of florida law,we disagree because florida courts have repeatedly concluded that injuries sustained during robberies in the workplace arise out of employment under florida law and have granted workers compensation immunity to in several cases with facts closely analogous to this one.
for instance,in sullivan atlantic federal savings loan association,so d,the plaintiff decedent was a bank manager.the bank branch had been robbed twice within the previous year,and during the course of the second prior robbery,the robber escaped after threatening to return and kill the bank manager.sullivan,so d at.the same robber ultimately returned and killed the bank manager during the course of a third bank robbery.id.the florida appellate court affirmed the trial court grant of summary judgment to the bank on the plaintiff claim that the bank negligently failed to provide security,concluding that the claim was barred by the workers compensation exclusivity bar.id.at.
similarly,in winn dixie stores,parks,so d,the florida appellate court held that the injury and subsequent death of an assistant manager of a grocery store arose out of his employment when the manager was kidnaped while driving home from work,forced to return to the store to open the store safe,and then stabbed.the florida appellate court observed that under florida law,a assault is covered by workers compensation,and concluded that the employer was entitled to workers compensation immunity from the wrongful death suit.winn dixie,so d at citing,inter alia,sullivan,so d see also lovin mood,bush,so d,finding the necessary causal connection between the plaintiff injuries and her employment to trigger the workers compensation exclusivity bar where,during store hours,a customer lured the to the back of the store and raped her mcdaniel sheffield,so d,affirming the grant of workers compensation immunity to defendants where plaintiff decedent,a clerk at defendants store,was shot and killed by an unknown armed robber of the store prahl,phillips,so d,affirming grant of workers compensation benefits to a hotel employee who suffered psychiatric impairment as a result of an armed robbery at her hotel,during which she had a gun placed to her head,a ring was physically removed from her finger,and she was forced to lie on the floor,overruled on other grounds by city of holmes beach grace,so d.
the florida supreme court decision in strother is also noteworthy.in strother,the strother was a cashier at a cafeteria.although it was not part of her regular duties,strother drove the cafeteria manager o
