plaintiffs and appellants louie palestini and darla palestini together the palestinis,who are husband and wife,appeal from a judgment of dismissal following the court sustaining without leave to amend of a general demurrer to their amended complaint in this personal injury and loss of consortium action against louie palestini former employers,defendants and respondents general dynamics corporation and hughes missile systems company together defendants.this appeal involves application of labor code section,subdivision b hereafter section b,an exception to the exclusive remedy provisions of the california workers compensation act that subdivision provides that an employee may bring an action at law for damages against the employer w here the employee injury is aggravated by the employer fraudulent concealment of the existence of the injury and its connection with the employment,in which case the employer liability shall be limited to those damages proximately caused by the aggravation.italics added.
louie palestini filed a second amended complaint against defendants seeking damages for injuries including,but not limited to,testicular cancer allegedly caused by his chronic exposure at work to carcinogenic chemicals.darla palestini joined the lawsuit seeking loss of consortium damages.in their statutory cause of action under section b for fraudulent concealment resulting in aggravation of an industrial injury,the palestinis allege that as a result of louie palestini continuous exposure to carcinogenic chemicals at work during the period of more than years he worked for defendants,he developed skin rashes and discoloration,which he reported to his supervisors,and the carcinogens entered his body through skin lesions and inhalation.they also allege defendants knew,but fraudulently concealed from louie palestini,that the chemicals to which he was exposed at work contained carcinogens,and his skin problems were a precursor to the development of the types of cancer that he later developed,thereby aggravating his injuries.the palestinis further allege that louie palestini inquired at work whether certain chemicals were safe for him to use,and he was repeatedly told the chemicals were safe and would not harm him.
hughes,joined by general dynamics,filed a general demurrer to challenge the legal sufficiency of the cause of action for fraudulent concealment on the ground it is barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation act et.the palestinis opposed the demurrer,arguing they had stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under section b.
the court sustained defendants demurrer to the first cause of action without leave to amend and eventually entered judgments of dismissal of the action in their favor following the palestinis unsuccessful attempt to amend their pleading to state a different claim.the palestinis appeal from the judgments of dismissal.
the sole issue presented is whether the palestinis second amended complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraudulent concealment resulting in aggravation of louie palestini injuries within the meaning of section b.we conclude it is sufficient for pleading purposes under that statute.accordingly,we reverse the judgments of dismissal.
factual background 
from march to june,louie palestini worked as a plastics fabricator,group leadman,and supervisor at general dynamics manufacturing plants in san diego.from june through january,he worked in the same positions for hughes.during those years,louie palestini was continuously overexposed at work to certain identified solvents and other chemicals that defendants allegedly knew could be absorbed through the skin and cause cancer in various organs,such as the lungs,liver,and the urinary tract.although some of his supervisors instructed him to wear gloves,the gloves would disintegrate and provide little or no protection against the absorption and toxicity of the carcinogenic chemicals.
as a result of louie palestini overexposure to those chemicals,the carcinogens entered his body and caused him to develop skin rashes and discoloration that he reported to his supervisors.he and his fellow employees tried to minimize the rashes by using barrier creams,wearing plastic sleeves,and wrapping their arms in rags or plastic wrap.wrapping his arms often made the rashes worse.
defendants allegedly knew they were overexposing louie palestini and other employees to carcinogenic chemicals and also knew the overexposure would probably cause damage to them.defendants fraudulently concealed from louie palestini that the chemicals to which he was exposed contained carcinogens and that his skin problems were a precursor to the development of the types of cancer that he later developed,thereby aggravating his injuries.he and other employees inquired as to whether it was safe for them to use the chemicals,and they were repeatedly told the chemicals were safe and would not harm them.
unaware of the danger and deprived of the opportunity to either take proper precautions to avoid exposure to the chemicals or seek alternative employment where such exposure was eliminated or minimized,louie palestini sustained chronic exposure to carcinogens that caused him to contract cancer.in october,he underwent surgical removal of a testicle and was diagnosed with testicular cancer and stage iii metastasis to the abdominal and chest areas of his body.he underwent chemotherapy and additional surgeries for the removal of cancerous growths around his prostate,heart and lungs.although his cancer is currently in remission,he suffers from chronic medical problems as a result of the cancer and its treatment.
procedural background 
in his second amended complaint,louie palestini brought a claim against defendants under section b discussed,ante for aggravation of injuries by fraudulent concealment seeking damages for the injuries including,but not limited to testicular cancer he suffered allegedly as a result of his chronic industrial exposure to carcinogenic chemicals.his wife darla palestini joined the lawsuit seeking loss of consortium damages.
hughes,joined by general dynamics,filed a general demurrer to the section b cause of action on the ground it was barred by the exclusive remedy provisions of the workers compensation act et.
the palestinis opposed defendants demurrer,arguing that for purposes of section b their amended pleading stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraudulent concealment and aggravation of louie palestini injuries.specifically,the palestinis argued that louie palestini was entitled under section b to bring an action at law for damages for aggravation of his injuries caused by defendants fraudulent concealment that his skin problems and overexposure to chemicals were a precursor injury to cancer caused by his exposure to carcinogens and at the workplace.they also asserted that i ssues of proof surrounding defendants actual knowledge of the circumstances regarding louie palestini injury and aggravation of the injury,are questions of fact.
sustaining defendants demurrer without leave to amend the court found that the palestinis had failed to plead that hughes general dynamics had actual prior knowledge of louie palestini injuries as required pursuant to section b and hughes aircraft superior court th,d hughes aircraft.the court also found that w hether louie palestini injury is construed to be a skin condition,rash or cancer,the palestinis have not pled that hughes or general dynamics was aware of any of these injuries prior to louie palestini discovery of the injury.it rejected the palestinis assertion that the defendants were not required by law to be unaware of louie palestini injuries at the time defendants first learned of those injuries.the court stated that the palestinis arguments suggested an improperly expansive reading of section b,and that the court was required to narrowly construe that subdivision under the decision in soares city of oakland th,d soares the court also stated that t he nature and manner of the facts pleaded in the palestinis second amended complaint lead the court to conclude that leave to amend would not be appropriate in this regard because the palestinis have not suggested that either hughes or general dynamics was aware of any injury prior to louie palestini learning of his injury.
the court thereafter entered judgments of dismissal of the entire action in favor of defendants.the palestinis timely appeal followed.
standard of review 
the standard of review on appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after the sustaining of a demurrer without leave to amend is well established.the reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation and treats the demurrer as admitting all properly pleaded material facts.blank kirwan,supra,cal d at.the reviewing court does not,however,assume the truth of contentions,deductions or conclusions of law.moore regents of university of california cal d.the judgment must be affirmed if any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken.citations.longshore county of ventura cal d.it is error,however,for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory.barquis merchants collection cal d.
discussion 
applicable legal principles 
as a general rule,an employee injured in the course of employment is limited to the remedies available under the workers compensation act.davis lockheed th,d,citing foster xerox cal d,foster.
in foster,the california supreme court explained that a n employee who suffers an injury in the course of his employment may recover damages in an action at law only if he comes within certain exceptions to the workers compensation law.foster,supra,cal d at,citing.the high court also explained that o ne of these exceptions is embodied in section b.it provides that an action at law may be brought w here the employee injury is aggravated by the employer fraudulent concealment of the existence of the injury and its connection with the employment,in which case the employer liability shall be limited to those damages proximately caused by the aggravation.foster,supra,cal d at,fn.omitted,italics added.
the supreme court decision in foster,supra,cal d,necessarily guides our analysis because the high court first interpreted section b in that case see hughes aircraft,supra,th at,d,and foster continues to represent the high court most recent interpretation of the essential pleading requirements that must be met to state a claim under that statute.
in foster,which was factually similar to the instant case,the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against his former employer seeking to recover damages for the aggravation of his injuries.foster,supra,cal d at.the high court summarized the foster plaintiff allegations 
plaintiff was employed by defendant for years as a service technician to maintain and repair equipment manufactured by defendant.this machinery incorporated a drum that was unsafe for its intended use because it contained a large amount of arsenic,a poisonous substance.defendant did not warn plaintiff of the presence of the arsenic,nor did it safeguard him from its effects.as a result,he suffered symptoms of arsenic poisoning beginning several years after his employment.these symptoms were reported to his supervisor in and.although defendant knew that the reported symptoms of plaintiff to his supervisor were symptoms of arsenic poisoning,and that plaintiff physical problems were caused by the arsenic,it failed to warn him that the disease was aggravated with the passage of time,and it fraudulently concealed from him that his injuries were connected with his employment.in december,plaintiff symptoms became so severe that he was forced to terminate his employment,and it was at this time that his doctor told him that he was suffering from arsenic poisoning caused by his work and aggravated by his continued exposure to the arsenic used in the drums,italics added.
the defendant employer demurred to the complaint on the ground the allegations were insufficient to state a cause of action for fraudulent concealment under section b,and the action was barred by the exclusive remedy provisions set forth in section foster,supra,cal d at.the defendant maintained the plaintiff allegations were insufficient because the term fraudulent concealment as used in section b applied only when an employer affirmatively misrepresented the employee was,and the plaintiff had failed to allege the defendant made misrepresentations designed to conceal from him the fact that he suffered from arsenic poisoning caused by his employment.foster,supra,at.the trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend,and the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of dismissal.ibid.
in a unanimous decision,the supreme court in foster reversed the judgment of dismissal.foster,supra,cal d at.citing its earlier decision in,supra,cal d,which the legislature codified in the provisions of section b,the high court rejected the defendant contention that affirmative misrepresentations by the employer are required to state a cause of action under section b.foster,supra,cal d at.noting that in the plaintiff action at law for aggravation of his disease was justified by his allegations that the employer concealed the dangers of the workplace,the supreme court stated that section b reflects this holding by its reference to fraudulent concealment.foster,supra,cal d at.
the foster court then turned to the factual allegations set forth in the complaint and addressed the defendant assertion that the pleading was defective because it failed to allege the defendant had knowledge that the plaintiff had contracted arsenic poisoning.foster,supra,cal d at.the court explained that s uch knowledge is essential to establish a claim under section b because defendant obviously could not be charged with concealing matters which it did not know.citation.foster,supra,cal d at.the high court stated that the plaintiff allegations that he had advised his supervisors in and that he was suffering from certain symptoms and that the defendant knew the symptoms were those of arsenic poisoning,were insufficient to allege that defendant knew of plaintiff disease.ibid.the court explained that t here was no allegation that the supervisors to whom these symptoms were reported were aware of their significance,or that they reported plaintiff condition to a physician or other official employed by defendant who recognized that plaintiff was suffering from arsenic poisoning caused by this employment.ibid.
notwithstanding this apparent deficiency in the allegations in the complaint,the foster court noted that the complaint did sufficiently allege in general terms that defendant knew that plaintiff physical problems were caused by the arsenic and that his injuries as reported to the company and well known to them were aggravated by continued exposure to arsenic in the drums.foster,supra,cal d at,italics added.
concluding that the complaint sufficiently alleged in general terms that the defendant employer knew of the plaintiff arsenic poisoning disease and that the injuries the plaintiff had reported to his supervisor were aggravated by continued exposure to arsenic at work,the foster court explained that w e are enjoined by statute to liberally construe pleadings with a view to achieving substantial justice between the parties.foster,supra,cal d at,citing code civ,the supreme court reasoned as follows 
these allegations fairly apprise defendant of the basis of plaintiff action.citation.since the complaint alleges that defendant knew plaintiff had contracted arsenic poisoning from his employment and concealed that knowledge from him,thereby aggravating his illness,it is sufficient to state a cause of action under section b.foster,supra,cal d at,italics added.
foster thus holds that an employee seeking to state a cause of action against an employer under section b must in general terms plead facts that if found true by the trier of fact,establish the existence of three essential elements the employer knew that the plaintiff had suffered a injury the employer concealed that knowledge from the plaintiff and the injury was aggravated as a result of such concealment.foster,supra,cal d at.foster also holds that in determining whether the allegations in a complaint are legally sufficient under section b,the trial court must liberally construe the pleading with a view to achieving substantial justice between the parties.foster,supra,cal d at,code civ.
applying the foregoing principles,we conclude the palestinis second amended complaint stated facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action for fraudulent concealment resulting in aggravation of louie palestini alleged injuries within the meaning of section b.
first foster pleading requirement 
under the first foster pleading requirement discussed,ante,the palestinis were required to plead in general terms facts showing that defendants knew that louie palestini had suffered a injury.foster,supra,cal d at.
the palestinis met this first pleading requirement.in their amended complaint,they allege facts showing that louie palestini was injured at work by chronic overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals.specifically,they allege 
during the years defendants employed him,louie palestini was continuously overexposed at work to chemical compounds containing carcinogens and 
defendants failed to provide protective devices and ventilation to prevent his exposure to those chemical compounds 
although some of his supervisors instructed him to wear gloves,the gloves would disintegrate and provide little or no protection against the absorption and toxicity of the carcinogenic chemicals 
toxins entered his body as a result of his exposure to those chemicals,and he and his fellow workers developed skin rashes,irritations,discoloration and numerous reactions to the chemicals 
the chronic overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals damaged the protective barrier of the skin,which allowed those chemicals to be directly absorbed into the body through the skin and lungs 
defendants never informed louie palestini of his overexposure to those chemicals or the damage such overexposure caused 
on several occasions,louie palestini inquired at work as to whether certain chemicals were safe for him to use,and he was repeatedly told the chemicals were safe and would not cause him any harm and 
the toxins that entered his body were substantial factors in bringing about his cancer.
defendants contend that louie palestini alleged injuries consisted only of skin conditions in the form of rashes,dermatitis,and discoloration,and metastasized testicular cancer that was diagnosed after his employment with defendant ended and resulted in the surgical removal of a testicle and additional surgeries to remove cancer around his prostate,heart and lungs.liberally construing the foregoing factual allegations,however,as we must foster,supra,cal d at,code civ,we reject this contention and conclude the palestinis have sufficiently pleaded facts showing that as an alleged result of chronic overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals at work during the many years he was employed by defendants,louie palestini suffered an industrial injury in the form of skin damage which he characterizes as a breakdown in his dermal barrier that,unknown to him,permitted those toxic chemicals to be injuriously absorbed into his body.a fair reading of the amended complaint as a whole shows the palestinis are also claiming that during a latency period that culminated with the diagnosis of his cancer after his employment ended the continuing chronic overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals that followed the initial injury caused further harm in the form of unspecified internal physiological injuries that ultimately developed into diagnosable metastatic testicular cancer.because the palestinis are required to plead only ultimate facts,not evidentiary facts,and they have sufficiently alleged in general terms both the nature of louie palestini initial industrial injury and the element of causation between the defendants alleged concealment discussed,post of that injury including the medical significance of the continued overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals and the development of diagnosable cancer,they are not required to specifically plead the nature of the internal physiological process by which the cancer developed.we note that although the pleaded skin rashes and discoloration may be viewed as injuries that louie palestini reported to the defendants through his supervisors,they also may be viewed as symptoms of the alleged dermal barrier breakdown and related injurious absorption of toxic chemicals that together constitute the initial industrial injury of which he was not aware.
the palestinis also met their burden of pleading in general terms facts showing that defendants knew that louie palestini was being harmed by chronic overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals,and thus had suffered a injury.specifically,the palestinis allege 
louie palestini and other employees were exposed to chemicals that were known to defendants to diminish the protective barrier of the skin causing absorption into the body to be directly absorbed through the lungs and skin and into the body 
defendants were well aware that the chemicals used by their employees could cause certain injuries,including skin irritations and reactions,and that louie palestini and other employees experienced continuing skin problems because of their exposure to the chemicals 
defendants were further aware that the skin problems louie palestini and other employees were suffering from were a precursor to the development of specific types of cancer which are caused by exposure to chemical substances that contain carcinogens and 
louie palestini complained about the skin rashes to his supervisor in and,and he complained about the skin discoloration to his supervisor in.
defendants knew they were overexposing him to carcinogens and knew this overexposure would cause,more probably than not,damage to him and 
defendants knew there was a high probability louie palestini would develop cancer if his chronic exposure to the chemical substances continued.
an employer actual knowledge of the existence of an employee injury connected with the employment is a necessary prerequisite to establishing a claim against the employer for fraudulent concealment under section b.foster,supra,cal d at,ashdown ameron internat.th,d.this principle is based on the rationale that an employer can not be held liable under section b for concealing something of which it had no knowledge.foster,supra,at.
here,the allegations that louie palestini reported to his supervisors that he was suffering from skin rashes and other symptoms,and that defendants knew he was being overexposed to carcinogenic chemicals and were aware those symptoms were a precursor to the development of cancer,are technically insufficient to allege that defendants had actual knowledge that louie palestini was suffering a dermal barrier injury and consequent injurious absorption of carcinogenic chemicals into his bloodstream through chronic overexposure to such chemicals.see foster,supra,cal d at.however,as already discussed,we are required by statutory and case law authorities to liberally construe the palestinis pleading with a view to achieving substantial justice between the parties.code civ,foster,supra,cal d at.the hughes aircraft case,supra,th,d,on which defendants rely,involved a ruling in a summary judgment proceeding based on evidence.the instant appeal,however,arose out of the court ruling on the legal sufficiency of the allegations set forth in the palestinis amended complaint.we conclude that the palestinis general allegations that defendants knew louie palestini physical problems were caused by his exposure at work to carcinogenic chemicals,that he reported those problems to his supervisors,and that defendants were well aware his exposure to those chemicals could harm him,are sufficient for pleading purposes to show that defendants knew he had suffered a injury.see foster,supra,cal d at.
second foster pleading requirement 
under the second foster pleading requirement,the palestinis were required to allege in general terms facts showing that defendants concealed their knowledge that louie palestini had suffered a injury.foster,supra,cal d at.
a review of the palestinis second amended complaint shows they met this second foster pleading requirement.they alleged 
defendants were aware of the causal relationship between louie palestini precursor conditions and the development of specific types of cancer which he developed,yet fraudulently concealed this knowledge from him 
defendants concealed from its employees the identity of chemical compounds they were working with and the fact that those chemicals were carcinogens 
defendants never informed louie palestini and his of their overexposure to chemicals or the damage such overexposure caused 
on several occasions,louie palestini inquired at work as to whether certain chemicals were safe for him to use,and he was repeatedly told the chemicals were safe 
defendants concealed the causal relationship and significance in chemical exposures,the development of skin conditions,including rashes,other forms of dermatitis,and skin discoloration,and louie palestini contraction of cancer 
defendants acts and omissions were done falsely and fraudulently with the intent to induce louie palestini to continue to work in a dangerous environment and without safeguards,protections,warnings,proper medical care and procedures aimed at reducing the risk of exposure and 
louie palestini was ignorant of the risks involved and would not have continued to work under such conditions,or to use the products in the manner or form requested by defendants if he had known the true facts.
if found true by the trier of fact,the allegations would establish that defendants concealed their knowledge that louie palestini was chronically overexposed at work to carcinogenic chemicals and as a result of that exposure he was being injured by those chemicals.
hughes aircraft.
defendants contend the palestinis have not alleged,and can not allege,facts showing that defendants concealed the existence of louie palestini injuries which they claim are limited to the skin injuries and cancer because the palestinis are required under the decision in hughes aircraft,supra,th,d,to allege facts showing that defendants knew of the injuries before louie palestini knew of them they further contend the palestinis have not alleged,and can not allege,facts sufficient to state a cause of action under section b because the factual allegations set forth in the amended complaint admit that louie palestini knew about his rashes,dermatitis and skin discoloration when they occurred,before he reported them to his supervisors and the palestinis have not alleged,and can not allege,that defendants actually knew that louie palestini had cancer at a time when he did not know he had that disease.we reject these contentions for several reasons.
first,defendants contentions are based on the premise that louie palestini injuries consisted only of his skin rashes and discoloration,and the testicular cancer.for reasons already discussed,however,a fair reading of the palestinis pleading shows that louie palestini alleged injuries were not limited to those skin conditions,which he claims he reported to his supervisors in and,and the cancer,which was diagnosed in october more than a year after his employment terminated in january louie palestini alleged injuries also included dermal barrier breakdown allegedly caused by chronic overexposure at work to carcinogenic chemicals,which resulted in the injurious absorption of carcinogens into his body through inhalation and skin contact with the chemicals.in this regard,the instant case is similar to the foster case discussed,ante,which involved allegations that the defendant employer knew that certain symptoms the plaintiff reported to his supervisor were symptoms of arsenic poisoning and concealed that knowledge from the plaintiff,thereby aggravating his illness through continued exposure to the arsenic.see foster,supra,cal d at.
second,defendants contentions are also based on the premise that the palestinis have not alleged,and can not allege,that defendants actually knew about all of louie palestini alleged injuries at a time when he did not know about them.although the palestinis allege in their amended complaint that louie palestini complained to his supervisors about certain skin conditions,there are no allegations to show that during the time he was employed by defendants,louie palestini reported or even knew that he was suffering dermal barrier injuries and related harmful absorption of carcinogenic chemicals through chronic exposure to the subject chemicals,or that he had contracted cancer.for reasons already discussed,we conclude the palestinis have sufficiently alleged facts showing for pleading purposes that defendants knew that louie palestini was being injured through chronic overexposure to carcinogenic chemicals and concealed that knowledge from him.in this regard,we again note the palestinis allegation that louie palestini inquired at work whether certain chemicals were safe for him to use,and he was repeatedly told the chemicals were safe and would not harm him.
third,defendants reliance on hughes aircraft,supra,th,d,is misplaced.unlike the instant case,hughes aircraft involved a summary judgment proceeding id.at,d.because hughes aircraft did not address the pleading requirements that must be met to state a cause of action under section b,it is procedurally distinguishable and inapposite.as already noted,the instant appeal is governed by the supreme court decision in foster,supra,cal d.
third foster pleading requirement 
under the third and last foster pleading requirement,the palestinis were required to allege in general terms facts showing that louie palestini injuries were aggravated as a result of defendants alleged fraudulent concealment of their knowledge of the existence of the injuries.foster,supra,cal d at.a review of the palestinis pleading shows they met this pleading requirement.the amended complaint alleges 
as a result of louie palestini continuous exposure to the chemical compounds,toxins entered his body.each toxin that entered his body was a substantial factor in bringing about,prolonging,and aggravating his cancer 
as a result of defendants alleged acts of concealment,louie palestini and his were deprived of the opportunity to take proper precautions to avoid exposure to such chemicals seek alternative employment where such exposure was eliminated minimized 
as a proximate result,louie palestini alleges he sustained long term chronic exposure to carcinogens that caused his cancer and 
as a proximate result of the acts and omissions of the defendants,louie palestini contracted cancer thereby further injuring his health,strength and activity 
the foregoing allegations,if found true by the trier of fact,would establish that as a result of defendants alleged acts of concealment discussed,ante,louie palestini was deprived of the opportunity to take proper precautions to avoid exposure to the carcinogenic chemicals at work and,as a proximate result,he continued to be chronically exposed to those chemicals,thereby prolonging and aggravating his alleged industrial injury and eventually resulting in his contraction of cancer.for purposes of section b,the testicular cancer,the surgical removal of a testicle,the stage iii metastatic cancer in the abdominal and chest areas,and the surgeries for the removal of cancerous growths around his prostate,heart and lungs constitute the alleged aggravation of louie palestini industrial injury as pleaded in the amended complaint.such allegations are sufficient to satisfy the third foster pleading requirement.
conclusion 
the factual allegations set forth in the palestinis amended complaint sufficiently allege paraphrasing foster,supra,cal d at,that defendants knew that louie palestini physical problems were caused by carcinogenic chemicals and that his injuries as reported to defendants and well known to them were aggravated by continued exposure to the carcinogenic chemicals.we hold that louie palestini has alleged facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action under section b,and darla palestini has properly asserted a related claim for loss of consortium damages.
in so holding,we find add
