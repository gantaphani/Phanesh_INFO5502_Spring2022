linda calvert claims that liberty life assurance company of boston liberty wrongfully terminated her disability ltd benefits in violation of the employment retirement income security act of erisa.see.after reviewing the administrative record,the district court granted liberty motion for judgment on the administrative record.calvert appeals.while we agree with most aspects of the district court opinion,we disagree with its ultimate conclusion.we find that liberty acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying calvert further ltd benefits,and,thus,reverse the district court judgment,and remand this matter for entry of judgment in favor of calvert.
background 
for years,calvert worked as a mortgage loan officer in the scottsville,kentucky branch of star bank.as a star bank employee,she participated in a disability insurance plan issued by liberty.
three time periods are relevant to the determination of benefits under this plan.first is the elimination period,a period of consecutive days of disability for which no benefit is payable.the second relevant time period covers the months thereafter.to be deemed disabled for this second time period,an employee must be unable to perform all of the material and substantial duties of his occupation.
after receiving ltd benefits for months,the plan definition of disabled becomes more strict.an employee is disabled under this final time period only if the employee is unable to perform,with reasonable continuity,all of the material and substantial duties of his own or any other occupation for which he is or becomes reasonably fitted by training,education,experience,age and physical and mental capacity.the insured employee bears the burden of proving his or her continuing disability.
in may,calvert suffered a back injury.on august,calvert underwent a lumbar laminectomy and diskectomy.when she was discharged following surgery,her treating physician,ray hester,noted that he planned to keep her off work probably six to eight weeks.calvert,in fact,never returned to work after her surgery.she applied for ltd benefits in february,which liberty authorized and made effective that same month.
although hester noted after a visit in may that calvert could t ry sedentary work,he was of the opinion a month later that calvert would never be able to work again.hester opinion was based,among other things,on and ct scans that indicated mild disc bulging and disc protrusion at the level.hester opined that severe limitations on calvert ability to sit,stand,or walk make it impossible for her to perform either her past work,as a loan officer,or other similar duties.
liberty asked harold smith,a neurosurgeon,to perform an independent medical evaluation of calvert in august.smith was concerned with the symmetrical nature of calvert symptoms,pain,weakness,loss of muscle control in limbs,and extremities on both sides and cautioned against any further surgery in light of that symmetry and her surgical history.smith also found that calvert suffered from certain limitations in her range of motion and ability to sit or stand for prolonged periods of time.despite these concerns,however,smith opined that calvert could possibly be employed with appropriate attention to breaks and gradual work conditioning program.he also recommended steroid injections,physical therapy,water aerobics.after receiving smith report,liberty continued to pay benefits to calvert.
during this time period,liberty informed calvert that her continued receipt of benefits was conditioned upon her making an application for benefits from the social security administration ssa,which she did.in september,ssa determined that calvert was totally disabled as of august.the ssa concluded that calvert could not perform her past relevant work as a loan officer,and did not have transferrable skills to perform other work within her residual functional capacity.specifically,the ssa found that 
hester medical assessment is consistent with the claimant medical treatment,objective findings upon testing,clinical findings,and subjective complaints of pain.as hester is the claimant treating neurosurgeon and has treated the claimant consistently over a year,he is in a better position to know the claimant limitations than the state agency physicians,who determined the claimant was capable of light exertional work.for this reason,the undersigned gives hester medical assessment controlling weight and adopts his assessment in this case.the claimant can not perform her past relevant work as a loan officer and does not have transferable skills to perform other work within her residual functional capacity based upon the claimant residual functional capacity for less than a full range of sedentary work,and vocational factors,there are no jobs existing in significant numbers that she can perform.
after she was awarded benefits by the ssa,liberty demanded reimbursement of a portion of the benefits previously paid to calvert on the grounds that the plan provides for a proportionate reduction in benefits whenever benefits are received from an alternative as the the same disability.liberty was reimbursed for a portion of the benefits paid between february and september,the date of the ssa award.thereafter,while liberty continued to pay calvert benefits,it apparently did so at a reduced level because of her simultaneous receipt of benefits from the ssa.
in april,liberty had calvert undergo a evaluation an fce to assess her level of functioning and to determine her ability to return to any occupation.rob pearse,an exercise physiologist and a certified ergonomic specialist,conducted the fce,after which he concluded that calvert could work,but that she should perform sitting tasks only occasionally and should avoid stooping or repeated bending.pearse also noted that calvert would need to change positions from sitting to standing frequently.sitting is her main functional limitation.
these results were used by a vocational rehabilitation specialist,mary titterington,in conducting a analysis for calvert.while titterington concluded that the majority of calvert most transferrable skills require extensive sitting beyond her tested tolerances,there were some tasks titterington felt calvert could perform requiring minimal exertion.a representative sampling of jobs meeting this limitation included drive thru bank teller customer service representative retail security guard cashier ii utility and government positions bank loan officer.following the analysis,liberty requested a survey to determine whether any of these occupations were available in calvert vicinity.a number of such jobs were found to exist.
in a letter dated june,liberty informed calvert that her ltd benefits were being discontinued because she did not meet the policy definition of disability beyond months.liberty determined,based upon the evaluation and the analysis that,with accommodations for her inability to sit or stand for long periods,or to stoop,bend or lift heavy items,calvert was capable of performing certain sedentary types of work.
in a letter dated august,calvert notified liberty that she was appealing its denial of further ltd benefits.accompanying calvert letter were two letters from hester attesting to her continued disability,a report of a ct scan performed by hester in july,a personal statement prepared by calvert in july,hester treatment notes covering the period between april and july,and a letter from hester dated august,responding to titterington report.
in his august,letter,hester reaffirmed his position that calvert was unable to perform any work,and stated that this lady requires the ability to lie down at times when the pain becomes worse,due to her increased activities and none of the positions listed in titterington report would allow that sort of activity.i think she is not able to do these jobs which have been listed.
in response to her appeal,liberty engaged morris soriano,a neurosurgeon,to review calvert medical records.soriano reported that there were no objective or clinical findings which support any restriction on calvert work activity.according to soriano,the primary diagnosis affecting calvert ability to work was her subjective complaints of lower back pain.soriano stated that o n an objective basis,it should be noted that calvert is capable of unrestricted work of any kind since she has always been objectively normal.indeed,soriano felt that calvert was,and had always been,able to perform her job as a loan officer full time without restriction or limitation.it is undisputed that,before reaching these conclusions,soriano never physically examined calvert.
after receiving soriano report,liberty upheld its denial of further ltd benefits to calvert.on november,liberty wrote to calvert counsel and stated that although calvert reports subjective complaints of low back pain,left hip and leg pain,the objective clinical findings do not establish that her reported low back pain is of a nature and severity which would prevent her from performing the material and substantial duties of her own occupation or other occupations identified above.there are no objective or clinical findings which support any restriction.emphasis added.
calvert subsequently filed a complaint,pursuant to erisa,in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky.the district court affirmed liberty determination,concluding that the denial of further ltd benefits was not arbitrary or capricious.this timely appeal followed.
standard of review

the parties agree that the plan at issue gives the plan administrator such discretionary authority.specifically,the plan provides that 
liberty shall possess the authority,in its sole discretion,to construe the terms of this policy and to determine eligibility hereunder.liberty decisions regarding construction of the terms of this policy and benefit eligibility shall be conclusive and binding.

the effect of liberty conflict of interest 
although we must review liberty denial of benefits to calvert under the highly deferential arbitrary and capricious standard,we must take into consideration the fact that liberty is acting under a potential conflict of interest because it is both the,determining which claims are covered,and also the payor of those claims.marks newcourt credit group,cir.liberty ultimate disability determination was based upon the fce of robert pearse and the file review of soriano,both of whom liberty selected and paid to assess calvert claim.as the plan administrator,liberty had a clear incentive to contract with individuals who were inclined to find in its favor that calvert was not entitled to continued ltd benefits.see,darland fortis benefits ins,cir.considering calvert age,payment of this claim beyond the month limitation period would be expensive for liberty.as the district court noted,there was an incentive for liberty to terminate coverage or deny the claim.under such facts,the potential for is evident.hosps.of cleveland emerson,cir.
the possible conflict of interest inherent in this situation should be taken into account as a factor in determining whether liberty decision was arbitrary and capricious.id.quoting davis kentucky finance.retirement plan,cir,cert.denied,d see also firestone tire and rubber,d darland,at whitaker hartford life and accident insurance,fed.appx,cir holding that a court is to factor an insurer dual role into its review under the arbitrary and capricious standard,though the standard remains arbitrary and capricious.while several courts have altered the standard of review to something less deferential than the arbitrary and capricious standard where a benefits administrator is operating under a conflict of interest see,adams thiokol,cir,this court has not taken that approach.instead,as noted,the standard remains unchanged and the conflict of interest is to be considered in applying that standard 
ssa determination of total disability 
calvert also contends that the ssa determination that she was totally disabled must be considered in determining whether liberty decision was arbitrary and capricious.indeed,calvert argues that the ssa determination conclusively proves that liberty decision was arbitrary and capricious.for this proposition,calvert primarily relies on darland,supra.in that case,this court found that it was inappropriate for the plan administrator to ignore the ssa award in making its benefits determination.this was true,the darland panel found,for two reasons because it believed that the plan administrator had failed to follow the treating physician rule,which generally requires deference to the opinions of treating physicians and because the plan administrator in darland had asked the claimant to apply for ssa benefits so as to concomitantly reduce its own payment obligations,effectively estopping it from arguing that the ssa determination was inaccurate.at.
calvert argues,that,as in darland,liberty gave insufficient weight to hester unequivocal opinion,and,again like darland,liberty required calvert to apply for social security benefits and then benefited from the ssa determination by seeking reimbursement for certain of the payments made to calvert in light of the ssa award.despite the obvious similarities between the facts here and those in darland,however,calvert asks us to read too much into darland.this is true for two reasons.
first,as noted,central to the first prong of darland holding was this court conclusion that erisa plan administrators are generally required,like the ssa,to give deference to the opinions of a claimant treating physician.that principle has since been rejected by the united states supreme court,however.in black decker disability plan nord,d,the supreme court held that,while plan administrators may not arbitrarily reject or refuse to consider the opinions of a treating physician,they are not obligated to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.id.at.thus,the treating physician rule followed in darland no longer applies in the erisa context see also whitaker,supra,fed.appx.at holding that an erisa plan administrator is not bound by an ssa disability determination when reviewing a claim for benefits.
this is not to say,however,as liberty argues,that the ssa determination is meaningless and should be entirely disregarded.while it is true that the ssa must apply the treating physician rule in its determinations,that rule provides that deference is to be given to the opinions of treating physicians over those of or reviewing physicians where,and only where,there is objective support for those opinions in the record.see cutlip secretary of,cir harris heckler,cir.hence,the ssa determination,though certainly not binding,is far from meaningless.as the court said in black decker,a plan administrator may not arbitrarily disregard the medical evidence proffered by the claimant,including the opinions of her treating physicians.at.here,the ssa determination,at a minimum,provides support for the conclusion that an administrative agency charged with examining calvert medical records found,as it expressly said it did,objective support for hester opinion in those records 
second,although liberty indeed benefitted from the ssa determination by seeking and receiving reimbursement from calvert for a portion of the payments it previously made to calvert,and it is clear that lib
