the county of san joaquin county petitions this court for a writ of review of the workers compensation appeals board board decision that james davis davis is a maximum wage earner for purposes of calculating his temporary and permanent disability indemnity benefits.
davis was employed by the state compensation insurance fund state fund as an attorney and paid a monthly salary of.while employed there,he was called for jury duty by the county,which paid jurors a day for jury service.on his first and only day of jury duty,davis sustained an admitted industrial injury to his lower back.he returned to work at state fund and continued to work there,suffering ongoing back pain.upon his application for temporary and permanent disability benefits,the board calculated his average weekly earnings based upon his salary at state fund,which entitled him to receive compensation at the maximum rate of pay.
the county contends the board erred in concluding davis is entitled to maximum rate benefits,arguing that the rate of pay is governed by labor code section,subdivision c that provision limits the injured worker average weekly earnings to the hourly rate received from the employer where the injury occurred.if that provision is applicable,davis indemnity benefits would be calculated at the minimum rate based upon the nominal juror fee paid by the county.
we find that provision is inapplicable however and conclude the board properly determined that section,subdivision c hereafter subdivision c sets forth the proper method for determining davis average weekly earnings.subdivision c provides that w here the employment is for less than hours per week,or where for any reason the foregoing methods of arriving at the average weekly earnings can not reasonably and fairly be applied,the average weekly earnings shall be taken at percent of the sum which reasonably represents the average weekly earning capacity of the injured employee at the time of his or her injury,due consideration being given to his or her actual earnings from all sources and employments.
this case is a prime example of one calling for application of section,subdivision c.we shall therefore affirm the board decision,order,and award 
factual and procedural background 
the facts are undisputed.davis was employed as an attorney at state fund and paid a monthly salary of.while employed there,he was called for jury duty by the county.he reported for duty at on november,where he sustained an admitted industrial injury to his lower back.he remained on duty until and returned to work at the state fund later that day.the county paid its jurors per day for jury service and sent davis a check for that amount,which he turned over to the state fund as required.code civ.davis continued to have back problems,underwent back surgery in early,and returned to work at state fund while continuing to receive treatment for back pain.
davis filed a claim against the county stk for the injury to his lower back on november,and a claim against state fund stk for cumulative trauma to his lower back through april.
the matter went to trial and after several hearings and reconsideration,the workers compensation judge wcj issued amended findings,award and order,determining that davis was temporarily totally disabled from january,to march,that at the time of injury,he earned a day for jury service and a month for his work at state fund,which produced a maximum temporary disability rate of per week and a maximum permanent disability rate of per week.see,subd.a and.in the opinion on decision,the wcj concluded that davis should be paid the maximum wage under section,subdivision c.
both parties filed petitions for reconsideration.the county claimed,inter alia,that the board erred by finding davis was a maximum wage earner for purposes of calculating his benefits because on the day he was injured,he worked for the county which paid him per day.as to that claim,the board denied the county petition,adopting and incorporating the wcj report and recommendation,in which she reaffirmed her decision that davis was a maximum wage earner at the time of his injury.in so doing,the wcj stated as follows,i ca think of anything more unreasonable and more unfair and more inconsistent with the reasoning of all relevant case law on this issue than to ignore davis earnings capacity as an attorney for state fund and limit him to the nominal daily stipend for calculation of his average weekly earnings.
on june,the county filed a petition for writ of review in this court cal,art.xiv,challenging the board determination that davis is entitled to be paid at the maximum disability rate 
discussion 
our review of the board decision upon a petition for writ of review is governed by section.in conducting that review,we may consider whether the board acted without or in excess of its powers,whether its order,decision,or award was unreasonable or unsupported by substantial evidence,and whether the findings of fact support the order,decision,or award.in reviewing questions of fact,we determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the board action unless its findings are unreasonable,illogical,improbable or inequitable in light of the overall statutory scheme.in reviewing questions of law,we review the board determination de novo.smith workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
the question raised by the county,whether section,subdivision c rather than subdivision c is the applicable method in determining davis average weekly earnings,is a question of law.the county does not claim the board order is unsupported by substantial evidence or that the evidence is insufficient to support the board findings of fact.
maximum rate of pay 
disability payments for temporary total disability and for permanent partial disability are computed at of the worker average weekly earnings,subd.b,gonzales workers comp.appeals bd.th,d herlick,cal.workers compensation law ed.average weekly earnings are determined under the provisions of section which provides four methods for making that calculation.pham workers comp.appeals bd.th,d pham gonzales workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.
although the statute uses the legal term average weekly earnings,it is well established that earning capacity remains the benchmark for determining average weekly earnings regardless of which statutory method is applicable.gonzales workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d west industrial acc.com.d,earning capacity is the touchstone in determining average earnings.
moreover,e arning capacity is not locked into a straitjacket of the actual earnings of the worker at the date of injury the term contemplates his general capability and productivity the term envisages a dynamic,not a static,test and can not be compressed into earnings at a given moment of time.the term does not cut capacity to the procrustean bed of the earnings at the date of injury.goytia workmen comp.appeals bd.cal d,goytia.
nevertheless,with respect to permanent employees,application of the first three statutory methods will generally result in a determination of earning capacity that is equivalent to the worker actual earnings.pham,supra,th at,d argonaut ins.industrial acc.com.cal d,montana.as the supreme court explained in goytia,supra,the legislature deliberately established earning capacity as the test for the fourth subdivision as distinguished from the actual earnings for the other three subdivisions.section provides for the computation of both temporary and permanent disability indemnity.subdivisions a,b,and c relate to employees,employees working for two or more employers,and employment at an irregular rate,such as piecework or work on a commission basis.each of those subdivisions provide for computation of average annual earnings for purposes of permanent disability indemnity based upon earnings prior to the injury.cal d at,fn.omitted.
by contrast,the fourth method,formerly subdivision d of section stats,ch,now codified in subdivision c,provides that when employment is for less than hours per week,or where for any reason the foregoing methods of arriving at the average weekly earnings can not reasonably and fairly be applied,the average wee
