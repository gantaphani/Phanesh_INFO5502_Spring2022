ferro corporation ferro terminated david goetzke in august on the ground that he had defrauded it by exaggerating the extent of a injury.in response to his termination,goetzke filed this action in state court against ferro and crawford company crawford,a administrator retained through ferro insurance carrier to administer worker compensation claims brought by ferro employees.in count i,goetzke alleged that ferro had terminated him in retaliation for filing a worker compensation claim.count ii of the complaint asserted that crawford had tortiously interfered in goetzke employment relationship with ferro.in count iii,goetzke alleged that ferro and crawford had conspired to end his employment.after removal of the case to the federal system,the district court granted summary judgment to ferro and crawford on all counts.for the reasons set forth in the following opinion,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
backgrounda.facts 
on august,goetzke sustained a injury to his lower back while employed at kiel chemical,a subsidiary of ferro corporation.upon learning of goetzke injury,ferro officials promptly filed a worker compensation claim on his behalf.over the next year,goetzke spent extended periods on medical leave from ferro as a result of the injury.
in the weeks following the injury,the company placed goetzke on light duty assigning him jobs that did not require heavy lifting.initially,the light duty required goetzke to train a fellow employee.although these sessions did not require any lifting,the assignment required goetzke to stand and to walk for substantial portions of a shift.roughly six days into this job,goetzke informed his foreman that the length of the shifts and nature of the assignment aggravated his back injury.after goetzke consulted with a physician,ferro moved him from light duty to sedentary duty a desk position.the new assignment required goetzke to work only an shift.
during september and,goetzke spent several days on medical leave.when goetzke returned from an excused absence in october,steve hartford,the company safety training supervisor,contended that he smelled alcohol on goetzke.ferro therefore ordered goetzke to undergo an alcohol test.the test,however,returned negative,and ferro never pursued this incident any further.
when his injury failed to improve,goetzke returned to medical leave in november.over the next ten months,goetzke clashed over his medical care with his doctors and crawford.goetzke particularly expressed frustration with betty foy,his case manager from crawford.goetzke believed that foy often clandestinely overruled his physicians prescribed course of treatment.as a case manager,foy not only monitored goetzke treatment but also served as an information conduit between his physicians and crawford claims adjustor.for instance,foy accompanied goetzke to his doctor appointments.at each appointment,the responsibility fell to her to clarify with the physicians when goetzke could return to work.in turn,she relayed this information to crawford adjustor and frequently to ferro steve hartford.
after physical therapy and injections failed to alleviate his pain,goetzke underwent back surgery in march.foy informed hartford that the recovery period for this procedure generally lasted three to four months.two months into his recovery,goetzke still complained of back pains to his physician.specifically,during a doctor appointment in may,goetzke informed his physician that he had not been the same since he had sneezed and then heard a popping noise in his back soon after the surgery.
upon receiving this information,steve hartford contacted yadwiga duncan,the crawford claims adjustor handling goetzke file.hartford believed that goetzke was now exaggerating his symptoms and requested that crawford hire an investigator to conduct surveillance of goetzke.pursuant to hartford request,crawford employed an investigator who recorded goetzke for two days in june.the surveillance recorded goetzke in a variety of activities including carrying and loading groceries into his vehicle.crawford for warded the tape to hartford.
meanwhile,concluding that goetzke had reached a plateau in his recovery his physician,in consultation with foy,scheduled a functional capacity evaluation fce for him.conducted by an independent physician evaluator,the fce is a battery of physical tests that assesses whether an injured employee is able to return to work and in what capacity.hartford requested that an investigator conduct surveillance of goetzke the day before the fce.this surveillance,conducted in,captured goetzke in a variety of activities.in particular,goetzke worked on his under the hood for several minutes.when the hood failed to close properly,goetzke repeatedly pressed down on it with both hands.the july tape also pictures goetzke stretching across the front seat of his truck while his feet dangled awkwardly from the vehicle.the tape was forwarded to ferro.
soon after,the evaluator performed the fce and sent the results to goetzke,ferro,crawford and betty foy.the cover letter of the fce stated goetzke did magnify his symptoms and his ability may be greater than what the data on the test indicates.dep,ex.in addition,the summary report noted thirteen inconsistencies between goetzke stated symptoms and his conduct during the evaluation.the evaluator assigned goetzke a on a scale of on the waddell symptom magnification evaluation one line of the full report,however,noted 
i t is my opinion that goetzke is unable to perform work at the medium level however,i do believe the client is magnifying the pain symptoms in an unconscious effort to control the environment.
dep,ex.although the report indicated that goetzke was limited in the range of tasks he could perform,the fce suggested that he be placed in a work hardening program to restore his capabilities.in conclusion,the report stated that if goetzke responds positively and improves quickly,i would release the client to return to work sooner than the prescribed period.dep,ex emphasis in original.accordingly,goetzke physician scheduled his patient for work hardening in.
in late july,approximately one week after receiving the results of the fce,goetzke filed an application for assistance with the indiana industrial board in this letter,goetzke questioned the quality of the care that he received.more precisely,he alleged that foy interfered with his doctor orders and failed to stay abreast of his test results.finally,goetzke challenged the fce as biased and inaccurat e.the letter made no reference to ferro.crawford learned of goetzke application for assistance on august.it relayed this information to hartford at ferro.
after completing his work hardening in,goetzke returned to work on light duty pursuant to his doctor orders.however,upon goetzke arrival at work,ferro officials informed him that he was being terminated for defrauding the company.according to company officials,the contents of the videotape and goetzke fce had warranted this action.
district court proceedings 
after his termination,goetzke filed this action against ferro and crawford in indiana state court.the complaint,which contained multiple counts,alleged that ferro discharged goetzke in retaliation for filing a worker compensation claim crawford had tortiously interfered in goetzke employment relationship with ferro and ferro and crawford had conspired to end goetzke employment.invoking the diversity jurisdiction of the district court,ferro and crawford removed the case to the federal system.once before the district court,ferro and crawford moved for summary judgment on all counts.ferro contended that,under indiana law,goetzke,an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement,could not raise a retaliatory discharge claim.in the alternative,it submitted that goetzke could neither demonstrate a causal connection between his termination and the filing of a worker compensation claim nor demonstrate the pretextual nature of ferro proffered reason for his termination.with regard to the tortious interference claim,crawford contended that,pursuant to an indiana exclusivity statute,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over this portion of goetzke complaint.in any event,according to crawford,goetzke had failed to establish the elements of the tort of tortious interference.finally,both ferro and crawford maintained that the record contained no evidence that indicated a civil conspiracy.
the district court entered summary judgment for ferro and crawford on all counts.as a threshold matter,the district court rejected ferro contention that goetzke could not maintain a retaliatory discharge action under indiana law.specifically,it concluded that a decision of the court of appeals of indiana had expressly allowed employees covered by collective bargaining agreements to bring retaliatory discharge claims.turning to the substantive aspects of goetzke complaint,the court found that he had failed to establish a causal nexus between his termination and the filing of his worker compensation claim.according to the district court,ferro had terminated goetzke solely on its belief that he defrauded the company.
in the view of the district court,a paucity of evidence existed with regard to the remaining claims.goetzke could not demonstrate that crawford and ferro had engaged in an unlawful retaliatory foreclosing the civil conspiracy claim.after rejecting crawford contention that federal courts lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the tortious interference claim,the district court concluded that goetzke had failed to prove the elements of the tort.at a minimum,no evidence existed to prove that crawford induced ferro to terminate goetzke.
discussiona.
we must first address ferro contention that indiana law does not permit goetzke to maintain a frampton action a claim alleging that an employer discharged its employee for filing a worker compensation claim.more precisely,ferro submits that a frampton claim is unavailable to former employees such as goetzke who were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at the time of their termination.the precise scope of a frampton action is a question of indiana law.we have stated that,when resolution of an issue depends on state law,we must apply the law that would be applied in this context by the state supreme court.home valu,pep boys,cir quoting mcgeshick choucair,cir.if the state supreme court has not addressed the matter,this court generally treat s decisions by the state intermediate appellate courts as authoritative unless there is a compelling reason to doubt that those courts have got the law right.home valu,at internal quotations and citations omitted.
because the supreme court of indiana has not addressed this precise issue,we turn to indiana intermediate appellate courts for guidance.in bentz metal products,stephans,the court of appeals of indiana considered and rejected ferro narrow construction of the frampton action.specifically,in bentz,the court concluded that employees covered by collective bargaining agreements at the time of their discharge may maintain frampton claims.see id.at.unless compelling evidence casts doubt on the bentz ruling,we treat it as authoritative concerning the scope of the frampton action.
ferro correctly notes that,in a diversity case decided prior to bentz,this court reached an opposite conclusion concerning the availability of a frampton action to this class of workers.see vantine elkhart brass,cir.in vantine,we emphasized that collective bargaining agreements adequately protected the goals and policies underlying indiana worker compensation scheme as such,we concluded that a frampton action was not available to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.see vantine,at.however,at the time of the vantine decision,the indiana courts had not addressed the question raised in that case.
over a decade later,we now have guidance from the indiana courts concerning the availability of the frampton action to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement.in bentz,the court of appeals of indiana expressly declined to follow our decision in vantine.see bentz metal prod,at.the indiana appellate court noted that we had not considered indiana precedent regarding the doctrine when reaching our conclusion.see id.just as importantly,it noted that,at the time vantine was decided,we did not have the benefit of the holding of the supreme court of the united states in lingle norge division of magic chef,d.in lingle,the supreme court held that an employee protected by a collective bargaining agreement that provides the employee with a contractual remedy for discharge without just cause may nevertheless seek a state remedy for retaliatory discharge for exercising rights under the state worker compensation statute.see lingle,at.given these developments,we believe that the proper course is for this court to follow the decision of the court of appeals of indiana in bentz.therefore,goetzke may maintain a frampton action even though he was covered by a collective bargaining agreement at the time of his termination 
we turn now to an examination of whether the district court properly granted summary judgment on goetzke frampton claim.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see thomas pearle vision,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c see celotex catrett,d.the court function is not to weigh the evidence but merely to determine if there is a genuine issue for trial.anderson liberty lobby,d.we must ask whether there are genuine factual issues that can properly be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.id.at.in assessing whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,we must construe all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see id.at.basith cook county,cir.
to maintain a frampton action,the plaintiff must establish a causal nexus between his termination and the filing of a worker compensation claim.see hamann gates chevrolet,cir markley,grover.the plaintiff must submit either direct or indirect evidence to satisfy this burden.see markley,at.because direct evidence frequently does not exist in these cases,a party usually must rely on indirect methods of proof.in particular,when considered with other circumstances,the temporal proximity between termination and filing of the worker compensation claim may satisfy the plaintiff burden in some cases.see hamann,at.in addition,retaliation may be inferred if the plaintiff demonstrates that the employer proffered lawful reason for the termination is patently inconsistent with the evidence before the court.markley,at.
goetzke contends that a reasonable jury could determine that ferro discharged him in retaliation for exercising his rights under indiana worker compensation scheme.in particular,he submits that a jury may infer ferro retaliatory intent based upon the close temporal proximity between his termination and his request for assistance from indiana industrial board.ferro responds that it had a legitimate reason for terminating belief he was defrauding the negating any inference of retaliatory intent.goetzke,however,contends that he has submitted sufficient facts to demonstrate the pretextual nature of ferro asserted reasons for his termination.
as an initial matter,we note that,in his application for assistance,goetzke does not mention any grievances against ferro.to the contrary,the request contains numerous complaints relating only to goetzke medical care and his desire for additional treatment the application largely objects to the conduct of his doctors and his case manager,foy.goetzke,however,contends that,if the ombudsman had ordered further treatment,the costs would have fallen on ferro rather than its insurance carrier or crawford.we note that goetzke never sets forth within any specificity why this conclusion is necessarily true.although he asks us to assume that ferro insurance carrier would pass the costs along to its insured in the form of higher premiums at some point in time,reaching this conclusion on this record is speculative at best.goetzke has failed to adduce evidence in support of his contention.
we next turn to goetzke temporal proximity arguments.we conclude that the temporal proximity between the filing of goetzke original worker compensation claim and his termination does not create an inference of retaliation.one year lapsed between goetzke termination and ferro decision to file a worker compensation claim on his behalf.although the indiana courts have indicated that a time lapse coupled with additional evidence of retaliation will defeat a motion for summary judgment,see,pepkowski life of.ins,they have not indicated whether a longer period of time would prove fatal to a plaintiff frampton claim.in analogous title vii cases,we have concluded time lapses similar to the one present in this case,without more,fail to create an inference of retaliation see paluck gooding rubber,cir time lapse fails to create an inference of retaliation.in fact,we have stated that substantial time lapse between protected activity and the adverse action is of any causal connection.johnson of claire,cir.analogizing goetzke case to this body of law,the timing between his termination and the filing of the original worker compensation claim provides no indication of retaliatory intent.
goetzke instead stresses the close temporal proximity,roughly thirty days,between his termination and his petition for assistance from indiana industrial board.according to goetzke,this fact creates a strong inference of ferro retaliatory intent.although ferro contends that its decision to terminate goetzke occurred before it learned of his application for assistance,the record does not support unequivocally this contention.we have reviewed the deposition testimony of both hartford and ferro director of human resources.neither individual could state definitively that the discharge decision preceded goetzke request for assistance from the industrial board.because we can not say with certainty that the termination decision predated the application for assistance,we turn to ferro contention that it had a legitimate,reason for discharging goetzke.
before goetzke filed his application for assistance,ferro possessed fce and surveillance tended to show that he was malingering.in particular,the videotapes capture goetzke in a variety of activities bending at the waist for several minutes while working on his car,pushing down forcefully and repeatedly on the hood of his car,and laying across the front seat of his vehicle while his feet dangled awkwardly outside of the truck.goetzke emphasizes that his conduct on the videotapes is not inconsistent wholly with the physical limitations noted on his fce.a layman,however,could interpret fairly goetzke physical capabilities as seen on the videotape as beyond those described in the fce.
in reaching its conclusion that goetzke was exaggerating the extent of his injury,ferro also relied on the con tents of the fce.at several points,the report notes that goetzke exaggerated his symptoms.indeed,the cover letter of the fce states in plain,simple terms that goetzke did magnify his symptoms and his ability may be greater than what the data on the test indicates.dep,ex.another portion of the report notes thirteen apparent inconsistencies between goetzke professed and actual physical capabilities.one portion of the report does indicate that goetzke unconsciously failed to use full efforts during the fce the ferro officials responsible for reviewing the fce testified that they could not remember reading this latter portion of the report,and,further testified that even if they had read it,this language would not have altered their assessment of goetzke in light of the other portions of the document.arguably,ferro officials may have been negligent in failing to read the entire report or in relying solely upon those portions of the fce that they considered unequivocal.however,indiana law does not render a company liable for retaliatory discharge because it used poor judgment.rather,a frampton action may only succeed upon proof of the employer retaliatory intent.ferro failure to read the entire report may indicate negligence on the company part,but it does not indicate pretext.
goetzke raises several other contentions in an effort to demonstrate the pretextual nature of ferro asserted rationale for his termination.some evidence exists that foy,the nurse managing goetzke case,believed that goetzke neither had attempted to defraud ferro nor was malingering.goetzke also alleges that he was on pain medication during the periods in which he was videotaped.he submits that the medication accounts for any increased physical activity depicted on the videotapes.the contentions concerning both foy and goetzke medicated state suffer from a common deficiency ferro officials apparently knew of neither piece of evidence at the time they terminated goetzke.in particular,the record provides no indication that foy ever communicated her views to ferro officials prior to goetzke termination.similarly,goetzke has offered no evidence that indicates ferro officials were aware he was on pain medication at the time the surveillance occurred.in the context of title vii cases,this court has stated that the question is not whether the evaluation was right but whether the employer description is honest.gustovich v.at t communications,cir.similarly,this evidence attempts to challenge the accuracy,as opposed to the honesty,of ferro asserted reasons for discharging goetzke.this is an insufficient basis to demonstrate the pretextual nature of ferro proffered reasons for his termination 
finally,goetzke notes several other incidents that he contends create an inference of ferro retaliatory intent.first,he points to the october incident in which ferro tested him for alcohol consumption.ferro ordered the test only after a supervisor thought he smelled alcohol on goetzke.goetzke tested negative,and,notably,ferro never ordered him to take another alcohol test and took no additional adverse action against him as a result of this incident.simply put,this evidence is not probative of his retaliatory discharge claim.
goetzke also contends that,in retaliation for filing his worker compensation claim,ferro transferred him during september to a position that required him to work shifts.as a result of his injury,ferro transferred goetzke to a light duty position,and this position initially entailed a shift.this assignment,however,required less strenuous activity than did his original position with ferro.moreover,once goetzke informed his employer that the lengthy shift bothered his back,ferro sent him to the doctor and immediately assigned him to an shift.in total,goetzke worked six shifts over a period of four months.again,this evidence does not establish that ferro articulated reason for the discharge was pretextual.indeed,the absence of any evidence of pretext is,standing alone,sufficient to justify the grant of summary judgment on goetzke frampton claim.
we must now examine whether the district court properly granted summary judgment on goetzke allegation that ferro and crawford conspired to terminate him.we conduct a de novo review of the district court determination.
goetzke maintains that ferro and crawford conspired to terminate his employment for filing a worker compensation claim a civil conspiracy is defined as a combination of two or more persons,by concerted action,to accomplish an unlawful purpose or to accomplish some purpose,not in itself unlawful,by unlawful means.see huntington mortgage debrota.goetzke maintained that ferro and crawford conspired to commit an unlawful him for filing a worker compensation claim.we already have determined that the district court properly granted summary judgment on goetzke frampton claim.it follows that it is impossible that ferro and crawford engaged in the alleged unlawful conspiratorial conduct.because goetzke can not prove the necessary illegal purpose of the conspiracy,his conspiracy claim must fail.
even if we are in error in our affirmance of the summary judgment on the frampton cla
