anthony baker,an employee of flowers construction company,was injured in a collision with a truck driven by an employee of rocha trucking.because he was injured in the course and scope of his employment,baker filed a claim for workers compensation benefits with argonaut insurance company,flowers workers compensation insurance carrier.at the time,flowers had a deductible plan that provided for flowers to the first of loss arising from each injury suffered by its employees.under the policy,argonaut would first apply any recovery from a liable third party to benefit payments made by argonaut in excess of the deductible,and the remainder of any recovery would be applied to reduce the deductible amount flowers owed.
insurance code article c governs optional deductible plans such as the one flowers purchased.flowers deductible plan provided for argonaut to pay the full amount of each covered claim submitted by an employee,including any portion payable from flowers deductible,as mandated by article c a deductible policy must provide that the carrier will make all payments for benefits that are payable from the deductible amount and that reimbursement by the policyholder shall be made periodically,rather than at the time claim costs are incurred.c d.argonaut paid a total of in workers compensation benefits to and on behalf of baker,including the paid from the deductible.

ii.analysis 
when both parties move for summary judgment and one motion is granted and one denied,the appellate court should determine all questions presented and render the judgment that the trial court should have rendered.city of garland dallas morning news.here,both parties rely on statutory provisions to support their entitlement to summary judgment.in general,matters of statutory construction are questions of law.id.at.
argonaut relies on sections and of the labor code for its right to reimbursement for the full.those sections provide that i f a benefit is claimed by an injured employee or the legal beneficiary of the employee,the insurance carrier is subrogated to the rights of the injured employee and t he net amount recovered by an employee in a action shall be used to reimburse the insurance carrier for benefits,including medical benefits,that have been paid for the compensable injury.thus,according to argonaut,because it paid in benefits for the compensable injury,section requires reimbursement from the settlement funds for the full paid.
on the other hand,the bakers contend that allowing argonaut to recover the from the settlement funds effectively passes the cost of the deductible from the employer to the employee,a result article c prohibits.article c,which governs optional deductible plans,provides that employers must reimburse the insurance carrier periodically to cover benefit payments that are payable from the deductible amount and expressly forbids the employee from having to pay the deductible.c d,f.thus,the bakers argue,an insurance carrier that has paid benefits to an injured employee may obtain reimbursement of any amounts in excess of the deductible from the employee recovery,but must then look to the employer for reimbursement of the deductible amount under those provisions.otherwise,they contend,employers will receive a statutorily forbidden windfall by being allowed to pass on to their employees the cost of the deductible.the court of appeals agreed with the bakers,concluding that article c prohibition on the employee being made to pay the deductible,coupled with its requirement that the employer reimburse the carrier for benefits paid to the extent of the deductible amount,precludes argonaut from obtaining reimbursement from the settlement funds for the paid from the deductible.
because this case turns on the construction of several statutory provisions,we start with the provisions themselves.we construe a statute,first,by looking to the plain and common meaning of the statute words.fitzgerald advanced spine fixation.under article c section e,a carrier offering a deductible plan is statutorily obligated to service all claims that arise during the policy period,including those claims payable,in whole or in part,from the deductible amount.c e.likewise,section d provides that the carrier must make all payments for benefits that are payable from the deductible.id.c d.thus,benefits payable from the deductible are included in the amount of workers compensation benefits paid by the carrier to or on behalf of the injured employee.further,section of the labor code plainly states that the net amount recovered by a claimant in a action shall be used to reimburse the insurance carrier for benefits that have been paid for the compensable injury.emphasis added.section does not limit the carrier right to reimbursement to those payments made in excess of the deductible amount.thus,taken together,these provisions establish the carrier right to reimbursement to the total amount of benefits it has paid,including those benefits payable from the deductible.
the bakers contend,however,that allowing the full reimbursement required by section conflicts with article c mandate that the employee may not be required to pay any part of the deductible.they further argue that their construction,which limits the carrier recovery to benefits paid in excess of the deductible,effectively harmonizes article c with section.to the contrary,their construction conflicts with the plain language of section,which,under the payment scheme established by article c,allows the carrier reimbursement of benefits paid,including benefits payable from the deductible,from any recovery.
rather than conflicting with section,argonaut position is consistent with its plain language.moreover,allowing argonaut reimbursement of the total does not contravene article for decades,the law has been that,under the workers compensation act subrogation provision,the first money paid to or recovered by the employee,or his representatives,belongs to the compensation carrier paying the compensation,and until it is paid in full,the employee,or his representatives,have no right to any funds.fort worth lloyds haygood.the carrier right to reimbursement from the first money recovered is statutory.see.b providing that the carrier shall reimburse itself first from the amount recovered,and then pay the remainder to the injured employee or the legal beneficiary.under this principle,any recovery from a third party by the injured employee is burdened by the carrier subrogation rights to the extent of any payments made.a,b.workers comp.ins.fund serrano.thus,rather than the employee owning the money and being forced to disgorge it,the carrier is first entitled to the money up to the total amount of benefits it has paid,including from the deductible,under section.when the carrier is fully reimbursed from the recovery from a liable third party,as in this case,the money is being paid to the carrier by that responsible third party,not by the employee,pursuant to the carrier statutory right.accordingly,the employee is not being made to pay the employer deductible in violation of article c f.similarly,allowing the insurance carrier reimbursement for the total amount of benefits paid does not violate section of the labor code,which bars an employer from collect ing from an employee,directly or indirectly,a premium or other fee paid by the employer to obtain workers compensation insurance.
presumably,when the legislature enacted article c in,it was aware of section and similar prior statutes establishing the carrier right to subrogation for benefits paid.see acker.water comm n,a statute is presumed to have been enacted by the legislature with complete knowledge of the existing law and with reference to it.there is no indication in article c that the legislature intended to change existing law regarding subrogation and recovery.accordingly,article c should be construed in a manner that harmonizes rather than conflicts with that law.see.gov t code a if a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,the provisions shall be construed,if possible,so that effect is given to both.
thus,section applies equally to all subrogation claims to allow the carrier to be reimbursed from a recovery for all benefits it has paid,regardless of whether a deductible is involved.under the bakers and the dissent construction,which would prohibit the carrier reimbursement from a recovery for payments made from the deductible amount,an injured employee recovery would vary depending on whether his employer had a deductible plan and on the size of that deductible.in fact,under such an approach,if an employer chose to forego a deductible plan and pay higher premiums,its injured employee would receive less money out of a recovery than if the employer chose a deductible plan and paid lower premiums.we think it unlikely that the legislature intended that result.instead,section c f does not apply when the recovery from a tortfeasor is sufficient to reimburse the carrier for all benefits it has paid,including from the deductible.but its inclusion in article c was necessary to prevent employers from requiring employees to pay the deductible amount when there is no recovery or when the recovery is insufficient to fully reimburse the carrier.because the employer must then reimburse the carrier for all or part of the deductible amount because it is not being paid by a tortfeasor,section c f prohibits the employer from requiring the injured employee to pay that deductible.
our construction is consistent with the texas department of insurance position.the department is the agency legislatively charged with regulat ing the business of insurance in this state and ensur ing that the insurance code and other laws regarding insurance and insurance companies are executed.rule xix of the department publication texas basic manual of rules,classifications and experience rating plan for workers compensation and employers liability insurance reprint provides that i n the event the insurer makes a recovery from a third party through subrogation,the amount recovered shall first be applied to the amount paid on the claim by the insurer and then to the amount of the deductible paid by the insured,with reimbursement being made to the insured,if necessary.id.at.this construction is reasonable and consistent with the statute plain language,and is therefore entitled to serious consideration.tarrant appraisal dist.moore.
iii.conclusion 
in sum,we conclude that argonaut must be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds for the benefits it has paid to and on behalf of baker,including those paid from the deductible.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment in part and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
the facts of this case are perhaps no different than any other case in which a third party injures someone covered by worker compensation insurance,and in accord with its statutory subrogation rights,the worker compensation insurer seeks to recoup benefits paid.but there is one essential difference in this case that the court discusses but then is,that anthony baker employer,flowers construction company,chose an insurance plan with an optional deductible of,but then did not pay any part of that deductible to its workers compensation carrier,argonaut insurance company.by choosing a deductible plan,flowers received a substantial premium discount of over.but also by choosing a deductible plan,flowers bound itself to pay the deductible amount to argonaut under texas insurance code c d.see.c d.
the court,however,permits argonaut to recover the amount of the deductible from anthony settlement,instead of from flowers,even though flowers is legally responsible under the insurance code for paying the deductible,and has not done so.in so holding,the court accepts argonaut contention that the deductible is not relevant,and treats this case as if article c simply does not exist.this result is contrary to the statutory scheme governing optional deductible plans.more troubling,this result is based on the fiction that argonaut is asserting its own subrogation right with regard to the deductible,when it is actually asserting flowers putative subrogation right.flowers,however,as an employer,does not have any subrogation interest under the express terms of the labor code.see.b.thus,the court has shifted the risk represented by the employer choice of a deductible policy from the employer to the employee,which the legislature has plainly forbidden,and created statutory subrogation rights in favor of the employer,which the legislature has plainly not provided.accordingly,i respectfully dissent.
in its overhaul of the worker compensation system,one of the legislature primary goals was to reduce the cost of worker compensation insurance and bring more employers into the system.see ashcraft alessandra,a review of the new texas workers compensation system.tech,montford et,a guide to texas workers comp reform,at.as part of its efforts to achieve that goal,the legislature amended the insurance code to authorize,among other reforms,premium incentives for small employers,group insurance,certified,and certain insurance arrangements,including retrospectively rated policies and optional deductible plans.act of,ch.laws montford,supra,at.a deductible plan allows an employer to reduce its premium by agreeing to reimburse the insurer for benefits the insurer pays to
