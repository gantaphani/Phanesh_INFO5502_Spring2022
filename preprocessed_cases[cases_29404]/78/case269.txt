albina engine machine albina petitions for review of a decision of the benefits review board the board upholding the administrative law judge alj ruling that albina is liable for payment of death benefits to karen mcallister claimant under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act the lhwca,et.claimant is the widow of james mcallister decedent,who died of mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos during his work as a carpenter for three shipyard employers,one of which was albina.albina argues that the board misconstrued existing law on the burden of proof in lhwca proceedings against multiple employers,misapplied the last employer rule,and upheld the alj decision that was not supported by substantial evidence.albina further contends that liability for payment of benefits should have been assigned instead to lockheed shipbuilding lockheed,another of decedent former employers.we have jurisdiction under c and grant the petition for review,concluding that lockheed is liable for the payment of benefits.
background 
in,decedent worked as a shipyard carpenter in the vicinity of portland,oregon,first for willamette iron steel wisco and then for albina.in,decedent moved to seattle and worked in a similar capacity at a predecessor company to lockheed.decedent ceased maritime employment in.he died in of mesothelioma.claimant,his widow,filed a claim for death benefits pursuant to of the lhwca,against lockheed,albina,and wisco.
all parties stipulated that decedent injuries occurred while he was employed at a maritime situs,that his death was due to mesothelioma caused by exposure to asbestos,and that the examining pathologist would,if called to testify,state that any level of exposure to asbestos can cause mesothelioma.the principal remaining issue to be decided by the alj at trial was the question of which,albina or be liable for the payment of benefits.a trial was held before alj paul mapes alj mapes in february,and in july,alj mapes issued a decision finding lockheed liable.the board reversed and remanded in an opinion issued on august,mcallister i.on remand,alj mapes again found lockheed liable.the board again reversed and remanded in an opinion issued on april,mcallister ii.on the second remand,the case was heard by alj steven berlin alj berlin,who found albina liable for the payment of benefits.the board affirmed in a decision issued on december,mcallister iii.
the three opinions of the board contain the following statements of the law with respect to how liability should be assigned in an lhwca case involving multiple employers 
the section a presumption set forth in a is invoked only on behalf of a claimant,and not against a particular employer.mcallister i at.
once the a presumption is invoked,the alj must then weigh relevant evidence with respect to all potentially responsible employers to determine which is liable for payment of benefits.mcallister ii at.
the last employer rule,adopted by this court in cordero triple a mach.shop,cir,which assigns liability for payment of benefits to the injured employee last covered employer,does not mean that the last employer bears any special burden of proof.instead,once a claim has been established as compensable,each potentially liable employer bears the same burden of proving,by a preponderance of the evidence,either that the claimant was not exposed to injurious stimuli at that employer in sufficient quantities to cause his disease,or that the claimant was exposed to injurious stimuli while working for a subsequent covered employer.the alj should consider the evidence with respect to all employers simultaneously.mcallister ii at.
if no employer manages to persuade the alj that its evidence is entitled to greater weight,then the alj should assign liability to the claimant last employer.mcallister ii at.
in keeping with the board instructions,on the board second remand,alj berlin weighed all of the evidence regarding decedent exposure to asbestos at the three employers and determined that lockheed evidence is entitled to greater weight.alj berlin noted that wisco admitted that decedent was exposed to asbestos in its employ,and that decedent had done essentially identical work for albina as he did for wisco,but that the evidence of asbestos exposure at lockheed was weaker.alj berlin determined that lockheed had met its burden of showing more likely than not the absence of exposure during decedent employment with lockheed,and that there was no preponderance of evidence showing an absence of exposure at albina.because decedent worked for albina after he worked for wisco,alj berlin found albina liable for the payment of benefits.the board affirmed.
albina timely petitioned for review.at the request of this court,the director of the office of workers compensation programs the director filed a supplemental brief setting forth the director views on the case.
ii.analysis 
standard of review 
we review decisions of the board for errors of law,and failure to adhere to the statutory standard governing the board review of alj decisions,which is one of substantial evidence.todd pac.shipyards,owcp picinich,cir.the board interpretation of the lhwca is not entitled to any special deference.port of portland,owcp ronne,cir.this court does,however,defer to the statutory interpretations of the director,owcp palmer coking coal manowski,cir.
burden of proof 
albina argues that the board erred in placing on each employer the burden of establishing that it was not the responsible employer,and suggests that the board also erred in concluding that the a presumption applies to the claim,rather than to specific employers.
section a presumption 
the a presumption provides i t shall be presumed,in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary t hat a claim for compensation comes within the provisions of the lhwca.a.in order to invoke the presumption,a claimant must allege that he has been injured and that the injury arose both in the course of and out of employment.indus.fed.sheet metal,owcp,see also sprague,owcp,cir volpe ne.marine terminals,cir.a claimant must offer some evidence of both factors.see brown cont l baking ins.of,in order to come within the section presumption,all the claimant need adduce is some evidence tending to establish the prerequisites of the presumption.see also ramey stevedoring servs.of,cir holding that uncontradicted testimony by the claimant regarding working conditions is sufficient evidence to invoke the a presumption the employer may then overcome the presumption by presenting substantial evidence to rebut the claim that the injury is,that it arose in the course of and out of the claimant employment.ramey,at see also volpe,at.if the employer succeeds in rebutting the presumption,the alj must then evaluate whether the evidence as a whole justifies the awarding of benefits.id.the claimant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence.bath iron works,at.
contrary to the board repeated statements in its decisions in this case,the a presumption is relevant to the question of liability in a case,and not just to the question of whether a claim is compensable in the first instance.it is illogical to state,as the board does,that a applies only to the compensability of a claim,and not to the question of the liable employer,because of the nature of the prima facie case that a claimant is required to make under a.the presumption is invoked only if a claimant alleges that his injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.it is implicit in this language that the employment referred to is employment with a particular employer,against whom a claim has been filed.where only a single employer is claimed against,the claimant would of course not be able successfully to assert a claim that fell within the a presumption on the basis of evidence relating to employment with some other employer that was not claimed against.similarly,in a claim against multiple employers,the claimant should be expected to make out a prima facie case against all of the employers if the claimant fails to make such a case against one employer,the presumption should not apply against that employer.
additionally,removing the a presumption from the determination of the liable employer,as the board held,threatens to violate c of the administrative procedure act apa.apa c states that,e xcept as otherwise provided by statute,the proponent of a rule or order has the burden of proof.d.the supreme court has held that apa c applies to adjudications under the lhwca,owcp greenwich collieries.under the rule in greenwich collieries,the a presumption is a legitimate statutory exception to apa c,but the true doubt rule previously applied by the director,which shifted the burden of persuasion to the party opposing a benefits claim even when the a presumption did not apply,violated apa c.id.at.the board in this case held that each employer bears a burden of proof in the determination of liability in a suit.mcallister iii at.but it is unclear where that burden of proof can come from if not the a presumption.if the burden is imposed other than pursuant to statute,it is invalid under apa c and greenwich collieries 
this and other courts have relied on a to reach the conclusion as to which of several employers is liable for lhwca benefits.see ramey,at applying a a analysis to the question of whether the claimant had proved that he was exposed to injurious stimuli while working at a particular employer,where the parties agreed that the claimant claim was compensable norfolk shipbuilding drydock faulk,cir determining which of two potentially responsible employers is liable for payment of benefits through an analysis derived from a.
the board cites marinette marine,owcp,cir,as support for its assertion that a applies only to the claim,and not to individual employers.the board itself has also previously so held.
see buchanan int l transp,wl,at dol ben,march,lins ingalls shipbuilding,wl dol ben,at susoeff stevedoring,wl,at dol ben.however,the board interpretation of the proper application of a did not determine the outcome in those prior holdings.in buchanan,there was no question as to whether the claimant had sustained an injury in the employ of all employer parties.buchanan,wl,at.lins concerned an attempt by one employer to invoke the a presumption against a subsequent employer where the claimant had not filed a claim against that subsequent employer the board rightly rejected that attempt.lins,wl,at.in susoeff,only one employer was claimed against,and the key issue was whether it was the claimant burden to show that the employer against whom a claim was filed was the last responsible employer.susoeff,wl,at.as for marinette marine,we respectfully disagree with the its holding on the application of the a presumption.the seventh circuit cites only buchanan in support of its holding and does not cite or discuss greenwich collieries on this issue.
rational connection rule 
albina also argues that the imposition of a burden of proof on all employers violates the rational connection rule of this court,which states that liability may not be assigned to an employer who could not,even theoretically,have contributed to the causation of the disability.ronne,at see also cordero,at.that objection would be valid only if a burden of proof is imposed on all employers based on evidence relevant only to one.alj mapes did apply the a presumption in that way in his second opinion reluctantly,as he believed that this was what the board called for in mcallister i,but that application was in error and,in any event,was reversed in mcallister ii.the application of the presumption described above,in which the presumption is imposed only on employers with respect to whom the claimant offers some evidence,does not threaten any violation of the rational connection rule.
c.last employer rule 
albina also argues that the board erred by holding that the burden of each employer to persuade the alj that it is not liable is not sequential but is simultaneous,and that the board should weigh all of the evidence regarding all of the employers in one analysis.mcallister ii at.albina asserts that the evidence regarding each employer should have been analyzed sequentially instead,with the most recent employer analyzed first,and with liability assigned to the employer to be found responsible for exposing decedent to asbestos.
albina position is that a sequential analysis is the correct application of the last employer rule.the last employer rule dictates that the employer during the last employment in which the claimant was exposed to injurious stimuli should be liable for the full amount of the award.travelers ins.cardillo,cir.that rule was first applied by this court in cordero,at,and has been reiterated in a number of our other decisions.see ronne,at picinich,at lustig dep t of labor,cir todd shipyards black,cir.the last employer rule is justified by the policy consideration of administrative convenience and by the theoretical likelihood that all employers will be the last employer a proportionate share of the time.cordero,at.
the director agrees with albina that the correct way to apply the last employer rule is to analyze the evidence regarding each employer separately and sequentially.the director argues that i mposing simultaneous burdens results in uncertainty and confusion,and may lead to anomalous or inconsistent results,and that,if the board approach is adopted,it is unclear who bears the risk of between any two potentially liable employers.this court accords considerable deference to the director interpretations of the lhwca.ship serv,owcp,cir manowski,at.when the interpretations of the director and the board conflict,we favor those of the director.ronne,at mcdonald,owcp,cir.
the policy arguments for the sequential analysis are also compelling.the point of the last employer rule is to simplify the alj analytical task and the task of the board and the courts in reviewing the alj analysis so that a claimant may receive benefits quickly.the sequential approach accomplishes this goal,because it establishes clearly which of the potentially liable employers bears the burden of proof and because,if the last employer claimed against is determined to be a responsible employer,the alj need not analyze the evidence regarding earlier employers.in contrast,a simultaneous analysis runs the risk of engaging the alj in irrelevant questions,such as to use examples drawn from this case whether the evidence of exposure at albina is far greater than at lockheed or whether the evidence of asbestos exposure at albina is not as strong as at wisco.as the director points out,the sequential approach also makes it easier for a potential employer to anticipate its potential liability,based on its position in the sequence.see tahara matson terminals,inc,cir the compensation scheme set forth in the lhwca recognizes the employers interest in having their contingent liabilities identified as precisely and as early as possible.quoting potomac power,owcp.we conclude that the board erred in adopting a simultaneous analysis approach.
lockheed contends that the sequential approach would convert the last employer rule from administrative to evidentiary from a rule grounded in convenience and speed of recovery to one of narrowly focused burdens.we are not persuaded.a sequential analysis does not affect the burdens of proof already in place.as lockheed admits,once the a presumption is established,all potentially responsible employers have a burden to disprove liability.a sequential analysis merely relieves the alj of the trouble of formulating a reasoned opinion regarding whether earlier employers have disproved liability if a later employer has failed to do so.
the board relies on picinich as support for its position that the analysis should be simultaneous,not sequential.in picinich,this court overturned a decision of the board assigning liability to a employer at which the claimant had been exposed only to minimal quantities of asbestos,and assigned liability instead to the earlier employer.picinich,at.the crux of that case,however,was not the mode of analysis,but instead whether or not an employer may be found liable if it was not found responsible,if the employee was not even exposed by that employer to i
