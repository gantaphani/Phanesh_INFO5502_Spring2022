the defendant,patrice hurn,was an employee of the united states postal service who painted as a hobby.she had a website advertising her painting services.on december,she submitted a claim for disability due to carpal tunnel syndrome that she alleged was caused by her job.although her claim was initially accepted,in may,postal inspectors opened an investigation to examine the possibility that she had committed workers compensation fraud.in august,the postal service offered her a new job to accommodate her disability,but she sent them a letter stating that she did not have the physical capacity to perform the duties of that job,and that it was too far away for her to drive to.
as part of the ongoing investigation of hurn,two undercover postal inspectors separately hired her at different times to paint pictures of their pets.they paid her a total of approximately she gave one of the agents a professionally printed receipt.shortly after each transaction,the postal service sent her a form in connection with her workers compensation benefits,which required her to report any outside income she had received.both times,she failed to report her income from her paintings on the forms.
on september,a federal grand jury indicted hurn for three counts of violating,which prohibits making false statements in connection with federal worker compensation programs.count i was based on her letter to the postal service claiming she was unable to perform the duties of the new job which she had been offered.counts ii and iii were for the two forms on which she neglected to report her income from painting.hurn pled not guilty.she was tried before a jury,convicted on all counts,and sentenced to five months imprisonment.
part ii of this opinion considers hurn challenge to the adequacy of the district court jury instructions.part iii turns to her claim that the district court violated her right to a fair trial by excluding a critical defense witness.finally,part iv considers the sufficiency of the evidence to support her convictions under counts ii and iii.
hurn first contends that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury to determine whether her false statements actually led to her receiving over in workers compensation benefits.provides,whoever knowingly and willfully makes a false,fictitious,or fraudulent statement or representation in connection with the application for or receipt of compensation or other benefit or payment under a federal program shall be guilty of perjury.the statute goes on to state,
o n conviction thereof the defendant shall be punished by a fine under this title,or by imprisonment for not more than years,or both but if the amount of the benefits falsely obtained does not exceed,such person shall be punished by a fine under this title,or by imprisonment for not more than year,or both.
the maximum sentence to which a defendant is subject depends on the amount of benefits she falsely obtained.in apprendi new jersey,d,the supreme court held that o ther than the fact of a prior conviction,any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.under apprendi,for a defendant to be subject to a rather than a maximum sentence under,the jury must determine that the amount of benefits she falsely obtained exceeds.in the instant case,the court instructed the jury that it could not convict unless the amount of benefits falsely obtained by hurn exceeded.this instruction satisfies apprendi due process requirements.
hurn maintains that this instruction was insufficient,however,because it did not require the jury to find that a causal link existed between her false statement and her receipt of more than in workers compensation benefits.she argues that the district court should have asked the jury whether,because of the false statement or report,hurn obtained more than in federal worker compensation funds.we agree with hurn that the plain meaning of the statute requires that the jury find such a causal link for a defendant to be subject to the statute enhanced penalty regime.we believe that the instructions given,however,satisfy this requirement.the court asked the jury whether the amount of benefits falsely obtained exceeded.a reasonable juror would be likely to conclude that a benefit is obtained falsely if it is obtained as a result of a fraudulent or misleading statement or omission.therefore,the instruction as given fairly includes the causation requirement to which the defendant points.moreover,because the instruction was essentially lifted from the text of the statute,it would be almost impossible for us to conclude that it did not convey the statute requirements.consequently,we reject hurn challenge to the jury instructions.
hurn next claim is that the district court exclusion of attorney paul felser as a defense witness violated her constitutional right to a fair trial.hurn sought to have felser testify that,under the concurrent dissimilar employment doctrine,her benefits would not have been reduced if she had truthfully reported her income from painting on the forms.hurn claims that,because her benefits would have remained the same whether she lied or told the truth about her painting income,she had no reason to deliberately or willfully defraud the government.had the jury heard this doctrine,it would likely have concluded that the omission of this information from the form was the result of either an oversight or misunderstanding of the forms.
the sixth amendment to the united states constitution guarantees defendants the right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.const.amend.vi.implicit in this well as in the basic notion of due process of law in general,see const.amend the idea that criminal defendants must be afforded the opportunity to present evidence in their favor.see specht patterson,d due process requires that the defendant have an opportunity to be heard and to offer evidence of his own.united states ramos,cir a criminal defendant right to present witnesses in his own defense during a criminal trial lies at the core of the fifth and fourteenth amendment guarantees of due process.
in assessing a defendant claims under the fifth and sixth amendments to call witnesses in her defense,we engage in a analysis.we first examine whether this right was actually violated,then turn to whether this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under chapman california,d.because we conclude that the district court did not violate hurn constitutional right to call witnesses on her behalf,we need not reach the second step of this analysis.
a district court exclusion of a defendant evidence violates these compulsory process and due process guarantees in four circumstances first,a defendant must generally be permitted to introduce evidence directly pertaining to any of the actual elements of the charged offense or an affirmative defense second,a defendant must generally be permitted to introduce evidence pertaining to collateral matters that,through a reasonable chain of inferences,could make the existence of one or more of the elements of the charged offense or an affirmative defense more or less certain.third,a defendant generally has the right to introduce evidence that is not itself tied to any of the elements of a crime or affirmative defense,but that could have a substantial impact on the credibility of an important government witness.finally,a defendant must generally be permitted to introduce evidence that,while not directly or indirectly relevant to any of the elements of the charged events,nevertheless tends to place the story presented by the prosecution in a significantly different light,such that a reasonable jury might receive it differently.we review each of these standards in turn 
the most obvious component of a defendant fifth and sixth amendment right to present evidence in his favor is to present evidence that has a direct bearing on a formal element of the charged offense.a defendant right to a fair trial is violated when the evidence excluded is material in the sense of a crucial,critical,highly significant factor.united states ramos,cir see also washington texas,d t he petitioner in this case was denied his right to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor because the state arbitrarily denied him the right to put on the stand a witness whose testimony would have been relevant and material to the defense.this reasoning applies with equal force to directly proving the existence of an element of an affirmative defense.see boykins wainwright,cir holding that expert testimony directly relevant to establishing an insanity defense clearly meets the constitutional standard of materiality in the sense of a crucial,critical,highly significant factor.see also united states till,cir reversing conviction where evidence was excluded that was highly relevant and material to the entrapment defense united states herrera,cir reversing district court exclusion of evidence that the defendant had been threatened because such evidence was directly relevant to the defendant affirmative defense of duress.in applying this rule,we have recognized that if there is simply no other practical means to prove the point,then the need factor points strongly toward receipt of such evidence.united states cohen,cir quotations and citation omitted.
hurn is unable to articulate a constitutional violation under this theory.she contends that felser was going to testify about her continued eligibility for benefits under the concurrent dissimilar employment doctrine.none of the elements of directly address a defendant continued eligibility for benefits.moreover,hurn did not offer an affirmative defense to which this testimony would be directly material.consequently,hurn must advance a different theory under which the court wrongfully excluded this testimony.
a defendant also has the right to introduce evidence that is not directly relevant to an element of the offense,but that makes the existence or of some collateral matter somewhat more or less likely,where that collateral matter bears a sufficiently close relationship to an element of the offense.in united states sheffield,cir,for example,the defendant was an air force employee convicted of embezzling government property because he ordered his subordinates to produce fishing lures for his personal use.he attempted to demonstrate that this was part of a legitimate,authorized custom on the base of making retirement presents for civilian and military officials.the district court excluded all evidence concerning the existence of such a custom.
evidence proving that such a custom existed was not directly relevant to any of the elements of embezzlement.nevertheless,the existence of the custom was a collateral matter that was itself relevant to the mens rea element of the offense.that is,if the defendant was acting pursuant to an established,authorized custom,then he was not intentionally doing anything wrong.id.at evidence of the custom was relevant to the defendant state of mind when he ordered the production of fishing lure molds.consequently,exclusion of the evidence violated the defendant rights.id.
similarly,in united states lankford,cir,the defendant was convicted of filing false tax returns.we reversed,however,because the district court had prevented a defense expert from testifying that the defendant belief in the legality of his acts was reasonable.to be convicted of filing false tax returns,the government had to prove that the defendant acted willful ly that is,that he knew he was breaking the law.id.at.we recognized,however,that it would be difficult if not impossible for a defendant to introduce direct evidence specifically about his mental state.consequently,he had to focus on providing circumstantial evidence concerning collateral matters,such as the reasonableness of his beliefs,from which the jury could infer what his mental state was.the more untenable his belief that he was acting legally,the less likely he actually held it.id.at.because proof demonstrating the reasonableness of the defendant beliefs was therefore indirectly relevant to an actual element of the offense willfulness through a short chain of inferential reasoning,the defendant had the constitutional right to introduce it.id.at by disallowing expert testimony on the issue,the trial court deprived the defendant of evidence showing that his asserted state of mind was reasonable.accordingly,we hold that the exclusion of expert testimony on this issue was error.
a defendant also has the constitutional right under this theory to introduce evidence concerning a collateral matter where the government attempts to use that collateral matter as the basis for securing a conviction.in united states word,cir,for example,the government had introduced evidence that the defendant and her husband had a close relationship a collateral matter.it invited the jury to infer,from the existence of this close relationship,that the defendant husband had shared with her information about his criminal activities,causing her to have actual knowledge about them an element of the offense with which she was charged.id.at.the defendant wished to rebut that inference by testifying that her husband physically and emotionally abused her and that he did not share much information with her.id.we held,with the district court exclusion of the proposed testimony of abuse or similar evidence about a relationship the defendant had no means to defend against the government contentions and the jury did not hear the whole story about the relationship.id.we concluded 
during trial,the government was able to argue inferences favorable to the prosecution based upon the romantic relationship between the two while the defendant was prohibited from introducing evidence that told a different story about the relationship and that might have contradicted or undercut those inferences.
id.at.consequently,we vacated the conviction and ordered a new trial based on the exclusion of evidence concerning this collateral matter.
conversely,where the proffered evidence does not bear a logical relationship to an element of the offense or an affirmative defense,whether direct or indirect,a defendant has no right to introduce that evidence and a district court may properly exclude it.see ramos,cir upholding district court refusal to allow defendant to introduce evidence of a conversation between a confidential informant and allegedly corrupt dea agents in new york because that testimony did not link any improprieties between the informant and new york dea agents to the defendant or the miami dea agents who conducted the investigation of the defendant.moreover,a district court may exclude evidence where the relationship between the evidence and the element of the offense or affirmative defense at issue is simply too attenuated.that is,there comes a a district court is perhaps in the best position to judge the chain of inferences linking evidence and the legally relevant point to be proven is simply too long,dubious,or attenuated to require that the evidence be introduced.see united states gonzalez,cir upholding district court decision to exclude testimony of an accident reconstruction expert because whether appellant rammed the officers car,or vice versa,was simply not adequately material to the crimes for which appellant stood charged at trial.
hurn is unable to prevail under this theory because there is a crucial break in her proposed chain of reasoning.the existence of the concurrent dissimilar employment doctrine a collateral matter could only have reduced her motive to lie when filling out the documents a factor which goes to the mens rea element of the offense if she knew about it.hurn does not argue on appeal that she had consulted with felser prior to filling out the forms,and did not offer any other evidence to suggest that she was aware of the doctrine.indeed,if it would take an expert testimony to make a jury aware of the concurrent dissimilar employment doctrine,it is highly unlikely that she knew of it at the time she filled out the forms.consequently,she failed to offer the vital link in the chain that would have made that collateral matter relevant to an element of the cha
