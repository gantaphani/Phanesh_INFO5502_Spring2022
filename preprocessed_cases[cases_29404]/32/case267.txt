we have for review a referee report recommending that francisco ramon rodriguez be found guilty of professional misconduct and that he receive a public reprimand and serve a period of probation.the referee also recommends denying the florida bar request that rodriguez be ordered to forfeit prohibited fees to the clients security fund.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.
for the reasons explained herein,we disapprove the referee recommendation that rodriguez receive a public reprimand and serve probation.instead,we impose a suspension.further,we order rodriguez to disgorge his portion of the prohibited fee to the clients security fund,including the taxes and interest on that fee 
background 
rodriguez was a shareholder in the law firm of friedman,rodriguez,ferraro,and louis.the firm was hired to represent twenty clients who sought to sue dupont corporation for damages allegedly resulting from use of the dupont product benlate,a fungicide that was suspected of causing severe crop damage and was recalled from the market in march.the partners in the firm were paul friedman,diane ferraro,roland louis,and francisco rodriguez.the florida bar brought separate disciplinary actions against the four named partners of the firm alleging that they committed misconduct by engaging in a secret engagement agreement with the dupont corporation,solely for their own financial benefit,while they were representing the clients in the benlate cases against dupont.based on the partners separate acts of misconduct,they received different sanctions.
ferraro received a public reprimand and made restitution of to the clients.bar ferraro,so d table citation.the sanction was based on the referee finding that ferraro had absolutely nothing to do with the settlement negotiations with dupont and did not even know about the engagement agreement until well after her former partners received the prohibited funds.also,ferraro agreed to testify against her former partners.due to these facts,the referee ultimately recommended a public reprimand,after finding that a suspension or disbarment was not appropriate.
friedman did not know about the engagement agreement until after it had been executed.thus,he had a comparatively smaller role in the firm misconduct than louis and rodriguez.also,friedman cooperated with the bar and he paid restitution before his disciplinary case was reviewed by this court.however,friedman partook in the financial benefits of the unethical engagement agreement,exposed the benlate clients to potential harm by engaging in the conflict of interest,and acquiesced in the firm lying to the clients.he did not take any measures to inform clients or repudiate the engagement agreement.in fact,as of the firm,friedman received the prohibited funds from dupont.therefore,friedman misconduct merited a suspension and payment of restitution in the amount of.bar friedman,so d table citation.
louis and rodriguez were the firm principal actors in developing and executing the secret engagement agreement.as will be discussed herein,rodriguez misconduct is less egregious than louis misconduct.louis negotiated the engagement agreement for the firm,placed his financial interests above those of his clients with regard to dupont,and lied to judge wilson and the bar regarding the secret engagement agreement.this court disbarred louis.bar louis,no,so d,wl.may.
with regard to rodriguez,a referee made the following findings and recommendations.
the firm,dupont,and the engagement agreement.in,the firm represented twenty different plaintiffs in property damages claims against dupont arising from the use of benlate.louis,who was the lawyer who brought in the clients for the firm,had primary responsibility for communicating with the clients.rodriguez primary role in the benlate cases was to act as first chair if any of the cases went to trial and to handle significant hearings.
the firm discovered that in the case for one of its clients,davis tree farm,dupont had concealed its testing of benlate in costa rica.the test plants exhibited significant damage and dupont ordered the plants to be destroyed.the firm subsequently filed a motion to strike dupont pleadings in the davis tree farm case.the trial court judge orally ruled that she would enter an order striking dupont pleadings and entered a judgment in favor of davis tree farm.
after the judge made this oral ruling,dupont approached the firm to try to settle the davis tree farm case,as well as the other benlate cases the firm was handling.dupont attorney negotiated with rodriguez and louis.at this point,rodriguez learned that dupont was requesting as a condition of settlement a restriction on the firm right to practice.dupont counsel stated that settlement of the firm cases would include resolving the davis tree farm case before the trial judge issued her written order,as well as requiring the firm not to use the fees earned to fund future litigation against dupont.the firm engaged in research to determine whether it was ethical for the firm to engage in such an agreement.the firm researcher informed rodriguez that the law was unclear,but it appeared that dupont objective could be achieved by engaging the firm after the firm finished representing the twenty benlate clients.
dupont eventually made offers of settlement to nineteen of the benlate plaintiffs,but not to davis tree farm.the firm was prepared to recommend that the clients accept the offers because the firm believed the offers exceeded what the clients could have reasonably expected to recover if their respective cases had gone to trial.while rodriguez initially rejected dupont request for the firm not to bring future benlate cases against the corporation,louis told dupont that in order to have a restriction on the firm right to practice,dupont would have to pay the firm.dupont made settlement of the nineteen benlate plaintiffs claims contingent on the settlement of the davis tree farm case.
on august,the trial judge written order striking dupont pleadings arrived in the mail.settlement negotiations continued and when dupont offer reached,the spokeswoman for davis tree farm agreed to accept the offer.although rodriguez believed settlement negotiations were complete,dupont then made the settlement of the nineteen benlate clients contingent on the firm agreeing to sign an engagement agreement that would preclude the firm from bringing future cases against dupont.again,rodriguez declined to enter into such an agreement until the firm representation of the clients was complete.the firm resisted dupont condition until the appointed mediator made it clear that dupont would retract the offer unless the firm signed such an engagement agreement.the mediator,who had substantial experience in mass tort cases and had been appointed as the special master to handle discovery disputes in litigation in dade county,advised rodriguez that in these situations,parties would sometimes make an engagement agreement.
after much discussion about the settlement amounts that the firm was going to recommend that the clients accept from dupont,the firm and dupont negotiated the restrictions on the right to practice.dupont agreed to pay the firm in exchange for the firm agreement not to pursue future claims against dupont and for the firm to possibly perform future work for dupont on an hourly basis.thus,the offered to the benlate plaintiffs and the offered to the firm through the engagement agreement constituted separate funds.rodriguez did not participate in drafting the engagement agreement.however,he did not object to the agreement,he agreed with its terms,and he testified that he negotiated very hard for the.further,language in the engagement agreement stated that it was contingent upon the effectiveness of the settlement agreement with the benlate clients.
the referee found that,at this point,rodriguez became an agent of dupont,and his allegiance to both dupont and his benlate clients created a conflict of interest.further,the referee found that the firm placed its interest above that of the benlate clients because the firm avoided the risks and expenses of protracted litigation and possible appeals the firm received fees from these cases,some of which had fatal flaws the firm received significant amounts of attorney fees from the settlements the firm accepted a guaranteed in exchange for not pursuing future cases against dupont and the firm could return to the very successful full time practice of working on an hourly basis with dupont as an added client.
the referee found that the attorneys of the firm knew or should have known that negotiations for settlements were not concluded until the clients had accepted dupont offers and,if the offers were rejected,they would have to resume negotiations.yet,dupont agreement with the firm was conditioned on the consummation of the settlement agreement between dupont and the firm clients.the referee found that the statement in the engagement agreement that the firm had completed the negotiations indicated that the firm had a desire,if not an intent,not to have any further discussions with dupont on behalf of its clients.
on august,the parties appeared before the trial judge and announced that a settlement for the benlate clients had been reached and requested that the judge vacate and seal the order striking dupont pleadings.the parties did not inform the judge about the engagement agreement.also,because all but two of the benlate clients had the right to accept or reject the settlement,dupont insisted that the clients only be told the amount that they were being offered to settle their respective cases.dupont further insisted that the clients keep the amount they received confidential.to enforce these conditions,ten percent of the settlement amounts were to be held in escrow for two years and,should any breach of confidentiality occur,approximately of the clients settlement monies would be lost.rodriguez never told the clients about the engagement agreement.he claimed that because dupont had insisted on confidentiality,he believed a breach of that confidentiality would result in the clients losing ten percent of the settlement.however,because the settlement agreement between the clients and dupont was separate from the engagement agreement between the firm and dupont,the referee found that the confidentiality provisions of the settlement agreement were between the clients and dupont,and did not bind the firm.thus,disclosure of the engagement agreement to the clients would not have jeopardized the escrow funds.
the referee found that by not disclosing the agreement,rodriguez was protecting the firm interest in,his own interest in,and dupont economic interests in not having disclosed to the world that it had done some very bad things to its clientele and got caught doing them.because there was ongoing benlate litigation occurring around the nation,the latter information potentially could have caused dupont serious harm.
rodriguez testified that the money he would receive from the agreements never entered his mind.however,the referee found this to be unlikely because rodriguez admitted that he found the amounts offered to the clients to be staggering rodriguez testified that the benlate clients were clients with no hope and would obtain no money had their cases gone to trial and rodriguez received in excess of from the settlements.
aftermath of the settlement and engagement agreements.after the terms of the settlement and engagement agreements were agreed upon,louis traveled around the state to meet with clients and convince them to accept dupont settlement agreement.louis told the clients that if they did not accept the settlement offer,the firm would no longer represent them.on august,the firm received.thereafter,on august,the firm received from dupont.when one client refused to settle,rodriguez filed a motion to withdraw representation and a charging lien.at the hearing on this motion,rodriguez did not tell the judge about the engagement agreement.rather,he claimed that he wished to withdraw because the client wanted to eliminate rodriguez fee.eventually,the client accepted dupont offer and rodriguez resumed the relationship with the client.rodriguez did withdraw from representing fred haupt,another client who refused to settle.haupt eventually settled with dupont through his own means.
the referee found that no clients,other than davis tree farm,were made aware of the engagement agreement.thus,the clients believed that rodriguez was representing only their interests.further,the referee found that the firm also kept of the clients money.the authorization to settle contained a provision by which the firm kept the interest earned on the clients settlement funds.the referee found that this provision was not in the best interest of the clients.
bar investigation.in,based on the complaint of one of the benlate plaintiffs,the bar conducted an investigation into allegations that the firm did not explain to its clients the original settlement agreement,and that a possible conflict of interest had occurred between the various benlate clients.the individual who filed the complaint,robert beasley,alleged that the firm was coercing clients into accepting dupont offers,the clients were being held hostage by the firm,and the firm was keeping the interest earned from the clients settlement funds.rodriguez contacted attorney robert batsel to represent him during this initial bar investigation,which included a meeting with bar representatives.rodriguez and batsel subsequently testified that the bar did not ask any questions that called for them to disclose the engagement agreement to the bar.rodriguez and batsel believed the meeting concerned whether there was an improper aggregate settlement with the benlate clients.eventually,this earlier disciplinary proceeding resulted in a consent judgment in.
the instant complaint.the bar filed the instant complaint in.before the referee in these proceedings,batsel testified that during the meeting the bar representatives never posed a question that required rodriguez to disclose the engagement agreement.batsel testified that if the bar had asked questions regarding the engagement agreement during that investigation,batsel would have counseled rodriguez to disclose the agreement.the instant referee found batsel testimony credible.further,the referee found that rodriguez and batsel did not conspire to deceive the bar.the referee did find,however,that rodriguez should have disclosed the engagement agreement on his own accord during the investigation.
findings as to guilt.based on these facts,the referee recommended that rodriguez be found guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar a informing client of status of representation,b duty to explain matters to client,a prohibited fees,a representing a client whose interests are adverse to another client,b duty to avoid limitation on independent professional judgment,a business transaction with or acquiring interest adverse to client,a conflict of interest as to former clients,a declining or terminating representation,c responsibilities of a partner for rules violations,b restriction on lawyer right to practice,and a lawyer shall not violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct.in making these recommendations,the referee specifically rejected the following defenses raised by rodriguez he was only following the advice of counsel he believed he was acting in his clients best interests client confidentiality prevented him from disclosing the engagement agreement to the benlate clients and the bar the bar is at fault in this matter and dupont is responsible for these acts of misconduct.
disciplinary recommendations.in aggravation,the referee found the sole factor of multiple offenses.in mitigation,the referee found rodriguez lack of a disciplinary history his remorse his inexperience in handling settlements of mass tort cases his interim rehabilitation the length of time during which rodriguez has had to deal with various proceedings and negative publicity arising out of the dupont settlement the emotional,financial,and physical stress rodriguez has suffered for over eight years as a result of his misconduct the excellent results rodriguez obtained for the benlate clients and rodriguez character and outstanding reputation in the community.
as to discipline,the referee recommended that rodriguez serve a probationary period,during which he would perform hours of pro bono legal services receive a public reprimand and pay the bar costs.the referee stated that the recommended discipline is a constructive sanction that will help the less fortunate in the community and that s uspending rodriguez from the practice of law will not accomplish any worthy objective.
before the referee,the bar requested that rodriguez be ordered to forfeit from his prohibited fee to the clients security fund of the florida bar.the referee concluded that the bar was seeking forfeiture of the funds more as a fine than as restitution for money taken from the benlate clients.the referee stated that there is no authority in a bar disciplinary proceeding to require payment that is not for restitution or payment of costs.further,the referee found that payment of such an amount by rodriguez would be punitive in nature.
on review.rodriguez petitioned this court for review of the referee report,alleging that the bar claims in the instant case are an impermissible collateral attack on the consent judgment entered into by rodriguez and the bar.the bar filed a,challenging the referee recommended discipline and the referee recommendation that rodriguez not be required to forfeit money to the clients security fund.
first,rodriguez asserts that the florida bar claims in the instant case are barred by the doctrine of res judicata and,in turn,the referee findings of certain rule violations should not be approved.he bases this claim on the consent judgment that he negotiated with the bar.rodriguez claims that the consent judgment resolved all disciplinary matters relating to the firm twenty benlate clients,and that it therefore prevents the bar from bringing this case.based on this premise,rodriguez argues that the instant referee erred in denying rodriguez motion for summary judgment.further,rodriguez notes that the grievance that generated the first disciplinary proceeding raised the issue of the firm keeping the interest on the settlement monies that were to go to the clients.therefore,rodriguez concludes that the bar could have alleged a violation of rule a at that time,so the referee instant recommendation of a violation of the rule on that same basis is barred by res judicata.
rodriguez claim that the bar was precluded from bringing a second complaint,based on the firm secret engagement agreement with dupont,is without merit.the doctrine of res judicata applies when all four of the following conditions are present identity of the thing sued for identity of the cause of action identity of persons and parties to the action and identity of quality in persons for or against whom claim is made.mcgregor provident trust of philadelphia,so,see also palm afc holdings,palm beach county,so d,dca.thus,the causes of action must be closely related for the doctrine of res judicata to apply.see hay salisbury,so.
while both the previous and current disciplinary proceedings stem from rodriguez representation of the benlate clients in a lawsuit against dupont,the previous case focused on how the firm dealt with its clients and whether the firm improperly negotiated an aggregate settlement for the clients.in contrast,the current case is based on the engagement agreement that the firm arranged with dupont.where the second action between the same parties is upon a different claim or demand,the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted,upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.gray gray,so,quoting cromwell county of sac.thus,the current case is not barred by res judicata as it is based on a different cause of action,rodriguez relationship with dupont see.bar gentry,so d holding that there was no identity of facts for res judicata to bar the proceedings where the subsequent bar allegations were based on separate,additional,and continuing misconduct.further,rodriguez did not disclose or produce the secret engagement agreement in the course of the bar investigation.as this engagement agreement never came to light and the bar did not suspect its existence,rodriguez can not be rewarded in this case for previously hiding this matter from the bar and this court.see.bar spears,so d,finding that the exclusion of the present disciplinary matter from a prior judgment was solely attributable to spears failure to bring the matter to the bar attention.
based on the doctrine of res judicata,however,we disapprove the referee finding that rodriguez violated rule a when the firm retained the interest earned on the clients escrow funds.in its answer brief and initial brief on cross appeal in the instant case,the bar admits that one of the main issues in the earlier proceedings was that rodriguez and his partners were keeping interest earned on the clients settlement proceeds.thus,the bar was aware of this issue,but failed to fully pursue it in the earlier case regarding the firm dealings with its benlate clients.further,this rule violation is based on the firm settlement agreement with the benlate clients,rather than its engagement agreement with dupont.accordingly,based on res judicata,we disapprove the referee finding of this rule violation.
second,the bar argues that the referee recommended disciplinary sanctions are not supported by caselaw or the standards for imposing lawyer sanctions.in reviewing a referee recommended discipline,this court scope of review is broader than that afforded to the referee findings of fact because it is the court ultimate responsibility to order the appropriate sanction.see.bar anderson,so d,see also art.v.const.the supreme court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the discipline of persons admitted to the practice of law.generally speaking,this court will not the referee recommended discipline as long as it has a reasonable basis in existing caselaw and the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions.see.bar temmer,so d.in the instant case,we agree with the bar that the referee recommendations are not supported.
a suspension,rather than a public reprimand,is the appropriate sanction under these circumstances.florida standard for imposing lawyer sanctions states that s uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knows of a conflict of interest and does not fully disclose to a client the possible effect of that conflict,and causes injury or potential injury to a client.rodriguez violated this standard and exposed the benlate clients to potential harm.he was a knowing party to the engagement agreement,he did not disclose the conflict of interest to his clients,and his interests were clearly divided.he protected his interest in the engagement agreement by engaging in actions that were contrary to the interests of his own clients.a suspension is appropriate in conflict of interest situations which,as here,rise above mere negligence.see.bar dunagan,so d upholding suspension where,without wife consent,lawyer represented husband in dissolution proceeding although the lawyer had previously represented both husband and wife in a business matter.
additionally,standard provides for suspension when a lawyer knowingly engages in conduct that is a violation of a duty owed as a professional and causes injury or potential injury to a client,the public,or the legal system.stds.imposing law.sancs.rodriguez conflict of interest with respect to the benlate clients caused the clients harm.further,he potentially harmed the public by forming an agreement with dupont not to pursue future lawsuits against dupont.also,he potentially harmed the legal system by not disclosing the engagement agreement to the bar during the previous disciplinary proceedings.
rodriguez misconduct does not rise to the same level of egregiousness as that of his former partner louis.see.bar louis,no,so d,wl.may,disbarring louis.louis engaged in additional acts of misconduct,such as drafting the engagement agreement,signing the engagement agreement on behalf of the firm,deliberately lying to a circuit court judge,making dishonest
