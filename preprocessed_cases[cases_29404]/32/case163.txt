a company seeking contracts for information technology services to a city retained a small private law firm.two attorneys in the firm provided various services to the company,advising it about doing business with the city.fifteen months later,one of those attorneys successfully won election as the city attorney.before taking office,the new city attorney announced he would personally not participate in any case involving a client of his former law firm.
fifteen months after the new city attorney was sworn in,his office named the company as a defendant in a complaint seeking damages for the city on allegations of fraud,statutory violations,and breach of contract.the company sought to disqualify the city attorney entire office,arguing that as its former attorney he had obtained confidential information about it that precluded him,and the public office he now headed,from representing the city against it in a matter substantially related to the city attorney former representation of the company.the trial court disqualified the city attorney and his office.the court of appeal upheld that ruling in a decision.we affirm the court of appeal.
background 
the facts and dates recited here are drawn from declarations and exhibits submitted on the motion to disqualify and from a written contract between the city and county of san francisco hereafter city and cobra solutions,and telecon,two california corporations.cobra solutions is in the business of providing computer products,accessories and related professional services.on october,the related entities of cobra solutions and telecon entered into a contract with the city store qualified them to bid on contracts for technology goods and services provided to various city departments,including the department of building inspection.
in september,cobra solutions retained the law firm of kelly,gill,sherburne and herrera,seeking advice on difficulties the company had encountered in performing a city contract with the department of building inspection department.according to james brady,the president and chief executive officer of cobra solutions,the law firm continued to represent it in all matters until december,and it also provided legal services for telecon on several occasions.
in september of,then city attorney louise renne began investigating contracts for computer services entered into by the department.the investigation revealed irregularities in payments made to marcus armstrong,a department employee.
on december,dennis herrera,a named partner in kelly,gill,sherburne and herrera,was elected san francisco city attorney city attorney.herrera was sworn into office on january,and he adopted a blanket policy of not participating in any matter involving his former law firm or any of its clients regardless of whether he had a conflict in any particular matter.when herrera assumed office,the city attorney investigation of marcus armstrong was already underway results of that investigation led the city attorney office to file a civil complaint on february,naming various defendants,including armstrong,and alleging causes of action arising from what was characterized as a kickback scheme by which armstrong received payments from computer service providers for services they never performed.
on the same day the complaint was filed the city attorney office issued a press release under the heading,herrera names top building department official,technology vendors in major public corruption suit.in that press release,city attorney herrera denounced armstrong and his cronies for betraying a public trust,and asserted that p ublic corruption diminishes the confidence of our citizens in their government.according to the press release,the lawsuit was the product of a yearlong investigation by the city attorney public integrity task force,which herrera created on taking office and which he described as a vehicle for civil law enforcement enabling us to aggressively pursue those who would violate the public trust.
because the allegations in the city lawsuit implicated armstrong in possible criminal misconduct,the city attorney office referred the matter to the united states attorney for the northern district of california.the federal prosecutor filed criminal charges against armstrong,who later pleaded guilty to federal charges of mail fraud,wire fraud,and obstruction of justice.
in march,the city investigators discovered that armstrong had deposited more than in checks from cobra solutions into the bank account of a fictitious business entity he created.when city attorney herrera learned that the investigation implicated his former client cobra solutions in the kickback scheme,he took measures to screen himself from the case to the extent that it could involve the former client.to maintain the ethical screen,attorneys working on the case were directed to report to chief assistant city attorney jesse smith and not to discuss the case with herrera.those attorneys maintained locked files and computerized records that were inaccessible to herrera.
on april,the city filed an amended complaint adding cobra solutions and telecon as defendants.in addition to causes of action for fraud,unfair competition,and false claims that the complaint alleged against all defendants,it also alleged causes of action against cobra solutions and telecon for negligent misrepresentation and contractual claims arising from breach of the city store contract.
cobra moved to disqualify from the litigation its former counsel herrera and the city attorney office he heads.in support of the motion,cobra submitted a bill dated april,showing a charge of of an hour attributable to herrera r eview of city store contract document.cobra president asserted that he and his employees disclosed to gill and to herrera confidential aspects of cobra business in the course of a representation that was broad enough to include advocacy with city officials,review of contracts,advice on corporate structure,and drafting of standard agreements,forms,and policies.after a hearing,the trial court granted cobra disqualification motion,finding that city attorney herrera,while in private practice,had personally represented defendants,and that during that representation he had obtained confidential information regarding matters related substantially to the issues raised against defendants in this litigation.the trial court concluded that herrera conflict must be imputed to the entire city attorney office because the counsel is the head of that office,and each of his deputies serves at his pleasure,subjecting them necessarily to his oversight and influence.accordingly,the trial court ordered the city to retain outside independent counsel to litigate this matter.the city attorney appealed.
in a decision,the court of appeal upheld the trial court ruling.it concluded that when an attorney leaves private practice to become the head of a public law office the vicarious disqualification of the entire public law office generally is required in all matters substantially related to the head of the office earlier private representations.the dissenting justice saw no need to recuse the entire government law office as long as the personally conflicted city attorney had been shielded by an effective ethical screen.the majority rejected that view,but it acknowledged the existence of sound reasons against automatically imputing the conflict of one attorney to an entire government law office.because it was unnecessary to reach the issue,the majority expressly refrained from deciding whether an ethical screen might suffice to avoid disqualification when a conflicted attorney comes from private practice into a government law office to assume a subordinate post,but it held that when,as here,the conflicted attorney serves as chief executive of the government law office,disqualification of the entire office is necessary.given the importance of these issues,we granted review.
ii.relevant law 
the authority of a trial court to disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in every court t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d,speedee,quoting code civ,subd.a.ultimately,disqualification motions involve a conflict between the clients right to counsel of their choice and the need to maintain ethical standards of professional responsibility.speedee,at,d.as we have explained,however,t he paramount concern must be to preserve public trust in the scrupulous administration of justice and the integrity of the bar.ibid.
when disqualification is sought because of an attorney successive representation of clients with adverse interests,the trial court must balance the current client right to the counsel of its choosing against the former client right to ensure that its confidential information will not be divulged or used by its former counsel.
two ethical duties are entwined in any relationship.first is the attorney duty of confidentiality,which fosters full and open communication between client and counsel,based on the client understanding that the attorney is statutorily obligated bus,subd.e to maintain the client confidences.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.the second is the attorney duty of undivided loyalty to the client.flatt superior court cal th,d,flatt.these ethical duties are mandated by the california rules of professional conduct.rules conduct,rule c e.
the interplay of the duties of confidentiality and loyalty affects the conflict of interest rules that govern attorneys.an attorney who seeks to simultaneously represent clients with directly adverse interests in the same litigation will be automatically disqualified.flatt,supra,cal th at,fn,d.moreover,an attorney may not switch sides during pending litigation representing first one side and then the other.city of santa barbara superior court th,d.that is true because the duty to preserve client confidences bus,subd.e survives the termination of the attorney representation.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.
that enduring duty to preserve client confidences precludes an attorney from later agreeing to represent an adversary of the attorney former client unless the former client provides an informed written consent waiving the conflict.rules conduct,rule e.if the attorney fails to obtain such consent and undertakes to represent the adversary,the former client may disqualify the attorney by showing a substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations.flatt,supra,cal th at,d.to determine whether there is a substantial relationship between successive representations,a court must first determine whether the attorney had a direct professional relationship with the former client in which the attorney personally provided legal advice and services on a legal issue that is closely related to the legal issue in the present representation.jessen hartford casualty ins.th,d.if the former representation involved such a direct relationship with the client,the former client need not prove that the attorney possesses actual confidential information.id.at,d.instead,the attorney is presumed to possess confidential information if the subject of the prior representation put the attorney in a position in which confidences material to the current representation would normally have been imparted to counsel.flatt,supra,cal th at,d,adams th,d ahmanson salomon brothers,d.when the attorney contact with the prior client was not direct,then the court examines both the attorney relationship to the prior client and the relationship between the prior and the present representation.if the subjects of the prior representation are such as to make it likely the attorney acquired confidential information that is relevant and material to the present representation,then the two representations are substantially related.jessen hartford casualty ins,supra,th at,d see farris fireman fund ins.th,d material confidential information is that which is directly at issue in or has some critical importance to,the second representation.when a substantial relationship between the two representations is established,the attorney is automatically disqualified from representing the second client.flatt,supra,cal th at,d,see hazard and hodes,the art of lawyering ed supp.
although the rules governing the ethical duties that an attorney owes to clients are set out in the california rules of professional conduct,those rules do not address when an attorney personal conflict will be imputed to the attorney law firm resulting in its vicarious disqualification.vicarious disqualification rules are a product of decisional law.henriksen great american savings loan th,d.normally,an attorney conflict is imputed to the law firm as a whole on the rationale that attorneys,working together and practicing law in a professional association,share each other,and their clients,confidential information.speedee,supra,cal th at,d,fn.omitted.here we consider whether the judicially created rule requiring vicarious disqualification of an entire law firm should apply to a government law office when the head of that office has a conflict because that attorney previously,while in private practice,represented a client that is now being sued by the government entity in a matter substantially related to the attorney prior representation.
iii.analysis 
the trial court found,and it is undisputed here,that city attorney herrera had a conflict based on his having previously represented,in private practice,the cobra defendants during which representation he obtained confidential information from them in matters related substantially to the issues raised against them in this litigation.the trial court further found that each of the city attorney deputies serves at the pleasure of the city attorney and thus is subject necessarily to his oversight and influence.
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.here there is no factual dispute,and we review independently the court of appeal legal conclusion that the city attorney personal conflict is properly imputed to the office of the city attorney and requires its disqualification.
the city contends that the vicarious disqualification of its entire city attorney office is neither compelled nor justified by prior court decisions involving government law offices.it relies on people christian th,d christian.there the court of appeal held there was no actual conflict when two attorneys,both supervised by the contra costa county public defender,in a joint trial represented two criminal codefendants who had potentially conflicting interests.id.at,d.the public defender oversaw two independent government law public defender office and an alternate defender office.id.at,d.although the public defender was the titular head of the alternate defender office,he did not supervise or evaluate alternate defender attorneys,did not initiate their promotion or discipline,and he had no access to its client files or confidences.id.at,d.concluding that the organization and operation of the two defenders offices made them,in effect,separate law firms see rules conduct,rule b d law firm includes a publicly funded entity which employs more than one lawyer to perform legal services,the court of appeal rejected the view that the simultaneous representation of codefendants by the public defender and the alternate defender created a conflict,because the county public defender was also the titular head of the alternate defender office.christian,supra,at,d.given the public defender limited control of the alternate defender office in christian,we reject the city argument that the attorneys in christian were attorneys within the same government office.
in an analogous case,castro los angeles county bd.of supervisors d.castro,a single executive director headed a nonprofit corporation with three separate public law units providing service to parents and children in dependency proceedings.the court of appeal in castro concluded that there would be no conflict if attorneys from each unit were to simultaneously represent clients from a single family whose interests were divergent.id.at.in castro the autonomy of each law unit was ensured because the chief attorney in each unit initiated hiring,firing,and salary changes for that unit attorneys.id.at.in both castro and christian,supra,th,d,the separate law units under a single governmental umbrella operated as separate law firms independent of parallel units also sheltered under that umbrella.both castro and christian addressed conflicts arising from simultaneous representation,unlike the successive representation conflict before us.but both cases were decided in the wake of the court of appeal decision in younger superior court d.younger.
younger was a successive representation case in which the court of appeal upheld the disqualification of the entire los angeles county district attorney office in the prosecution of a criminal defendant.younger,supra,d at.the defendant had been represented by the law firm of johnnie cochran,who was later appointed assistant district attorney,making him one of three top executives supervising more than deputy attorneys.id.at.when cochran assumed his new post,the district attorney office adopted procedures designed to screen cochran from making crucial decisions,such as whether to settle a case,or whether to seek the death penalty in a capital case,whenever it involved a defendant formerly represented by the cochran law firm.id.at,fn.
notwithstanding the ethical screen erected between cochran and the prosecution of defendants formerly represented by his law firm,the court of appeal upheld the vicarious disqualification of the entire los angeles county district attorney office.it noted that cochran presence in a job near the top of the office hierarchy could possibly affect the office prosecution of his firm former clients.younger,supra,d at.pointing specifically to cochran role in formulating prosecutorial policies,it expressed concern that even seemingly unrelated policy decisions could impact the prosecution of these cases.ibid.in addition,cochran role in the appraisal and promotion of deputies necessarily required him to evaluate the performance of deputies prosecuting his firm former clients.the court of appeal explained a deputy handling one or more of such cases would not in all probability forget cochran former professional association with the defense of those cases.ibid.even absent any impropriety,the court of appeal cautioned,public perception of the prosecutor integrity and impartiality would be at risk unless the entire office was disqualified.ibid.
the disqualification standard that the court of appeal applied in younger no longer controls criminal prosecutions because the legislature in enacted penal code section stats,ch,which provides for the recusal of local prosecuting agencies only when the evidence shows that a conflict of interest exists that would render it unlikely that the defendant would receive a fair trial,subds.a b.section is inapplicable to this case,which is a civil action.although the statute,which triggers disqualification of a prosecutor from a criminal proceeding only if the conflict is so grave as to render it unlikely that the defendant will receive fair treatment people griffin cal th,d,has superseded younger holding see people conner cal d,the concerns that the court of appeal in younger expressed about conflicted heads of public law offices,whose policymaking and supervisory duties are such as to preclude them from being effectively screened,have not lost their relevance 
as this court has explained in the past,there are both societal and personal interests at stake when an attorney and the attorney private or public law firm is disqualified.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.the societal interests at stake include preserving high ethical standards for every attorney,each of whom is obliged to preserve client confidences and whose failure to do so undermines public confidence in the judicial system.ibid.attorneys who head public law offices shoulder additional ethical obligations assumed when they become public servants.they possess such broad discretion that the public may justifiably demand that they exercise their duties consistent with the highest degree of integrity and impartiality,and with the appearance thereof.people superior court greer cal d,disqualification of conflicted district attorney.
vicarious disqualification also has an impact on the personal interests of a conflicted attorney current and former clients.current clients have a right to retain their chosen counsel,and they will bear the financial burden when their chosen counsel is burden that an opponent may desire in order to gain a tactical advantage in the litigation.speedee,supra,cal th at,d.with respect to former clients,they have an overwhelming interest in preserving the confidentiality of information they imparted to counsel during a prior representation.that interest is imperiled when counsel later undertakes representation of an adversary in a matter substantially related to counsel prior representation of the former client.
the burdens of disqualification are heavy both for private sector and public sector clients.when an entire government law office is disqualified,the government inevitably incurs the added cost of retaining private counsel in re lee th,d,the delay such substitution entails,and in certain types of litigation it may also lose the specialized expertise of its attorneys,hampering its ability to protect the public interest.see,city of santa barbara superior court,supra,th at,fn,d city attorney office possessed specialized expertise in the law of sewer construction and maintenance.greater legal costs caused by hiring private sector attorneys raise the specter that litigation decisions will be driven by financial considerations,not by the public interest.id.at,d.and when a government law office is disqualified,the expense of that disqualification is ultimately paid by the taxpayers.
other burdens caused by vicarious disqualification are cited by the attorney general,appearing as amicus curiae on behalf of the city he argues that disqualification hampers recruiting by government law offices of the most promising class of young lawyers.chambers superior court d.he further asserts that vicarious disqualification impugns the integrity of government attorneys by implicitly assuming they will violate the confidences of former clients.
citing these burdens on government,both the city and its amicus,the attorney general,urge us to hold that whenever a conflicted attorney enters government service,that attorney conflict should not result in vicarious disqualification of the government law office the attorney joins.instead,they argue,screening the conflicted attorney from matters involving the attorney former as the screening of the city attorney that occurred suffice to protect client confidentiality.
ethical screening is the approach adopted by the american bar association aba,whose model rules of professional conduct require a lawyer currently serving as a public officer or employee not to participate in a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially while in private practice.aba model rules conduct,rule d i.indeed,the aba model rules have long included rules specifically directed to government lawyers and to their conflicts arising from successive representation.as the comment to rule d explains,b ecause of the special problems raised by imputation within a government agency,the rule does not impute the conflicts of a lawyer currently in government service to other associated government lawyers,although ordinarily it will be prudent to screen such lawyers,com.thus,under the a
