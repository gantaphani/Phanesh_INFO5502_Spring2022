we granted the state petition for discretionary review to decide whether a petition for expunction qualifies as a governmental record under section of the texas penal code.one definition of a governmental record is anything belonging to,received by,or kept by government for information,including a court record.penal code ann.a vernon.the definition of a court record is a decree,judgment,order,subpoena,warrant,minutes,or other document issued by a court.penal code ann.vernon.we will resolve whether pleadings filed with but not issued by a court fall within the definition of a governmental record pursuant to a.
appellee,james vasilas,is an attorney whose client was charged with the state jail felony of delivery of marijuana.appellee client was convicted of the offense of possession of marijuana.thereafter,appellee signed and filed a petition of expunction of the records relating to his client arrest on the delivery charge.the state then charged appellee in a indictment of tampering with a governmental record pursuant to.penal code,alleging that he made three false entries in the petition for expunction.appellee filed a nonsuit of the expunction lawsuit.
subsequently,appellee filed a motion to quash the indictment on two grounds.first,he asserted that of the texas penal code and texas rule of civil procedure were in pari materia,with rule controlling over.second,he claimed that pleadings in civil suits were not governmental records under the definition of a.after hearing oral argument,the trial court granted the motion to quash without filing findings of fact or conclusions of law.the state timely filed its notice of appeal.
because the state did not appeal the trial court granting of the motion to quash the first three counts of the indictment,the sole issue before the court of appeals was whether the trial court erred in granting the motion to quash count iv,which alleged that appellee did with intent to defraud and harm another,namely,the state of texas,make,present,and use a governmental record,to wit a petition for expunction of records,with knowledge of its falsity.the court of appeals affirmed the trial court,holding that the petition for expunction filed by appellee was not a governmental record within the meaning of chapter of the penal code.state vasilas,pet.granted.the court of appeals reasoned that by including a court record in the definition of a governmental record,the legislature meant to exclude every type of court document that was not a court record.since the definition of a court record under the texas penal code is a document issued by a court,the court of appeals concluded that a pleading,such as a petition for expunction,which is created by a party or attorney and merely filed with a court,can not be a governmental record.having resolved this issue against the state,the court of appeals did not address whether.penal code and rule were in pari materia.
issue presented 
the state argues that under the plain language of the statutory definition of governmental record,which encompasses anything received by a court for information,a petition for expunction can be a governmental record even though it is filed with,not issued by,a court.the state asserts that the court of appeals interpretation of the definition of a governmental record violates section of the texas government code,commonly referred to as the code construction act,which defines including as a term of enlargement and not of limitation.furthermore,the state submits that the court of appeals should not have looked beyond the plain language of the statute to its legislative history in discerning the meaning of a governmental record,and that it erred by misinterpreting the legislature intent in amending the definition of governmental record in to include a court record while appellee concedes that the word including is not itself a term of limitation,he argues that a petition for expunction does not qualify as a governmental record because the words for information in a exclude documents that seek to destroy information the legislature did not explicitly include pleadings within the definition of a governmental record and the petition for expunction was not a governmental record when the false entries were made.although appellee also advances the argument that and rule of the texas rules of civil procedure are in pari materia,the court of appeals did not reach this issue,and it is not the issue for which we granted review.we will reverse the court of appeals decision.
the resolution of this case depends on the meaning of the word including in the definition of governmental record in a.the construction to be given a statute is a question of law.johnson city of fort worth.in our leading statutory interpretation case,boykin state,we explained that courts must begin with the plain language of a statute in order to discern its meaning.this is because the court interpretation of statutes must seek to effectuate the collective intent or purpose of the legislators who enacted the legislation.id.at citing camacho state.in boykin,we established that if the literal text of the statute was clear and unambiguous,we would ordinarily give effect to that plain meaning.at citing smith state.however,we also held 
if the plain language of a statute would lead to absurd results,or if the language is not plain but rather ambiguous,then and only then,out of absolute necessity,is it constitutionally permissible for a court to consider,in arriving at a sensible interpretation,such extra textual factors as executive or administrative interpretations of the statute or legislative history.
id.at.the seminal rule of statutory construction is to presume that the legislature meant what it said.seals state,no,wl.lexis.in adhering to this rule,we show our respect for the legislature and recognize that if it enacted into law something different from what it intended,it would amend the statute to conform to its intent.getts state,citing lamie trustee,d it is beyond our province to rescue congress from its drafting errors,and to provide for what we might think is the preferred result.
the legislature has provided the code construction act to assist in statutory interpretation.it instructs that words or phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning,whether by legislative definition or otherwise,shall be construed accordingly.gov ann.b vernon.in of the code construction act,the legislature expressly stated its intent regarding its use of the word including in statutory provisions,providing includes and including are terms of enlargement and not of limitation or exclusive enumeration,and use of the terms does not create a presumption that components not expressed are excluded.gov ann.vernon.this court relied on in interpreting the statutory meaning of including in grunsfeld state,plurality opinion,superseded by statute,crim.proc.a vernon supp.pursuant to,we established that the list following including in article a of the texas code of criminal procedure was not exclusive as to the evidence admissible at the sentencing phase of trial,as long as it was relevant to sentencing.grunsfeld,at explaining that the legislature use of the term including in amending article a rendered the list following it nonexclusive see also beasley state,at holding that evidence concerning the activities of a gang,to which the appellant belonged,was admissible under article a because matters relevant to sentencing were not limited to the prior criminal record of the defendant,his general reputation and his character 
the lower courts have also interpreted the legislature use of the word including as a means of illustration and not exclusion.for instance,in leach state,the court of appeals applied to the defendant community supervision condition,which tracked statutory language in the texas code of criminal procedure,and held that the word including did not creat e a presumption against further inclusion of terms not expressly stated,worth,pet.ref holding that because including was a term of enlargement,the defendant had violated his community supervision by going within feet of a grassy area where children p
