introduction 
in a case of first impression,we are asked to determine whether government code section bars disciplinary actions against employees of the california department of corrections cdc based upon their dishonest denials of underlying charges where the underlying charges are barred by section.we do not find that extensive lying during the course of investigative interviews that occurred within the applicable statute of limitations of the matter being investigated merges with the underlying offense.this is consistent with case law saying that dishonesty is a separate act.thus,section does not bar the disciplinary actions in this case.
statement of the case 
the facts are undisputed.darrell snell snell,wayne villarreal villarreal,stephanie rodriguez rodriguez,and rene villarreal villarreal,are employees of cdc.snell and villarreal are peace officer employees,and rodriguez and villarreal are civilian employees.
pursuant to section,subdivision a,cdc served various written notices of adverse actions notices imposing disciplinary sanctions upon snell,villarreal,rodriguez and villarreal for participating in a pyramid scheme from approximately june of to september of.snell and villarreal were suspended for work days,rodriguez was suspended for work days,and villarreal was suspended for work days.
the notices alleged various causes for discipline based upon the appellants participation in the pyramid scheme.these causes included section,subdivision d inexcusable neglect of duty section,subdivision r incompatible activities and section,subdivision t other failure of good behavior.
the notices also alleged section,subdivision f dishonesty,as a cause of discipline.cdc alleged that the appellants were dishonest at various investigative interviews conducted by cdc,in calendar years and,when they denied any participation in the pyramid scheme.
as alleged in the notice,snell was interviewed on august,as a witness.he denied any involvement and firsthand knowledge of the pyramid scheme.he participated in an investigatory interview on december.at this second interview,he denied any involvement in the pyramid scheme.
villarreal was interviewed on december.he denied that he was ever approached or recruited into the pyramid scheme.he denied that he was familiar with the pyramid scheme,or had any knowledge of the pyramid scheme other than through rumors.he denied ever attending any pyramid scheme meeting.he further denied discussing or recruiting for the pyramid scheme on the job.he denied that he conducted or hosted pyramid scheme parties or meetings at his home.he denied that he handled monies relative to the pyramid scheme.although he was advised that several persons had testified that he was actively involved in the pyramid scheme,and had stated that they had been at his home for recruiting parties for the pyramid scheme,villarreal continued to deny any firsthand knowledge of the pyramid scheme or involvement in it at any level.
rodriguez was interviewed on november.she denied any involvement in the pyramid scheme including ever being approached,recruiting,investing,attending a meeting during which the pyramid scheme was explained and hosting a pyramid scheme party at her home.
villarreal was interviewed on february.during this interview,she denied all involvement and first hand knowledge of the pyramid scheme.she denied investing in the pyramid scheme.she denied recruiting for the pyramid scheme.she denied attending or hosting any pyramid scheme parties.she denied ever having received or handled monies for the pyramid scheme.
snell was served with a notice on december.villarreal was served with a notice on december.rodriguez was served with a notice on december,and villarreal was served with a notice on december.
pursuant to section,subdivision a,the appellants filed timely appeals with the state personnel board spb requesting an administrative hearing to contest the validity of the notices.the four appeals were consolidated for hearing.
an administrative hearing was held before a duly appointed administrative law judge alj.appellants repeated their denials at the hearing.the alj issued proposed decisions sustaining all disciplinary causes of action contained in the notices,but modified the imposed suspensions.the alj found that snell and rodriguez denials of involvement in the pyramid scheme were not credible in light of testimony by numerous witnesses.the alj found that villarreal and villarreal were dishonest when they denied any knowledge of,or participation in,the pyramid scheme.on july,spb adopted the proposed decisions of the alj,but further modified the imposed suspensions.
the appellants filed a timely petition for rehearing with spb pursuant to section.spb granted appellants petition for rehearing and set the appeals for further hearing and argument.
on august,spb issued a final decision dismissing all charges contained in the notices,including the charges of dishonesty.spb found that the notices were not served within the limitation period of section,and that the facts did not warrant a finding that cdc was entitled to the fraud discovery exception of that statute.spb held that dishonesty during an investigatory interview is a separate and serious charge,but that the dishonesty charges were also untimely.spb found persuasive appellants argument that to allow the charges of dishonesty,based upon the appellants denials of participating in the pyramid scheme,to survive the dismissal of the underlying charges would defeat the purposes of the statute of limitations set forth in section.
spb reasoned that for cdc to prove the appellants denials to be false and dishonest,cdc must prove the appellants participation in the pyramid scheme to be factually true.spb held that such a result would force the appellants to litigate and defend matters whose litigation is already barred by the statute of limitations.according to spb,t his bootstrapping of the dishonesty charges to the underlying charges would,in turn,serve to eviscerate one of the primary purposes of a statute of prevent the hardship and injustice of having to defend against stale claims after memories have faded or evidence has been lost.
on july,cdc filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus seeking to set aside spb final decision.cdc petition was heard on may,before the honorable rosendo pena of the fresno county superior court.
on july,judge pena held that spb correctly decided that all disciplinary charges related to the employees participation in the pyramid scheme are properly barred by the statute of limitations of section,and that cdc is not entitled to the fraud discovery exception to that statute.however,judge pena also held that spb erred as a matter of law when it dismissed the dishonesty charges as untimely.the trial court ordered the dishonesty charges reinstated against appellants.
appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on september.they appeal only from judge pena decision holding that the dishonesty charges were not barred by section.
discussion 
neither the appellants nor the respondent contest the factual determinations made by the trial court,or those made by spb.where the facts are undisputed,spb ultimate conclusion is a pure question of law subject to de novo review.moosa state personnel bd.th,d.furthermore,we are not bound by spb or the trial court application and interpretation of a statute.burden snowden cal th,d.
