plaintiff appeals from the july,judgment of the united states district court for the southern district of new york robert patterson,judge dismissing this qui tam action and disqualifying plaintiff,its individual members including a former general counsel to defendant and its outside counsel from bringing a subsequent qui tam action on the basis that the suit was brought in violation of the general counsel ethical obligations under the new york rules of professional conduct the rules the issues on appeal arise out of the tension between an attorney ethical duty of confidentiality and the federal interest in encouraging whistleblowers to disclose unlawful conduct harmful to the government.
we consider here two questions whether the district court correctly held that the former general counsel to defendant violated his ethical obligations under the rules by participating in this qui tam action and,if so,whether the district court erred in dismissing the complaint and disqualifying plaintiff,all of its general partners including the former general counsel,and its outside counsel from bringing any subsequent qui tam action based on similar facts.
we agree that the attorney in question,through his conduct in this qui tam action,violated rule c which,in relevant part,prohibits lawyers from us ing confidential information of a former client protected by rule to the disadvantage of the former client,rule c,except to the extent that the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent the client from committing a crime,id.b.
in addition,we hold that the district court did not err by dismissing the complaint as to all defendants,and disqualifying plaintiff,its individual relators,and its outside counsel on the basis that such measures were necessary to avoid prejudicing defendants in any subsequent litigation on these facts.
accordingly,we affirm the july,judgment of the district court.
background 
fair laboratory practices associates flpa or plaintiff brought this qui tam pursuant to the federal false claims act fca,against quest diagnostics incorporated quest and unilab corporation unilab for alleged violations of the federal anti kickback statute,aks one of flpa general partners,mark bibi,was formerly general counsel to defendant unilab.the facts set forth below are drawn from the record on appeal,including the account of facts found by the district court.
a.the parties 
quest is a delaware corporation founded in and headquartered in new jersey that provides diagnostic medical testing services for managed care organizations mcos and independent practice associations ipas nationwide.in,quest acquired unilab a clinical laboratory company headquartered in california through a cash tender offer.unilab became a subsidiary of quest through a subsequent merger.
flpa,the relator in this qui tam action,is a delaware general partnership formed in by three former unilab executives,andrew baker baker,richard michaelson michaelson,and mark bibi bibi and jointly,the individual relators for the purpose of bringing this qui tam action.the individual relators worked for unilab prior to its acquisition by quest in.baker was unilab chairman and chief executive officer from to about december.michaelson was unilab chief financial officer from to january,and was a director of and consultant to unilab from january to november.bibi was unilab vice president,executive vice president,secretary,and general counsel from november to march,and then served only as an executive vice president through june,after which he was retained as a consultant by unilab until december.
bibi role as unilab general counsel is central to the issues presented on appeal.bibi,who has been practicing law in new york since,was unilab sole lawyer from.in that capacity,he was responsible for all of unilab legal and compliance affairs,such as advising unilab on matters relating to its mco contracts and managing all litigation against the company.
b.the alleged scheme 
flpa alleges that f rom at least through at least,unilab and quest violated the by operating a scheme by which they charged mcos and ipas commercially unreasonable discounted prices on business to induce referrals of medicare and medicaid business and then billed the medicare and medicaid business to the government at dramatically higher prices than those charged to the mcos and ipas on the nonfederal business.appellant br.citing complaint.specifically,flpa argues that the commercially unreasonable discounted prices constituted kickback s,bribe s or rebate s insofar as they were designed to induce referrals of medicare and medicaid business.appellant br.internal quotation marks omitted.
between and,the individual relators began to question whether unilab pricing structure violated the aks.for example,as chief financial officer,michaelson allegedly knew that unilab often charged its mco clients prices that were sometimes less than of unilab actual testing costs.and bibi allegedly advised baker that unilab pricing structure,as it was then formulated,potentially facilitated kickbacks.
in response to these concerns about unilab pricing structure,unilab,under its baker,established a new pricing policy that included negotiated increases to the rates under its existing contracts.joint app x.specifically,in unilab delivered a letter to its mco and customers stating that it was reserving its contractual right to terminate its contract with that customer and would,in thirty days,cease providing laboratory services to any customer that did not agree to a price increase.id.following unilab notice that it was raising its prices,some of unilab customers began to slowly slip away to its competitors.id.at.
flpa asserts that baker tenure as ceo ended in as a result of the falling profits caused by this increase in unilab prices.when baker left,unilab shares were selling for less than per share.in,kelso completed a leveraged of unilab for per share and installed a new management team,including robert whalen as ceo.whalen reversed course from baker pricing policy,informing other executives that baker increased pricing had been a mistake,and that unilab needed to i accept commercially unreasonable contracts with mcos and physician associations and ii implement a strategy that required physicians to refer,and the mcos to arrange for or recommend that physicians refer,business,including medicare and business,to unilab.id.at.
in december,the department of health and human services office of inspector general oig published advisory opinion ao,which addressed the pricing practices of clinical pathologists.in particular,ao indicated that if the prices offered to mcos on business were below actual cost,such an arrangement might violate the aks because the oig would infer that such discounts were offered for the purpose of inducing physicians to refer their medicare and medicaid business.
the month after ao was published,bibi had a meeting with whalen during which bibi stated his personal opinion,that ao created an inference of illegality with respect to unilab existing pricing structure.whalen allegedly instructed bibi to work with outside counsel to find a way around ao.in response bibi obtained an opinion letter from an outside law firm,winston strawn,on this issue bibi never reported his concerns to the unilab board.
flpa alleges that bibi was subsequently frozen out by unilab management as a result of his concerns related to unilab pricing structure and was no longer asked for advice on compliance matters.by march,bibi had been replaced as general counsel.
after the individual relators left unilab,the company allegedly continued its illegal strategy and as a result significantly improved its profitability.id.at.in,quest acquired unilab at a price of per share.according to bibi,baker who had sold his remaining unilab shares for per share three years earlier felt shortchanged.baker contacted jeffrey lanzolatta,a longtime unilab executive,who allegedly told baker that unilab had become very profitable engaging in the practice.id.at.baker relayed this information to bibi,stating that he was in a tax dispute with and wanted to go after them t hrough a qui tam lawsuit.id.
procedural history 
baker initiated the filing of this qui tam action and invited michaelson and bibi to join him as individual relators in particular,he believed bibi status as a lawyer would improve our credibility with the government.id.at.recognizing the potential ethical implications of a former general counsel bringing a qui tam lawsuit against his former company and client,bibi consulted the rules and the american bar association model rules of professional conduct to determine whether he could participate.bibi concluded that certain exceptions to the confidentiality rules permitted his participation,and did not feel it was necessary to verify his understanding with the new york state bar.id.at.
on january,flpa was formed for the purpose of acting as a relator in one or more qui tam actions against defendants for alleged violations of the aks.pursuant to the flpa partnership agreement,bibi stands to collect of any qui tam recovery,while baker and michaelson would receive and,respectively.on june,flpa filed this qui tam action in the southern district of new york.after flpa filed the operative second amended complaint complaint on may,the district court permitted defendants to take discovery regarding whether bibi and flpa had improperly used or disclosed unilab confidences in this lawsuit.following the completion of this discovery,defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint,arguing that bibi participation in this qui tam action violated two provisions of the rules.
first,defendants argued that bibi violated rule a,known as the rule,which provides that 
a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent,confirmed in writing.
rule a defendants asserted that,by acting as an individual relator in this qui tam action,bibi essentially switched sides and represented the government against unilab,his former client.
second,defendants argued that bibi violated the rules by making use of unilab confidential information for this litigation.pursuant to rule c 
a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter or whose present or former firm has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter use confidential of the former client protected by rule to the disadvantage of the former client,except as these rules would permit or require with respect to a current client or when the information has become generally known or reveal confidential information of the former client protected by rule except as these rules would permit or require with respect to a current client.
flpa,in turn,relied upon the exception in rule b,which permits a lawyer to reveal or use confidential information to the extent that the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent the client from committing a crime rule b 
on march,the district court granted defendants motion to dismiss,presumably pursuant to the inherent power necessarily vested in courts to manage their own affairs,chambers nasco,discussing authority to dismiss sua sponte for failure to prosecute.see united states ex rel.fair lab.practices assocs.quest diagnostics,civ.rpp,wl,at,the district court concluded that the fca did not preempt applicable state ethical rules,and that bibi participation in this action violated rule a the rule and rule c prohibition on disclosing client confidences beyond what was necessary,within the meaning of rule b,to prevent the commission of a crime.id.at.
in light of these conclusions,the district court held that the appropriate remedy was to dismiss the complaint as to all defendants,and disqualify flpa,each of the individual relators,and flpa counsel from bringing this suit or any subsequent suit based on the same facts.id.at.the district court reasoned that these measures were necessary to protect defendants from the use of their confidential information against them.id.at.the district court clarified that the dismissal in no way affected the right of the united states to intervene and bring an action against defendants.id.at.on july,however,the united states gave notice that it was declining to intervene.judgment was entered on july.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
on appeal,flpa argues principally that the district court erred in holding that bibi violated his ethical duties under the rules and the district court erred in granting an overly broad remedy in favor of the defendants.we consider each argument in turn.
bibi violated rule c by disclosing unilab confidential information

the fca does not preempt state ethical rules 
as a general matter,the salutary provisions of new york ethical rules have consistently been relied upon by the courts of this district and circuit in evaluating the ethical conduct of attorneys.hull celanese,cir.nothing in the false claims act evinces a clear legislative intent to preempt state statutes and rules that regulate an attorney disclosure of client confidences.see see bates dow agrosiences llc,in areas of traditional state regulation,we assume that a federal statute has not supplanted state law unless congress has made such an intention clear and manifest.internal quotation marks omitted.see also cipollone liggett,same.as one court recognized,w hile the fca permits any person to bring a qui tam suit,it does not authorize that person to violate state laws in the process.united states ex rel.doe,emphasis supplied.
at the same time,we are mindful that the central purpose of the rules to protect client confidences can be inconsistent with or antithetical to federal interests,grievance comm.for s.simels,cir,which under the fca,are to encourage private individuals who are aware of fraud being perpetrated against the g overnment to bring such information forward ex rel.dick long island lighting,cir quoting,sess.in such instances courts must interpret and apply the rules in a manner that balances the varying federal interests at stake.simels,at.we conduct the following analysis with these principles in mind.
bibi violated rule c by disclosing confidential information beyond what was necessary within the meaning of rule b.
flpa concedes that rule c governs bibi conduct in this case.see appellant br.as noted above,rule c provides that 
a lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter 
use confidential information of the former client protected by rule to the disadvantage of the former client,except as these rules would permit or require with respect to a current client or when the information has become generally known or 
reveal confidential information of the former client protected by rule except as these rules would permit or require with respect to a current client.
rule b,in turn,authorizes a lawyer to reveal or use confidential information to the extent that the lawyer reasonably believes necessary to prevent the client from committing a crime 
accordingly,review of the district court determination that bibi participation in the qui tam action violated rule c requires us to decide whether bibi reasonably believed that the defendants intended to commit a crime when flpa filed this action in,and the disclosures were necessary to prevent the defendants from committing a crime.
we agree with the district court that bibi could have reasonably believed in that d efendants had the intention to commit a crime.quest diagnostics,wl,at emphasis omitted see also id.at i t is reasonable to infer that bibi believed quest intended to violate the aks in.the district court made specific factual findings as to what bibi knew about defendants alleged violations of the aks.see quest diagnostics,wl,at.defendants do not argue that any finding made by the district court in this regard was erroneous.finding no error based on the record before us,we affirm the judgment of the district court insofar as it rests on its conclusion that bibi reasonably could have maintained such a belief.
the second question is whether bibi reasonably believed that his disclosures were necessary to prevent defendants from committing a crime.flpa asserts that it was necessary within the meaning of rule b for bibi to reveal the confidential information disclosed in this lawsuit because the terms of the fca required bibi to make written disclosure of substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses to the government.appellant br.quoting b.thus,flpa argues,u nder elementary principles of the supremacy of federal law,the fca preempts application of rule appellant br.we disagree,in light of the balancing principles set forth in part,ante.
rule b implicitly accounts for the federal interests at stake in the fca by permitting disclosure of information necessary to prevent the ongoing commission of a crime.as illustrated by this very case,rule prohibition on bibi disclosures could not have undermined the qui tam action in light of the alternative means,discussed below,of exposing the alleged kickback scheme.because rule itself balances the interests at stake,it need not give way to section b requirement of full disclosure of material evidence.
alternatively,flpa contends that even if rule b does not give way to section,bibi complied with its requirements by tempering his disclosures until his deposition,when he finally testified as to the details of his conversations with whalen and revealed the existence of the winston strawn opinion letter upon solicitation by unilab.appellant br.flpa argues further that the ongoing nature of the alleged crime necessitated the broad disclosures.id.at.
the district court concluded that e vidence of the continuing crime in could be shown by evidence of quest pricing agreements with mcos and ipas in effect in and not,for example,through bibi disclosures confidential information.quest diagnostics,wl,at.thus,the court reasoned,the confidential information divulged by bibi,dating back to,went beyond what was reasonably necessary to prevent any alleged ongoing crime in,when the suit was filed.see id.further,flpa has not articulated a persuasive reason why disclosure of confidences from the to march would be necessary to prevent the commission or continuation of a crime in.
we agree with the district court that the confidential information bibi revealed was greater than reasonably necessary to prevent any alleged ongoing fraudulent scheme in.by flpa own admission,it was unnecessary for bibi to participate in this qui tam action at all,much less to broadly disclose unilab confidential information.see appellant br.baker and michaelson each has ample relevant information to bring this case flpa could have brought the qui tam action based on the information that baker and michaelson possessed as former executives of unilab,or,if necessary,bibi could have made limited disclosures instead,bibi chose to participate in the action and disclose protected client confidences,see app x,in violation of rule c.
because we affirm the judgment of the district court on the grounds that bibi violated rule c,we need not consider whether bibi also violated rule a the rule by participating in this qui tam action 
b.the district court did not err or abuse its discretion in dismissing the complaint and disqualifying flpa and its counsel 
having affirmed the judgment of the district court insofar as it concluded that bibi violated rule c,we must decide whether the district court remedy dismissing the complaint and disqualifying flpa,flpa counsel,and the individual relators from bringing this action or any subsequent action based on the same facts was proper.
we review a district court decision on remedies for ethical violations for abuse of discretion.see grant haines,cir remedy of disqualification will only be upset upon a showing of abuse.a district court has abused its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law,made a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or rendered a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.nml capital,republic of argentina,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
we have long recognized the power of trial judges to disqualify attorneys where necessary to preserve the integrity of the adversary process most commonly where the attorney is at least potentially in a position to use privileged information concerning the other side through prior representation bd.of ed.of new york nyquist,cir internal quotation marks omitted.dismissal of a complaint prepared in reliance on privileged information may also be an appropriate remedy.see,ackerman.prop.analysts,aff without opinion,cir disqualifying counsel and dismissing complaint prepared in reliance on improper disclosures by the opposing party former counsel doe v.a,aff sub nom.hall,cir dismissing complaint in a derivative action brought by a lawyer against a former client on the basis of confidential information obtained while representing that client,and disqualifying lawyer.
we are conscious that,notwithstanding any salutary effect on attorney ethics or the appearance of fairness,dismissal or disqualification for violations of ethical rules may impede the pursuit of meritorious litigation to the detriment of the justice system.see,fund of funds,arthur andersen,cir affirming a district court refusal to dismiss a complaint due to ethical violations on the ground that we are loathe to countenance a remedy which will affect the rights of a plaintiff embarked on serious litigation.accordingly,courts must balance these competing concerns by limiting remedies for ethical violations to those necessary to avoid taint ing the underlying trial.nyquist,at see also fund of funds,at w e have sought to strike a delicate balance between the litigant interest in representation by counsel of its choice and the need to maintain high ethical standards within the profession of law.hull,at a party right to counsel of her choice must yield to considerations of ethics which run to the very integrity of our judicial process.
we have repeatedly cautioned that,w hen dealing with ethical principles,we can not paint with broad strokes.fund of funds,at internal quotation marks,citations and alteration omitted.in evaluating the remedies ordered here,we note flpa unusual posture in this litigation by virtue of its status as relator.while flpa stands to benefit from any recovery in this case,it brings this suit on behalf of the united states government.as such,it acts neither as the real party in interest nor in a representative capacity.in addition,we recognize the particularly strong federal interest underpinning qui tam litigation pursuant to the fca.
dismissal of the complaint and disqualification of flpa 
we first address the district court decision to dismiss the complaint as to all defendants and disqualify flpa and its individual relators.in ordering remedies for bibi violation of the rules,the district court correctly recognized that n ot all violations of the legal code of ethics require dismissal or disqualification of counsel,and that the relevant inquiry was the possibility of prejudice at trial.quest diagnostics,wl,at internal quotation marks omitted.after considering lesser alternatives,the district court concluded that because flpa pursued this litigation on the basis that bibi could spill his guts and freely disclose unilab confidential information,it would be virtually impossible to identify and distinguish each improper disclosure.id.at.furthermore,given the concessions by baker and michaelson that bibi had revealed information about confidential communications with whalen,id.at,a llowing baker and michaelson to proceed with the suit would allow that taint to proceed into trial,id.at.
we do not conclude that the district court erred or abused its discretion in finding that,in view of bibi unrestricted sharing of confidential information with the other individual relators,permitting flpa or any of its individual relators to proceed with th
