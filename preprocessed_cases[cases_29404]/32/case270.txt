we have for review a referee report recommending that roland raymond louis,be found guilty of professional misconduct for violating a number of the rules regulating the florida bar.the referee is recommending several sanctions,the most significant of which are a suspension,probation for three years,and forfeiture of to the florida bar clients security fund.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.
for the reasons explained herein,we disapprove the referee recommendation that louis be suspended.instead,we impose disbarment.further,in addition to disgorgement of,we order louis to pay interest on that amount.
background 
louis was a shareholder in the law firm of friedman,rodriguez,ferraro,and louis frf s.the firm was hired to represent twenty clients who sought to sue dupont corporation for damages allegedly resulting from use of the dupont product benlate,a fungicide that was suspected of causing severe crop damage and was recalled from the market in march,which lead to mass tort litigation by farmers against dupont.the partners in the firm were paul friedman,diane ferraro,roland louis,and francisco rodriguez.the florida bar brought separate disciplinary actions against the four named partners of the firm alleging that they committed misconduct by engaging in a secret engagement agreement with the dupont corporation,solely for their own financial benefit,while they were representing the clients in the benlate cases against dupont.based on the partners separate acts of misconduct,they received different sanctions.
ferraro received a public reprimand and made restitution of to the clients.bar ferraro,so d table citation.the sanction was based on the referee finding that ferraro had absolutely nothing to do with the settlement negotiations with dupont and did not even know about the engagement agreement until well after her former partners received the prohibited funds.due to these facts,the referee ultimately recommended a public reprimand.
friedman did not know about the engagement agreement until after it had been executed.thus,he had a comparatively small role in the firm misconduct.also,friedman cooperated with the bar and he paid restitution before his disciplinary case was reviewed by this court.however,friedman partook in the financial benefits of the unethical engagement agreement,exposed the benlate clients to potential harm by engaging in the conflict of interest,and acquiesced in the firm lying to the clients.friedman misconduct merited a suspension and payment of restitution in the amount of.bar friedman,so d table citation.
louis and rodriguez were the firm principal actors in developing and executing the engagement agreement.they created a conflict of interest when they executed the engagement agreement with dupont,placing their financial interests above those of their benlate clients.see.bar rodriguez,so d imposing a suspension on rodriguez.as discussed herein,louis engaged in additional misconduct,including acts of dishonesty such as lying to a judge and the bar regarding the secret engagement agreement.clearly,louis cumulative misconduct is the most egregious.
with regard to louis,a referee issued a report making the following findings and recommendations.
louis and rodriguez were the firm primary lawyers working on the benlate matters.louis,who had been practicing law for approximately fourteen years,brought the benlate clients to frf s.he had primary authority for communicating with the clients,and he was the main strategist in the case.
the engagement agreement between the firm and dupont in,jim davis,the owner of davis tree farm davis,came to louis,who agreed to take over davis benlate case from a previous firm that had quit the case.if the davis case went to trial,it had fair prospects of a recovery,although the liability,causation,and damages elements of benlate cases can be difficult to prove.davis previous lawyer advised davis that he thought the most dupont would offer in settlement would be.
over the next two years,louis and frf s were representing nineteen additional benlate claimants.dupont vigorously defended itself with carefully calculated strategies and scorched earth discovery tactics.louis aggressively pursued discovery,motion practice,and investigations.he documented a pattern and practice of dupont deliberate discovery abuse.by diligent and extraordinary efforts,louis discovered a secret benlate field test dupont conducted in in costa rica,in which benlate had severely damaged the plants.he proved that dupont had concealed or destroyed all of the physical evidence of that test,and that dupont had denied under oath that the test even took place.louis parlayed that evidence,together with other dupont discovery violations,into a motion for sanctions,asking the trial judge to strike dupont pleadings in the davis case.the judge agreed,and orally advised the parties that she was striking dupont pleadings as a sanction.the judge encouraged dupont to settle the case.
as a result of the judge anticipated written order,dupont actively sought to settle all twenty cases.during the settlement discussions,rodriguez learned that dupont was requesting the firm to cease representing any benlate plaintiffs as a condition of the settlement.at various points in the negotiations,dupont raised the issue of the firm not bringing any future benlate cases.initially,louis refused to discuss such an engagement agreement.nevertheless,the firm researched the issue with regard to rule b of the rules regulating the florida bar the rule provides that a lawyer shall not participate in offering or making an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer right to practice is part of the settlement of a client controversy.
dupont made substantial offers for all the cases except davis.the amounts exceeded what the clients could have reasonably expected to recover if their cases went to trial.however,these nineteen benlate clients had only marginal claims unless their cases were tied to the davis case.thus,because the davis case was still unsettled,the parties agreed to submit the case to mediation.the parties employed a mediator,who was the special master for benlate cases in dade county.
during a recess in mediation,the trial judge entered a written order striking dupont pleadings in the davis case.this had the effect of vitiating all of the irrevocable settlement offers made by dupont over the prior month of negotiations.to salvage the situation,both parties contacted the mediator to secure an emergency hearing before the trial judge for the next morning.thereafter,the mediation evolved into a settlement negotiation of the davis case.that evening,the negotiations resulted in a million settlement for the davis case.dupont offers were irrevocable for sixty days with the following contingencies the trial judge order striking dupont pleadings would be vacated and sealed without any publicity all offers to all plaintiffs were contingent on actual settlement of the davis case and another case brought by fred haupt and the settlement figures were to be kept confidential.the confidentiality of the settlement offers made to each client was ensured by a hold back provision that retained ten percent of the clients settlement funds in escrow for two years.those funds would be forfeited to dupont if there were a breach of confidentiality.
after the settlement numbers were agreed upon in negotiation,the mediator reported to frf s that dupont counsel insisted that the firm agree not to bring any future benlate cases against dupont.louis and rodriguez initially rejected this condition,but dupont counsel insisted on the engagement agreement,asserting that it was dupont policy to secure such an agreement.the referee noted that the main proponents of the scheme were the attorneys for dupont.in fact,dupont counsel referred to an article purportedly written for an american bar association publication that allegedly supported their position.the article allegedly described a practice where opposing attorneys are retained by the defendant,which would supposedly prevent the plaintiff attorney from suing the defendant in the future.louis testified that frf s asked the mediator whether agreements like this were done and that the mediator responded in the affirmative.ultimately,louis and rodriguez agreed to dupont conditions.louis went with dupont counsel to draft the engagement agreement and finalize the settlement agreement.
the engagement agreement stated that the firm accepted dupont offer to be retained for and to perform unspecified work concerning benlate matters.the engagement agreement provided that the work for dupont was to commence upon completion of all activities on behalf of our existing benlate clients.based on that provision,the referee found that louis did not become an agent of dupont,had no conflict of interest with his clients or dupont,and did not violate rule a representing adverse interests of the rules regulating the florida bar.the referee found that louis had violated rule b duty to avoid limitation on independent professional judgment because the exercise of his independent professional judgment was limited by his own interest in keeping the engagement agreement a secret from his clients.
frf s received the from dupont for the engagement agreement.although dupont and frf s agreed that payments for work in the future were to be based on the frf s standard hourly rate,at no time did louis or dupont counsel expect the firm to actually represent dupont.the true purpose of the engagement agreement was to create the appearance of a conflict so frf s might circumvent rule regulating the florida bar b.
louis testified that,in his estimate,the value of potential future benlate business that frf s surrendered to dupont far exceeded million.however,he claimed that if the firm had not agreed to dupont demand regarding the engagement agreement,the value of nineteen of the benlate claims other than the davis claim would have been greatly diminished.thus,before the referee,louis asserted that he was acting in the best interests of his clients when he signed the engagement agreement for.nevertheless,the unrefuted evidence shows that the paid to the clients and the paid to frf s for the engagement agreement were separate funds.the was not taken from funds that were available to the clients.
louis and the dupont attorneys finished drafting the engagement and settlement agreements in the early morning hours.louis signed the engagement agreement and the settlement agreement on behalf of frf s.at the time,louis was aware that rule b a lawyer shall not participate in making an agreement in which a restriction on the lawyer right to practice is part of the settlement prohibited the making of such an agreement.the referee found that by entering into this agreement,louis violated rule b.in turn,louis also violated rule a a lawyer shall not violate the rules of professional conduct of the rules regulating the florida bar.
at,the parties appeared before the trial judge and announced that a settlement had been reached.frf s and dupont did not disclose any of the details to the judge.
aftermath of the settlement and engagement agreements.after the settlement,louis traveled around the state meeting with the benlate clients,presenting the dupont settlement offers.he urged them to accept the settlements.in fact,he informed some clients that if they did not accept,frf s would withdraw as their lawyers.louis did not tell the nineteen clients about frf s engagement agreement with dupont or that frf s was now retained by dupont.further,each client received a redacted copy of the settlement agreement containing only his own settlement offer and an authorization to settle form.
eventually,every client ended up authorizing the settlement,although some clients were dissatisfied and demanded more information.one client,jerry gilley,demanded to know the specifics of the settlement negotiations.louis refused to tell gilley anything other than the dollar amount he would receive.in addition,louis refused to advise gilley.thus,gilley was compelled to hire another attorney,marc ossinsky,to uncover the details of the settlement negotiations.louis refused to provide ossinsky or gilley any information regarding the engagement agreement.by his behavior,louis failed to keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of the engagement agreement and therefore violated rule a informing client of status of representation of the rules regulating the florida bar.further,louis failed to explain the terms of the settlement to the extent reasonably necessary for his clients to make informed decisions regarding the representation and the offer from dupont,even though there were specific inquiries regarding the terms of the settlement agreement.thus,louis also violated rule b duty to explain matters to client.
by purposefully not disclosing the engagement agreement,louis was protecting frf s interest in the,his own interest in his share of that fee,and dupont economic interests by not having it publicly disclosed that it had paid a law firm in violation of rule b.such information could have caused dupont serious financial and legal harm because it had ongoing benlate litigation across the country.thus,the referee found louis exercise of his independent professional judgment was materially limited by his own financial interest.therefore,he violated rule b duty to avoid limitation on independent professional judgment of the rules regulating the florida bar.
except for davis tree farms,none of the clients were told of the engagement agreement.louis knew that the clients had not been told,did not tell them himself,and never explained the terms of the engagement agreement to any of his clients.thus,he failed to keep his clients reasonably informed about the status of the engagement agreement and,therefore,violated rule a.
thereafter,louis accepted his share of the engagement agreement,which was.by accepting those proceeds,louis ratified the terms of the engagement agreement.also,louis participated fully in all of the discussions and negotiations with dupont concerning the engagement agreement.thus,in executing the engagement agreement and keeping it secret from his clients,on behalf of the firm,louis also violated rule c a lawyer is responsible for another lawyer violations of the rules of professional conduct under certain circumstances of the rules regulating the florida bar.
the referee also found that the engagement agreement payment was in violation of rule b and,therefore,was a prohibited fee.thus,louis also violated rule a an attorney shall not enter into an agreement for,charge,or collect an illegal,prohibited,or clearly excessive fee or cost of the rules regulating the florida bar.
bar investigation.in,having received informal complaints,the bar conducted an investigation into allegations that the settlement agreement was not explained to the clients and that it was a prohibited aggregate settlement.
in january,louis sent a letter to bar counsel elena evans,which served as his response to the complaints.in that response,he made the following statement it is therefore disappointing that ossinsky would continue to insist that we have withheld some kind of documentation relating to the settlement negotiations we simply can not furnish him with what does not exist.this statement was false because the engagement agreement did exist,and it had not been disclosed to ossinsky or the bar.at the time louis made the statement,he knew his statement was false.it was a misrepresentation that was material to the bar investigation.thus,louis violated rules a and c engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation of the rules regulating the florida bar.
the bar received additional complaints from several former benlate clients.the bar counsel for these investigations was joan fowler,and the grievance committee member was jeanette haag.at the request of louis and rodriguez,a meeting was arranged with these bar representatives in inverness.prior to the meeting,fowler had telephone conversations with louis and rodriguez in which she asked them to bring all documents relating to the settlements to the inverness meeting.the meeting was held in haag office,with haag,fowler,louis,rodriguez,and robert batsel,the attorney representing louis and rodriguez,present.
batsel advised louis that he had a duty to answer all of the bar questions fully and truthfully,and to supply all documents that were responsive to an inquiry by the bar.however,batsel also advised louis that he was not required to volunteer the existence of the engagement agreement or the confidential terms of the settlement.
pursuant to the bar direction that louis and rodriguez bring any documents they wanted the bar to review,they brought a box of records to the inverness meeting.although the records of the settlement and the engagement agreement were in the box,the engagement agreement was neither inspected by the bar nor brought to the bar attention.there are two versions of what transpired at this meeting.louis and rodriguez contend that no question was asked that would require them to show the engagement agreement to the bar.in contrast,fowler testified that louis and rodriguez pulled documents out of the box one at a time,showed them to the bar representatives,and explained each document.fowler testified that she believed she had seen all of the documents in the box.thus,she was under a misapprehension that she had seen all of the documents.louis never revealed the existence of the engagement agreement to fowler or haag,even when fowler asked rodriguez and louis if they had received money from dupont.this issue was discussed in the context of that appeared to have been paid directly to the firm by dupont.the bar concern was whether this was a payoff for an agreement not to represent future benlate plaintiffs against dupont.thus,at that time,fowler was under the misapprehension that the was the payment by dupont to frf s for a restriction on the right to practice.when fowler inquired about that money,louis stated that the amount was an award of sanctions against dupont on the davis case.fowler believed this was a complete answer.however,at this point louis knew or should have known of fowler misapprehension,yet louis failed to correct it.nor did louis disclose the existence of the engagement agreement.
the referee found louis purposeful omission created a misunderstanding for fowler.louis conduct,from the start,was designed to gain fowler trust by his offer of complete cooperation with the investigation,his willingness to travel to inverness,and his eagerness to meet face to face to explain his position.yet,while louis knew the engagement agreement was relevant to the investigation of the settlements of the clients claims,he deliberately obfuscated matters and omitted showing the engagement agreement to fowler.thus,louis violated rule b a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter shall not fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension of the rules regulating the florida bar.because louis had requested the meeting to explain his position and demonstrate the good work he had performed for his clients,he had a duty to volunteer the engagement agreement to fowler,especially because he knew at the time that he had created the misunderstanding.yet,louis purposefully failed to correct the misunderstanding.thus,he violated rule b by his omission,and rule c a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation by engaging in this misrepresentation to the bar investigators.
misrepresentation to judge wilson.in october,louis appeared before circuit judge thomas wilson,while representing carolyn smith in a malpractice action against her former lawyers,who had represented smith in a benlate claim against dupont.defendant counsel moved to disqualify louis because of a conflict of interest.even though louis knew that the engagement agreement with dupont was material to the conflict of interest issue,he failed to disclose its existence to the circuit judge.
judge wilson later discovered the existence of the engagement agreement and a prior disciplinary consent judgment regarding the settlement.he asked louis why he should not provide that information to the bar.in response,louis claimed i disclosed to the florida bar at the time i was questioned every piece of information,every document at my disposal.the referee found this statement to be false because the engagement agreement had not been disclosed to the bar.further,at the time louis made this statement to judge wilson,louis knew it was false.he also knew that it concerned a fact that was material to the inquiry of judge wilson regarding a possible conflict of interest in the malpractice case.
judge wilson asked louis if he did not have the agreement at his disposal,did not know about it,or whether it did not exist.louis replied no,your honor,i not telling you that.i am telling you,sitting as the court presiding over this case,that i made full disclosure to the florida bar.this statement was false because louis had not disclosed the engagement agreement to the bar.further,louis knew that the statement was false when he made the statement to judge wilson.the referee found that louis statements to judge wilson were misrepresentations that violated rules candor toward the tribunal and c of the rules regulating the florida bar.
defenses raised by respondent.before the referee,louis raised three affirmative defenses the constitutionality of rule b he acted under duress,coercion,and necessity and he acted on the advice of counsel.
the referee found that rule b,the practice restriction rule,is constitutional on its face and as applied.the referee also found that the policy reasons for the rule directly apply to this case.when dupont issued its ultimatum that the firm be retained,dupont effectively made louis,who the referee stated was among the most qualified benlate plaintiffs lawyers in the world,unavailable to future claimants.
next,the referee found that duress,coercion,and necessity were not viable defenses to the rule violations under the facts of this case.as a matter of law,fear of not receiving money can not be the basis for a claim of duress.also,louis argument that the settlement had to be finalized on the night in question does not amount to coercion.louis further testified that he was acting in his clients best interests by entering into the engagement agreement.as a matter of law,that is not a defense to rule violations.
lastly,louis raised advice of counsel as a defense to some of the alleged rule violations.rule a of the rules regulating the florida bar states that a lawyer is bound by the rules of professional conduct even if the lawyer is instructed otherwise by another person.thus,a defense based on advice of counsel is not available to respondents in florida bar discipline cases unless specifically provided for in a rule or considered as a matter in mitigation 
findings as to guilt.the referee found louis guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar a informing client of status of representation b duty to explain matters to client a prohibited fees b duty to avoid limitation on independent professional judgment candor toward a tribunal c responsibilities of a partner b restriction on right to practice a knowingly making a false statement of material fact b failure to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension a violating or attempting to violate the rules of professional conduct and c engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation.
disciplinary recommendations.with regard to aggravating factors,the referee found that louis had a dishonest motive submitted false statements during the disciplinary process and had substantial experience in the practice of law based on his fourteen years of experience as a lawyer when he entered into the practice restriction.however,the referee noted that louis had no substantial experience in mass tort litigation.
with regard to mitigating factors,the referee found that louis had no prior disciplinary record was inexperienced in the practice of mass tort litigation had good character or reputation and has shown remorse for violating the rules and for what this has done to his family.the referee further noted that louis has been through a significant amount of turmoil and that he and his family have been financially damaged by this experience.
as to discipline,the referee recommended that louis be suspended from the practice of law for sixty days be placed on probation for three years during which time he would be required to perform one hundred hours of pro bono services per year and to take five additional ethics hours per year and forfeit to the florida bar clients security fund in accordance with rule h of the rules regulating the florida bar.the referee found that such a forfeiture is authorized and that it is not a fine.the referee also awarded costs to the bar in the amount of.
on review.before this court,the bar filed an initial brief seeking disbarment and review of the referee finding that louis did not violate rule a.louis filed an amended answer brief and initial brief on cross appeal,in which he raised numerous issues.
consent judgment and res judicata.louis argues that the bar claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata.in,louis and the bar entered into a consent judgment regarding disciplinary proceedings against louis based on his misconduct in dealing with the firm twenty benlate clients.louis asserts that the instant case is a subsequent attempt by the bar to discipline him for conduct relating to the benlate clients and that the doctrine of res judicata applies to this proceeding.
we disagree.the bar was not precluded from bringing a second complaint that is based on the firm secret agreement with dupont.the doctrine of res judicata applies when all four of the following conditions are present identity of the thing sued for identity of the cause of action identity of persons and parties to the action and identity of quality in persons for or against whom claim is made.mcgregor provident trust of philadelphia,so,see also palm afc holdings,palm beach county,so d,dca.thus,the causes of action must be closely related for the doctrine of res judicata to apply.see hay salisbury,so.
with regard to louis,the previous and current proceedings broadly stem from his representation of the benlate clients in a lawsuit against dupont.however,the previous case focused on how frf s dealt with its clients and whether the firm improperly negotiated an aggregate settlement for the clients.in contrast,the current case is based on the secret engagement agreement that frf s arranged directly with dupont while still representing its benlate clients.where the second action between the same parties is upon a different claim or demand,the judgment in the prior action operates as an estoppel only as to those matters in issue or points controverted,upon the determination of which the finding or verdict was rendered.gray gray,so,quoting cromwell county of sac.thus,the current case is not barred by res judicata as it is based on a different cause of action,louis relationship with dupont.see.bar gentry,so d holding that because subsequent bar allegations were based on separate,additional,and continuing misconduct,there was no identity of facts for res judicata to bar the proceedings.
findings of fact.louis challenges the referee findings of fact.he contends the referee finding that he made a material misrepresentation when responding to bar counsel evans initial inquiry letter is not supported by the record.a referee finding of fact carries with it a presumption of correctness that should be upheld unless clearly erroneous or without support in the record.bar barrett,so d.absent a showing that the referee findings are clearly erroneous or lacking in evidentiary support,this court is precluded from reweighing the evidence and substituting its judgment for that of the referee.id.
in january,louis sent the response letter to bar counsel evans,in which he stated it is therefore disappointing that ossinsky would continue to insist that we have withheld some kind of documentation relating to the settlement negotiations we simply can not furnish him with what does not exist.when louis wrote that response,he knew that the engagement agreement existed because he had assisted in drafting it.further,he knew that it had not been disclosed to gilley,ossinsky,or the bar.thus,it is clear louis lied to the bar when he claimed that he was not withholding any documents and that no other documents existed.the referee factual findings on this point are supported by the record.
next,louis claims the referee finding that louis failed to correct the apparent misapprehension of bar investigators at the inverness meeting is also not supported by the record.he argues that he did not lie to the investigators.in contrast to louis assertions,however,the record supports the referee finding.louis admitted that he did not want to divulge the engagement agreement to the bar.in fact,he purposefully avoided disclosing the engagement agreement to the bar investigators.based on louis handling of the documents that were brought to the meeting and displayed by louis to the bar investigators,fowler was under a misapprehension that she had seen all of the documents in the box.
rule of the rules regulating the florida bar provides that a lawyer,in connection with a disciplinary matter,shall not fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a bar admissions or bar disciplinary authority.the rule may be violated by an omission in connection with a disciplinary investigation of the lawyer own conduct.thus,rule imposes an affirmative duty upon lawyers to abide by high standards of truthfulness and candor in order to maintain the integrity of the profession.we conclude that the record and the rule support the referee findings in this case.
louis also challenges the referee finding that he made deliberate misrepresentations of material facts to judge wilson.louis asserts that he merely misspoke when telling judge wilson that he had engaged in full disclosure with the bar.we strongly disagree with louis characterization of his statements and conclude that the record supports the referee findings.judge wilson questioned louis because of an allegation that louis had a conflict of interest that could result in disqualification.obviously,at that time,louis knew that he had previously signed the engagement agreement with dupont,which would create a conflict of interest for louis regarding benlate cases.the record clearly demonstrates that louis did not answer judge wilson with candor and truthfulness.thus,the referee findings are amply supported.
violation of rule a.the bar argues that the referee was clearly erroneous in failing to find that louis violated rule a representing interests adverse to his clients.we agree.the referee determination that louis was not guilty of violating rule a was a legal conclusion.this court scope of review in attorney disciplinary actions is broader for legal conclusions than it is for factual findings.see.bar joy,so d.rule a provides that a lawyer shall not represent a client if representation of that client will be directly adverse to the interests of another client unless the lawyer reasonably believes the representation will not adversely affect the lawyer responsibilities to and relationship with the other client and each client consents after consultation.the rule imposes a mandatory prohibition on such representation,unless the lawyer meets the exception.louis did not meet those steps.
with regard to the first step,louis knowingly entered into the engagement agreement with dupont,forming a relationship with dupont while still representing the benlate clients.the record reveals that louis even pressured some of his benlate clients to accept dupont settlement offer.he informed clients that he would cease representing them unless they accepted the settlement,although he refused to inform those clients of the settlement details.in addition,louis decided not to inform his clients about his decision to represent dupont,the very decision he made while negotiating their cases against dupont.thus,the record demonstrates that through his actions louis had divided loyalties,and that his divided loyalties could have adversely affected his benlate clients.as to the second step,the record a
