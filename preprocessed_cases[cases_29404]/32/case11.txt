in this case,the district court confirmed an arbitration award that directed a hospital to reinstate an nurse.the hospital,citing the pains that must be taken by professionals to restrict the distribution of controlled substances,appeals on the ground that the reinstatement order transgresses public policy.after studying the matter,we agree with the district court that the arbitral award should be confirmed.
background 
we start by rehearsing the underlying facts.we then limn what transpired before the arbitrator and the district court,respectively.
mercy hospital the hospital operates an acute care hospital facility in springfield,massachusetts.massachusetts nurses association the mna is the authorized collective bargaining representative of the nurses who toil there.the hospital and the mna are and were at all relevant times parties to a collective bargaining agreement cba.the cba recognizes the hospital right to discipline or discharge employees for just cause and establishes a grievance procedure,culminating in binding arbitration,for the resolution of disputes between the hospital and the nurses.
the hospital hired nancy dufault as a nurse in.in the pertinent time frame,dufault worked the night shift in the intensive care unit icu.part of her responsibilities included administration of ativan,morphine,and other controlled substances designed to relieve pain or anxiety.dufault also served as a preceptor charged with oversight of fledgling icu nurses orientees.
over her estimable career,dufault developed a reputation as an industrious,highly skilled nurse.in,the hospital gave her a special commendation for her service as a preceptor.her last performance evaluation,prepared shortly before the events in question occurred,describes her as a very strong expert critical care nurse and remarks that she had exceeded hospital standards in a number of performance areas.
in the fall of,storm clouds gathered.the hospital revised its system for administering medication to icu patients and installed an omnicell machine in that unit.the machine functions as a computerized medicine cabinet.to obtain medication,a nurse must enter into an electronic keypad her personal code,the patient personal code,the type of drug,and the dosage.the omnicell processes this information and automatically unlocks the compartment housing the requested medication.
after administering the medicine to the patient,the nurse records the time,the identity of the drug,and the dosage in a separate database known as sms.each night,a medicine administration schedule mas displaying the data entered into the sms system is printed out and filed in the patient chart.the purpose of this regime is to enhance the hospital ability to track and correlate requests for and administration of medications in the icu.
in june of a nursing supervisor approached dufault about a possible discrepancy in the dual entries for a patient in her care.the supervisor accepted dufault explanation and allowed the incident to pass without further inquiry.
the following month,the same supervisor detected what appeared to be inconsistencies between the omnicell record and the mas of one of dufault patients.the supervisor conducted an independent review of dufault entries into the omnicell and sms systems.based on that review,the supervisor and a nurse who had assisted her concluded that,on a number of occasions,dufault had withdrawn medication from the omnicell without recording an offsetting entry for administration in the sms system.they related their conclusions to the director of nursing,mary brown,who placed dufault on administrative leave pending further investigation.
on august,brown met with dufault,an mna representative,and the two nurses who had conducted the initial review.brown presented dufault with the omnicell and sms printouts for five different patients and asked her to explain the inconsistences in her entries.with respect to an instance in which she had withdrawn eighteen milligrams of ativan but had made no record of dispensing such a dose to the patient,dufault stated that she had retrieved the unusually large quantity of ativan so that she could prepare an intravenous drip bag and avoid having to return periodically to the omnicell to obtain the smaller doses prescribed in the physician orders.the other four instances dated back nearly two months,and dufault complained that,without forewarning,she could not recall the particulars.she speculated,however,that incomplete documentation by her and an orientee probably explained the discrepancies.the meeting ended on that note.
brown convened a second meeting two days later.she regarded dufault explanation of the discrepancy involving the eighteen milligrams of ativan as implausible the patient intravenous drip had been discontinued several hours before dufault withdrew the ativan,and the physician orders called for the drug to be injected rather than administered by intravenous drip.dufault stood by her previous account.brown then presented dufault with two more alleged inconsistencies in her entries and served her with a termination notice.the stated reason for termination was failure to adhere to the standards of substance drug diversion.
following dufault discharge,the mna filed a grievance on her behalf.the parties eventually submitted two imbricated matters to binding arbitration i whether there was just cause for dufault termination and ii if not,what consequences should ensue.
the arbitrator conducted an evidentiary hearing.she subsequently issued an opinion concluding that the preponderance of the evidence did not support the claim that dufault had engaged in drug diversion but,rather,supported her repeated denials of culpability.in the arbitrator view,dufault testimony that the discrepancies were most likely the result of documentation errors was worthy of belief for four reasons i dufault and other nurses testified credibly that they commonly caught up on their sms entries during breaks or at the end of their shifts when they could not always remember the exact medications and dosages administered ii dufault explanation of the probable cause of the discrepancies had remained consistent throughout the investigation and the grievance process iii dufault testimony that icu nurses occasionally deviated from established documentation protocols had been more corroborated than rebutted by the other evidence in the case and iv there was absolutely no proof to substantiate the hospital accusation that the discrepancies in the records were attributable to the diversion of drugs the arbitrator also found that dufault had received no formal training as a preceptor and that the hospital had no established policy as to which preceptor or the responsible for documenting the medications administered to patients who were under their joint care.
with specific reference to the ativan incident,the arbitrator accepted the testimony of two witnesses that it was common practice for icu nurses to prepare intravenous drip bags well in advance of the time when they would be needed either for use during their own or succeeding shifts.the arbitrator also credited testimony that although it was not good practice,a nurse might deviate from a doctor orders and administer medication intravenously rather than by syringe as a device.
on the basis of these findings,the arbitrator concluded in pertinent part 
the hospital failed to carry its burden in this matter.the preponderance of the evidence in the record supports dufault denial of any culpability with respect to the hospital charges of drug diversion dufault credibly testified as to what she believed were the most likely actions she took or did not take with respect to the narcotics she removed from the omnicell in light of the hospital failure to submit a preponderance of evidence that contradicts dufault account,the termination is found to be without just cause.
the arbitrator then moved to the remedy question and,taking into account the idiosyncratic facts of the case,ordered the hospital to reinstate dufault with back pay and without any loss of seniority.
the hospital was not pleased.it asked the federal di
