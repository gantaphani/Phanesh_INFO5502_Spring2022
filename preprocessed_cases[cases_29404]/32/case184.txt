ellen hughes finnerty,a registered nurse,petitioned for a writ of mandate requiring the board of registered nursing to set aside its decision disciplining her for gross negligence and incompetence.the board disciplined finnerty in connection with an incident during which finnerty refused to comply with a resident physician order that a patient be intubated immediately in his room,and instead insisted on first moving and did move the patient to the intensive care unit,where the intubation was then performed.the trial court found the weight of the evidence supported the board conclusion that finnerty conduct constituted both incompetence and gross negligence,and denied finnerty petition.because the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
in the early morning hours of august,finnerty,a nurse with more than years of experience,was working as a resource or charge nurse,responsible for among other duties monitoring the conditions of patients in two stations,including a subacute unit station,at huntington memorial hospital.one of the patients in station was james,a man with down syndrome and multiple illnesses the patient.the patient began to suffer from respiratory distress,and between and,the nurse caring for him,ann mugi,called a respiratory therapist hiran obeyesekere to assist her.the patient respiration was rapid and labored,with oxygen saturation of only percent.obeyesekere suctioned the patient pharynx to help prevent airway blockage,and mugi called the telephone exchange of the patient primary care physician jackson,reporting a respiratory rate of breaths per minute rather than the normal to per minute and a low urinary output.
at,mugi received jackson orders for percent oxygen via a mask,various blood tests,a diuretic,and to keep the patient blood oxygenation level above percent.
at about,the patient respiration continued to be labored breaths per minute.obeyesekere again suctioned mucus from the patient pharynx,allowing him to breathe well for a few minutes the patient blood oxygenation level was then percent.the medical records show a order from jackson,also at,directing transfer of the patient to the icu for respiratory failure impending code and directing the medical resident to intubate patient stat.this order was not recorded in the patient records until after the pertinent events occurred,so finnerty was unaware of jackson order.
at approximately,mugi paged hengemeh monsef,the medical intern on call.when monsef arrived,mugi informed her jackson had requested the patient be intubated and prepared for transfer to the icu.monsef examined the patient and found him barely responsive,lethargic,breathing rapidly,and appearing very sick and weak,with an altered level of consciousness.she confirmed the need for an arterial analysis,and obeyesekere took a blood sample to the lab for analysis.between and,finnerty also came to the patient room,along with respiratory therapist joey lee.finnerty examined the patient,but did not discuss her findings with monsef,who ordered the patient to be transported to the icu.finnerty left to telephone the icu to reserve a bed.
at,obeyesekere returned with the lab results,which indicated acidosis and insufficient blood oxygenation.monsef concluded the patient was too unstable to be transported to the icu and needed his airway secured first she paged the resident,jennifer nguyen,monsef immediate supervisor,to assist with the clinical decision of whether to intubate the patient.nguyen arrived within five minutes of being paged.when nguyen arrived,finnerty was helping the respiratory therapists prepare to transport the patient to the icu.nguyen found the patient cyanotic or thoroughly pale,and monsef told her the patient was unstable and needed to be intubated.
nguyen agreed with monsef,informed everyone in the room that the patient was to be intubated,and instructed obeyesekere to obtain the necessary supplies which were on a crash cart on the floor.obeyesekere left to do so.finnerty told nguyen that she could not intubate the patient on the floor and that the patient was first to be taken to the icu.nguyen repeated her intention to intubate the patient immediately,but finnerty proceeded to unplug the bed from its electrical outlet and maneuver the bed out of the room.all personnel in the room,including nguyen,followed the patient as finnerty and lee transported him to the icu,which was on another floor of the hospital the trip to the icu took approximately five minutes.the patient was transported without any device for monitoring his cardiac status or vital signs he received oxygen from a portable tank during the transport.
the patient and entourage arrived at the icu at approximately morphine sulfate was administered and monsef successfully intubated the patient.at,his respiration was breaths per minute.his vital signs,which were normal on arrival at the icu,fluctuated during the next several minutes at,a code blue was initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation began at and the patient died at.there was no evidence the delay in intubating the patient caused or contributed to his death 
nguyen entered a code blue note on the patient record at,recording the incident substantially as described above at,finnerty wrote an occurrence report of the incident which included the statement that she c ountermand ed the order of nguyen she wrote that when nguyen said she wanted to intubate in the room,she finnerty said the equipment and staff were not adequate and the patient should be moved to the icu,and nguyen repeated request to intubate on the floor.finnerty further observed that the patent was awake,but lethargic,was breathing spontaneously with palpable pulses,was viable at the time and would have had to be transported to the icu after intubation at much risk due to the obvious complications an unnecessary intubation and code blue on the station,especially at change of shift would compromise all the patients on the unit.
a few days after the incident,huntington memorial hospital terminated finnerty employment,listing gross to follow direction from treating physician as the reason for the termination.the hospital discharge memorandum stated finnerty had refused the physician order and transported the patient to the icu without a cardiac monitor or a secure airway,thereby placing the patient in an unsafe environment.finnerty noted her disagreement with the hospital finding due to the lack of a direct order to me by the physician to do or not do anything and the knowledge that the patient was transported to icu faster than a code team could have come to the room.finnerty subsequent legal action against the hospital was settled by cancelling finnerty termination in exchange for her agreement to resign.finnerty is currently employed at glendale adventist medical center.
in april,the board of registered nursing filed an accusation in connection with the august,incident,alleging unprofessional conduct and gross negligence and incompetence and seeking the revocation or suspension of finnerty license.a hearing was held before an administrative law judge in january.the evidence and testimony from nguyen,monsef,obeyesekere and lee revealed the facts recited above.in addition,there was other evidence and testimony from several other witnesses,including 
susan turner,an expert presented by the board,opined that,while finnerty may have believed she was acting in the best interest of the patient,she was wrong while it is permissible for a registered nurse to disobey an order that is inaccurate or unsafe,the documentation turner reviewed did not indicate this was such a case.the patient had been in respiratory distress for an extended period of time intubation in the room was a viable clinical option and if insufficient staff was then present or in case of a complication during or after intubation,a code blue could have been called 
zumfiqar ahmed,a physician specializing in internal and pulmonary medicine,knew finnerty from working with her at glendale adventist.he testified he had confidence in finnerty judgment given a choice,it is preferable to int
