while a candidate for judicial office in arizona,appellant randolph wolfson initiated this action against the members of the arizona commission on judicial conduct,the members of the arizona supreme court disciplinary commission,and arizona chief bar counsel robert van wyck collectively,defendants challenging several canons of the arizona code of judicial conduct code that restricted his political speech and activities while a candidate for judicial office.while this action was pending,wolfson lost the election.because the code applies only to judges and candidates for judicial office,and because wolfson did not intend to seek judicial office in the next election,the district court dismissed the action as moot.
wolfson now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.we reverse and remand.
wolfson is a practicing attorney and member of the arizona bar.he has twice unsuccessfully sought election to judicial office in the state of arizona.in,wolfson ran for the office of kingman precinct justice of the peace in mohave county,arizona.during his campaign,wolfson filed an action alleging that several canons of the code imposed unconstitutional restrictions on his political speech and campaign activities.wolfson brammer wolfson i,no.judge stephen mcnamee.wolfson alleged that he wanted to engage in certain activities and political speech but refrained from doing so,believing the activities to be prohibited by the challenged canons of the code.in november,wolfson lost the election.it is wolfson belief that the restrictions on his campaign imposed by the code contributed to his loss.
shortly after his defeat,wolfson decided that he would again seek an elected judicial office in the elections.in early,wolfson announced his candidacy for the office of superior court judge,division v,mohave county,arizona.at this time,wolfson i was still pending.
in august,however,the district court dismissed wolfson i on the basis of prudential ripeness.the district court concluded that wolfson should seek an advisory opinion from arizona judicial ethics advisory committee ethics committee,a body empowered by the arizona supreme court to render,upon request,advisory opinions to judges and judicial candidates.see matter of walker.rule b.an advisory opinion would clarify,to some degree,whether the campaign activities and political speech in which wolfson wished to engage were prohibited by the code.following the district court dismissal,wolfson submitted a request to the ethics committee for a formal advisory opinion.in april,the ethics committee responded to wolfson request by issuing advisory opinion.
with the advisory opinion in hand,wolfson filed the present action in may.wolfson brammer wolfson ii,no.judge frederick martone.the allegations in the present action are similar to those in wolfson i wolfson alleges that he wanted to engage in certain activities and political speech but refrained,believing that the contemplated activities were prohibited by the code.
first,wolfson asserts that he wanted to solicit campaign contributions personally,at live appearances and speaking engagements,by making phone calls,and by signing his name to letters seeking donations.wolfson argues that such solicitations are prohibited by canons c and revised rules a and a,respectively collectively,the solicitation restrictions.
second,wolfson alleges that he wanted to endorse other candidates for office and to support their election campaigns.wolfson asserts that canons b revised rule a the endorsement clause and d revised rule a the campaigning prohibition forbid a candidate for judicial office from endorsing other candidates or supporting their campaigns.
third,wolfson alleges that he wanted to answer questions from voters and to make presentations regarding his views on disputed legal and political issues,but was prohibited from doing so by canon d i revised rule a the pledges and promises clause and canon e revised rule a the commits clause.
in november,wolfson lost the election.after wolfson defeat,the district court ordered him to submit a supplemental brief indicating whether he intended to seek judicial office in the next election.wolfson replied that he did not.the district court concluded that the action was moot.the district court further held that the action did not meet the exception to mootness for actions capable of repetition yet evading review.
after the district court dismissal,the arizona supreme court adopted a new code of judicial conduct.the revised code,effective september,renumbers and recodifies the canons at issue,but does not alter the substance of the challenged canons,with one exception.in the new code,the text of the commits clause has been substantially revised.the complaint alleged that the commits clause in addition to the pledges and promises clause impermissibly restricted the speech of judicial candidates regarding disputed legal and political issues.wolfson concedes that his claims regarding the commits clause have been rendered moot by the revision of that clause,and so those claims are no longer before us.
we review the district court dismissal on the grounds of mootness de novo,as a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.rosemere neighborhood ass united states epa,cir.we review factual determinations underlying the district court decision for clear error.comm.thornburgh,cir.in this appeal,defendants invoke the additional jurisdictional defenses of standing and ripeness.standing and ripeness,like the doctrine of mootness,predominantly present questions of law that we review de novo.san diego county gun rights comm.reno,cir.
article iii of the united states constitution limits federal court jurisdiction to actual,ongoing cases or controversies.lewis cont l bank,see also arizonans for official english arizona.we lack jurisdiction to decide moot questions or abstract propositions,because moot questions require no answer.north carolina rice,per curiam internal quotation marks,citations and alterations omitted.a case or controversy must exist at all stages of review,not just at the time the action is filed.alvarez smith.a case may become moot after it is filed,when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.porter jones,cir,quoting clark city of lakewood,cir.
an exception to the mootness doctrine exists,however,where an action is capable of repetition,yet evading review.so.pac.terminal interstate commerce comm n.this exception permits actions for prospective relief to go forward despite abatement of the underlying injury only in exceptional situations where the following two circumstances are simultaneously present the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration,and there was a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party would be subjected to the same action again.lewis,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
wolfson action easily satisfies the first requirement,as a controversy evading review.election cases often fall within this exception,because the inherently brief duration of an election is almost invariably too short to enable full litigation on the merits.porter,at see also joyner mofford,cir election cases are likely to escape review because appellate review often can not be completed during the brief duration of an election.indeed,this is precisely the situation wolfson has encountered being unable to complete the litigation of his claims within the brief time frame of his campaign for judicial office.
to satisfy the second requirement,that the action is capable of repetition,wolfson must establish a reasonable expectation that he will be subjected to the same action or injury again.wolfson is not presently bound to obey the code,and will not be subject to the code unless he again becomes a candidate for judicial office.wolfson is not now,and he has never been,subject to any enforcement action or threat of enforcement action related to his campaign conduct.wolfson argues,however,that this action is capable of repetition because he intends to seek elected judicial office in the future.in the alternative,wolfson asserts that his intentions toward future candidacy,or lack thereof,are irrelevant to evaluating the application of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.
the district court found that wolfson did not intend to seek judicial office in or in any other future election.this finding is clearly erroneous.while wolfson concedes that he does not intend to seek office in the election,he has declared an intent to seek judicial office at some point in the future.the district court finding relied on a supplemental brief filed by wolfson,but that brief does not support such a finding.after wolfson defeat,the district court ordered him to submit a supplemental brief answering the following question will you be a candidate for judicial office in the next election in his supplemental brief,wolfson replied plaintiff does not currently intend to be a candidate for judicial office in.on the basis of wolfson supplemental brief,the district court concluded that wolfson action was not capable of repetition,because he affirmatively state d that he does not intend to be a candidate in the next election and failed to express an intention to be a candidate in any election in the near future.
but wolfson was not asked about his future intent.wolfson response was appropriate for the question posed.the district court asked wolfson if he would seek office in the next election,and wolfson replied that he currently did not intend to be a candidate for judicial office in.the district court asked a narrow question whether wolfson intended to seek office in the next election.wolfson responded that he did not.the district court did not order wolfson to declare his intentions more generally.we do not fault wolfson for answering the specific question posed in the district court order,and we do not fault wolfson for failing to volunteer information that the court had not requested.
there is more than sufficient evidence to support a finding that wolfson intends to seek judicial office in the future.wolfson complaint expresses an intention to seek judicial office in the future,and a desire to engage in prohibited conduct both in the judicial election and in future judicial elections.furthermore,eliminating any doubts regarding the record,wolfson has represented in the present appeal that he intends to seek judicial office in a future election.the court has declined to dismiss election cases as moot where the has subsequently announced an intent to seek office in a future election.see davis fed.election comm n,challenge to provisions of federal campaign finance law not moot where the subsequently announced his intention to another campaign for office chandler miller,citing for the proposition that defective jurisdictional allegations are curable at trial or on appeal,and holding that a challenge to certain provisions of georgia election law was not moot,even though did not announce in the trial court his plans to run again,where he later represented,as an officer of this court,that he plans to run again see also fed.election comm.right to life,inc,challenge to advertising restrictions in federal campaign finance law not mooted by conclusion of election where expressed its intention to run similar ads in future elections int l org.of masters,mates pilots brown,holding an election case not moot because r espondent has run for office before and may well do so again.wolfson has declared his intention to seek elected judicial office in the future and declared his desire,in connection with any future campaign,to engage in the same activities that are the subject of the complaint in this action.these expressions of intent are sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation that this action is capable of repetition.
as an alternative,wolfson asserts that his intentions regarding future candidacy are irrelevant to our application of the capable of repetition,yet evading review exception to mootness.to support this argument,wolfson relies on our decision in schaefer townsend,cir.there,plaintiff schaefer was a resident of nevada who sought to become a candidate in a special election to fill a vacant california seat in the house of representatives.schaefer challenged a residency requirement in california election law that prohibited his candidacy.schaefer refused to disclose whether he intended to run for office in california in the future,arguing that his future political aspirations were irrelevant to evaluating the mootness exception.id.at.we decided that the exception should not be construed narrowly,observing that several cases had proceeded to the merits without examining the future political intentions of the challengers.id.at,citing dunn blumstein,joyner,at.we did not hold that only when a candidate plans to seek reelection is the case not moot,and concluded that schaefer action could proceed.id.second emphasis added,quoting thorsted munro,cir.
although the parties have vigorously disputed the viability,meaning,and import of schaefer,we need not weigh in on the matter.the plaintiff in schaefer refused to declare his future electoral intentions.wolfson,in contrast,has affirmatively stated that he intends to become a candidate again.we have already concluded that wolfson has met the ripeness requirement by indicating his intent to run for judicial office in the future.see,davis.at chandler,at.we need not go further at this time.we therefore leave for another case the significance of schaefer in this circuit.
additional objections have been raised as to our jurisdiction.defendants ask us to dismiss this case for the alternative reasons that wolfson lacks standing and that wolfson claims are not ripe.these contentions are properly considered in this appeal.see attorneys trust videotape computer,cir jurisdictional challenges may be raised at any time.
s tanding is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,see also hein freedom from religion.at an irreducible constitutional minimum,standing requires the party asserting the existence of federal court jurisdiction to establish three elements an injury in fact that is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent causation and a likelihood that a favorable decision will redress the injury.lujan,at.in addition to these requirements,the doctrine of prudential standing requires us to consider,among other things,whether the alleged injury is more than a mere generalized grievance,whether the plaintiff is asserting her own rights or the rights of third parties,and whether the claim falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the constitutional guarantee in question.alaska right to life pac feldman,cir,quoting johnson stuart,cir.
defendants argue that the third element of constitutional standing,redressability,is absent here.they argue that wolfson has failed to state a claim for relief from them,because they have no legal authority to change the code.instead,that authority is reserved to the arizona supreme court.defendants contend that wolfson,if successful in this action,can obtain no effective redress because he can not obtain a revision of the code.
wolfson need not obtain a code revision,however,in order to obtain a measure of relief.a plaintiff meets the redressability requirement if it is likely,although not certain,that his injury can be redressed by a favorable decision.see bonnichsen united states,cir beno shalala,cir plaintiff must show only that a favorable decision is likely to redress his injury,not that a favorable decision will inevitably redress his injury.if a plaintiff is an object of the challenged action there is ordinarily little question that the action or inaction has caused him injury,and that a judgment preventing or requiring the action will redress it.lujan,at.
these defendants have the power to discipline wolfson and,if they are enjoined from enforcing the challenged provisions,wolfson will have obtained redress in the form of freedom to engage in certain activities without fear of punishment.the arizona commission on judicial conduct has disciplinary jurisdiction over the actions of judges,including their actions as candidates.see generally rules of the commission on judicial conduct explaining disciplinary authority of the commission on judicial conduct see also jud.conduct,canon a successful candidate is subject to judicial discipline for campaign conduct id,rule cmt.same.the arizona supreme court disciplinary commission has authority to impose various sanctions on members of the arizona bar,including censure,reprimand,probation,and restitution.rule c,see also republican party of white,naming officers of the minnesota board on judicial standards and the lawyers board as defendants in an action challenging the constitutionality of a canon restricting behavior of candidates for judicial office.the arizona chief bar counsel is charged with overseeing and directing the prosecution of discipline cases involving members of the bar.rule.enjoining the defendants from enforcing the challenged canons will redress wolfson injury.without a possibility of the challenged canons being enforced,those canons will no longer have a chilling effect on speech.wolfson will thus be able to engage in the political speech and campaign activities he desires.it is true that wolfson can not obtain revision of the code from these defendants,but wolfson may nevertheless obtain a form of effective redress in this action.
defendants also assert that wolfson claims are not ripe.the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.park hospitality ass dep t of interior,internal quotation marks omitted.the ripeness doctrine is peculiarly a question of timing,reg l rail reorg.act cases,designed to separate matters that are premature for review because the injury is speculative and may never occur from those cases that are appropriate for federal court action,portman county of santa clara,cir internal quotation marks omitted.t hrough avoidance of premature adjudication,the ripeness doctrine prevents courts from becoming entangled in abstract disagreements.abbott labs.gardner,abrogated on other grounds by califano sanders.
wolfson is not presently bound to obey the code and will only be required to do so if he again becomes a candidate for judicial office.wolfson is neither now,nor has he ever been,subject to any enforcement action related to these canons.instead,wolfson alleges that he wants to engage in three kinds of expressive activity that he believes the code prohibits personally soliciting contributions,which is prohibited by the solicitation restrictions contained in canons c and revised rules a a endorsing other candidates for office and supporting their campaigns,actions which are prohibited by the endorsement clause and the campaigning prohibition contained in canons b d revised rules a,a and answering questions from voters and making public speeches regarding disputed legal and political issues,which wolfson believes is prohibited by the pledges and promises clause,canon d i revised rule a.wolfson alleges that he has suffered the injury of,and that he will be required to in any future campaign for elected judicial office.as the pledges and promises clause raises distinct issues from the solicitation,endorsement,and campaigning clauses,we will address the pledges and promises clause separately.
we first turn to whether wolfson claims regarding the solicitation,endorsement,and campaigning prohibitions canons b,c,d,and are ripe.
ripeness has both constitutional and prudential components.portman,at.the constitutional component of ripeness overlaps with the injury in fact analysis for article iii standing.thomas anchorage equal rights comm n,cir en banc see also united states parole comm geraghty.whether framed as an issue of standing or ripeness,the inquiry is largely the same whether the issues presented are definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract.thomas,at internal quotation marks omitted.
wolfson is not currently subject to an enforcement action and therefore raises a challenge to the canons.neither the mere existence of a proscriptive statute nor a generalized threat of prosecution satisfies the case or controversy requirement,citing san diego county,at see also stoianoff montana,cir.it is true that o ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.reg l rail reorg.act cases,at quotation marks and citation omitted see also babbitt united farm workers union,a plaintiff need not expose himself to prosecution in order to challenge the constitutionality of a statute that he claims deters the exercise of his constitutional rights.however,for a claim to be ripe,the plaintiff must be subject to a genuine threat of imminent prosecution.san diego county,at,quoting.mercantile ass williams,cir.when evaluating whether a claimed threat of prosecution is genuine,we consider whether the plaintiff has articulated a concrete plan to violate the law in question whether the prosecuting authorities have communicated a specific warning or threat to initiate proceedings and the history of past prosecution or enforcement under the challenged statute.id.at.
although the mere existence of a statute is insufficient to create a ripe controversy,we have applied the requirements of ripeness and standing less stringently in the context of first amendment claims.cal.council,getman,cir in the first speech context,the supreme court has dispensed with rigid standing requirements.in particular,we apply the principle that one need not await consummation of threatened injury before challenging a statute restricting speech,to guard the risk that protected conduct will be deterred.right to life pac bayless,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also lso,stroh,cir.to avoid the chilling effect of restrictions on speech,the court has endorsed a hold your tongue and challenge now approach rather than requiring litigants to speak first and take their chances with the consequences.bayless,at citations omitted see also bland fessler,cir accord navegar,united states.
looking to the first consideration,whether wolfson has a concrete plan to violate the law,we conclude that wolfson has established an intent to violate the law that is more than hypothetical.thomas,at.wolfson has expressed an intention to run for office in the future,and a desire to engage in two kinds of conduct that is likely to be prohibited by the code.
first,wolfson has expressed a desire to solicit campaign contributions personally,through live appearances,phone calls,and written requests.the solicitation restrictions,canons c and revised rules a a,state that a judicial candidate shall not solicit funds for or pay an assessment to a political organization and that a candidate should refrain from personally soliciting campaign contributions.advisory opinion confirmed that wolfson,while a candidate for judicial office subject to the code,can not personally solicit or receive campaign contributions.
second,wolfson has expressed a desire to endorse other candidates.the endorsement clause,canon b revised rule a,states that a judge or judicial candidate shall not make speeches for a political organization or candidate or publicly endorse a candidate for public office.the campaigning prohibition,canon d revised rule a,states that a judicial candidate shall not actively take part in any political campaign other than his or her own election,reelection or retention in office.several advisory opinions have confirmed that wolfson can not,while a candidate for judicial office,endorse another candidate or participate in another candidate campaign.advisory opinion stated that wolfson could not endorse other candidates for office while himself a candidate.in advisory opinion,the ethics committee said that judges may not participate in campaigns for or against political candidates,even those who take positions affecting the administration of justice,explaining that canon of the code of judicial conduct prohibits judges from publicly endorsing a candidate,making speeches for a political organization or candidate,or actively taking part in any political campaign other than their own.in advisory opinion,the ethics committee considered whether a judge could appear in an advertisement endorsing a ballot proposition that he had been involved in drafting.the ethics committee concluded that a judge could not endorse a proposition,even one that he or she had assisted in drafting,because the code does not permit a judge to act as a spokesperson and advocate for others.
turning to the second consideration guiding the ripeness inquiry,the existence of an enforcement action or threat of the same,we start with the undisputed fact that wolfson has never been threatened with enforcement proceedings.wolfson asserts that his claims are nevertheless ripe because he has to comply with the code.is a constitutionally recognized injury.see virginia am.booksellers ass n,is a harm that can be realized even without an actual prosecution.in the context of first amendment speech,a threat of enforcement may be inherent in the challenged statute,sufficient to meet the constitutional component of the ripeness inquiry.bayless,at see also getman,at majors abell,cir t he threat of prosecution is latent in the existence of the statute.especially where protected speech may be at stake,a plaintiff need not risk prosecution in order to challenge a statute.see,bayless,at bland,at.the supreme court has repeatedly pointed out the necessity of allowing challenges to avoid the chilling of speech.see,am.booksellers ass n,at dombrowski pfister,recognizing the sensitive nature of constitutionally protected expression,in permitting a action involving the first amendment.
the third inquiry,past prosecution or enforcement,has little weight in our analysis.the code is relatively new and the record contains little information as to enforcement or interpretation,other than the advice of the ethics committee to wolfson.nevertheless,this record is sufficient under the circumstances of this case.wolfson claims meet the constitutional component of ripeness.
to evaluate the prudential component of ripeness,we weigh two considerations the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.abbott,at.we have held that a claim is fit for decision if the issues raised are primarily legal,do not require further factual development,and the challenged action is final.us west commc ns mfs intelenet,cir,quoting standard alaska prod.schaible,cir.to meet the hardship requirement,a litigant must show that withholding review would result in direct and immediate hardship and would entail more than possible financial loss.stormans,selecky,cir,quoting west commc ns,at.in our evaluation of a claim of hardship,w e consider whether the regulation requires an immediate and significant change in plaintiffs conduct of their affairs with serious penalties attached to noncompliance.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
we hold that wolfson claims regarding the solicitation,campaigning,and endorsement clauses satisfy the concerns of prudential ripeness.wolfson claim is fit for decision,because it is primarily legal and does not require substantial further factual development.see west commc ns,at san diego county,at.we also conclude that wolfson is subject to a sufficient hardship.wolfson has alleged a hardship through the injury of.because we relax the requirements of standing and ripeness to avoid the chilling of protected speech,getman,at,wolfson need not await prosecution to seek preventative relief.see bayless,at lso,at.
defendants assert that wolfson claims should be adjudicated in the future,if and when he is again a candidate for judicial office and subject to enforcement proceedings.defendants ask too much.wolfson alleges that he has already suffered the injury of selfcensorship in two separate election campaigns and that he will again be required to censor his speech in a future campaign.defendants approach would effectively relegate wolfson to in a third election as wolfson two electoral bids and two actions demonstrate,it is unlikely that this litigation will be completed in the short time frame of an election.even further,defendants would have any action by wolfson deferred until an enforcement proceeding is brought.but an enforcement proceeding is not likely,given wolfson statement that he will to comply with the code.wolfson compliance with his duties under the code should not bar this action,because the principle that one should not have to risk prosecution to challenge a statute is especially true in first amendment cases.bland,at see also bayless,at lso,at.requiring wolfson to violate the code as a precondition to bringing suit would,furthermore,turn respect for the law on its head.bayless,at see also bland,at concluding that a plaintiff decision to obey the law was reasonable and demonstrates a commendable respect for the rule of law.wolfson has stated an injury of and therefore need not await consummation of the threatened injury to bring his claims.see,canatella california,cir challenge to state bar rules ripe where alleged harm of potential disciplinary measures damage to the expressive rights of attorneys who refrained from protected activity aclu.bar,cir challenge to canons of judicial conduct ripe where plaintiff would have to refrain from protected speech to avoid disciplinary action 
defendants also argue that our decision in alaska right to life pac feldman requires us to decline jurisdiction.the plaintiff in feldman was a political action committee,alaska right to life,which sought to elicit,through a questionnaire,sitting judges viewpoints on several issues.id.at.few judges responded to the questionnaire in any way of the few judges who did,all declined to provide substantive answers,citing the alaska code of judicial conduct.id.alaska right to life brought an action challenging the constitutionality of the pledges and promises and commits canons of alaska code of judicial conduct.id.we concluded that the district court should have declined to exercise jurisdiction on prudential ripeness grounds.id.at.there was no hardship to the plaintiff because the challenged canons did not apply to it,and by extension,no concrete factual situation framing the controversy.id.at.also weighing against the exercise of jurisdiction,the alaska supreme court had not yet had an opportunity to construe the canons at issue.id.at.because alaska code of judicial conduct indicated a preference for interpretation in a manner that does not infringe first amendment rights,we had no reason to expect that the alaska supreme court would adopt a recommendation that ran afoul of the first amendment.id.at see also renne geary,consideration of constitutional questions should be postponed until a concrete controversy arises,allowing state courts the opportunity to construe a challenged law.
feldman does not compel dismissal of wolfson action.wolfson is dissimilar from the feldman plaintiff in several material respects.in feldman,the plaintiff was not subject to the challenged code,was not threatened with any enforcement action,and had not suffered the injury of.id.in contrast,wolfson speech was constrained by the code and he in order to comply with the code.unlike the feldman plaintiff,wolfson action seeks principally to redress restrictions on his own speech,as a former candidate for judicial office and as a likely future candidate.see,porter,at.in further contrast to the feldman plaintiff,wolfson has already sought an advisory opinion regarding the challenged canons.wolfson claims relating to the solicitation,campaigning and endorsement canons of the code are ripe.
we turn to wolfson claims regarding the pledges and promises clause,canon d i revised rule a.wolfson alleges that,during his campaigns for judicial office,he wanted to give talks on certain disputed legal and political issues,and answer questions from voters regarding the same.for example,wolfson alleges that he wanted to give talks regarding marriage and family values during the campaign.an initiative on arizona november ballot,proposition,pertained to marriage.believing that he was prohibited from discussing disputed legal and political issues while a candidate for judicial office,wolfson censored his presentation to omit any discussion of proposition.
although we apply the requirements of ripeness less stringently in the first amendment context,a plaintiff must nevertheless establish that he or she possesses an actual and wellfounded fear that the law will be enforced against him or her.getman,at internal quotation marks omitted.we have held that a plaintiff must have a plausible and reasonable fear of prosecution.see lso,at.bare allegations that a plaintiff speech has been chilled by the challenged statute are insufficient to establish a reasonable fear of prosecution.getman,at the door to standing does not open for every plaintiff.instead,a fear of prosecution will only inure if the plaintiff intended speech arguably falls within the statute reach,citing am.booksellers ass n,at see also majors,at a statute that clearly fails to cover plaintiff conduct does not give rise to a latent threat of enforcement or reasonable fear of prosecution.
in evaluating the ripeness of a claim,we typically consider whether the plaintiff intends to violate the law,whether enforcement proceedings have been threatened,and whether the enforcement history of the challenged statute corroborates a genuine threat.see generally san diego county,at.wolfson claim regarding the pledges and promises clause displays none of these features.wolfson admits that he has no concrete plan to violate the pledges and promises clause.see id.at.in fact,wolfson complaint declares that he does not wish to pledge or promise certain results in particular cases or classes of cases.wolfson has never been subject to or threatened with an enforcement action,and does not submit any history of enforcement under the pledges and promises clause that would support his claimed fear of prosecution.see id.at.instead,wolfson fears that the pledges and promises clause may be construed to prohibit judicial candidates from announcing their views on disputed legal and political issues.
wolfson can have no fear that he will be prosecuted for violating the pledges and promises clause because that clause does not unambiguously reach his proposed conduct.arizona pledges and promises clause provides that a judge or judicial candidate shall not with respect to cases,controversies,or issues that are likely to come before the court,make pledges,promises or commitments that are inconsistent with the impartial performance of the adjudicative duties of the office.the pledges and promises clause prohibits committing oneself or making promises.the pledges and promises clause does not unambiguously prohibit the expression of one views on issues that may come before the court.the ethics committee has explained that a judicial candidate may publicly discuss his or her personal opinions on any subject under the pledges and promises clause because a candidate may express views on any disputed issue.advisory opinion.
taking all of the above together,we conclude that wolfson does not face a genuine threat of imminent prosecution with respect to the pledges and promises clause.san diego county,at.wolfson has no intent to violate the pledges and promises clause,and fails to demonstrate that the clause reaches any of his intended speech.see getman,at.in effect,wolfson fear is that the pledges and promises clause might be construed in a particular manner.this falls short of a credible threat that the pledges and promises clause will be enforced against him.bayless,at,quoting lso,at.wolfson fear concerns a possibility,and is insufficient to satisfy the constitutional component of ripeness.see portman,at speculative injuries are not ripe for review darring kincheloe,cir imaginary or speculative fears of prosecution are not ripe,quoting younger harris.we hold that wolfson claims regarding the pledges and promises clause do not satisfy the constitutional component of ripeness,and we need not decide whether they meet the prudential requirements of ripeness.
taking a different tack,wolfson asserts that the advice he received from the ethics committee failed to dispel his concerns regarding the scope of the pledges and promises clause.wolfson twice sought an advisory opinion from the ethics committee.in december,following the district court dismissal of wolfson i,wolfson sought guidance on several issues,including whether he could state his opinions on disputed legal and political issues,endorse other candidates,and personally solicit campaign contributions.in september,during his campaign for judicial office,wolfson inquired whether the code restrictions on political activity by judicial candidates would prohibit him from speaking publicly about a pending ballot initiative.in response to these requests,wolfson received two advisory opinions,and.
wolfson asserts that the advisory opinions have not only failed to dispel the chilling effect of the pledges and promises clause,but actually heightened it.wolfson does not,however,state why the advisory opinions increased the chilling effect of the pledges and promises clause.both advisory opinion and advisory opinion state that a candidate may express views on any disputed issue,subject to and consistent with the pledges and promises clause.see also white.the advisory opinions merely incorporate the pledges and promises clause.the opinions may not have provided wolfson with the level of clarity he desired,but there is no basis on which to conclude they chilled his speech.wolfson conclusory assertion of chilling is therefore insufficient.see getman at a plaintiff may not challenge the constitutionality of a statute on first amendment grounds by nakedly asserting that his or her speech was chilled by the statute.
insofar as wolfson alleges a fear that the pledges and promises clause continues to restrict the speech of judges,such a claim is also not ripe.wolfson is not a judge and may never become one.the application of the code to wolfson as a judge is a long step removed from wolfson claims as a candidate.a claim is not ripe for judicial resolution if it rests upon contingent future events that may not occur as anticipated,or indeed may not occur at all.texas united states,internal quotation marks omitted.wolfson can not ground a claim against the pledges and promises clause on its hypothetical application to him as a judge.wolfson can become a candidate of his own accord wolfson can not similarly control his appointment to judicial office or the outcome of an election.insofar as wolfson purports to redress injuries to judges speech,such claims are also not ripe.wolfson can not assert the constitutional rights of judges when he is not,and may never be,a member of that group.see,feldman,at political action committee plaintiff did not face hardship where the organization would not itself have risked civil sanction or criminal penalty.
defendants have also asserted that this action is barred by collateral estoppel.to support this argument,defendants point to the district court order dismissing wolfson i on the basis of prudential ripeness.defendants assert that wolfson has not satisfied the preconditions to a subsequent action set forth by the district court wolfson i order and is therefore barred from bringing this action.
t he doctrine of collateral estoppel can apply to preclude relitigation of both issues of law and issues of fact if those issues were conclusively determined in a prior action.united states stauffer chem.under this doctrine,a party is precluded from relitigating an issue if four requirements are met there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the previous action the issue was actually litigated there was final judgment on the merits and the person against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to or in privity with a party in the previous action.kendall visa,cir.we review the availability of collateral estoppel de novo.pardo olson sons,cir.
here,the district court dismissal was not an adjudication of the merits.rather,the district court set forth a curable defect in jurisdiction ripeness.as a curable defect,a second action on the same claim is permissible after correction of the deficiency.see wright miller,feder
