the right of fair procedure derives,as our high court pointed out in pinsker ii,from the common law,and should not be confused with constitutional due process.pinsker ii,supra,cal d at,fn.the right by no means applies to all private organizations,but rather only to those which,in the yari court useful phrase,act as some sort of gatekeepers over the right to practice a lawful trade or profession.see yari,supra,th at,d,citing ezekial winkley cal d,ezekial

this case,however,concerns a gatekeeper organization of some special interest to the judiciary.the organization here,the association of firearm and toolmark examiners,or afte,exists to promote the integrity of expert testimony in the area of firearms forensics.provisions in the organization private code of ethics preclude,among other things,making unrepresentative,atypical,or unreliable conclusions from evidentiary materials or assisting litigants so as to create a false impression.
the plaintiff in this case,paul dougherty,was censured by afte after he gave forensic testimony for defendant state troopers in a louisiana case that his peers in the afte determined to be untenable.dougherty then brought this litigation in orange county,california,seeking a writ to force afte to overturn its censure.
as the record shows,there can be no question that afte afforded dougherty a high level of fair procedure.he had the chance to explain his theory no less than four times in writing,to an ethics committee,then again,personally,in front of afte board,then again,in writing,in web postings before a general membership meeting,and yet again,in person,in front of the entire membership at that meeting.in the process of these multiple layers of review,at least two procedural protocols were bent in dougherty favor he got extra time to respond to the initial complaint at the ethics committee level he had missed the initial deadline and he got the chance,at the convention,to participate in the voting on his own sanction,which was the reason he was only censured,and not kicked out of afte altogether.
the trial judge denied the requested writ.we affirm.
ii.underlying facts 
a.an occurrence on the causeway in charles parish,louisiana,march,
ronnie clark was a convicted felon in florida.he had been residing with his father in texas and was traveling through louisiana after being contacted by his florida probation officer.he was armed with a loaded caliber handgun.
clark was speeding on his motorcycle,going about miles per hour.a louisiana state trooper pursued,sirens wailing.clark refused to pull over.pursuing officers could see a handgun tucked into his pants.
clark was on interstate as it edges along lake pontchartrain,heading east toward new orleans and the mississippi state line.two louisiana state troopers,michael sunseri and william dorris,set up a road block just before the intersection of the and the,which is at the edge of lake pontchartrain,to stop clark.they parked two marked cars in the that point really a causeway with a high wall or curb along the lake side.that left only the north shoulder of possibly open.sunseri stood on that north shoulder with a shotgun to block the oncoming clark.dorris had a mm handgun.
clark avoided the cars already blocking his path on the north side of the highway by getting his motorcycle up on the north shoulder.then he gunned his motorcycle straight for sunseri.
what happened as clark sped toward sunseri is the subject of some least as subsequent memories would what is clear is this 
both sunseri and dorris fired their weapons as clark sped toward sunseri.those two discharges resulted in clark sustaining a bullet wound to his right foot,as would be expected from dorris firing the weapon from a location somewhere to the side of sunseri.
there is also no question that sunseri fired his shotgun a second time.that second shot would ultimately bring this case to our court more than years later,and half a continent away.
according to testimony that sunseri would later give,as summarized by a louisiana appellate court,sunseri second shot occurred,as he jumped out of the way of the speeding clark.clark state so d,clark,italics added.as sunseri testimony was described by the louisiana trial court judge,the speeding clark passed sunseri so close that sunseri could have reached out and grabbed him had he not been going so fast.the trial court also noted a testimony that the second shot was fired as the officer was jumping out of the way.
in any event,clark collapsed further up the roadway.clark,supra,so d at.a shotgun pellet had lodged in his spine,and had permanently paralyzed him.
there is no question that the shotgun pellet that ultimately severed clark spinal cord entered from the rear.there were two holes in the back of clark shirt and one hole in the front of the shirt.a louisiana state crime laboratory report showed that there was lead residue on the outside of the two holes in the back of clark that they were entry that there was lead residue on the inside of the hole in the front of the that it was an exit wound.
and that is exactly what one would expect if sunseri,either in a fit of anger at seeing a maniacal motorcyclist coming straight at him at a high rate of speed,or merely as an instinctive reaction to having to jump out of the way of that motorcyclist,had simply spun around and shot clark in the back.
then there was the matter of the two shotgun wads.a shotgun wad is a piece of paper,cardboard or plastic inside a shotgun cartridge that is used to contain the pellets or powder behind the pellets or both.the two wads were found by louisiana police.but those wads described as a pristine plastic wad and a cardboard filler wad were found by police down the causeway,toward the east,along a line between where sunseri was standing and where clark went down,paralyzed.in short,the two wads were found exactly where one would expect them to be if sunseri had shot clark in the back as he was heading away from sunseri.
there were also lighter wad fragments found to the west of where one would expect them to be from the first shotgun blast aimed directly at clark as,coming from the west,he barreled down on sunseri.evidently those fragments had not been blown off course by any wind.videotapes were made shortly after the shooting which gave at least some clue as to wind conditions.records at nearby new orleans international airport showed maximum winds of knots at the time.
and finally,there was the condition of the actual pellet that was found in clark spine.the pellet was very damaged.the louisiana state crime laboratory had the pellet examined under an electron microscope for embedded concrete particles,and the results were negative.that is,the physical condition of the pellet belied the idea that the pellet,fired at clark simultaneously with his passing sunseri,had somehow ricocheted off the concrete causeway and found its way into clark back.
b.the battle of the experts in clark state of louisiana 
clark sued the state of louisiana,sunseri,dorris and others,and the case came to trial in october.clark would lose the case when the trial judge issued a formal statement of reasons for judgment and judgment,dated november,is,more than a year later 
each side employed a firearms expert.clark employed lucien haag.louisiana employed paul dougherty at the time both haag and dougherty were members in good standing with afte.
in the course of discovery in the clark litigation at least in an expert report and in a deposition,dougherty came up with this scenario to explain clark wound from the back simultaneous with clark passing by him,sunseri fired his second shotgun is,sunseri fired his shotgun clark was passing him.further,according to dougherty,sunseri fired at an extremely low angle,so that the injuring pellet ricocheted off the highway,and then a second time off the nearby curb close to where clark was passing.and the pellet not only ricocheted,but ricocheted upward toward clark,who conveniently turned his body on his motorcycle at precisely the right time for the upward traveling pellet to penetrate the back of his shirt.as for the shotgun wads that were found by police in a direct line between sunseri and clark,dougherty theorized that sunseri fired sideways or just ahead of him,so that the wads traveled to feet toward the west where clark was coming from and then were blown back twice that distance in the direction where clark was going.
november the afte complaint 
that scenario or reconstruction was just too much for dougherty fellow afte member and opposing expert,lucien haag.haag was so incensed with conduct and testimony of dougherty that was intellectually dishonest that he began outlining ethics charges on his flight home from the october trial.
the result was a letter dated november,to the chairman of afte ethics committee,in which haag accused dougherty of unethical conduct.he cited and quoted provisions of afte code of ethics.these provisions may be summarized as 
a requirement to serve the interests of justice at all times 
a requirement to make adequate examination of material 
a prohibition not to draw unrepresentative,atypical,or unreliable conclusions from materials 
a requirement to conduct tests to disclose facts,and a prohibition from knowingly distorting any conclusions from any tests 
a prohibition against assigning greater significance to an interpretation than is justified by available data 
an affirmative requirement,if necessary under the circumstances,to indicate that an opinion may not be as certain as other opinions 
a prohibition against assisting litigants so as to create a false impression 
a prohibition against altering or distorting photographic displays so as to mislead a court or jury 
a prohibition against using terms and opinions that give greater weight than is due and,
a moral obligation to see that the court understands the evidence as it exists and to present that evidence in an impartial manner.
each of these rules was given a count number,so that,for example,the prohibition against altering photographic displays was count.
after giving the case background,the letter spelled out a series of narratives,and then,at the end of the relevant narrative,identified the counts that applied to that narrative.thus,for example,haag letter described in a given paragraph portions of dougherty report asserting that the pellet taken from clark spine had ricocheted off a roadway and off a curb,and then identified that particular assertion as a violation of counts,and.
haag letter was accompanied by six compact discs two for each member of the committee,which included a number of photographs,consisting of of clark spine,various ct scans made of clark,and blowups of the pellet itself.
notice and response 
on january,the ethics committee chair sent dougherty a notice and copy of haag complaint,and invited dougherty to respond within thirty days of the receipt of the notice.
on march,the deadline had wrote a letter to the ethics committee chair,stating that this matter will have to be continued because the clark case had not yet gone to verdict and dougherty and haag remain as potential witness es.the trial judge still had the matter under consideration at the time,but the trial was over.
dougherty letter alluded to a number of documents which i will need to make a proper defense.dougherty also acknowledged in his letter receiving a binder of material along with haag complaint.the letter did not request a certain amount of additional time needed,or specify which other documents that dougherty needed,or give any hint as to when the clark case might yet come to verdict.
two months having heard no more from chair of the ethics committee provided the board of directors with a report on the complaint.the board determined that the ethics committee should not conclude their investigation without receiving a response from dougherty.
dougherty response came in a three and page letter dated june.to summarize the letter 
a under the heading,wind there were gusts of wind on the elevated highway on the edge of lake pontchartrain,and videotapes made just after the incident showed markers moving and clothing being pressed against the people at the scene.
b under the heading,treatment of evidence at scene there was considerable foot traffic at the scene and a certain projectile not otherwise identified without reference to a certain diagram was stepped on or kicked by one of the officers at the scene,and a federal shot shell recovered at the scene showed damage as if it had been run over by a vehicle.
c under the heading,the pellet photographs showed damage to the pellet that could not be explained by the lamina or barrel of a shotgun alone,plus something about how other pellets impacted on the street and the fact that firing pellets at close range would produce a billiard ball effect what is important here is that the pellets were fired at fairly close range at an unyielding target.as in the nixon report that would later be proffered by dougherty before the general membership meeting,dougherty seemed to be assuming his ricochet theory was an established fact.
d under the heading,clothing acknowledging the fact there was a roundish hole in the rear of a hooded sweatshirt and four holes in the rear of a shirt,dougherty said that,taken together with another series of three holes in a vertical line one eight inches from the bottom seam,there was a puzzling pattern for the pellet.he said the immediate explanation that is easy and simplistic is that the three holes in the back center represent the entry of the pellet in the spine but that those holes are slanted to the right side so that one has the impression that the pellet is moving from left to right which could occur if the shirt were folded into three layers.
e under the heading,wounds there was a wound in the back to the right of the center of the spine,and another wound on the left side degrees from the horizontal with no right to left direction.the letter did not explain the significance of these facts,assuming that significance was 
f under the heading,ronnie clark position clark himself had indicated he was sitting straight when he was hit,but clark expert haag had clark bent over the handle bars so as to produce the upward angle in the back from a direct fire shot.
g under the heading,dorris position dougherty refuted an allegation in haag complaint that dorris had changed his position literally position as in where he was standing at the time or position as in what letter does not say after dougherty and a state medical expert,martin fackler,had entered the case.the idea of the change was,according to dougherty,pure libel.
h and,under the heading,conclusion haag had brought up some minor points which dougherty did not address because haag whole thesis is based on the points i have addressed.
and with that,dougherty requested the whole matter be dismissed.
the appellant appendix in this appeal shows three blurry images as when on television digital technology is used to blur an image,such as a license plate or a face attached to dougherty june response.none of those images has enough detail,at least as reproduced in the appellant appendix,for us to make any comment.
fall the louisiana state court decision 
it appears from our record that the ethics committee would hold off on issuing its report until after clark trial against the state of louisiana went to verdict,because in any event the final report was not issued until january.in the meanwhile,the trial judge issued a statement of reasons for a judgment in favor of the state of louisiana and the state troopers,dated november.
the judge had had more than a year to reflect on his decision.the statement of reasons concentrates on the eyewitness testimony of events,and the trial judge found the testimony of both dorris and sunseri particularly credible.the trial judge found that sunseri had fired the second shot as clark passed him,that is,the shot was simultaneous with the passing.
the louisiana appellate decision in clark,supra,so d,saw the case the same way.the opinion summarizes sunseri testimony this way as he jumped out of the way,sunseri fired his weapon again.id.at,italics added.again,the idea was a discharge sideways at the passing clark,or,at best,a point blank shot into clark back as sunseri spun around at the speeding clark.
our record is not clear as to what precise role dougherty had in the ultimate denial of clark claim by the louisiana state and appellate courts.review was also denied by the louisiana supreme court,but that is an uninteresting fact,given that the clark case was highly factual,and we may presume that the louisiana supreme court thought that the louisiana appellate court got its louisiana law right.
there is no specific summary or recounting of the forensic testimony or physical evidence in the louisiana state trial court decision.the trial court written decision is based on eyewitness testimony.likewise,the published clark decision is structured as a series of summaries of eyewitness accounts.neither haag nor dougherty are mentioned in the trial court decision,nor is there any reference to forensic evidence,such as all those details that we have recounted above,the pellet holes in the back of the shirt,or the shotgun wads found down the road toward clark as he lie paralyzed.
there is,however,a allusion to forensic testimony in the appellate decision in clark that suggests that dougherty did actually play a role in the outcome.the paragraph came at the end of the court summary.we will quote the entirety of that paragraph now the record also contains volumes of expert testimony and documents opining on the trajectory of the bullets sic the injuring projectile was a shotgun pellet and the effect of any possible factors,which would show where the motorcyclist was in relation to the troopers when the shooting occurred.clark,supra,so d at.
the clark opinion then quoted from the third paragraph of the trial judge statement of reasons which is also in our appellant appendix to the effect that the court had heard testimony from fact and expert witnesses and reviewed over separately identified trial exhibits including numerous photographs,diagrams,sketches,scientific journal articles,deposition testimony,shooting test results,and physical evidence.clark,supra,so d at.
interestingly enough,though,none of that physical evidence was summarized,either in the trial court statement or the published opinion.the most that any louisiana court ever came to actually confronting those facts was in the next paragraph after the summary of the quantity of evidence in the clark decision this court has also considered all of the extensive evidence in this case to review the findings of fact made by the trial court.clark,supra,so d at.
the clark decision then proceeded to reiterate some classic doctrines about appellate courts giving deference to trial court findings,and after that it finished its discussion on the forensic evidence,such as it was,with these lines where there is conflict in the testimony,reasonable determinations of credibility and reasonable inferences of fact should not be disturbed on appeal.the reasons for these principles of review are not only the trial court better capacity to evaluate live witnesses,as compared to the appellate court access only to a cold record,but also the proper allocation of trial and appellate function between the respective courts.clark,supra,so d at.
and with that,the clark decision administered the coup de grace to clark case given the testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial,we do not find that the trial court erred in its factual finding that sunseri was in fear for his life when he shot plaintiff.accordingly,we find no merit in plaintiff assignment of error regarding the factual findings of the court.clark,supra,so d at.
in short,neither the appellate clark decision,nor the trial court,ever explicitly came to grips with those facts that strongly indicate sunseri shot clark in the back as clark tried to speed away.the reasonable inference is that dougherty double ricochet theory influenced the louisiana courts not to confront those facts on the general theory that the dueling experts simply cancelled each other out 
january the ethics committee report 
a formal ethics committee report was issued,dated january.that report was,literally,pages.one thing that positively distinguishes that report from either the trial or appellate decisions in the louisiana clark case is that the ethics committee report includes an explicit recounting of the losing side case.that is because,as the report was organized,it essentially copied relevant swaths of haag november complaint,followed by corresponding swaths from dougherty june response.the original part of the report is found in the conclusion on pages and of the report we believe that in most shooting reconstruction situations,the simplest explanation that is in concert with natural laws and the behavior of projectiles as we know it,is probably the best.
the ethics committee concluded that because of the position of the wad,the lack of damage to the injuring pellet,and the inordinately high angles of ricochet required by the ricochet theory,dougherty had given testimony that was not objective,not well supported by past experience or experiment and reflected either seriously flawed science or was a deliberate attempt to mislead the court.
the report would eventually be posted to the afte website around may.apparently,though,it went out without the initial approval of one of its members,a tasmanian police ballistics expert named gerard dutton.when it was eventually posted to the website,dutton would write a letter to ann davis,afte president,to complain that his own name was incorrectly spelt on the final document.shades of a statement oft attributed to new york mayor jimmy walker to the press,you can write anything you want about me as long as you spell my name right.dutton called the report absolutely dreadful and in particular unprofessional,confusing and repetitive and in general,badly organized.
but dutton criticisms were only literary.as a composition teacher it appears he would have given the report a d.but,he totally agreed with the substance of the report.he further said haag had presented a case and specifically noted that dougherty apparently did not examine the pellet for grit from the impacts of his theory.dutton own bottom line was yes he referring to dougherty did knowingly do this,and by this he meant the rhetorical question posed in the previous sentence therefore,did he intentionally distort the truth to serve his own position and that of his employer,without giving due consideration to a and compelling opposing hypothesis italics added.
g.the board of directors review 
it does not appear that the ethics committee sent its report to least immediately.what does appear is that by july,the committee had sent its report to at least the of afte,robert shem,who on that date wrote dougherty to give him an opportunity to address the complaints brought forward by haag,at a special hearing of the board at some indefinite time in the as much as six months away if the board had its meeting in december.dougherty replied in august of.he requested a copy of the ethics committee report,all ex parte communications from haag to the committee or other interested parties,and a list of who will be present at the hearing and witnesses.he also asked how the meeting would be memorialized.
dougherty was sent an ethics committee to his later declaration,it was a preliminary a compact disc containing videos and powerpoint presentations via a letter from shem to him on august.apparently,though,there was enough information in even this preliminary report for one to realize that dougherty was being censured,since dougherty would later submit a declaration to the orange county superior court stating that i timely appealed the ethics committee decision to the afte board of directors.
in shem letter,dougherty was told the hearing would take place on october,in dallas.he was told that those present would be afte board,its legal advisor,and at least one representative of the ethics committee.
shem alluded in his letter that the scheduled date of october,and location in dallas was a date and location that have met with your approval.dougherty would later dispute that in a declaration.he contended that he requested a continuance of the hearing so that his lawyer could be present,since his lawyer had an unavoidable scheduling conflict.in any event,the meeting went forward.we need only note that the afte board is made up of individuals from all over the world who volunteer their time in a private organization.getting them together before the next board meeting would have very expensive indeed.
the hearing was scheduled for,but apparently there was a morning session where the ethics committee findings were presented to the board.according to dougherty later declaration,when the afternoon session commenced,it began with the board asking dougherty to present evidence to rebut the ethics committee findings.according to the same declaration,the board voted to expel dougherty from afte that afternoon.
what that declaration does not describe which would be described in a later declaration from incoming president ann davis is that during the course of that afternoon dougherty himself testified,as did martin fackler who also had been an expert medical witness in the clark litigation,another expert who was aligned with the state of louisiana in the clark case,kerry najolia,plus dougherty himself responded to detailed questioning by the board members.davis declaration relates that after hearing from at least those three individuals,the board voted unanimously that the ethics committee conclusions were well founded,and then voted to in favor of expelling dougherty from afte.
the board decision was posted on afte website as of november.the post,from president davis,stated that the board of directors has determined that afte member paul dougherty has violated the code of ethics.dougherty has requested an appeal before the general membership at the next business meeting.so that you,the members,have ample opportunity to thoroughly review the materials on which the board based our decision before the vancouver meeting,the pertinent materials will be made available on this message board.the ethics committee report,the complaint and the defendant response will be posted once we convert all of the documentation into a digital format.you will be alerted when these documents become available for your review.in the interim,your patience with respect to the specifics of this ethics complaint is appreciated.
one member wrote back two days later to say that he hoped and prayed that the membership at large will be open minded and review the charges and response with due diligence as this is a very serious matter.a man reputation is at stake as well as the entire afte organization,so we can do without any hyperbole until all the facts are presented.
skirmishing before the may general meeting 
the general meeting would be held in vancouver on may,but some noteworthy events occurred in between.
president davis sent dougherty,as a courtesy,an email link to review the afte ethics web page prior to release to the general membership,with the invitation to let her know if she had inadvertently left pertinent materials out of the posting.an attorney for dougherty,bradford powers from the louisiana firm that also represented the state of louisiana in the clark litigation and who are among the counsel who represent dougherty in this california litigation wrote to davis saying that dougherty requests two weeks to review the proposed material so that he may accept in a reasonable fashion your invitation to point out information that you may have inadvertently left out of the materials.davis eventually agreed to an extension to march.
davis was sent two new items for posting a report from athena research consulting dated march,authored by john nixon hence it is called the nixon report in the briefing and the transcript of fackler deposition.
the nixon report 
the nixon report was about pages,single spaced.the report was organized by a series of specific misconduct allegations listed on pages and of the report,apparently abstracted by nixon.following those allegations were a series of short paragraph rebuttals keyed to each of the allegations.as the nixon report framed the allegations,there was no explicit acknowledgment of the facts that pellet holes were found in the back of clark shirt,or that a crime lab found no concrete grit on the injuring pellet,or that shotgun wads were found in a straight easterly line between sunseri and where clark went down.
the refutation to allegation touched on the location of the pellet holes in the back,and,like the louisiana written decisions,fell back on the idea of experts disagree.specifically,in response to the allegation that mr dougherty misrepresents the location of the lead around the holes in the front of the shirts,saying that they were only on the inside,the entirety of the nixon report response was this there is clearly some discrepancy between the opinion of mr churchman and mr dougherty on this issue.without access to better photographs the clothing,it is not possible to offer a reliable opinion on this issue.it is evident,however,that mr dougherty provides an explanation for his opinion.
and that it.
as to the shotgun wads,addressed in the rebuttal to allegation,the nixon report asserted that knots is quite a stiff breeze and the strength of the wind could be verified in video footage,and,besides which,there was plenty of foot traffic that might have contributed to wad movement.specifically in regard to the lighter wads being found to the west,the report had this explanation readers can judge for themselves how convincing it is there is no way to reliably ascertain which wads came from which cartridge because the two sets of wadding were not differentiated linked to individual discharges.it is normal for shotgun wads to experience significant damage even when they hit nothing but air 
shotgun wads were also addressed in the rebuttal to allegation,which confronted the problem of a theory that had wads fired to the west these wads,we note,would have been fired even sideways,the wads would have had to go approximately to feet,and then be blown back twice this distance eastward to where they were found.
the refutation began with this sentence,apparently referring to the way the report had framed the allegation this statement does not appear to make sense.the substantive point that followed was that the wads from this second shot would have been very near the incident scene,and would only need to be blown tracked to feet eastward to where they were found.this explanation makes perfect sense because the wads from both shots would have travelled the same distance eastward to the locations where they were subsequently found and logged.it should be remembered that these type of wads are extremely light 
similar to dougherty june response to the ethics committee,the nixon report appeared to assume the truth of the double ricochet theory,hence this sentence in the introductory,background part of the report the main issue in the case was how mr clark came to sustain the two shotgun pellet wounds.due to the double ricochet of one of the shotgun blasts the trajectory possibilities of individual pellets became very complex.
in its conclusion,the nixon report referenced the fact that clark had lost in the louisiana trial court.here is what it said under the heading,opinions and conclusions the matter was decided by a judge,who determined that the analysis was the most plausible,and ruled in favor of the defense.the judge verdict was recently endorsed by the louisiana supreme court.
with all respect to nixon,we must point out that the copy of the trial judge statement of reasons in our record most assuredly did not say that the analysis was the most plausible.italics added.our copy contains no reference to dougherty or fackler unless subsumed in a passing reference to expert witnesses and certainly makes no attempt at all to argue that double ricochet theory was the most plausible of competing theories.we seriously doubt that judge pierre would ever have based his decision on the double ricochet theory being the most plausible.at most,he might have concluded that it was barely possible,and hence there was no need to deal with what he thought was conflicting forensic evidence.
the aftermath of the nixon report 
for his part,haag prepared a response to the nixon report,correcting some obvious errors in the nixon report such as the implication that the october trial had been only an initial trial.specifically in regard to the pellet holes in the back of the shirt which,as we have noted above,were not directly addressed in the nixon report,haag said there is much that could be said on the role of churchman and the state crime lab in this matter but to his credit he did not wa ver from his finding that the pellet that perforated ronnie clark left side enter in the back having produced a round hole in the left rear of his shirt with lead wipe around it and exited in the front producing a exit with diffuse lead deposits on the inside of his shirt.italics and underlining in original.
in any event,president davis sent the new materials by email to the other board members on april.none of the board members changed their mind,and on april,the afte board issued a reconsideration report to that effect.the report does not go into any specifics.
then followed negotiations between dougherty attorney powers and davis over the protocols to be used at the general meeting regarding dougherty appeal.in an email dated may to afte voting members,president davis told them that materials on the case would be available to voting members only for limited times at the upcoming vancouver convention on saturday evening may and on sunday may all day.documents were also made available on the afte website,including the january ethics committee report that would elicit gerard dutton letter complaining about its misspelling of his name.
the meeting occurred monday,may.about members were in attendance.
i.the meeting 
at the meeting davis gave an opening statement followed by haag power point presentation.part of his presentation included an affidavit from churchman,who said he reviewed a transcript of dougherty testimony in october before the board of directors.churchman disputed a number of statements which dougherty had apparently made,perhaps the most significant of which was that any claim that a certain diagram apparently suggesting that the injuring pellet came from the front was a cooperative effort involving him,was inaccurate.
haag also included a second affidavit from walter rowe,a professor of forensic science at george washington university.rowe had also reviewed the transcript of dougherty testimony to the directors back in october.rowe contradicted claims that dougherty had apparently made to the effect that rowe was a percipient witness to the clark shooting he obviously was,and that rowe had been a standby witness to testify in support of dougherty reconstruction when,in point of fact,at the time of the clark trial rowe was unaware of that reconstruction.
dougherty had been allotted minutes,with an option to have an additional more minutes if needed to call witnesses.
dougherty used only minutes of his time and called no witnesses.there was,however,a lengthy question and answer session afterwards,which belies any inference that there was not sufficient time at the meeting for dougherty to use his full minutes,or plus minutes.
then the voting commenced,by secret ballot.members were present.more than percent votes that day were needed to sustain the sanctions against dougherty.anything less than that supermajority would vindicate him.the members first voted by more than the required votes to find dougherty in violation of every one of the counts in haag complaint.
then dougherty left the room,and the next vote concerned the actual sanction to be imposed.without dougherty own vote,there were enough secret ballots to expel dougherty from afte.however,dougherty attorney powers requested that he be able to vote by proxy on dougherty behalf davis simply allowed dougherty to reenter the room.casting a vote in favor of himself resulted in his only being censured,as distinct from expelled.
j.the orange county litigation 
a little less than a year later,on may,dougherty filed this action in orange county superior court,seeking both a writ of mandate to overturn the censure and asserting various causes of action against haag and afte mostly tort,one was for breach of contract.judge didier denied the petition for writ of mandate in december of,finding that,based upon the totality of the administrative record,this court does not find any material deviations from the afte bylaws or the procedures for enforcement of the code of ethics,nor does it find any credible evidence of bias,conflicts of interest,or procedural due process violations.the remaining claims quickly fell in a motion for judgment on the pleadings,and in january,a judgment was entered in favor of haag,afte,and the other defendants.dougherty timely appealed in march.
iii.discussion 
procedural unfairness 
the basic contours of the common law right of fair procedure in gatekeeper organizations have been fairly well mapped in the case law,though one must of course distinguish between cases going to the substantive validity of an organization rules from the levels of procedure or lack thereof afforded individual members.we are concerned here with the latter category.dougherty makes no argument that afte rules against misleading courts or drawing atypical conclusions from the evidence themselves run afoul of the law and thus could not be the basis of a censureship resolution 
canvassing the case law 
in pinsker,for example,an applicant to join a professional society was initially turned down for membership of the protagonist in kafka the not told the reasons for the rejection.it turned out that the society had rules against delegating orthodontia work to a dentist called patient sharing in the opinion,and a visit from a society member to the office of the applicant during the applicant absence revealed that he shared patients with such a dentist.when the applicant questioned the reason,he was at first unsuccessful,but unlike the plot of the trial finally found out that patient sharing was the reason for the rejection.he would also at least later contend that he discontinued the practice of patient sharing then and there.the society rescinded its initial rejection,and notified the applicant it would reconsider his application.but,months later,the society again rejected the membership application,and without affording the orthodontist an opportunity either to appear in person or submit a written statement on his own behalf for consideration at the meeting that ultimately considered his application for the final time.pinsker ii,supra,cal d at.no reason was given for the rejection,though it turned out that the local secretary went to lunch with two local orthodontists who told him they were certain that the applicant was still employing at least one.id.at.
the supreme court noted that the common law requirement of a fair procedure does not compel formal proceedings with all the embellishments of a court trial citation nor adherence to a single mode of process.pinsker ii,supra,cal d at.thus the court declared that it should not attempt to fix a rigid procedure that must invariably be observed.ibid.but,the absence of some meaningful opportunity to be heard either in writing or by personal appearance meant that there had been no fair opportunity for the applicant to respond to the charges raised against him,particularly after the point where,he contended,he had stopped and was apparently unaware that anyone still questioned his qualifications.id.at.
if opportunity to be heard was missing in pinsker ii,the first half of the formulation that every law student learns by heart as the essence of due process notice was missing in the supreme court next big fair procedure case,ezekial,supra,cal d.there,a resident at a kaiser hospital was simply advised he would not be permitted to remain in the surgical residency program after a certain date.no reasons were given to plaintiff,either then or subsequently,for kaiser decision to dismiss him.id.at.and in fact,no reason can be detected from the body of the opinion,most of which was devoted to demonstrating that the resident had a common law right of fair procedure in relation to the hospital residency training program 
in contrast to pinsker i and ezekial,with their conspicuous absence of any opportunity to be heard,or notice,the plaintiff in another medical case,anton san antonio community hosp.cal d,anton,was afforded plenty of both,and,accordingly,our high court had no problem in holding that the proceedings afforded him did comply with,as the court put it,the minimal due process which is applicable in proceedings of this kind.id.at.
in anton,an investigation by medical staff of a hospital indicated that a doctor was using poor medical judgment and overutilizing the hospital.id.at.the investigation led to a committee report.the report was referred to a second committee,who forwarded it to the hospital board of directors,which led to the doctor summary suspension.id.at.
and then the real due process began the doctor was notified of his right to a preliminary hearing there did not seem to be any issue of notice of the actual charges.the hearing was held,which upheld the suspension,then the doctor requested a formal hearing.a judicial review committee was appointed to review the recommendation,which included a very detailed list of the charges,and the doctor certainly had notice of those charges.anton,supra,cal d at.meanwhile,the board of directors changed the hospital bylaws to bring them into conformity with model bylaws promulgated by a national hospital organization.then a formal hearing was commenced before the judicial review committee a court reporter was present conducted under the new bylaws,which resulted in a recommendation of suspension.that in turn led to the doctor written request for an appellate review of the judicial review committee decision and there was yet another hearing.however,under the new bylaws,the standard of review for this hearing was whether the doctor could show that the judicial review committee had not complied with the revised bylaws,or was otherwise not supported by substantial evidence.the result that the recommendation of the judicial review committee was affirmed,and the case thereupon went into litigation.id.at.
the supreme court declared in part iii of its opinion that the doctor had been afforded fair procedure,even as against his various attacks on the hospital process the doctor never raised the issue of prejudice of any members of the judicial review committee when he had the chance anton,supra,cal d at.the doctor never actually requested to be allowed to appear with counsel before the judicial review committee.id.at.the doctor did have counsel at the next stage.importantly,the court rejected the idea that bylaws that required the doctor to go forward with the evidence and burden of proof was inconsistent with the requirement of minimal fair procedure.id.at.gatekeeper organizations,said the anton court,have a flexibility in their mode of process id.at,quoting pinsker ii,supra,cal d at,and the organization had the discretion to have such a bylaw,particularly given that the recommendation of suspension still needed a substantial showing to support it.id.at.it was enough that procedures provided in the case provided adequate notice of charges and a fair opportunity for the affected party to present his position.id.at.
in contrast to the multiple levels of review in anton,the procedural safeguards afforded the doctor in oskooi,supra,th,d,were comparatively spartan,and yet still upheld as against a fair procedure challenge by a majority of another panel of this court.in oskooi,it was enough that the doctor was simply notified why he was being summarily suspended he did not disclose certain information on his application and given a hearing on that point,complete with hearing officer and court reporter.see oskooi,supra,th at,d lead opn.of sonenshine,and id.at,d conc.opn.of sills.
specifically,the oskooi majority held that even though a bylaw indicating that omission of the information might lead to outright dismissal and did not make reference to the lesser sanction of suspension,and even though a hospital letter informing the doctor that he could request a hearing made reference to that bylaw,the discrepancy between dismissal and suspension was,in context,a mere technical classic case of harmless error.the letter still told the doctor of the reason for the suspension,and gave him every opportunity to rebut the charge that he had omitted vital information from his application.oskooi,supra,th at,d conc.opn.of sills,see also id.at,fn,d lead opn.of sonenshine,agreeing with the conclusions reached in justice sills concurring opinion.
justice crosby,in dissent on the procedural fairness issue,stressed the technical deviation from a bylaw contemplating,on its face,only dismissal as distinct from suspension.the irony is that justice crosby acknowledged that a full dismissal would have been appropriate,after a fair hearing.id.at,d dis.opn.of crosby.nor did justice crosby find that anything about the hearing that the doctor actually received was procedurally unfair.justice crosby simply did think the evidence substantial enough to show an actual threat to patient care or safety given that the doctor sin was omitting certain information on his application form.ibid.
an appellate case similar to oskooi in looking to the substance of whether the procedure was fair as distinct from quibbling about the technicalities of provisions in the bylaws was davis int.alliance.employees d.there,a couple of stagehands were thrown out of the union for promoting an organization that would have defeated the purposes of the union.id.at.the opinion,rather coyly,does not disclose the nature of the organization the union found so offensive.the stage hands sought relief in the courts,and the appellate court affirmed the denial of any relief,noting they received formal charges,they were given timely notice of the dates and places of their respective trials,the trials took place,and the trials so far as appears were fairly conducted.id.at.
there were in davis,however,some departures from the union constitution as to the exact procedures under which the trials were conducted.charges had been filed with an international representative when the constitution required charges to be filed with the local union secretary.davis,supra,d at.charges should have been read at a regular meeting of the local union.they were.the presiding officer of the local was to refer the charges to a trial committee or an executive board.instead,the international representative appointed the three members of the trial committee and the trial was held before those members.and instead of sending its report to the local union,the report was sent to the international representative,who actually signed the formal sentences of expulsion.ibid.
the davis court recognized that these deviations,in normal times would have given plaintiffs cause for complaint.but the court noted that the union was in a state of emergency the opinion was after all written right during the middle of world war ii and recognized that the union constitution made provisions giving the international president powers to take over the administration of local unions during emergencies.davis,supra,d at.significantly,the davis court zeroed in on the lack of actual prejudice from the change of procedures.id.at.to be sure,the changes had essentially shifted the trial of the charges against the stagehands to a less favorable forum,depriving them of their home court advantage with the local.but the point was that the essentials of notice and opportunity to be heard had been observed.said the davis court in any event we deem the failure to comply with section to have worked no prejudice to plaintiffs.associations of the kind here involved are not bound to use the strict regularity of legal proceedings,and in reviewing the proceedings taken by such organization relating to the enforcement of its disciplinary laws,the courts will disregard technicalities and not interfere because of a departure from form unless it appears that the accused has been denied a full opportunity to defend himself and the organization has not exercised its powers fairly and in good faith.id.at,italics added,quoting mcconville milk union.
application to afte 
one can not review the case law covering the common law right of fair procedure without forming the distinct impression that,in this case,there was a surfeit of fair procedure.as in anton,there were multiple layers of review,each one affording dougherty the chance to tell his side of the story.
consider,in that regard,the avalanche of due process afte afforded dougherty in this case.he got in january,a copy of haag lengthy initial complaint plus a whole binder of materials acquiescence to his own unilateral continuance of the ethics committee deadline to respond a board determination that the ethics committee should wait to hear from him despite having missed the initial deadline the opportunity to respond in writing,to the initial complaint,in june,after missing the initial deadline acceptance by the ethics committee of his request that any decision be held off until after the louisiana trial court issued its formal decision an invitation from the president of afte in july giving him an opportunity to address the complaints brought forward by haag,at a special hearing of the board in august,a copy of a preliminary ethics report plus a compact disc the opportunity to be heard before the board in october the opportunity to personally testify at the october board meeting,and present the testimony of other experts with whom he had been aligned in the louisiana case the posting of the case against him on the organization website in the period prior to the annual convention the opportunity to post,in his defense on the website,the nixon report posting of the reconsideration report by the board prior to the meeting availability of hard copy materials to the membership prior to the voting,including any items he wanted included in his own defense the opportunity to address the membership himself for minutes at the general meeting the opportunity to call witnesses on his behalf at the general meeting for minutes secret ballot voting the requirement of a supermajority to sustain any sanctions against him and a rule bent in his favor to allow him to vote on his own sanction,which tipped the balance from expulsion to mere censure.
in notice and opportunity to be heard in the period through afforded by afte to dougherty is virtually breathtaking.dougherty had multiple notices of the precise charges against him,multiple opportunities to tell his side of the story,multiple opportunities to complain about the composition of any of the adjudicatory body,and an ultimate adjudicatory body the convention that required a supermajority to sustain any sanction which is better than the plaintiff got in anton.
indeed,the irony is because dougherty was afforded so many levels of review and so many opportunities to explain his position,his appeal is essentially a series of petty cavils lodged against each level of review he received,as if afte was somehow obliged to operate by the california evidence code and code of civil procedure and without any regard to a requirement of prejudicial error.these we may deal with summarily.
at the ethics stage dougherty complains that he did get a notice of referral via registered mail but he did receive the forwarded haag complaint the committee wrote a report after dougherty had asked for a continuance but he ignores that he got far more than thirty days,and his request was and evasive the ethics committee really did not investigate even though the charges were that he knowingly was unobjective about the louisiana case dougherty scienter is pretty obvious from his continuing maintenance of the double ricochet theory to this very day he did get the ethics report until eight months later but he clearly got the haag complaint and had the report prior to the directors meeting the report itself was organized well and was just a cut and paste job even so,it identified the three major items that render his double ricochet theory ludicrous.
at the board of directors stage dougherty complains that he was denied the right to have counsel of his own choosing but only because he chose counsel who could not make a board meeting the board went forward with the ethics committee vague and conclusory report which is still clear enough to give anyone who reads it a good understanding of the three major items that cast doubt on dougherty double ricochet thesis he could question his accuser the case did not turn on haag as percipient witness the board did give him a chance to voir dire the board for conflicts of interest afte is a private organization whose board was chosen independently of this disciplinary matter the board shifted the burden of proof to him which is not a valid inference from the fact that he was invited to defend himself,but even if so,a prima facie case had already been made the board voted only once on all ten accusations so the board failed to issue its own report substantiating each charge with clear and convincing evidence so the board allowed haag to respond to the nixon report the nixon report was new,haag rebuttal was new,so both were made available to the membership.
at the membership stage dougherty complains that afte code of ethics is vague it clear enough that an afte member should not mislead a court there are no clear procedures for discipline at a general membership meeting dougherty was the first,so protocols were worked out for the first time,dougherty time to present his defense was limited at the convention just did take all of it he was denied effective representation of counsel by a protocol because only he or his attorney was allowed to speak,but not both of them which happens all the time in real courts too there were two new affidavits that ambush ed him at the general meeting both were rebuttals to board statements of fact he was allowed to protest at the meeting procedural defects at earlier stages he had plenty of opportunity to challenge the ethics committee report to the board there were no instructions to the membership on burden of proof belied by the fact that a percent vote was needed to impose sanctions that shows the default result was exoneration there was no requirement that voting members actually review the written evidence which would have been physically impossible given how much there was of it,which is why afte has an ethics committee and a board in the first place.
and dougherty also complains about the alleged partiality of certain members of the ethics committee and on the board he had lots of opportunity to complain at the time about the fact that afte president initially presented the case as well as presided over the meeting she was a representative of the board,after all and about the board website posting that it had used extreme diligence in coming to its conclusions which is a drop in the bucket when one examines the ocean of materials made available to the membership.dougherty further complains about afte use of its legal advisor as a hearing officer at the meeting he is,after all,a lawyer in an association of else to act as a hearing officer the organization allowing haag son,also a member,to ask numerous questions during the question and answer session there is no indication that haag son was not a voting member or otherwise disqualified from asking those questions and further,finally,the fact that some members of afte have received considerable income from referrals from haag which is to be expected in a small,private organization,and ignores the fact that
