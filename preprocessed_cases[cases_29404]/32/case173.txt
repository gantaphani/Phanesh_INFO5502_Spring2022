the medical board of california the board ordered that petitioner william joseph roy,be publicly reprimanded,after finding he committed professional misconduct by engaging in sexual relations with a patient.

roy filed a petition for writ of mandate in this court,seeking to vacate the trial court decision.we granted an order to show cause and issued an alternative writ.
two issues are presented for review whether substantial evidence supports the trial court finding that roy willingly allowed a patient to fondle or grope an intimate part of his body for a substantial period of time and if so,whether the conduct constituted an act of sexual relations within the meaning of section.we answer yes to both questions and therefore deny the petition.
factual background 
on october,the executive director of the board filed an accusation against roy charging him with having sexual relations with female patients and and committing gross negligence based upon the same conduct.
roy filed a notice of defense and the case proceeded to a disciplinary hearing before an administrative law judge alj in october.
the evidence at the administrative hearing 
events prior to may 
the facts surrounding the events prior to may,all further unspecified calendar dates are to that year are largely undisputed.hence,we draw our factual summary in this section from the trial court written ruling.
roy is a highly trained gynecological oncologist at the time of the incident in this case was a year old woman who worked at a bank in escondido.she was in the process of getting divorced.in its decision,the board described her as a single,bright,attractive,assertive young woman,and as a strong,independent woman who was seeking adventure.
on april,was admitted to the hospital by her primary obstetrician,jerome sinsky.when a ct scan revealed a cystic mass in her,sinksy advised her to have it removed and referred her to roy to perform the surgery.roy performed the surgery on april.the mass turned out not to be malignant and was instructed to follow up with doctors roy and sinsky.on april,roy examined and concluded that she was doing well.he instructed to return to his office in four weeks.
on may,sinsky evaluated.he told her she was recovering well,but instructed her to call roy office to determine whether was necessary.when telephoned roy,he began disclosing details about his personal life.he told her it was his birthday,that his car needed repair,and that he was having difficulty obtaining a california driver license even though he had been a law enforcement officer.found this charming and became interested in him.she decided to create a pretext to speak with him further.in a phone call,which she initiated,asked roy if she could interview him for an english class.roy agreed,and instructed his nurse to schedule for the last office appointment on may.
b.the events of may 
roy examined in his office on may.he prescribed an antibiotic and instructed her to have a level drawn to find out if her surgery had caused a malabsorption of.he also told her to continue seeing sinsky for routine care.
after the office visit concluded,and roy agreed to meet at chang restaurant for an early dinner.they took separate cars and met at the restaurant between and.during dinner,interviewed roy on a variety of topics,including his personal history,his hobbies and his reasons for becoming a doctor.after dinner,roy walked to her car.the plan was for to drive roy to the valet area where his car was parked.
what took place next was the subject of conflicting testimony.testified that,when they got to her car,she thanked roy,told him she had a nice time and asked if they could get together again.roy declined,telling her that she was his patient,that he could be having some sort of relationship with her,and that he could trust himself around her.replied that she felt like she was no longer a patient of his,but roy was not persuaded.
at this point,and roy were standing in front of her car.roy held out his hand to her to shake hands,but somehow that became like we were hugging each other.the encounter then took on a much different character 
board attorney and then what happened 
and then things took more of a sexual nature.
board attorney were you outside the car or inside the car 
board attorney did they take more of a sexual nature did you stay outside 
board attorney did you ever get in the car 
board attorney did it continue in the car

board attorney did he tell you not to do it because you were a patient 
no,i do recall that.
board attorney did he say,stop,i am getting out of the car 
no,i do recall that.
board attorney so you went from hugging i assume he was also hugging.hugging connotes a mutual act.is that true when you said you were hugging both you had your arms around him and his arms around you 
board attorney it went from that to other touching while you were standing and then into the car 
estimated that the entire touching episode lasted an hour,about minutes of which took place inside the car.as they said goodbye,roy told that they could never see or speak to each other again b ecause she was a patient,and that he would have to go to confession the next day.
later in the hearing,the alj elicited the following testimony from 
the court on the occasion when you first got together at chang,did you touched sic his penis or the area above where the penis would be 
yes,but it was threw sic his pants.
the court okay.did he tell you to stop 
according to roy,when the couple arrived at her car,said she had a few more questions,and asked if they could just sit in the car,for a few more minutes.he agreed and questioned him further in the car.at some point,the conversation kind of broke and her hand wound up on my thigh.i guess you could say in the crease or groin area.and she stroked my leg and thigh and touched it with the back side of her hand,my privates,but not a direct grab.roy testified that he was very startled and said he needed to leave.then said,if i never going to see you,can i at least have a hug he said fine,and hugged her before departing.later in roy testimony,he said that touched him in the groin area for a m atter of seconds.it was kind of putting it there.it was there and,like,a pat and a kind of a rub and that was it.it took me time to react.i was a little bit shocked and asked her to stop and got out.
post may events 
in june,roy continued to communicate with about her lab results.in july or august,roy and embarked on a personal relationship that lasted until at least september of.the relationship involved telephone calls,some of which involved phone sex.they also went out a few times and engaged in heavy petting and oral sex,but not intercourse.during the relationship,loaned roy,which he eventually repaid.
expert testimony 
philip disaia,testified as an expert witness for the board.he testified that was still a patient of roy on may,that roy had engaged in sexual relations with her on that date and therefore his behavior constituted an extreme departure from the standard of care.john schlaerth,testified as an expert for roy.he opined that was not a patient of roy after her office visit on may because she was not under his active medical care.he also opined that intimate touching of roy later on may without his consent would not constitute grounds for discipline.
administrative and judicial rulings 
following the evidentiary hearing,the alj issued a proposed decision finding,essentially,that on may,while was a patient of roy,they met for dinner at chang.afterward,they walked to car,where they engaged in heavy petting initiated by,during which time she felt his penis through his pants.roy did not tell her to stop,although he did tell her that she was his patient and they should not be doing this.the alj characterized roy contrary testimony as not particularly sympathetic or believable.
despite these factual findings,the alj found that discipline was unwarranted.the alj reasoned that the encounter was relatively brief,that stroking of roy penis was unsolicited,and that p hysicians should not be held accountable for the unilateral sexual misconduct of their patients.
the board filed a notice of nonadoption of the alj decision and the parties were allowed to submit arguments for and against modification of the proposed order.
on july,the board issued a decision after nonadoption,finding there was good cause to impose discipline under sections sexual relations with a patient and,subdivision b gross negligence,based upon the events that occurred in the parking structure near chang on may.as a sanction,roy was publicly reprimanded and ordered to take a course in ethics and participate in the professional boundaries program.at roy request,the board granted reconsideration of its decision and permitted a new round of briefing.the board decision after reconsideration,reaffirmed the findings of its original decision and imposed the same discipline.
roy then petitioned for writ of administrative mandate in the superior court.code civ.he sought an order vacating the board decision,claiming the board prejudicially abused its discretion and that its decision was unsupported by the weight of the evidence.
the trial court filed a lengthy written order denying the petition.after upholding the board finding that was still a patient of roy on may,the court determined that the critical factual issue was whether sexually groped roy without his consent,or whether roy willingly permitted her to grope him,as the board found.agreeing with the board that was a more credible witness than roy,the court found that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that roy permitted to grope him including touching his penis over his clothing and did not tell her to stop.
the trial court also agreed with the board that the conduct between and roy constituted sexual relations,which the court construed as the touching of an intimate part of another for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.the court upheld the board finding that the groping went on for at least a few minutes,and perhaps longer.it therefore sustained the board legal conclusion that roy had engaged in sexual relations with,warranting discipline under section.
on the other hand,the trial court found that the evidence did not support the board finding of gross negligence and therefore struck that part of the board decision.however,because there was no real doubt that the board would impose the same discipline even without a gross negligence finding,the court found it unnecessary to remand to the board for further proceedings regarding penalty.
following the judgment denying his petition,roy petitioned this court for writ of mandate.we issued an order to show cause,granted the alternative writ of mandate,and stayed further proceedings pending consideration of the merits of the case.
discussion 
i.the standard of review 
roy petition for writ of administrative mandate challenged the board discipline of his physician license for violating section.the case of griffiths superior court th,d,contains a succinct summary of the applicable principles of review after an administrative agency imposes discipline on a professional licensee,the trial court to which application for mandate is made exercises its independent judgment on the facts.bixby pierno cal d,hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.after the trial court exercises its independent judgment in reviewing the facts,the appellate court confines itself to determining whether substantial evidence supports the trial court findings.the appellate court,however,independently exercises its ability to decide issues of law.marek board of podiatric medicine th,d.griffiths,at,d.
roy petition raises two distinct issues first,whether the trial court finding that roy willingly permitted to fondle his private area for a substantial period of time is supported by substantial evidence in the record and,second,if the evidence supports such a finding,whether it provides a legally sufficient basis for concluding that roy engaged in sexual relations with a patient within the meaning of section.resolution of the first issue is governed by the substantial evidence rule.resolution of the second requires the interpretation of a statute,and is therefore subject to independent review by this court.jenkins county of riverside th,d.
ii.analysis 
substantial evidence 
section,which governs the conduct of physicians and surgeons,provides,in pertinent part the commission of any act of sexual abuse,misconduct,or relations with a patient,client,or customer constitutes unprofessional conduct and grounds for disciplinary action for any person licensed under this division italics added.
roy claims the board finding that he allowed to fondle him for at least a few minutes on may was based entirely on speculation,conjecture,or mere possibilities and is therefore unsupported by substantial evidence.
roy argument has been forfeited by the totally statement of facts appearing in the factual portion of his petition.as we stated in state water resources control bd.cases th,d when a petitioner challenges an administrative decision as unsupported by substantial evidence in light of the record as a whole,it is the petitioner burden to demonstrate that the administrative record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the agency decision.citation.a recitation of only the part of the evidence that supports the petitioner position is not the demonstration contemplated under the above rule.citation.accordingly,if,as petitioner here contend s,some particular issue of fact is not sustained,he is required to set forth in his brief all the material evidence on the point and not merely his own evidence.unless this is done the error is deemed to be waived.id.at,d,quoting foreman clark fallon cal d,some italics omitted.
nevertheless,in the interest of justice,we shall address roy argument on the merits.the trial court found the weight of the evidence supports the finding that roy permitted to grope him for at least a few that he did not immediately tell her to stop.the court rejected roy claim that testimony about heavy petting carried no weight,noting that the term was commonly understood to mean stimulating sexual contact between two people short of intercourse,including touching of erogenous zones over clothing.
in attacking the court reasoning,roy points out that actually said that they engaged in something like heavy petting,and she never defined what she meant by that term.italics added.we are not persuaded.
in a substantial evidence challenge to a judgment,the appellate court will consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party,giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference,and resolving conflicts in support of the findings.citations.citation.we may not reweigh the evidence and are bound by the trial court credibility determinations.citations.moreover,findings of fact are liberally construed to support the judgment.estate of young th,d.
we emphasize at the outset that testimony about heavy petting can not be viewed in a vacuum.the testimony must be considered in proper context and along with all of the evidence in the administrative record.
the evidence demonstrated that and roy were romantically interested in each other prior to may.in a phone call,during which he notified about her test results,roy inappropriately began divulging details of his personal life to her,which she found really interesting,and attracted her to him.when asked if she could interview him,roy not only agreed but suggested they meet at a restaur
