california statutory peer review process,business and professions code section et,provides a physician with the right to a hearing for the purpose of reviewing a hospital peer review committee recommendation to deny the physician application for reappointment to staff privileges.a hearing officer may be appointed to preside at the hearing,but the officer is prohibited by statute from acting as a prosecutor or advocate or from voting on the merits.bus,subd.b.the merits are determined by the trier of fact,often a panel drawn from other of the physician peers,subd.a.we conclude the hearing officer lacks authority to prevent a reviewing panel from reviewing the case by dismissing it on his or her own initiative before the hearing has been convened,and also lacks authority to terminate the hearing after it has been convened without first securing the approval of the reviewing panel.we therefore will affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
background 
gil mileikowsky is a physician and surgeon board certified in obstetrics and gynecology.he had staff privileges to practice gynecology at west hills hospital and medical center west hills,an acute care facility.in may,mileikowsky applied for obstetrical privileges at west hills and for renewal of his gynecological privileges.his applications were reviewed by a peer review committee,which recommended denial.the recommendation was submitted to west hills medical executive committee,which also recommended denial.mileikowsky was given formal notice of the recommendation and the reasons for it he had failed to notify the medical staff that his privileges at another facility,century city hospital,had been terminated he had represented that he had voluntarily resigned from a third facility,the regional medical center,when in fact he had been summarily suspended and he had attended a patient at west hills and attempted to perform a caesarean section on her when he lacked obstetrical privileges and the patient had requested he stay away.
on may,mileikowsky filed a timely request for a hearing,challenging the peer review committee recommendation.under west hills bylaws,hearings are held before a judicial review committee composed of members of the active staff the reviewing panel.west hills medical executive committee appointed a hearing officer to preside over the hearing.the bylaws specify that hearings are to be held,if possible,no later than days from the date a request for a hearing is received.in mileikowsky case,however,month after month went by without a hearing,largely because mileikowsky refused to produce documents requested by west hills,challenged the hearing officer authority,and refused to comply with the officer directions or orders.west hills in the meantime amended its notice of the recommendation to include an allegation that mileikowsky had failed to cooperate in west hills investigation of the actions taken against him by a fourth facility,medical center.the amended notice referred to a report had made to the medical board of california medical board and to the national practitioner data bank,indicating mileikowsky privileges at that facility had been suspended for actions falling into the adverse action classification of.
on february,after detailing the many complaints the parties had made about one another,including west hills complaint that mileikowsky persistently refused to provide information relating to the action taken against him by medical center,the hearing officer ordered mileikowsky to produce the documents,warning he would impose terminating sanctions should mileikowsky fail to comply.mileikowsky replied he would be occupied until march with other matters and would respond to the officer order after that date.on march,the hearing officer wrote to the parties he had received no further communication from mileikowsky,ordered mileikowsky to make arrangements to allow inspection and copying of the documents by march,and again warned he would order terminating sanctions if mileikowsky failed to comply.
mileikowsky did not comply with the hearing officer order.on march,the hearing officer issued an order dismissing mileikowsky request for a hearing,finding mileikowsky refusal to make the documents available prevented west hills from prosecuting its case.in dismissing the proceedings,the officer invoked a provision in west hills bylaws providing that a physician who fails to request a hearing shall be deemed to have accepted the action involved,the action will become effective immediately,and the physician will be deemed to have waived all other rights inuring to him or her under the bylaws.the order thus declared that the dismissal constituted mileikowsky voluntary acceptance of the peer review committee recommendation and that the recommendation therefore shall become effective immediately.as a result of the order,no hearing was convened,and the matter was never submitted to the reviewing panel for decision 
mileikowsky appealed the order to west hills governing board.the board adopted the hearing officer order,ruling mileikowsky had been afforded a fair hearing in substantial compliance with the bylaws and that the officer decision to dismiss the proceedings was reasonable,warranted,and supported by the weight of the evidence.mileikowsky sought relief in the superior court by petition for a writ of administrative mandate.the superior court denied the petition.the court of appeal reversed,remanding the matter to the trial court with directions to enter a judgment directing west hills and its medical staff to set aside the governing board decision,to convene a hearing under the provisions of subdivision c of section,and to conduct the hearing and any further proceedings in accordance with the provisions of section et.
discussion 
decisions concerning medical staff membership and privileges are made through a process of hospital peer review.every licensed hospital is required to have an organized medical staff responsible for the adequacy and quality of the medical care rendered to patients in the hospital,tit,subd.a arnett dal cielo cal th,d.the medical staff must adopt written bylaws which provide formal procedures for the evaluation of staff applications and credentials,appointments,reappointments,assignment of clinical privileges,appeals mechanisms and such other subjects or conditions which the medical staff and governing body deem appropriate,tit,subd.b see bus,regs,tit.the medical staff acts chiefly through peer review committees,which,among other things,investigate complaints about physicians and recommend whether staff privileges should be granted or renewed.arnett,at,d.in,california codified the peer review process at business and professions code section et,making it part of a comprehensive statutory scheme for the licensure of california physicians and requiring acute care facilities such as west hills to include the process in their medical staff bylaws,subd.a.
the primary purpose of the peer review process is to protect the health and welfare of the people of california by excluding through the peer review mechanism those healing arts practitioners who provide substandard care or who engage in professional misconduct,subd.a.this purpose also serves the interest of california acute care facilities by providing a means of removing incompetent physicians from a hospital staff to reduce exposure to possible malpractice liability.kibler northern inyo county local hospital dist.cal th,d,arnett dal cielo,supra,cal th at,d.
another purpose,also if not equally important,is to protect competent practitioners from being barred from practice for arbitrary or discriminatory reasons.thus,section recites peer review,fairly conducted,is essential to preserving the highest standards of medical practice,subd.a,but p eer review that is not conducted fairly results in harm both to patients and healing arts practitioners by limiting access to care,subd.a.peer review that is not conducted fairly and results in the unwarranted loss of a qualified physician right or privilege to use a hospital facilities deprives the physician of a property interest directly connected to the physician livelihood.anton san antonio community hosp.cal d.as one author stated it is almost impossible for a physician to practice medicine today unless she is a medical staff member at one or more hospitals.this is because a doctor can not regularly admit or treat patients unless she is a member of the medical staff.privileges are especially important for specialists,like surgeons,who perform the majority of their services in a hospital setting.for this reason,a hospital decision to deny membership or clinical privileges,or to discipline a physician,can have an immediate and devastating effect on a practitioner career.merkely,physicians policing physicians the development of medical staff peer review law at california hospitals.
the effect of denying staff privileges extends beyond reducing or eliminating a physician access to the denying facility.section,subdivision b requires that hospitals report certain disciplinary actions,including denials of staff privileges,to the medical board.the medical board,which licenses physicians,must maintain a historical record that includes any reports of disciplinary information,subd.a see arnett dal cielo,supra,cal th at,d.a hospital considering whether to grant or renew a physician staff privileges must contact the medical board to learn if some other facility has reported a disciplinary action involving the physician,subd.a.and,as occurred here,a hospital usually is required to report disciplinary actions to the national practitioner data bank,established for the purpose of tracking the activities of incompetent physicians.a.a hospital decision to deny staff privileges therefore may have the effect of ending the physician career.
the peer review process,while generally delegating responsibility to the private sector to monitor the professional conduct of physicians,establishes minimum protections for physicians subject to adverse action in the peer review system.kibler northern inyo county local hospital,supra,cal th at,d,smith selma community hospital th,d.where,as here,a peer review committee recommends a final proposed action that will require a hospital to file a report with the medical board,the affected physician is entitled to notice and may request a hearing for the purpose of determining if the recommendation is reasonable and warranted,subds.a,b,subd.b.the hearing shall be held,as determined by the peer review body,before a trier of fact,which shall be an arbitrator or arbitrators selected by a process mutually acceptable to the licentiate,the physician and the peer review body,or before a panel of unbiased individuals which shall include,where feasible,an individual practicing the same specialty as the licentiate,subd.a.at the hearing,both parties have the right to call,examine,and witnesses and to present and rebut evidence,subd.a.upon the completion of the hearing,the parties are entitled to the written decision of the trier of fact,including findings of fact and a conclusion articulating the connection between the evidence produced at the hearing and the decision reached,subd.a.under west hills bylaws,the reviewing panel is composed of no fewer than five members of the medical staff.a physician therefore has the right to have a second body of peers independently determine whether a peer review committee recommendation to deny the physician application for privileges is reasonable and warranted after considering not only the evidence that led to the peer review committee findings,but also any additional evidence produced at the hearing.
both the business and professions code and west hills bylaws provide for the appointment of a hearing officer,but both also carefully limit the authority of the officer.if a physician requests a hearing,the code provides that the medical executive committee may,but need not,select a hearing officer to preside over the hearing to be held before the reviewing panel,subd.b.west hills bylaws confer authority on the officer to maintain decorum at the hearing and ensure that all parties have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present oral and documentary evidence.both the statutory scheme and west hills bylaws caution that the hearing officer is not to act as a prosecuting officer or advocate,and both recite that the hearing officer shall not be entitled to vote,subd.b.the reviewing panel resolves any conflicts in the evidence,determines its sufficiency,and determines the reasonableness of the recommended disciplinary action.
a hearing officer without the authority to determine sufficiency of the evidence may not entertain a motion to dismiss the proceedings for lack of evidence.see frost state personnel board d.here,while the hearing officer did not dismiss the proceedings for lack of evidence,by dismissing the proceedings before the hearing was convened the officer prevented the reviewing panel from considering the evidence and eliminated the reviewing panel role in the decisionmaking process.whether the hearing officer had the power to take such action presents a question of law which we review de novo.mileikowsky tenet healthsystem,supra,th at,d unnamed physician board of trustees th,d rosenblit superior court d.
no provision in either the business and professions code or west hills bylaws expressly confers authority on a hearing officer to issue terminating sanctions.west hills,however,contends such authority is implicit in section,subdivision d.that subdivision grants each party the right to inspect and copy relevant documentary information in the other party possession.it then provides the failure by either party to provide access to this information at least days before the hearing shall constitute good cause for a continuance.the right to inspect and copy by either party does not extend to confidential information referring solely to individually identifiable licentiates,other than the licentiate under review.the arbitrator or presiding officer shall consider and rule upon any request for access to information,and may impose any safeguards the protection of the peer review process and justice requires,subd.d.
in west hills view,a hearing officer power to impose safeguards to protect the peer review process embraces the authority to issue terminating sanctions for a party failure to comply with requests for information.but that the legislature intended for section,subdivision d to confer on the hearing officer the power to impose sanctions beyond granting or denying continuances is dubious.after generally stating the right of each party to have access to information in the other party possession,subdivision d addresses two situations.the first is that a party might fail to provide access to information.after identifying that possibility,subdivision d states that the failure to provide timely access shall constitute good cause for a continuance.the second is that a document might contain confidential information relating to someone who is not a party to the proceedings.after identifying that possibility,subdivision d confers authority on the hearing officer to rule upon any request for access to information,and to impose any safeguards the protection of the peer review process and justice requires.read in context,the provision for imposing safeguards clearly seems directed to the situation in which the material a physician requests to inspect or copy includes confidential information related to physicians who are not parties to the proceedings in that case,the statute authorizes the hearing officer to redact or otherwise limit the information to protect the confidentiality of the nonparty physicians while still protecting the peer review process and justice by providing the physician access to otherwise discoverable material.
while the statutory language seems clear,a broad interpretation of the officer statutory powers might nonetheless be justified if granting the hearing officer authority to issue terminating sanctions were consistent with the goals of the statutory review process and its allocation of responsibilities for reviewing a peer review committee recommendation.but it is not.the purpose for providing a physician with a review of the peer review committee recommendation is to secure for the physician an independent review of that recommendation by a qualified person or entity,here the reviewing panel.that purpose is defeated if the matter is dismissed before the reviewing panel becomes involved.further,irrespective of a hearing officer authority at the hearing or over the evidence adduced there,the officer,who shall not be entitled to vote,subd.b,has no part in the decisionmaking process and no authority to prevent the reviewing panel from reviewing the recommendation.yet,in effect,a hearing officer who prevents the reviewing panel from conducting its review votes by ensuring that the peer review committee recommendation will be the final decision.
a physician refusal to cooperate in an investigation of reported problems may support a recommendation that the physician staff privileges be denied.see webman little of mary hospital th,d.however,it also is settled that a physician may not be denied staff privileges merely because he or she is argumentative or has difficulty getting along with other physicians or hospital staff,when those traits do not relate to the quality of medical care the physician is able to provide.miller eisenhower medical center cal d,rosner eden township hospital dist.cal d.for similar reasons,a physician obstructiveness in connection with the reviewing process might,but will not necessarily,support a conclusion the physician is unable to function in a hospital setting.as it is the reviewing panel and not the hearing officer that determines whether the peer review committee recommendation is warranted,it is the reviewing panel that should decide whether or not the physician inability or refusal to engage in the reviewing process suffices to render any further proceedings unnecessary.
we hold,therefore,that the hearing officer lacked authority to prevent the reviewing panel from fulfilling its statutory duty to review the peer review committee recommendation to deny mileikowsky applications 
the error was not in any way cured by mileikowsky subsequent appeal to west hills governing board and the board affirmation of the hearing officer order.hospitals have a dual structure.the administrative governing body,which might not include health care professionals,takes ultimate responsibility for the quality and performance of the hospital.the hospital medical staff evaluates staff applications and credentials,appointments,reappointments,and assignments of clinical privileges.alexander superior court cal th,d.it is not inconceivable a governing body would wish to remove a physician from a hospital staff for reasons having no bearing on quality of care.in smith selma community hospital,supra,th,d,for example,there was evidence suggesting a hospital governing board might have sought to terminate a physician privileges because the physician owned and operated clinics that competed with the hospital corporate owner,or because of a lawsuit between the physician and the corporate owner arising from the owner failed attempt to purchase the physician clinics.id.at,d.accordingly,although a hospital administrative governing body makes the ultimate decision about whether to grant or deny staff privileges,it does so based on the recommendation of its medical staff committee alexander,at,d,giving great weight to the actions of peer review bodies,subd.a.here,the board gave no weight to the actions of any peer review body.it simply affirmed the hearing officer order on its finding that mileikowsky prehearing conduct justified termination of the proceedings.this procedure violated both the letter and the underlying principles of the statutory peer review process.
we are not unmindful of the burdens the hearing process imposes on busy practitioners who voluntarily serve on a reviewing panel.our decision here should not be understood to mean the reviewing panel must involve itself in procedural or evidentiary issues.neither do we intend to suggest the hearing officer lacks the power to preside over the hearing,including,as required by west hills bylaws,the power to maintain decorum and ensure that all participants in the hearing have a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to present oral and documentary evidence.but an order dismissing the proceedings is a far cry from a ruling on a procedural or evidentiary issue,and a reviewing panel is equally if not more qualified to determine when a party refusal to cooperate has so interfered with the panel ability to resolve the issues as to justify sanctions.we hold only that once a hearing has been requested,the review process may not be concluded without the reviewing panel informed approval.mileikowsky tenet healthsystem,supra,th,d,therefore is disapproved to the extent it holds that a hearing officer without the approval of the reviewing entity may terminate a hearing as a sanction for the physician conduct in disobeying orders or disrupting hearing sessions.id.at,d.but we have no complaint with the hearing officer ruling in that case that the hearing would be recessed whenever mileikowsky,who had reacted emotionally and yelled in reaction to a ruling,was out of control id.at,d,or the officer ruling that the hospital could disclose to the reviewing panel that mileikowsky had violated the officer discovery orders id.at,d.
we also are cognizant of the arguments that limiting a hearing officer remedial power to granting continuances will encourage disruptive behavior and that unless a hearing officer has the power to impose sanctions,an obstructive physician may be able to extend the review process unreasonably,endangering the public health and welfare and forcing a facility other practitioners to monitor the physician actions until his or her appointment expires or the hearing is completed.the arguments raise legitimate concerns,but we are not convinced they justify allowing a hearing officer to impose terminating sanctions.
in the most severe cases,where the failure to take action may result in an imminent danger to the health of any individual,the physician clinical privileges can be summarily suspended.even when there is no summary suspension,a physician generally would wish to have the hearing held as soon as possible,if only to resolve uncertainty about his or her status at the hospital.a delay in the proceedings will injure a physician economically when the physician privileges have been denied,summarily suspended,or restricted,or if they expire without the physician reappointment.in the present case,for example,mileikowsky could not practice obstetrics at west hills because he was never granted privileges for that practice.he was entitled to practice gynecology until his gynecological privileges expired,and he was allowed a extension of those privileges,but even that extension expired long before the hearing officer dismissed the proceedings.and,that a physician staff privileges expire in the absence of reappointment protects the hospital against the possibility a physician whose work is substandard could forever impede the hospital ability to deliver quality medical care 
in addition,section,subdivision a authorizes hospitals to develop their own procedures and provides that parties to peer review proceedings are bound by any additional notice and hearing provisions contained in any applicable professional society or medical staff bylaws which are not inconsistent with the statutory peer review process.a hospital therefore has power through its bylaws to provide additional protections against obstructive behavior.thus,although we conclude a hearing officer may not on his or her own initiative dismiss the proceedings,we see no reason why a hospital might not create through its bylaws a simplified procedure that would allow a reviewing panel to consider and adopt a hearing officer recommendation that the proceedings be dismissed for a physician failure to cooperate.and a reviewing panel reasonably could infer from a physician failure to provide information that the information in question is unfavorable or tends to show the physician can not or will not cooperate with others and for that reason may be unwilling or unable to function effectively in a hospital setting.
finally,we question west hills assertion that it could not proceed without evidence only mileikowsky could provide.west hills peer review committee,as a result of an informal investigation,determined grounds existed for denying or refusing to extend staff privileges to mileikowsky.west hills presumably had some evidence to support the peer review committee allegations.it had no need for information possessed by mileikowsky to establish the validity of the allegation that he had failed to notify the medical staff his privileges at century city hospital had been terminated or the allegation that he had misrepresented that his resignation from regional medical center had been voluntary.similarly,west hills did not need mileikowsky evidence to substantiate the allegation that mileikowsky had attended a patient at west hills and had prepared to perform a caesarean section on her even though he lacked obstetrical privileges and she had requested he stay away.nor did west hills require information in mileikowsky possession to persuade the reviewing panel mileikowsky had failed to cooperate in west hills investigation of the actions taken against him by the other hospitals.the validity of the allegation medical center had reported mileikowsky privileges had been suspended for actions falling into the adverse action classification of is fully supported by the existence of the report itself,a document west hills was required to,and did,obtain from the medical board.there seems little reason to conclude mileikowsky refusal to provide information would have prevented west hills from making its case had the hearing been held within the period set forth in west hills bylaws or the period contained in section,subdivision h.
the code contains protections against the possibility a physician might attempt to obtain some advantage by refusing to reveal the nature of his arguments or supporting evidence until the hearing.for example,the hearing officer is entitled to consider a party lack of cooperation when ruling on that party own request for information,subd.e.initial applicants for hospital privileges may not introduce information not produced upon request of the peer review body during the application process,unless the initial applicant establishes that the information could not have been produced previously in the exercise of reasonable diligence,subd.b.in all cases,the hearing officer,as indicated,has the power to grant a continuance if a party fails to provide access to information in that party possession,subd.d.a party failure to disclose the identity of a witness or produce copies of documents the party expects to submit at the hearing at least days before the hearing also is good cause for a continuance,subd.f.similarly,section,subdivision h,which requires that a hearing be commenced within days after receipt of the request for a hearing and that the peer review process be completed within a reasonable time,creates an exception when the physician fails to comply with the obligation to allow inspection and copying of documentary information.
in sum,we are not persuaded the power granted the hearing officer to impose any safeguards the protection of the peer review process and justice requires,subd.d includes authority to terminate the peer review process without the reviewing panel approval,or that the interests of the people of california and their medical facilities to preserve the highest standards of medical practice can not be protected without implying such authority into the statutory scheme.it follows that the hearing officer order dismissing the proceedings was unauthorized.and,as decisions relating to clinical privileges are generally the province of a hospital peer review bodies and not its governing body but see,subds.b c,west hills governing board similarly lacked the authority to ratify the order of dismissal.
we therefore affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
plaintiff physician gil mileikowsky applied for obstetrical privileges and renewal of gynecological privileges at defendant west hills hospital and medical center in los angeles county.defendant medical executive committee recommended a denial for these reasons plaintiff failed to disclose termination of his staff privileges at century city hospital in los angeles county plaintiff misrepresented that his resignation from regional medical center in los angeles county was voluntary and plaintiff attempted to perform a caesarean section on a patient at defendant hospital when he lacked obstetrical privileges there and ignored the patient request that he not treat her.
when plaintiff thereafter asked for a hearing,defendant hospital appointed an attorney as a hearing officer,as well as a reviewing panel consisting of defendant active physician members.
in the ensuing statutorily authorized discovery process,which spanned eight months,plaintiff repeatedly refused numerous requests for access to documents related to the revocation of his staff privileges at medical center.twice,the hearing officer issued an order for production of those documents,to no avail.eventually,the hearing officer imposed,for plaintiff noncompliance and abuse of the peer review process,the sanction of terminating the proceedings the majority holds that the hearing officer lacked the authority to do so.i disagree.
pertinent here is business and professions code section,subdivision d.that provision governs the discovery obligations and rights of the physician and the peer review body it states that breach of those obligations is good cause for a continuance of the hearing,and provides that the discovery right does not extend to disclosure of confidential information regarding licensed personnel other than the physician in question.it then states the arbitrator or presiding officer shall consider and rule upon any request for access to information,and may impose any safeguards the protection of the peer review process and justice requires.italics added.the majority construes that provision as authorizing a hearing officer only to grant continuances and to redact or otherwise limit disclosure of confidential information relating to nonparties,ante,d at,at.i do not share that overly restrictive interpretation.
in my view,the provision critical phrase is the one that i have just italicized,stating that,in ruling on any request for access to information,the hearing officer may impose any safeguards to protect the peer review process and to advance justice.on its face,this is language granting expansive authority,not language restricting authority.
according to the majority,however,the provision last sentence,which permits the hearing officer to impose any safeguards the protection of the peer review process and justice requires,refers only to that provision penultimate sentence,which pertains to the situation in which the material a party requests to inspect or copy includes confidential information related to physicians who are not parties to the proceedings,ante,d at,at,italics added.in that situation,the majority states,subdivision d last sentence authorizes the hearing officer to redact or otherwise limit the information to protect the confidentiality of the nonparty physician while providing the physician access to otherwise discoverable material,ante,d at,at.but that interpretation is inconsistent with the rest of the statutory language that the hearing officer power to take appropriate action to protect the peer review process and to advance justice applies to any request for access to information bus,subd.d,italics added,not just those involving nonparty physicians.
to not allow a hearing officer presiding over a peer review proceeding to impose a termination sanction for a party egregious abuse of the discovery process would undermine the hearing officer ability to control recalcitrant parties and curb flagrant abuses of the statutory discovery process.contrary to the majority assertion,ante,d at,at,such authority would not interfere with the reviewing panel task of determining whether the physician possesses the requisite professional competence or q
