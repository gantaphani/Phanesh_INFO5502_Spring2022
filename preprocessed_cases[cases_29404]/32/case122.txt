darris young,a california state prisoner,appeals the district court denial of his habeas petition challenging his conviction for armed robbery and felony evasion.young contends that his trial attorney disciplinary problems rendered her presumptively unable to provide effective assistance,thereby warranting a per se reversal of his conviction under united states cronic,d.young further contends that his trial attorney baseless lawsuit against various public officials,including the alameda county district attorney da,for allegedly participating in a pedophile ring created an actual conflict of interest under cuyler sullivan,d.we uphold the state court resolution of young ineffective assistance claim since strickland washington,d,rather than cronic,governs this claim,and young fails to show prejudice under strickland.further,we find that young has waived his conflict of interest claim by not raising it before the district court.see belgarde montana,cir.accordingly,we affirm the district court denial of young habeas petition.
background 
and trial proceedings 
on july,young was apprehended after a car chase and charged with armed robbery and felony evasion.young,positively identified by two witnesses,waived his miranda rights and confessed to robbing a safeway store.young two prior robbery convictions were submitted as strikes against him under california three strikes law,which imposes a minimum sentence of years to life on defendants previously convicted of two or more serious or violent felonies.code e a,c a.prior to trial,the alameda county da office offered young a determinate prison term of sixteen years for pleading guilty.young rejected this offer,as well as a second offer for a term of twelve years,four months.later,he regretted his decision and had his public defender request a determinate sentence,which the da office declined to extend.
on march,young family retained kathryn dixon as his counsel.unbeknownst to young or his family,state bar disciplinary charges alleging counts of misconduct were pending against dixon at the time she was hired.dixon was also engaged in a baseless lawsuit accusing numerous public officials,including the alameda county da,of being members of a pedophile ring that kidnapped local schoolchildren.as young counsel,dixon moved to suppress the field lineup conducted after the robbery as unduly suggestive,as well as a prejudicial statement young had made in violation of his miranda rights.she argued unsuccessfully to exclude the use of young prior convictions for impeachment,but did secure a bifurcated trial on the truth of those convictions.dixon also twice requested of deputy da matt golde a determinate sentence,which golde refused to extend.at the close of the prosecution evidence,young offered to plead guilty,but withdrew the offer when dixon advised him that it might not affect the length of his sentence.on june,the jury convicted young of armed robbery and felony evasion and,in a separate proceeding,found his prior convictions to be true.
on july,before young sentencing had begun,the california state bar court recommended dixon disbarment.the bar court found that dixon took fees from and then stopped communicating with six clients made false statements to the probate court,to an administrative tribunal,and to a superior court engaged in acts of moral turpitude,dishonesty,or corruption and threatened or made false accusations against four attorneys,a former client,a former paralegal,the state bar trial counsel,and the bar court itself.dixon was eventually disbarred on march.
sentencing and appeals 
because dixon became an inactive member of the bar on july,the trial court reappointed a public defender to represent young during sentencing.the court first imposed a concurrent years to life sentence for young two offenses,with a determinate term of eleven years for enhancements.later,pursuant to its discretion under code a,the trial court struck one of young prior convictions and imposed a determinate sentence of twenty years.young simultaneously filed a direct appeal and state habeas petition alleging that dixon suffered from a conflict of interest,that she failed to pursue plea negotiations,and that the state bar proceedings rendered her presumptively incapable of providing effective assistance.the california court of appeal,unswayed by young arguments,denied relief on december,and the california supreme court denied young petition for review on april.young timely filed a federal habeas petition in which he argued that dixon failure to disclose her pending disciplinary charges amounted to an actual conflict of interest,and that the state bar finding that dixon was unfit to practice law established per se ineffective assistance under cronic.the district court denied the petition on august,and this appeal timely followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court denial of young habeas petition.robinson ignacio,cir.we may grant habeas relief to a person in state custody if the state court decision was contrary to,or involved an unreasonable application of,clearly established federal law,as determined by the supreme court of the united states.d.the state court findings of fact are presumed to be correct unless the petitioner can rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence.see e.
a state court decision is contrary to supreme court precedent if it applies a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth in the supreme court cases or confronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable from a decision of th e court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from the court precedent.williams taylor,d.a state court decision involves an unreasonable application of supreme court precedent if it identifies the correct governing legal principle from th e court decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner case.id.at.in applying the foregoing standards,we review the last reasoned decision by the state court,robinson,at,which in this case is the california court of appeal denial of young state habeas petition.
iii.discussion 
ineffective assistance of counsel 
young contends that he is entitled to relief because the california court of appeal applied the wrong legal standard to analyze his claim that dixon pending disciplinary proceedings rendered her assistance constitutionally deficient.we disagree and uphold the state court resolution of young ineffective assistance claim under strickland,rather than cronic,as neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established supreme court precedent.
to prevail on a sixth amendment ineffective assistance claim,a defendant must show that counsel representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,strickland,at,and that there is a reasonable probability that,but for counsel unprofessional errors,the result of the proceeding would have been different,id.at.see also bell cone,d explaining that w ithout proof of both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense,it could not be said that the sentence or conviction resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that rendered the result of the proceeding unreliable quoting strickland,at.
in cronic,the supreme court carved out certain exceptions to the general strickland rule,holding that in limited situations the defendant need not show prejudice,as required under strickland.see cronic,at.specifically,prejudice may be presumed when the defendant is denied counsel at a critical stage of his trial,id.at,counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution case to meaningful adversarial testing,or the likelihood that any lawyer,even a fully competent one,could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial,id.at.but apart from circumstances of this magnitude,there is generally no basis for finding a sixth amendment violation unless the accused can show how specific errors of counsel undermined the reliability of the finding of guilt.id.at.
young contends that cronic governs his ineffective assistance claim because representati
