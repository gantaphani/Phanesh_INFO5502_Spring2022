this case presents an issue of first impression involving attorney disqualification in a successive representation setting.the issue is whether the firm representing one party must be disqualified when it associates as counsel an attorney who previously obtained confidential information from the opposing party,even in the absence of any evidence that confidential information was shared between the firm and the associated counsel.
defendants howard demera howard,mark cameron mark,and demera demera cameron ddc collectively defendants appeal from an order denying in part their motion to disqualify counsel for plaintiffs ralston pound iii,karen bradley,and john renna collectively plaintiffs.
at the time of the motion,plaintiffs were represented by andrew jones jones and peter bradley bradley.bradley recently had been associated in the case.the trial court concluded bradley must be disqualified because he was provided with confidential information when he consulted with ddc counsel three years before being contacted by jones.the trial court concluded it was not necessary to disqualify jones,however,because bradley did not provide any confidential information to jones.defendants appeal from the order denying the motion to disqualify jones.
we conclude that once the trial court determined bradley received confidential information from ddc,the disqualification of jones also was required.we,therefore,will vacate the portion of the trial court order that denies the motion to disqualify jones and remand with instructions to issue a new order granting the motion.
factual and procedural summary 
this action arose out of plaintiffs employment with ddc,an accountancy corporation.plaintiffs were shareholders in ddc and subject to various agreements related to their employment,including covenants not to compete,termination bonuses,and the right to purchase shares of the corporation upon termination.howard and mark were the controlling shareholders of ddc.
plaintiffs decided to terminate their employment with ddc and form their own firm.plaintiffs,naturally,intended to retain some of the accounts they had established at ddc and became concerned with the potential effect of the various employment agreements.they filed a declaratory relief action against ddc seeking to resolve these concerns before they left ddc.the first amended complaint added derivative causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty,fraud,and other theories against howard and mark.ddc filed a seeking a declaration of the parties rights and duties under the various agreements and alleging plaintiffs breached their employment contracts.
the contentious nature of this corporate divorce sets the stage for the dispute before us.in september,howard and mark were seeking personal counsel,necessitated by plaintiffs amended complaint that named them as individual defendants for the first time.
michael smith smith,counsel for ddc,agreed to assist in the search.he interviewed several attorneys,including bradley.on september,he met with bradley for approximately one hour.smith stated in a declaration that during his interview with bradley he discussed the case in specific terms,including issues,personalities,vulnerabilities,and other topics properly described as attorney work product.code civ.howard and mark eventually retained james betts betts.
jones represented plaintiffs from the inception of the action.his declaration states that in september three years after bradley interviewed with smith he consulted with bradley because of bradley experience in corporate matters.they briefly discussed the case and bradley offered some observations about the legality of howard and mark actions.approximately one week later jones approached bradley about associating as counsel in the case.bradley told jones that years earlier he had met with smith about a case in which jones was the opposing attorney.bradley did not know if his meeting with smith involved this case,could not recall smith providing any specific information,and recalled the primary topic was his bradley qualifications.
jones and bradley met with plaintiffs a few times.bradley did not tell jones of any facts or legal issues learned from smith or any other source.the factual and legal context of the discussions was based on information provided by jones.
bradley filed a declaration confirming a meeting with smith,but denying the ability to confirm they discussed this case.bradley recalled the meeting involved a corporation that had been sued,as had the majority shareholders.although the parties probably were identified,the discussions were superficial.smith provided a brief overview of the case posture.the only facts bradley could remember with certainty were that the case involved corporate law issues and jones was the adverse attorney.bradley believes no facts were discussed beyond what one could learn from the pleadings.the primary purpose of the meeting was to discuss bradley expertise and experience.
bradley recounted his meeting with jones.jones did not tell bradley any information that sounded familiar to bradley.bradley described the covenant not to compete in the case as a novelty,one with which he was not familiar.the only thing bradley told jones about his meeting with smith was that the case involved corporate law issues and jones was the adverse attorney.
smith and betts learned of bradley association in the case at a court conference.ddc immediately moved to disqualify both bradley and jones.howard and mark joined in the motion.the trial court disqualified bradley,but denied the motion as to jones.defendants appeal the denial of the motion to disqualify jones.
discussion 
although there are many headings and subparts,defendants only argument is that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion because smith confided privileged information to bradley and,since bradley consulted with jones,the possibility exists that bradley,either intentionally or unintentionally,disclosed privileged information to jones.jones,of course,denies receiving any such information from bradley.defendants have no proof to support their argument but suggest the mere possibility is sufficient to disqualify jones.
generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d.
where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality.thus,where a former client seeks to have a previous attorney disqualified from serving as counsel to a successive client in litigation adverse to the interests of the first client,the governing test requires that the client demonstrate a substantial relationship between the subjects of the antecedent and current representations.the substantial relationship test mediates between two interests that are in tension in such a freedom of the subsequent client to counsel of choice,on the one hand,and the interest of the former client in ensuring the permanent confidentiality of matters disclosed to the attorney in the course of the prior representation,on the other.where the requisite substantial relationship between the subjects of the prior and the current representations can be demonstrated,access to confidential inf
