joseph coppola,an attorney,appeals a decision of the united states district court for the district of massachusetts admonishing him for unprofessional conduct.finding no abuse of discretion,we affirm.
background 
this appeal arises from coppola behavior during a case in which he made accusations against opposing counsel.to explain the reasons for the district court admonishment,we briefly review the background of the case.the estate of helen lewis held the senior mortgage on a parcel of real property,and harriet balerna whom coppola would eventually represent held the junior mortgage.when the mortgagor defaulted,helen lewis husband and executor melvin lewis hired an attorney,carmel gilberti,to foreclose on the property.in each of two foreclosure auctions,ruth drowne placed the highest bid but could not obtain financing,forfeiting in deposits she made.the property was eventually sold to edward lewis,melvin son and another executor of helen lewis estate,who had placed the second highest bid at the second auction.ruth drowne then filed suit in massachusetts state court to set aside the foreclosure sale and retrieve the deposits that she had forfeited.gilberti successfully defended the suit.after gilberti received attorneys fees for defending the suit,the remaining proceeds of the foreclosure sale were equal only to a fraction of balerna junior mortgage.
because the proceeds were so meager,coppola filed suit on balerna behalf in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts against gilberti,melvin lewis,and edward lewis on four counts 
accounting for the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.
declaratory judgment regarding the parties rights to those proceeds.
conversion of the proceeds,including unjustified payment of gilberti attorney fees in the drowne case.
breach of fiduciary duty,again including the payment of gilberti attorney fees.
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss,which the court denied in a minute order.after months of discovery,the case proceeded to a bench trial,at which coppola questioned gilberti extensively.three of coppola areas of inquiry are relevant on appeal 
conversion 
the complaint filed by coppola on behalf of balerna accused gilberti of wrongfully converting the foreclosure proceeds by using some of them to defend the drowne suit,in which gilberti was sued individually.despite the caption of that case,however,drowne had sued gilberti only in her capacity as the estate attorney.the mortgage agreement,moreover,clearly allowed the mortgagee to participate in legal proceedings affecting the mortgaged property,which undoubtedly included the drowne suit.balerna gilberti.at the beginning of the trial,the court warned coppola that he risked being assessed costs if he could not substantiate the conversion allegation.coppola offered no evidence that the decision to defend the drowne suit was unjustified in fact,the costs and fees associated with that suit were less than the in forfeited deposits that drowne was attempting to recover.the court later concluded that coppola had accused gilberti of serious misconduct without any evidence.
in a motion to disqualify gilberti,as well as in his opposition to the defendants motion to dismiss,coppola invoked the massachusetts criminal usury statute,which prohibits a lender from taking directly or indirectly,interest and expenses the aggregate of which exceeds an amount greater than twenty per centum per annum upon the sum loaned.laws ch,a.based on this statute,coppola argued that gilberti fees were excessive because they exceeded twenty percent of the foreclosure proceeds.on the first day of trial,the court told coppola that this was a losing argument i tell you right now,the usury argument is a total nonstarter.i look at it,but i have had it argued to me before.it never worked.it not going to work this time either.nevertheless,coppola questioned gilberti in a way that insinuated that she had committed criminal usury 
q are you aware that payments made on the loan were greater principal and interest greater than percent per year 
coppola the cause of action is that the payments were excessive,your honor.it is as a matter of law,it is illegal to charge more than percent per year.
after much discussion with coppola,the court cut off this line of questioning the usury statute does have anything to do with this witness.maybe by analogy you can argue it in your proposed findings,but this is not a claim that you advanced against gilberti or against anyone.
false statements 
based on discrepancies between the lewis estate records and information that gilberti provided during discovery,coppola accused gilberti at trial of providing false information the fact is,we asked for an accounting of those proceeds.we were provided false information.we were provided false information under oath.we were provided false information as to the answers to interrogatories.coppola pressed this attack in his questioning of gilberti 
q you did file an accounting.yes,you did.but you made false statements,did you not 
the court very strong words,coppola.you better be very careful.
the witness i am really tired of your accusations,joe.i going to tell you that right now.
the court let 
the witness i a good attorney.i done nothing wrong.
whereupon,the witness breaks down.
after the trial,the court entered judgment for the defendants and issued an order to show cause why coppola should not be disciplined for the conduct described above.after receiving briefing,the court held that sanctions are warranted because of the heedless and unnecessary damage inflicted on attorney gilberti reputation.balerna,at.the court admonished coppola under federal rule of civil procedure b for his conduct,but it did not impose any sanction beyond the admonishment itself.coppola appealed.
ii.analysis 
we review for abuse of discretion a decision of the district court imposing sanctions under rule.cooter gell hartmarx,d,superseded in part on other grounds by.c.as the standard implies,we give deference to the court decision.m√©ndez aponte bonilla,cir.here,the district court did not abuse its discretion in admonishing coppola for the accusations he made concerning conversion,usury,and false statements.
conversion 
coppola claim that gilberti converted funds was never supported by any evidence the mortgage agreement clearly permitted gilberti to spend foreclosure proceeds to defend the drowne suit,and any reasonable attorney would have understood that although gilberti had been named in her individual capacity in the drowne action,her presence as a defendant was related solely to her capacity as the attorney for the lewis estate.balerna,at.these facts should have been obvious to coppola before trial.nevertheless,coppola allowed this claim to proceed to judgment while impugning gilberti integrity.coppola claims that sanctions were not warranted because he relied in good faith on in re hilson,a case in which an attorney was disciplined for sending funds to his client when those funds were supposed to be held in escrow for another party.see protective life ins.dignity viatical settlement partners,cir but though that claim lacked merit,it was not so plainly unmeritorious as to warrant the imposition of sanctions.coppola could not reasonably have relied on this case because,unlike the attorney in hilson,gilberti had an explicit contractual right to spend the foreclosure proceeds as she did.see hilson,at.
coppola allegation that gilberti violated the criminal usury statute was frivolous.coppola claims that he reasonably relied on two cases,begelfer najarian,and focus investment associates,american title insurance,cir.in begelfer,the supreme judicial court of massachusetts ordered the recomputation of attorneys fees payable under a contract that violated the usury statute for reasons unrelated to attorneys fees.at.begelfer has no application here because the usury statute applies to lenders making loans,not to attorneys such as gilberti,charging fees.as the court pointed out to coppola,if his interpretation of the usury statute were correct,any attorney charging a contingency fee in a foreclosure matter would be guilty of crimin
