background 
in april,the acting executive director of the board brought before the board a second amended accusation the accusation against licensed chiropractor kifle thompson,seeking revocation or suspension of her license in accordance with section,subdivision b,of the chiropractic act and the administrative adjudication provisions for formal hearing set out in the administrative procedure act apa see,subd.a.this accusation charged kifle thompson with unprofessional conduct within the meaning of california code of regulations,title,section,subdivisions e,k,l,m,p,and q hereafter section 
more specifically,the accusation alleged kifle thompson was the wife of former licensed chiropractor steven thompson,and she had been employed at chiropractic clinics he had owned and operated in monterey county.in thompson was convicted of seven misdemeanor violations of insurance code section,subdivision a presentation of false or fraudulent claim for workers compensation,and in the board had revoked his chiropractic license based on evidence of insurance fraud relating to his conviction.kifle thompson allegedly,and in connection with thompson,owned,managed,and controlled a number of business entities described collectively as the thompson affiliated clinics.
the accusation set out separate causes or allegations of unprofessional conduct.these instances of unprofessional conduct arose from the creation by thompson and kifle thompson of several sham professional medical corporations each of which was ostensibly owned and directed by a licensed physician,but was in fact effectively owned,managed,and controlled by management corporations created and operated by thompson and kifle thompson thompson and kifle thompson,through these management corporations,professional medical corporations,and affiliated chiropractic clinics,presented to the public,insurers,and other third parties the appearance that they were properly constituted to provide both medical and chiropractic services,and engaged in a scheme to submit fraudulent and excessive claims for the payment of workers compensation and other health benefits.
the accusation noted that these same activities had resulted in an action for civil penalties instituted in in monterey county against thompson,kifle thompson,and the corporations they had formed.the trial court in that case found these defendants had violated insurance code section,subdivision b,by submitting fraudulent claims for compensation proscribed by penal code section,and imposed civil penalties against them in the total amount of.the sixth district court of appeal upheld this judgment in 
the accusation in this matter against kifle thompson was tried by an administrative law judge alj in alameda county.the alj during days of hearings over six months in,heard testimony and accepted numerous exhibits submitted by both the board and kifle thompson.see,subd.a,subd.c,subd.a,subd.a,subd.a.on december,the alj issued her proposed decision in favor of kifle thompson.see,subd.c.
in april the board issued a notice of its nonadoption of the alj proposed decision.see,subd.c e.two months later the board set a date for submitting written argument in the matter.see,subd.c e ii.kifle thompson submitted a written argument to the board dated july.the board,after review of the transcripts of the alj hearing and the exhibits presented to the alj,and consideration of the parties written arguments,made its final decision after nonadoption of the proposed decision it sustained a number of the accusation allegations of unprofessional conduct.on august,the board sent kifle thompson a copy of this final decision,effective september,together with notice of its disciplinary action revoking her license as of that date.see.
on september,kifle thompson filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate,contending essentially that the board had exceeded its jurisdiction,failed to provide a fair trial,and had abused its discretion in that its decision was not supported by the evidence.see code civ,subd.b.in an order dated august,the trial court denied the petition based on an independent review of the evidence.see code civ,subd.c.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review 
a writ of administrative mandate is available for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken,and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal code civ,subd.a.the trial court inquiry in such a case extend s to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without,or in excess of,jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.code civ,subd.b.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.
when it is claimed the findings are not supported by the evidence,and the trial court,as here,is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.code civ,subd.c.in such a case our review on appeal is limited.we will sustain the trial court findings if they are supported by substantial evidence.kazensky city of merced th,d see also moran board of medical examiners cal d.in reviewing the evidence,we resolve all conflicts in favor of the party prevailing in the superior court and must give that party the benefit of every reasonable inference in support of the judgment.kazensky,supra,at,d.
implicit in the foregoing standard of review is the trial court authority,when conducting an independent review,to reweigh the evidence and make its own findings.levingston retirement board th,d.as noted above,the trial court in this case simply denied kifle thompson petition,essentially rejecting her contention that the board findings were not supported by the evidence.in doing so,the trial court effectively adopted the board findings,and hence it is board findings we must examine to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence.
finally,we review independently kifle thompson other claims,that the board exceeded its jurisdiction or failed to afford a fair trial.see twc storage,llc state water resources control bd.th,d.
b.the board findings 
the board final decision included the following general findings.the board granted kifle thompson a chiropractic license in,after she received a doctor of chiropractic dc degree that year.she began working for thompson in his chiropractic clinic in salinas later that year.they married the following year.in august kifle thompson opened her own chiropractic clinic in seaside,using the same name clinica quiropractica guadalupe cqg as that used by thompson for his clinic in salinas.
in both thompson and kifle thompson attended a seminar involving the creation of a professional medical corporation authorized to provide both chiropractic and medical services commonly termed an md dc corporation.see,subd.a,fn,ante.soon afterward thompson incorporated an md dc corporation called the peninsula medical group pmg.
thompson arranged for charles salzberg,a physician with a practice in hawaii but licensed to practice in both hawaii and california,to be the physician owner of pmg.under this arrangement,salzberg was pmg president,director,and sole shareholder of record,while thompson acted as pmg secretary.however,the documents drafted by thompson and signed by salzberg included one giving thompson all banking authority for pmg,as the sole signatory for its bank accounts.another document,signed by salzberg and undated,tendered his resignation as president and director,which salzberg understood to allow thompson to terminate their relationship at any time.thompson,in turn,signed a document in which pmg agreed to indemnify salzberg for any losses or liabilities resulting from his status as sole shareholder of record.salzberg further signed a consulting agreement providing that pmg would pay him a monthly consulting fee of in return for his periodic review of and submission of recommendations concerning pmg business policies,procedures,and administration.
by this arrangement salzberg effectively agreed to act as pmg absentee owner.he understood that he had no actual role either in pmg operations or its profit distribution these would be controlled by thompson through a management corporation.additionally,salzberg oversight of the professional services provided by pmg was minimal he saw patients at pmg only twice,in the course of visits he made in march and may of,and otherwise merely discussed with thompson the prospect of hiring other physicians.while he was owner of pmg,salzberg never received any compensation other than his monthly consulting fee and payment for the medical services he provided in march and may of.
thompson became corporate secretary of practice management systems pms soon after its incorporation in nevada in november.during the period of november to november,pms corporate filings showed that thompson acted as president,treasurer,and director,while kifle thompson acted as secretary.
pmg began operating at the site of thompson clinic in seaside and kifle thompson clinic in salinas in late or early.pmg began an arrangement with pms for the latter to provide management services,which included the provision of nonprofessional employees and payroll and management of the facilities,equipment and supplies,whereas pmg handled the professional staff payroll.thompson and kifle thompson,acting for pmg,hired physicians to work at the seaside and salinas clinics.one of these,julius mueller,interviewed with both thompson and kifle thompson,and was hired for pmg under a physician consulting contract that paid by the hour.
in february,salzberg signed an application to obtain a fictitious name permit from the medical board of california.the application stated he was sole shareholder,director,president and of pmg,and sought to use pmg,professional corporation,as a fictitious name at the address of thompson clinic in salinas.the application answered yes to the question whether the medical practice was wholly owned and entirely controlled by the application signatory,and listed salzberg,mueller,and another physician as the medical licensees who would be practicing under the fictitious name.it appeared the application had been filled out by thompson,and listed him as the contact person it was unknown whether the application was ever filed with the medical board.
at some point kifle thompson began acting as pmg secretary,at thompson request.she submitted paperwork to the state and probably signed checks on behalf of pmg.thompson signed the salary checks she received from pmg.the board found that kifle thompson testimony as to her involvement with pmg that she just saws sic patients was inconsistent with testimony given in a deposition,in which she stated she and thompson were responsible for billings,all of which were done at the castorville office.it further found appellant hearing testimony inconsistent with thompson deposition testimony,in which he stated m y wife and i handled the billing.
at the site of the seaside and salinas clinics,patients were given a choice of seeing a chiropractor or a physician when the latter was scheduled to work at the clinic.chiropractic patients were all seen by pmg,unless they were on medicare or medi cal,in which case they would be seen by cqg,which was an authorized provider for medicare and medi cal.although patients were charged the same by pmg and cqg,medicare and medi cal reimbursed a lower amount kifle thompson sometimes charged cqg patients on a sliding scale,in some cases only.
salzberg resigned from pmg in november,after questions were raised about pmg workers compensation billings for employees of monterey mushrooms.see fn,ante.he testified he regret ed his involvement with pmg as an absentee owner with no control over clinic operations.pmg ceased to provide professional services on january.on that date kifle thompson signed a document assigning all of pmg patient files,contracts for professional licenses,service agreements,equipment leases,and outstanding accounts receivable to integrated family medical group ifmg.the document identified kifle thompson as secretary of both ifmg and pmg.
kifle thompson had incorporated ifmg,a professional corporation,in september.its address was the same as that of her clinic in seaside,and a joseph greenspan,a california licensed physician residing in texas,was listed as its president,director,and sole shareholder.kifle thompson was listed as ifmg secretary.greenspan had signed a document giving kifle thompson all banking authority as sole signatory on banking accounts,an undated document resigning his positions as president and director,and a consulting agreement under which ifmg was to pay him a consulting fee of annually.a statement filed with the secretary of state in september listed thompson as ifmg chief executive officer,with greenspan as director.kifle thompson was listed as chief financial officer and secretary of ifmg.kifle thompson stated she did not know how greenspan came to be owner of ifmg,but believed it was thompson who first communicated with him.
after ifmg replaced pmg in january,kifle thompson continued operations at her seaside clinic as before.pms provided the same management services to ifmg as it had to pmg.mueller was medical director of ifmg and continued seeing patients on a basis.kifle thompson oversaw the clinic operations.greenspan,according to her,appeared on two occasions to review patient records and mueller credentials.ifmg operated only a few months before greenspan died kifle thompson heard from thompson that attorneys for monterey mushrooms had contacted greenspan,who afterwards said he wanted to get out of ifmg.greenspan reportedly died from suicide.
in august thompson sold his cqg chiropractic clinic in salinas to another chiropractor.the purchase agreement involved both pms and pmg,and kifle thompson signed a number of the agreements.
in,kifle thompson incorporated seaside medical clinic smc,a professional corporation,which began operating at the address of her seaside clinic,in essentially the same manner that pmg and ifmg had operated.initially,mueller owned percent of smc shares,with kifle thompson owning percent.later mueller became sole owner and president,with kifle thompson acting as smc secretary.in august,universal medical management umm began providing management services to smc in the same manner that pms had provided such services to pmg and ifmg.umm was incorporated in nevada,and a document filed in that state in october listed thompson as president and director and kifle thompson as secretary and treasurer for the period of august to august.thompson worked at smc in an administrative capacity,performing a number of functions not related to patient care.
in march,kifle thompson closed her clinic in seaside and both smc and cqg ceased operation.
following these general findings,the board final decision noted the civil judgment against kifle thompson,thompson,pmg,ifmg,pms,and other defendants,and the fact that thompson and kifle thompson had filed for bankruptcy in face of that judgment.see fn,ante.the board declined to adopt the findings of the civil judgment,because a higher standard of proof applied in any disciplinary proceeding.
addressing the specific allegations of unprofessional conduct against kifle thompson,the board found of these allegations were not supported by clear and convincing evidence.it sustained,however,the remaining allegations of unprofessional conduct under section,subdivisions e,k,l,m,p,and q.see fn,ante,and accompanying text.
kifle thompson had engaged in unprofessional conduct as an individual and by and through her capacity as an owner and officer of various entities including pmg and ifmg operated sham md dc corporations with medical doctors as ostensible owners,that presented to the public as full service medical centers.in fact,the medical doctors were a series of absentee figureheads who gave no consideration for their ownership interests and for the most part had no meaningful role in the direction of patient care or general clinic operation.kifle thompson,based on her role as an owner and officer of pmg and ifmg,exercised actual dominion and control over these entities,in violation of the law requiring a medical doctor control such professional corporations.she and thompson created a sophisticated,formalized and strategy that was formed with the interest of maximizing profits by deceiving patients,payors,the workers compensation system,the public,and state and federal government.the board found that,while the idea of this strategy may have originated with thompson,kifle thompson was clearly involved in the business arrangement as an officer of pmg and ifmg,and she was involved in the finances of these corporations and their arrangement with pms,and had worked with thompson to circumvent limitations on reimbursement.
kifle thompson engaged in unprofessional conduct when she conspired with others,including thompson and several doctors,to form sham corporations for the sole purpose of creating a system whereby she and thompson could defraud the workers compensation system and insurers.rejecting her testimony to the contrary,the board found kifle thompson was an active participant in this fraudulent scheme,and was responsible for billings and other business transaction s related to the fraudulent scheme.
as an officer of pmg,kifle thompson participated in specific instances of fraudulent and misleading unbundled billings relating to one patient during the period between october and january.these billings were submitted in a manner designed to circumvent workers compensation rules that limit reimbursement to four procedures or modalities in a single visit,and to prevent the accurate cascading of reimbursement by which workers compensation claims are reimbursed at percent of the maximum allowable fee for highest valued procedure or modality,at percent for the next highest,at percent for the third highest,and at percent for the fourth highest.the board found it irrelevant,either that the patient was seen by thompson and not kifle thompson,or that kifle thompson was not listed as an owner of pmg,because thompson and kifle thompson were de facto owners the physician owner received only a nominal payment.
as an officer of pmg,kifle thompson,together with thompson,was responsible for its billings she participated in a specific instance of upcoding,wherein pmg billed for treatment of a patient in october and december by using an improper code in order to obtain reimbursement at a higher rate.
the board concluded that,while it had not sustained all allegations,those which it had sustained were extremely serious.conceding kifle thompson had presented some evidence in mitigation the board found her conduct during the alj hearing showed a woeful lack of candor,insight,and honesty.she repeatedly testified she was unable to recall significant events such as filing an appeal in the civil case and being served an accusation by the board,and the board viewed this behavior as aggravating evidence it considered in determining the appropriate disciplinary action.kifle thompson had conspired with others to defraud the workers compensation system by setting up sham medical corporations,to engage in a pattern of insurance fraud that circumvented reimbursement limits,and had shown no remorse or insight whatsoever regarding her illegal conduct the board concluded the appropriate disciplinary action was to revoke her chiropractic license.
c.the board findings are supported by substantial evidence 
kifle thompson main contention on appeal is that the board abused its discretion in that its decision was not supported by the evidence.specifically,she challenges the findings of the board made in connection with the allegations of unprofessional conduct that it sustained.she reasons these findings show only that she was somehow involved in the business arrangement,was a corporate officer,and was involved in the finances of the medical corporations and management corporations created by thompson,but they fail to establish thereby that she engaged in unprofessional conduct within the meaning of section,subdivisions e,k,l,m,p,or q.the challenged findings further fail to establish why the medical corporations were sham or why the billings made by or on behalf of these corporations were fraudulent.kifle thompson asserts these findings fail to establish that she did anything with respect to the specific billings of patients she never saw or treated.the findings also fail to establish that the unbundling or upcoding was illegal or fraudulent.
we observe,however,that kifle thompson has not challenged the general findings made in the board final decision.these findings,summarized above,are unquestionably supported by the evidence,and provide,in turn,substantial support for the findings kifle thompson has challenged.the board reasonably inferred kifle thompson was indeed clearly involved in the billing,finances,and business arrangements of pmg,ifmg,smc,and the two management companies.the general conclusions of the board show the medical corporations were,in fact,sham creations in violation of state law in that they were not actually owned and controlled by physicians.instead,thompson and kifle thompson exercised actual control and de facto ownership.perhaps most importantly they demonstrate kifle thompson actually participated in the billing practices of these corporations,and moreover shared responsibility as a corporate officer for these corporations billing practices,regardless of whether she treated a particular patient as to whom billings were made.
in addition to the facts established by the general,unchallenged findings,there was extensive testimony at the alj hearing,particularly that of expert witness michael stahl,indicating that kifle thompson and thompson,through the sham medical corporations and management corporations,engaged in a pattern or scheme of fraudulent or excessive billing in violation of the chiropractic standard of care.this same testimony supports the challenged findings related to specific instances of unbundled or upcoded billing involving particular patients,indicating these billings contained fraudulent misrepresentations designed to maximize profits by circumventing reimbursement limits established by the workers compensation system and other health plan insurers.
in short,our review of the administrative record leads us to conclude without hesitation that the challenged findings are supported by substantial evidence.
d.the challenged findings are sufficient to support the board decision 
besides attacking the sufficiency of the evidence regarding particular board findings,kifle thompson argues the challenged findings fail to satisfy the requirement articulated by the supreme court as one implicit in code of civil procedure section that a final administrative decision set forth findings to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order.topanga for a scenic community county of los angeles cal d,topanga.she further urges the board conclusions fail to satisfy government code section,which details the requirements for a written decision in an administrative adjudicative proceeding subject to the apa.kifle thompson suggests the challenged findings are inadequate on these grounds because they lack specificity of facts and analysis.
in a separate but similar argument,kifle thompso
