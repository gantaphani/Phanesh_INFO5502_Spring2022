on july,the california state bar court the state bar court found that miguel gadda,repeatedly failed to perform legal services competently.it placed gadda on involuntary inactive status and recommended that gadda be disbarred.
this opinion and order relate to two federal proceedings resulting from the state bar court recommendation.in the first,gadda appeals an order of the united states district court for the northern district of california,which denies gadda motion to preliminarily enjoin the board of immigration appeals bia decision to suspend him from practice based on his suspension by the state bar court.gadda ashcroft.gadda asserts that the state bar court can not affect his right to practice before the bia.the other proceeding is a disciplinary action initiated by this court after we received notice of gadda suspension from practice by the state bar court.in re gadda.
gadda argues that any reciprocal discipline imposed by the bia or by this court based on the state bar court suspension order is invalid because the supreme court of california lacked jurisdiction to discipline him.he claims that federal law preempts the states authority to regulate attorneys,like him,who practice only in the administration of immigration law and in the federal courts,but not in the state courts.because both of these proceedings involve the same underlying preemption issue,we consolidate them for opinion purposes only.
we conclude that federal law does not preempt the supreme court of california authority to suspend or disbar attorneys admitted to practice in california state courts.the supreme court of california discipline orders may serve as the basis for reciprocal disbarment actions by both the bia and this court.
we disbar gadda from the practice of law before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
gadda was admitted to the california state bar in.thereafter,he was admitted to practice law and became a member of the bar of the united states district court for the northern district of california,the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit,and the supreme court of the united states.he was also admitted to practice before the board of immigration appeals bia and was authorized to appear for clients before the bia and in all immigration courts throughout the united states.
california state court disciplinary proceedings 
on august,the review department of the california state bar court the review department affirmed the state bar court decision recommending gadda disbarment and placing him on involuntary inactive status.in re gadda,wl,at.on january,the supreme court of california ordered that gadda be disbarred from the practice of law in california,effective february.in re gadda,d,cal.
the review department opinion surveyed gadda history of federal immigration practice,concluding that disbarment is warranted under the circumstances for the protection of the public,the courts,and the legal profession.in re gadda,wl,at.the review department cited seventeen acts of misconduct extending over six years and involving eight federal immigration client matters and one client trust account matter.this misconduct included gadda failure to appear at scheduled court conferences and to keep clients apprised of the proceedings and relevant court dates.five of gadda clients were ordered deported in absentia and at least six courts found gadda to have provided ineffective assistance.the review department concluded that gadda failed to perform legal services competently,demonstrated indifference toward rectification of or atonement for the consequences of his misconduct,and significantly harmed clients.id.at see id.at discussing gadda misconduct.the review department determined that aggravating factors,including prior discipline for similar misconduct in,see gadda state bar,cal d,any mitigating factors gadda presented.id.at.
we incorporate by reference that portion of the review board opinion which inventories gadda incompetence between and.of the eight federal immigration client matters which the review board describes,that of the saba family is especially egregious.
the four minor saba children applied for political asylum.after the ins denied their application,the children retained gadda to represent them.gadda advised the children to withdraw their asylum claim the immigration judge ij ordered that they voluntarily depart from the united states.
thereafter,the children parents became naturalized citizens.the children were eligible for priority consideration of their application for adjustment of status to legal residency or citizenship based on their parents naturalization.however,as a result of gadda neglect and incompetence,the children were deprived of an adjustment of their immigration status,and ultimately were placed in deportation proceedings.
gadda moved for a stay of the children deportation.in the course of a hearing on that motion,gadda left the saba family unrepresented before an immigration officer.gadda also directed the children to sign a statement promising they would voluntarily depart once the stay expired.the immigration court granted the stay but the children did not depart as promised.gadda assured the children that he was appealing the earlier bia decision.
because gadda negligently allowed the time for an appeal from the bia to this court to lapse,he was forced to seek habeas corpus relief before the district court.gadda directed william gardner,an attorney gadda employed on a contract basis but did not supervise,to file the habeas petition.before gardner filed the habeas petition,the ij ordered the saba children to be deported on account of their refusal to depart voluntarily at the expiration of the stay.gadda once again advised the children not to comply with the court order.
gardner subsequently filed the habeas petition and the district court ordered a hearing.the district court made a suasponte finding of ineffective assistance by gadda and remanded the matter to the immigration court to reopen the deportation hearing.saba ins,d.by the time the case was heard,two of the saba children were no longer minors.gadda has not refunded the the saba children paid him.
regarding the saba matter,the review department agreed with the state bar that gadda recklessly and repeatedly fail ed to perform legal services and failed to refund unearned fees promptly upon termination.in re gadda,wl,at.specifically,the review department found gadda performance incompetent in the following ways 
by leaving the children alone,unrepresented,in the middle of a hearing before an immigration officer and advising them to sign a voluntary departure form by failing to advise the saba children to depart on or before the deadline by failing to timely move to reopen deportation proceedings by failing to file a petition for review with the ninth circuit by failing to file for adjustment of status after saba became a naturalized citizen and instead filing for adjustment of status on the children last day to depart voluntarily,approximately three months later and by failing to supervise gardner in filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.
gadda ashcroft,from bia disciplinary proceedings 
based on the state bar court order,on october,the bia suspended gadda from practice before the bia,the immigration courts,and the department of homeland security dhs,formerly the immigration and naturalization service ins gadda unsuccessfully sought a preliminary injunction of the bia action in the district court.see gadda ashcroft,wl.gadda appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction to this court.we deferred submission pending the outcome of disciplinary proceedings before the bia.see gadda ashcroft,cir,order.
meanwhile,the office of general counsel for the executive office for immigration review eoir initiated disciplinary proceedings and an adjudicatory official suspended gadda indefinitely from practice on august.on july,the bia dismissed gadda appeal and ordered him expelled from practice before the bia,the immigration courts,and the dhs.in re gadda,i n,bia 
ninth circuit disciplinary proceedings,
on may,pursuant to ninth circuit rule c,we ordered gadda to resign from the ninth circuit bar or show cause why he should not be suspended or disbarred based on the california state bar court order placing him on involuntary inactive status and recommending that he be disbarred.gadda responded and we referred the case to the appellate commissioner.see cir.f.on september,the appellate commissioner stayed the disciplinary proceedings pending a decision by the supreme court of california on the state bar court recommendation or a decision by us in gadda ashcroft.
following the supreme court of california january,order disbarring gadda,the appellate commissioner again ordered gadda to resign from the bar of the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit or show cause why he should not be suspended or disbarred.gadda requested a stay,claiming that the supreme court of california disbarment order was not final and that we should first resolve gadda ashcroft,
the appellate commissioner conducted a hearing on march,and filed a report and recommendation on may.the appellate commissioner recommends that gadda be disbarred from the practice of law before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit.
membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.an attorney is received into that ancient fellowship for something more than private gain.he becomes an officer of the court,and,like the court itself,an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice.in re snyder,d quoting people ex rel.karlin culkin,internal quotations and alterations omitted.we have both statutory and inherent power to suspend or disbar an attorney who has been admitted to this court bar.
federal rule of appellate procedure frap regulates attorney conduct,including admission to the bar of the ninth circuit and the conditions for suspension and disbarment.frap provides that a member of this court bar is subject to suspension or disbarment if the member either has been suspended or disbarred from practice in any other court or is guilty of conduct unbecoming a member of the court bar.fed.b a 
reciprocal discipline 
in this case,gadda suspension and disbarment from the practice of law in california forms the basis for his disbarment from the bia and this court.gadda argues that such reciprocal discipline is inappropriate because the supreme court of california did not have jurisdiction to discipline him.
we are not conclusively bound by the state bar court suspension of gadda or the supreme court of california disbarment.in re kramer,cir in re rosenthal,cir per curium.we independently examine the state bar court proceeding kramer,at.we will extend great deference to the state court determination unless our independent review reveals one of the following conditions a lack of due process insufficient proof of attorney misconduct or some other grave reason exist s that should prevent the court from recognizing the state court determination.id.citing selling radford.see also kramer,at.
gadda bears the burden of demonstrating,through clear and convincing evidence,that one of the above selling conditions exists.kramer,at.we presume the correctness of the state bar court factual findings.rosenthal,at.
gadda does not argue directly that any of the selling conditions existed in the california proceedings instead,he argues more generally that the supreme court of california did not have jurisdiction to disbar him.gadda contends that he practices only federal immigration law and that congress has granted exclusive authority to the united states attorney general to discipline attorneys who appear before the bia,immigration courts,and the dhs.he argues that federal law preempts a state authority to discipline or regulate the conduct of attorneys who,like him,practice exclusively in the immigration or federal courts and,accordingly,the supreme court of california lacked jurisdiction to disbar him.gadda preemption argument lacks merit 
we apply a presumption against federal preemption unless the state attempts to regulate an area in which there is a history of significant federal regulation.see ting,cir.gadda does not contend that attorney discipline is such an area.in fact,the opposite is true.the supreme court of the united states has long recognized that the several states have an important interest in regulating the conduct of the attorneys whom they license.see middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d see also theard,d the two judicial systems of courts,the state judicatures and the federal judiciary,have autonomous control over their officers.matter of abrams,cir recognizing the absolute and unfettered power of the federal courts to admit and discipline members of its bar independently and separately from admission and disciplinary procedures of the state courts.
federal law may preempt state law in three ways express preemption field preemption and conflict preemption.see ting,at.
express preemption occurs when congress enacts a statute that expressly commands that state law on the particular subject is displaced.id.gadda does not contend that any such statute exists.
field preemption occurs when the federal statutory scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to infer that congress left no room for supplementary regulation by the states.see id.at.in this case,gadda argues that the regulation of immigration attorneys in california is comprehensively covered by the federal regulatory scheme governing attorney conduct before the bia,immigration courts,and the dhs.gadda claims that this federal scheme leaves no room for additional attorney regulation by california.the federal regulations provide that an attorney may represent a person in immigration proceedings only if the attorney is a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any state and is not under any order of any court suspending,enjoining,restraining,disbarring,or otherwise restricting him in the practice of law.a e,f.beyond merely leaving room for supplementary state regulation,the immigration regulations condition an attorney ability to practice in immigration court on the attorney good standing as a member of the bar of a state court.
we observe that the immigration regulations expressly allow for supplementary state regulation.for example,absent good cause,the bia must immediately suspend an attorney who has been disbarred or suspended from practice on an interim or permanent basis by the highest court of any state,territory,the district of columbia,or any federal court.a.an immigration attorney also has a duty to inform the eoir if he or she has been disbarred or suspended by the highest court of any state or territory,or by a federal court.c.a final order of disbarment or suspension by a state or territory or federal court constitutes a rebuttable presumption that disciplinary sanctions should be imposed by the bia.b see c ii,e.
the immigration regulations thus promote reliance on and cooperation with the states,territories,and federal courts.they seek to ensure that qualified attorneys practice before the bia,immigration courts,and the dhs,and that their standards for practice are not contrary to the applicable disciplinary rules of other jurisdictions.the federal immigration regulatory scheme does not occupy the field of discipline for immigration attorneys.
gadda maintains nonetheless that the interpretation of the applicable regulations by the attorney general acts to preempt the field.gadda cites the following statement by the attorney general regarding the most recent amendments to the federal regulations controlling the attorney discipline system in the bia and immigration courts 
it is imperative that eoir and the service administer a uniform disciplinary system among the respective immigration courts.for the reasons explained in ssa social security administration supplementary information to their disciplinary rule,eoir and the service should not be expected or required to apply numerous local rules,or local interpretations of the rules,to problems that require national uniformity.applying local rules or local interpretations in lieu of a national standard would leave immigration attorneys in one state subject to discipline,while possibly exempting immigration attorneys in another state.eoir and the service do not believe that it would benefit the board,the immigration courts,the service,the public,or attorneys to promote inconsistency in regulating the conduct of practitioners,who all practice before the same forum.
professional conduct for practitioners rules and procedures,june.
contrary to gadda assertion,the attorney general statement merely clarifies that the regulations are designed to implement uniform,nationwide rules of professional conduct for attorneys who practice before the immigration courts it does not relate to state oversight of that same conduct,nor does it posit that agency oversight is the sole means of regulating immigration attorney conduct.moreover,the statement goes on to further refute gadda interpretation by explaining the necessary cooperation between the federal immigration disciplinary process and that of the states 
eoir and the service anticipate working closely with the various state bars when investigating disciplinary complaints cooperation between the federal government and the state bar disciplinary authorities will optimize resources and minimize duplication of investigations.in general,state bars have not been resistant to the federal government efforts to assist in protecting the public by scrutinizing the professional conduct of attorneys.
gadda presents no evidence that the attorney general has intended,through the applicable regulations,to preempt the field of attorney discipline for immigration attorneys.
the third way in which federal law may preempt state law is through conflict preemption.see ting,at.preemption may be inferred if there is an actual conflict between federal and state law,or where compliance with both is impossible.
gadda points to no conflict between california professional conduct rules and the federal regulations for immigration attorneys.the federal regulations clearly contemplate a state scheme and incorporate the results of state disciplinary proceedings into its disciplinary scheme.the two schemes do not conflict.gadda fails to show that federal regulation of attorneys before the immigration courts preempts state regulation of attorneys by express,field,or conflict preemption.see,berger cuyahoga county bar ass n,cir.because the supreme court of california had jurisdiction to disbar gadda,the reciprocal disbarments by the bia and this court are valid.
conduct unbecoming 
even if the california courts had not acted to disbar gadda,we have independent authority to suspend or disbar him from practice before the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit pursuant to frap b b.conduct unbecoming a member of the bar of the ninth circuit is sufficient cause for disbarment.unlike some of our sister circuits,the ninth circuit has not adopted local rules elaborating on frap conduct unbecoming standard.cir.a.the supreme court has held that conduct unbecoming is conduct contrary to professional standards that show an unfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or courts,or conduct inimical to the administration of justice.snyder,at.we have consistently found conduct unbecoming where an attorney failed to prosecute an appeal with due diligence.see,matter of withey,cir ordering suspension for failure to prosecute appeal matter of young,cir threatening to suspend or disbar attorney for failure to prosecute the appeal with due diligence in re margolin,cir holding that undue delay in filing of appeal warrants discharge from further representation,imposition of fine,and indefinite suspension united states ferrara,cir per curiam fining attorney for failure to prosecute appeal with due diligence pursuant to rule c in re chandler,cir suspending attorney for three years after first offence of gross negligence,which included the failure to perfect client appeal and protect claim from default united states smith,cir ordering suspension for failure to prosecute.intentional conduct is not necessary for discipline under frap lack of diligence that impairs the deliberations of the court is sufficient.dcd programs,leighton,cir.
because we have jurisdiction over appeals from the immigration courts,the quality of the practice by attorneys appearing before the immigration courts is crucial to our ability to administer justice and function effectively.the quality of our review is heavily dependent on the record established in administrative immigration hearings,which in turn is dependent on the competence of the at
