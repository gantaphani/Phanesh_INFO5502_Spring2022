after a real estate transaction went awry,the parties thereto,represented by separate counsel,entered into a settlement agreement.later,one of the parties agreed to advance settlement monies to another of the parties,but did not want to incur legal fees in connection with the documentation of the loan.consequently,the borrower asked his law firm to prepare a promissory note documenting the terms to which he and the lender had already agreed.the law firm did so and sent the document directly to the borrower.the borrower and the lender themselves then negotiated an addendum to the promissory note the borrower did not request assistance from his counsel.ultimately,the deal gone awry got worse.the borrower sued the other parties to the settlement agreement on various causes of action arising out of it.included in the complaint was one cause of action for usury,based on the promissory note.
the law firm that prepared the promissory note was also the one that filed the complaint on behalf of the borrower.the lender filed a motion to disqualify that law firm,contending it could not take a position adverse to him,as a former client,and also could not prepare a promissory note and then turn around and sue upon it as being illegal.the trial court denied the motion.the lender appeals,dropping the assertion that he was ever a client of the law firm that prepared the promissory note,and alleging instead the violation of ethical rules and the appearance of impropriety.
his arguments are unavailing.the lender has not demonstrated that the law firm violated state bar rules of professional conduct,rule as he asserts,and american bar association model rules of professional conduct,rule a upon which he also relies,has not been adopted in california.moreover,to the extent the law firm actions may or may not give rise to an appearance of impropriety,that does not mean the firm must be disqualified.appearance of impropriety is not the test for disqualification of counsel in california.finally,we can not hold that when a law firm prepares a legal document and later discovers that a provision therein may violate the law,the law firm must be disqualified,as a matter of law,from representing its client in a lawsuit that challenges the validity of the offending provision.we affirm.
factsa.operating and settlement agreements 
on august,todd kurtin kurtin,bruce elieff elieff and hetos investments,a california limited partnership,entered into an operating agreement pertaining to suncal of northern california,llc,a delaware limited liability company scnc.the purpose of the operating agreement was to acquire and develop a number of northern california real estate projects.in pursuing those projects,the parties apparently faced certain travails.on march,hetos investments,david hetos hetos,jewett pacific cwc,kurtin and elieff entered into a settlement agreement with respect to the operating agreement.the settlement agreement was made in order to i avoid litigation,ii restructure the parties relationship in scnc,iii ensure reimbursement to hetos investments,of certain expenses,iv allocate responsibility for certain liabilities,and v clarify the rights of the parties with respect to each of the p rojects.
gray cary ware freidenrich gray cary undertook the representation of hetos and hetos investments,in it continued to represent them in connection with the negotiation of the settlement agreement and the performance thereof,including the making of certain elections under the settlement agreement,in.voss,cook thel voss cook represented kurtin,elieff and cwc,in connection with the negotiation and drafting of both the operating agreement and the settlement agreement.it also represented them with regard to the settlement agreement performance issues.those two firms continue to represent their respective clients in this litigation.as an aside,voss cook admits to having represented kurtin,elieff and cwc,in connection with various unrelated matters.
promissory note 
according to hetos,as stated in his declaration,by spring,he had received only a fraction of the monies he had been projected to receive under the settlement agreement,and was in a difficult financial situation.as he further declared,mike mccook,a friend of his in the real estate industry,acted as an intermediary and requested kurtin to advance monies that were to be paid to hetos under the settlement agreement.according to hetos,kurtin insisted on being repaid for every advanced and would not agree to anything less.
kurtin version of the events is largely the same.his reply memorandum of points and authorities in connection with the disqualification motion explained the scenario thus in may hetos approached kurtin to ask for a loan.kurtin agreed to provide the requested money,but did not want to incur legal fees for preparing a promissory note.hetos told kurtin that he would have graycary draft the note at hetos s expense.
hetos,in his declaration,stated that once the parties had agreed to the terms of the promissory note,he contacted gray cary and asked the firm to document the terms in a promissory note.in his declaration,he also made clear that negotiations on the promissory note were conducted by mike mccook and himself,but that gray cary was not involved.hetos declared that the firm provided the promissory note directly to him and that it had no other involvement with the promissory note.
in his declaration,tannenbaum confirmed that hetos had requested gray cary to prepare a promissory note on the terms to which he and kurtin had agreed.he further stated that he had provided the promissory note directly to hetos and that the firm had had no other involvement with the promissory note.in addition,tannenbaum declared that his firm never had any discussions with kurtin regarding the promissory note.
ultimately,hetos executed a promissory note dated may.pursuant to that promissory note,kurtin agreed to lend hetos a maximum amount of,to be disbursed in monthly sums not to exceed.the promissory note required hetos to pay to kurtin a sum equal to all amounts advanced under the promissory note plus for each dollar advanced.the promissory note also contained language,which was crossed out by hand,stating that the holder thereof could demand payment once the total aggregate distributions to,or on behalf of,payor including,without limitation,any distributions made to walter hick pursuant to that certain settlement agreement and release dated march,equal or exceed.the promissory note provided no information concerning the identity of walter hick hick and no indication of when the described distributions under the settlement agreement would likely equal or exceed.
hetos also executed a may,addendum to the promissory note the addendum contained language appearing to supersede the promissory note provision concerning the time of repayment.instead of that provision,the addendum stated holder may make demand for payment of all amounts due under this note,at his discretion,once the aggregate distributions owed by payor to walt hick has been made.once again,the addendum gave no clue as to the identity of hick and did not specify the anticipated date for repayment.in addition to the language about the timing of repayment,the addendum permitted the holder of the promissory note to collect amounts payable thereunder directly from monies owing to hetos under the settlement agreement.
hetos declared that kurtin had prepared the addendum.in fact,kurtin had prepared two draft addenda to the promissory note.one of them was agreed upon as the final and signed.hetos further declared that he himself had faxed the executed promissory note and addendum back to kurtin directly,together with a personal letter.tannenbaum confirmed that gray cary had not had any involvement at all with the addendum.kurtin counsel acknowledged at oral argument on the motion to disqualify that kurtin had testified to having prepared the addendum.
hetos and hetos investments,filed suit against kurtin,elieff and cwc.the complaint contained causes of action arising out of the operating agreement and the settlement agreement and one cause of action pertaining to the promissory note.the causes of action relating to the operating agreement and the settlement agreement included fraud,conversion,breach of contract,breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,breach of fiduciary duty,and others.the cause of action on the promissory note was for usury.gray cary filed the complaint on behalf of hetos and hetos investments.
motion to disqualify 
voss cook,on behalf of kurtin,filed a motion to disqualify gray cary.the motion was based on the fact that gray cary had prepared the promissory note and turned around and filed a complaint containing a cause of action challenging the terms of the promissory note as being usurious.the lead argument was that gray cary had represented kurtin in the preparation of the promissory note,and that,in filing the complaint,it was acting adversely to its former client,kurtin,in contravention of rule c.kurtin also argued that gray cary should be disqualified because of an appearance of impropriety,inasmuch as the firm purportedly prepared a promissory note it knew to be illegal,caused him to enter into an illegal transaction,and then filed suit claiming the promissory note to be illegal.in support of this argument,he cited rules and.finally,kurtin asserted that gray cary should be disqualified because he would likely file a against the firm on account of its preparation of the purportedly illegal promissory note.
the declaration of kurtin was filed in support of the motion to disqualify.in the declaration,kurtin stated,inter alia,that gray cary was the only firm that had been involved in the negotiation or drafting of the promissory note and that his understanding was that gray cary had represented both hetos and himself in the transaction.he also said that no one at gray cary had disclosed to him that the promissory note violated california law or that he should seek independent counsel.yet nowhere in the declaration did kurtin state that he had ever had any type of communication whatsoever with anyone at gray cary concerning the matter.
at oral argument on the motion to disqualify,kurtin counsel said that gray cary had represented hetos in connection with the preparation of the promissory note.he also acknowledged that kurtin did not have a retainer agreement with gray cary and that there was no evidence to show that kurtin had ever had any contact with gray cary concerning the promissory note.the attorney further stated,however,that kurtin nonetheless believed that gray cary had represented him in connection with the promissory note.in addition,kurtin counsel explained his viewpoint that the existence of an relationship between gray cary and kurtin was not a predicate to disqualification,because there were other bases for disqualifying the firm.among them was the simple appearance of cary had prepared a promissory note and then filed suit thereon,claiming it was usurious.in addition,gray cary had purportedly violated certain ethical rules.
the court found that there was no relationship between gray cary and kurtin.it denied the motion for disqualification.
kurtin appeals.he does not now challenge the finding that there was no relationship between himself and gray cary.however,he continues to contend there remain other grounds for disqualification.
discussiona.standard of review 
the parties disagree as to the applicable standard of review in this matter.hetos contends the case must be reviewed for an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.kurtin argues that we should apply a de novo standard of review.both parties cite people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,cal th,d.
as stated in that case,generally,a trial court decision on a disqualification motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion.citations.if the trial court resolved disputed factual issues,the reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for the trial court express or implied findings supported by substantial evidence.citations.when substantial evidence supports the trial court factual findings,the appellate court reviews the conclusions based on those findings for abuse of discretion.citation.however,the trial court discretion is limited by the applicable legal principles.citation.thus,where there are no material disputed factual issues,the appellate court reviews the trial court determination as a question of law.citation.in any event,a disqualification motion involves concerns that justify careful review of the trial court exercise of discretion.citation.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems,supra,cal th at,d,accord,adams th,d.
on appeal,kurtin makes clear that he does not challenge the trial court finding that there was no relationship between himself and gray cary.he asks this court to review one issue,as a matter of law.that issue is whether gray cary must necessarily be disqualified for having prepared the promissory note and thereafter having filed a complaint which challenges the validity of the promissory note as violating the usury laws.as to this limited point,there are no material disputed factual issues.gray cary prepared the promissory note containing the interest provision.it also filed,on behalf of hetos and hetos investments,the complaint challenging that interest provision.whether this set of facts compels disqualification is a question we will review as a matter of law.see frazier superior court th,d.we apply a de novo standard of review.
kurtin argues that gray cary should be disqualified as a matter of law because it allegedly violated rule and model rule a by drafting a promissory note that it now contends is illegal.he also insists gray cary should be disqualified because its actions have created an appearance of impropriety.finally,kurtin contends the trial court order should be overturned because the court failed to make specific findings of fact and to demonstrate that it had considered appropriate factors in making its ruling.we shall address these issues in turn.
state bar rules of professional conduct,rule 
rule provides in pertinent part a member shall not advise the violation of any law unless the member believes in good faith that such law is invalid.according to kurtin,because gray cary admits to having documented the loan it now claims violates the usury laws and does not assert a belief that those laws are invalid,it violated rule as a matter of law.we disagree.
if there was a violation of the usury laws,a matter we do not decide,the violation was on the part of the individual seeking to collect interest at a usurious.yet kurtin concedes,for the purposes of the appeal,that gray cary did not represent him in connection with the documentation of the loan.since gray cary did not render legal advice to kurtin in connection with the loan,it did not advise him to violate the usury laws.the only person to whom gray cary rendered advice in connection with the promissory note would appear to be hetos.however,kurtin cites no legal authority for the proposition that gray cary violated rule by failing,if it did so fail,to advise its own client against paying an excessive interest rate,assuming the rate is indeed excessive.moreover,kurtin cites no legal authority for the proposition that it is illegal for an individual to agree to pay an interest rate that exceeds what the law permits the payee to demand.in sum,kurtin has not shown how gray cary violated rule in the rendering of legal advice.
kurtin disagrees with our interpretation of rule,to the extent we focus on the advice rendered to gray cary client,hetos.kurtin insists that the rule is not limited in application solely to advice rendered to clients.he emphasizes that the word client is not found in the rule.while that is correct,the rule does contain the word advise.in essence,the rule proscribes the rendering of certain advice.it presupposes that there is a recipient of the lawyer advice.kurtin has not explained how he can qualify as a party to whom gray cary rendered advice,so as to trigger the application of the rule.see fox pollack d.attorney did not render legal advice to nonclients who signed documents he prepared.
american bar association model rules of professional conduct,rule a 
kurtin says that even if gray cary did not render advice to him,so as to make rule applicable,model rule a must certainly apply.that model rule provides in pertinent part a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation will result in violation of the rules of professional conduct or other law as kurtin sees it,if gray cary is correct in its assertion that the promissory note violates applicable usury laws,then gray cary legal representation caused a violation of law.thus,argues kurtin,disqualification is warranted because gray cary actions violated model rule a.we can not agree.the issue of whether or not the promissory note is usurious has not yet been determined.only after that determination is made will it be known if the preparation of the promissory note resulted in the violation of law.
in addition,we underscore the fact that the aba model rules of professional conduct do not establish ethical standards in california,as they have not been adopted in california and have no legal force of their own.citations.state comp.ins.fund wps,th,d.even were this not the case,the violation of a model rule would not compel disqualification as a matter of law.inasmuch as a violation of a rule of the state bar rules of professional conduct does not necessarily compel disqualification gregori bank of america d,a fortiori a violation of a model rule would not do so.
appearance of impropriety 
gray cary,at the request of hetos,documented loan terms dictated by kurtin.kurtin now claims it creates an appearance of impropriety for gray cary to advocate on behalf of its own client that the terms kurtin demanded are usurious.worse,kurtin insists gray cary engaged in predatory lawyering,stating that the only motive gray cary could have had for drafting and transmitting a contract it knew contained illegal terms was to induce kurtin to violate the law by loaning money in reliance on the promissory note.
in urging disqualification,kurtin cites gregori bank of america,supra,d,which states that canon of the american bar association model code of professional responsibility hereinafter canon provides that a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of professional impropriety.id.at,fn.omitted.of course,california has not adopted canon,either in the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california or in the business and professions code nevertheless,the aba code still serves to guide california courts citations,which have adverted to canon or the appearance of impropriety standard in a variety of contexts.citations.see also neal health net,th,d.
for gray cary to prepare a promissory note and later file suit on behalf of its client challenging the validity of that promissory note may indeed create an appearance of impropriety.that does not,however,answer the question kurtin poses does that compel disqualification as a matter of law no.
as we recently stated in dch health services waite th,d,an appearance of impropriety by itself does not support a lawyer disqualification.citation.see also klein superior court d.despite the many references to the appearances standard in our case law,and despite occasional judicial statements that d isqualification is proper to avoid any appearance of impropriety citation,there is no california case in which an attorney has been disqualified solely on this basis.invariably,canon has been relied upon to disqualify counsel only where the appearance of impropriety arises in connection with a tangible dereliction.gregori bank of america,supra,d at,fn.omitted.however,the record before us contains no evidence of any tangible dereliction on gray cary part.
as explained in gregori bank of america,supra,d at pages.the case law and the legal literature persuade us that it is relatively unimportant whether the status or misconduct claimed to warrant disqualification is proscribed by a particular ethical norm or disciplinary rule or may be characterized as a failure to avoid the appearance of impropriety.since the purpose of a disqualification order must be prophylactic,not punitive,the significant question is whether there exists a genuine likelihood that the status or misconduct of the attorney in question will affect the outcome of the proceedings before the court.accord,koo rubio restaurants,th,d cal pak delivery,united parcel service,th,d but see in re complex asbestos litigation d.
in the case before us,the trial court,in ruling on the cause of action in the complaint,will need to decide whether the interest provision contained in the promissory note violates the usury laws.this determination is unlikely to be dependent upon facts related to gray cary involvement in the matter while it may be awkward for gray cary,having prepared the promissory note,to turn around and argue in a court of law that one of its provisions violates the usury laws,it is not apparent how it could affect the outcome of the proceedings whether the usury argument is made by gray cary or by replacement counsel following gray cary disqualification.inasmuch as the identity of the drafter of the promissory note would appear to be irrelevant to the determination of whether the provision in question is usurious,we can not see how the identity of the lawyer making the argument could somehow taint the outcome.
in an effort to prove that gray cary involvement will affect the outcome,kurtin latches onto certain language about fraud,contained in hetos pleadings.in the introduction to the complaint,hetos described a general scheme by which kurtin,elieff and cwc,purportedly set out to defraud him in connection with the real estate developments.among other things,he said to add insult to injury,and as further evidence of defendants fraudulent scheme,after defendants obtained plaintiff interest in the valuable real estate projects and deprived plaintiff of funds,one of the defendants then loaned plaintiff david hetos money which should have already been paid at an exorbitant and constitutionally prohibited interest rate.hetos made similar statements,about the promissory note as further evidence of fraud,in his memorandum of points and authorities in support of opposition to the disqualification motion and in his reply brief on appeal.
kurtin does not explain how it would negatively impact the outcome of the case,with respect to himself,if gray cary were to continue to press the argument that the promissory note it prepared is evidence of kurtin purportedly fraudulent scheme.as kurtin states,his best rebuttal to hetos claim that the promissory note itself is evidence of fraud is to show the jury that the promissory note was drafted by hetos s own counsel.that would indeed appear to be an argument favoring kurtin.thus,for gray cary to be in the uncomfortable position of arguing that the promissory note it prepared is evidence of kurtin fraud would not appear to be a reason why the outcome of the proceedings would be affected in any manner adverse to kurtin.moreover,we question how much less awkward it would be for new counsel to argue,on hetos behalf,that the promissory note hetos former counsel prepared is evidence of kurtin fraud.in any event,if there is prejudice arising out of gray cary continued involvement in the case,it would only be as to gray cary client and can not concern kurtin.
this is not a case where the outcome of the proceedings may be affected because the law firm the moving party seeks to disqualify has obtained confidential information that may be used to advantage against that party.see gregori bank of america,supra,d at.all we have here is an awkward situation,where a law firm actions may indeed create an appearance of impropriety.that notwithstanding,d isqualification is inappropriate simply to punish a dereliction that will likely have no substantial continuing effect on future judicial proceedings.citation.accord,koo rubio restaurants,supra,th at,d cal pak delivery,united parcel service,supra,th at,d.what kurtin really wants is for this court to apply the smell test.we have already rejected that test in smith,smith kring superior court th,d,wherein we stated that the smell test is not consonant with the current stat
