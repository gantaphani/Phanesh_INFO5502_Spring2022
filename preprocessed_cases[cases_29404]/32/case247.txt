the parties stipulated that respondent is guilty of violating rule g a lawyer shall not fail to respond,in writing,within established time periods,to any official inquiry by bar counsel or a disciplinary agency,when bar counsel or the agency is conducting an investigation into the lawyer conduct.
disciplinary recommendation.respondent used illegal substances for approximately six years,committed numerous felonies injured multiple clients,and engaged in professional misconduct that extended over a period.after considering the facts of the four cases,the referee recommended the sanction of disbarment,effective,nunc pro tunc,october,the date respondent was suspended due to his felony convictions.also,as a condition precedent to readmission to the florida bar,the referee recommended that respondent be required to pay restitution in the following amounts ermovick,smith,forbes,and mogulyan.further,the referee awarded costs to the bar of.
in considering the disciplinary recommendation,the referee noted that respondent is thirty years of age,was admitted to the florida bar in,and does not have any prior disciplinary history.next,the referee found that the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions indicate that disbarment is appropriate.see.stds.imposing law.sancs.failure to preserve the client property a lack of diligence failure to maintain personal integrity and duties owed as a professional.
with regard to aggravating factors,the referee found that respondent had a dishonest or selfish motive when he accepted payment for legal services never performed standard b engaged in a pattern of misconduct standard c committed multiple offenses standard d and engaged in obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency when he failed to respond to bar counsel letters requiring a response under rule g standard e.
as for mitigating factors,the referee found absence of a prior disciplinary record standard a inexperience in the practice of law standard f physical or mental disability or impairment standard h imposition of other penalties or sanctions standard k and remorse standard l.
respondent argued that his misconduct was directly related to drug addiction.the referee found that respondent presented mitigating evidence that he is addicted to gamma butyrolactone ghb and cocaine.however,respondent failed to present any evidence of addiction to the other two controlled substances that he also pled guilty to possessing,selling,and delivering the steroids methenolone and mesterolone.as a result,respondent did not overcome the presumption of disbarment for his felony conviction for the charges of possession,sale,and delivery of methenolone and mesterolone.disbarment is the presumed sanction for a single felony conviction.see.stds.imposing law.sancs.a.although case law demonstrates that respondents can overcome the presumption,respondent did not meet this burden.
next,respondent failed in his efforts to demonstrate interim rehabilitation,which is a mitigating factor under standard j.the referee considered the opinions of respondent psychiatric and addiction expert,seely,but found that seely opinions regarding respondent recovery were based upon only three hours of telephonic conversations that took place ten days prior to the final hearing.seely did not discuss respondent recovery with the professionals who were treating him in prison.seely did not even obtain copies of respondent treatment files from prison.thus,respondent failed to show current and reliable evidence of his rehabilitation program,addiction treatment,and progress.further,the referee expressed concern about respondent propensity to abuse substances in the future.respondent began abusing ghb,steroids,and cocaine when he was fully aware of the illegality of those substances.in fact,most of his use of those substances occurred after he was enrolled in law school or admitted to the florida bar.in addition,after his arrest in for the six felony charges of which he was eventually convicted,he continued to use ghb,steroids,and cocaine.thus,respondent failed to show interim rehabilitation.
on review.respondent petitions the court for review,arguing that the referee erred by concluding that addiction could not be considered as a mitigating factor for respondent steroid abuse the referee erred by not finding two additional mitigating factors and the referee recommended sanction of disbarment is not supported.
first,respondent asserts that the referee erred by concluding that addiction could not be considered as a mitigating factor for respondent abuse of the two steroids.the court has stated that a referee finding as to the existence or of a particular mitigator is considered a factual determination and is presumed correct and will be upheld unless clearly erroneous or lacking in evidentiary support.bar tauler,so d,quoting.bar hecker,so d.it is not enough for a party to point to contradictory evidence in the record if the record contains competent,substantial evidence to support the referee finding,the finding should not be disturbed.bar broome,so d.thus,the burden is on respondent to prove that the referee erred.respondent has failed to meet that burden.
the record supports the referee finding,which is that respondent did not present clear and convincing evidence of his addiction to the two steroids.before the referee,respondent concentrated on proving that he was addicted to ghb and cocaine.even when asked about his abuse of the two steroids,respondent testified that he used them because he believed they made him stronger and enhanced his.neither respondent nor seely testified that respondent was addicted to the two steroids.in fact,when bar co
