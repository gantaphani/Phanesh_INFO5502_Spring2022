we must decide whether a district court abused its discretion in denying a physician a preliminary injunction to halt his temporary suspension from california program based on his claims that such suspension violates federal medicaid law and is prohibited by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
medicaid is a cooperative program that authorizes the united states government to provide funds to participating states to administer medical assistance to individuals whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.the program operates by authorizing the federal government to pay a percentage of the costs a state incurs for patient care,and,in return,the state complies with certain federal requirements.see.administration of the program is entrusted to the secretary of health and human services hhs,who also has the authority to promulgate regulations under the medicaid act.california participates in medicaid through the california medical assistance program,and has designated its department of health care services dhcs or the department as the agency responsible for its administration.see id.a cal.welf.
eduardo guzman,is an who provides services through.sometime in,dhcs opened an investigation into certain claims guzman had submitted to for payment.on august,after several searches of his offices in downey and norwalk,california,dhcs filed an accusation against guzman alleging that he had imported large quantities of intrauterine devices iuds from mexico that had not been approved by the food and drug administration fda for use in this country that he had inserted such devices into his patients,beneficiaries and that he had billed for his services,fraudulently claiming that the devices used were.the accusation notified guzman that dhcs would seek permanently to suspend him from the program as a result of these allegations.see cal.welf.some time later,the california attorney general office filed felony criminal charges against guzman arising from the same alleged conduct 
dhcs scheduled an administrative hearing on the accusation for august,but guzman requested that it be postponed until the criminal proceedings against him were concluded dhcs granted the request.nevertheless,on january,dhcs sent guzman a letter informing him that he would be suspended temporarily from participating in because of the pending criminal proceedings against him.the letter stated that the suspension would take effect on february,and would continue until determined that he was no longer under investigation or until after legal proceedings related to the alleged fraud or abuses are completed.once enforced,the suspension would prohibit guzman from billing for any services rendered 
as the letter explained,california law entitled guzman to appeal the temporary suspension.dhcs concedes,however,that such appeal is limited to the question of whether a provider is,in fact,under investigation for fraud or abuse.thus,guzman would not have been able to contest the underlying allegations against him in such an appeal.in addition,the letter explained that guzman also had the right to request a meeting with dhcs representatives if he believed the information on which was relying was erroneous.see cal.welf.it is not clear whether guzman would have been able to challenge the validity of the underlying fraud allegations at such a meeting.in any event,guzman decided not to avail himself of either procedure.
on february,guzman filed a complaint against dhcs in the district court under seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the temporary suspension.guzman asserted that a preliminary injunction was necessary because his suspension would irreparably harm his patients,his practice,and his reputation although a california statute authorizes such suspension,cal.welf.a,guzman argued that the statute was preempted by federal law,and that he was entitled to a hearing either by federal medicaid statutes and regulations or,in the alternative,the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.
dhcs agreed to delay enforcement of the suspension for one month,allowing the district court sufficient time to rule on guzman expedited motion for a preliminary injunction.on march,the district court denied the motion,concluding that guzman would not likely be able to show that california welfare and institutions code section a was preempted by federal law,or that he had a statutory or constitutional right to a hearing.nevertheless,the district court granted a limited stay allowing guzman to file an emergency motion in this court to enjoin the suspension pending appeal.on march,a motions panel of this court denied the motion,but expedited the briefing schedule and the date of oral argument.this timely appeal followed.
our review of the denial of a preliminary injunction is limited and deferential.wildwest inst.bull,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we ask only whether the district court has abused its discretion.id.in such cases,the scope of our review is generally limited to whether the district court employed the proper preliminary injunction standard and whether the court correctly apprehended the underlying legal issues in the case.earth island inst.forest,cir.in other words,a s long as the district court got the law right,it will not be reversed simply because the appellate court would have arrived at a different result if it had applied the law to the facts of the case.wildwest,at.
a district court may grant a preliminary injunction under two sets of circumstances.in the first case,a plaintiff must show a strong likelihood of success on the merits,the possibility of irreparable injury to plaintiff if preliminary relief is not granted,a balance of hardships favoring the plaintiff,and advancement of the public interest in certain cases.natural res.def.council,winter,cir quoting freecycle network,oey,cir.in the second case,a court may grant the injunction if the plaintiff demonstrates either a combination of probable success on the merits and the possibility of irreparable injury or that serious questions are raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in his favor.id.emphasis added quoting freecycle,at.
the district court articulated this standard and,in applying it,held that guzman had failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits.thus,the court declined to consider the possibility that guzman would suffer irreparable injury.such action was a valid exercise of the court discretion.as we have held previously,before a preliminary injunction is granted,at an irreducible minimum,the moving party must demonstrate a fair chance of success on the merits,or questions serious enough to require litigation.dep t of parks recreation bazaar del mundo,cir quoting arcamuzi cont l air lines,cir.thus,we must decide whether the district court correctly apprehended the law underlying guzman claims in concluding that he was unlikely to prevail.we now consider each of those claims in turn.
we begin with guzman claim that california welfare and institutions code section a is preempted by federal law.under the supremacy clause,art.vi,cl,state laws that interfere with,or are contrary to the laws of congress,made in pursuance of the constitution are invalid.pub.intervenor mortier,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.guzman argues that california welfare and institutions code section a runs afoul of this provision because it conflicts with,and is therefore preempted by,federal medicaid law.in preemption cases,we begin with the presumption that the historic police powers of the states are not superseded by federal law unless such result was the clear and manifest purpose of congress.medtronic,lohr,d internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
section a states that 
i f it is discovered that a provider is under investigation by the department or any state,local,or federal government law enforcement agency for fraud or abuse,that provider shall be subject to temporary suspension from the program,which shall include temporary deactivation of the provider number,including all business addresses used by the provider to obtain reimbursement from the program.
id.guzman argues that this statute is preempted because federal law prohibits states from suspending providers from a state health care program simply because the provider is under investigation for fraud or abuse.
medicaid,by definition,is a cooperative medical benefits assistance program.see.as we have stated before,because such program exemplifies what is often referred to as cooperative federalism,the case for federal preemption becomes a less persuasive one.dep t of soc.health servs.bowen,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the medicaid statutes contain no explicit language limiting the grounds upon which a state may suspend a provider from a state health care program see mortier,at.thus,we must determine whether the federal medicaid scheme is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it,id.quoting rice santa fe elevator,or whether compliance with the california statute stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,id.quoting hines davidowitz.
section of the social security act lists certain grounds upon which the secretary of hhs must exclude providers from a federal health care program the act also lists certain other grounds upon which the secretary may do so in his discretion.see.in listing the discretionary grounds for suspension,one subsection of the act explains that the secretary may exclude or suspend a ny individual or entity which has been suspended or excluded from participation in a state health care program,for reasons bearing on the individual or entity professional competence,professional performance,or financial integrity.id.b.this provision plainly contemplates that states have the authority to suspend or to exclude providers from state health care programs for reasons other than those upon which the secretary of hhs has authority to act.were such not the case,this subsection would not vest the secretary with any authority not already provided elsewhere in the statute,and its inclusion would be redundant.see spencer,united states,cir i t is a cardinal rule of statutory interpretation that no provision should be construed to be entirely redundant.quoting kungys united states,d see also clark capital credit collection,cir same.
the applicable medicare regulations confirm this view.the regulation describing exclusions from medicaid provides that a state may exclude an individual or entity from participation in the medicaid program for any reason for which the secretary could exclude that individual or entity.a.next,it instructs that nothing in the regulations should be construed to limit a state own authority to exclude an individual or entity from medicaid for any reason or period authorized by state law.id.b.thus,not only does the applicable federal statute fail to prohibit states from suspending providers from state health care programs for reasons other than those upon which the secretary of hhs may act,the governing regulation specifically instructs that states have such authority.
accordingly,nothing in the federal medicaid statutes or regulations prevents a state from suspending a provider temporarily from a state health care program on the basis of an ongoing investigation for fraud or abuse,as california welfare and institutions code section a permits.thus,we agree with the district court that guzman is unlikely to prevail on the merits of his claim that such statute is by federal law.
even if california welfare and institutions code section a is not preempted,guzman argues that federal medicaid law entitles him to a hearing before his temporary suspension from the program is imposed.guzman seeks to enforce such purported right through.
section creates a cause of action against any person who,under color of state law,deprives any citizen of the united states of any rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.id.although this statute enables plaintiffs to enforce federal statutory rights,maine thiboutot,d,it does not provide an avenue for relief every time a state actor violates a federal law,city of rancho palos verdes abrams,d.thus,to demonstrate that he is entitled to a hearing under federal medicaid law,guzman must establish that a federal statute unambiguously e t he supreme court has held that only violations of rights,not laws,give rise to actions.save our valley sound transit,cir citing gonzaga doe,d blessing freestone,d.
guzman contends that he is afforded the right to a hearing by several medicaid statutes and regulations.first,he points to the social security act,which requires the secretary of hhs to afford reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to any provider excluded from any federal health care program.f.yet by its plain terms,such provision applies only to exclusions imposed by the secretary himself it does not govern state exclusion procedures.accordingly,the provision does not control guzman temporary suspension.
second,guzman points to the federal regulations that set forth the requirements for exclusions from medicaid.one such regulation requires the relevant state agency to have administrative procedures in place that enable it to exclude an individual or entity for any reason for which the secretary could exclude such individual or entity.id.another regulation provides that the state agency must give the individual or entity the opportunity to submit documents and written argument against such exclusion and any additional appeals rights that would otherwise be available under procedures established by the state.id.
by their express terms,such regulations do not apply to guzman temporary suspension from because they set forth only those procedures which a state must follow in excluding providers for reasons upon which the secretary of hhs could act.dhcs seeks temporarily to suspend guzman from because he is under investigation for fraud and abuse,as it has the authority to do under california welfare and institutions code section a.the secretary of hhs has no similar authority.accordingly,a suspension under section a is not controlled by 
guzman points to one final source of his right to a hearing,f.consistent with medicaid purpose of providing health care to the indigent in quantity and quality equivalent to the standard of care available to the general population,federal law requires state health care plans to provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain such assistance from any institution or person qualified to perform the service or services required,who undertakes to provide him such services.a.this mandate is sometimes referred to as the freedom of choice principle.see ball rodgers,cir.
in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat,congress cabined such principle by creating exceptions to a allowing states to lock in certain beneficiaries who utilize medicaid services at a frequency or amount not medically necessary by limiting the number of providers from whom they may obtain medical services.a a.similarly,the act allowed states to lock out certain providers from state health care programs upon a finding that the provider furnished medical services at a frequency or amount not medically necessary or of a quality which does not meet professionally recognized standards of health care.id.a b.
in,hhs promulgated regulations to implement these exceptions,stating that,consistent with the act,a state shall not be deemed to be out of compliance with the freedom of choice provision if it has elected any of the exceptions set forth in the regulation,including subsection f,which provides as follows 
of providers.if a medicaid agency finds that a medicaid provider has abused the medicaid program,the agency may restrict the provider,through suspension or otherwise,from participating in the program for a reasonable period of time.
before imposing any restriction,the agency must meet the following conditions 
give the provider notice and opportunity for a hearing,in accordance with procedures established by the agency.
find that in a significant number or proportion of cases,the provider has 
i furnished medicaid services at a frequency or amount not medically necessary,as determined in accordance with utilization guidelines established by the agency or 
ii furnished medicaid services of a quality that does not meet professionally recognized standards of health care.
notify cms and the general public of the restriction and its duration.
ensure that the restrictions do not result in denying recipients reasonable access taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time to medicaid services of adequate quality,including emergency services.
notably,such regulation is placed among the exceptions to the freedom of choice provision,see id.exceptions to certain state plan requirements,rather than those setting forth the procedural safeguards that must be followed when states exclude providers from state health care programs.see id.exclusions from medicaid.yet reading this provision in isolation,guzman argues that it vests him with a right to the remedies set forth in the regulation prior to the enforcement of his temporary suspension.
guzman is correct that his temporary suspension from is a restriction on his participation in such program because the effect of the suspension is to prevent him from billing for the costs of any services rendered.see supra at.moreover,dhcs has never made any finding that guzman has furnished unnecessary or inadequate medical services,as section f appears to require in order for a state to avoid infringing upon the freedom of medicaid recipients to choose among providers.
yet even if subsection f were designed to entitle guzman to the remedies it describes,guzman must demonstrate that a federal statute vests him with such a right.as we held in save our valley,agency regulations can not independently create rights enforceable through.at see also alexander sandoval,d language in a regulation may invoke a private right of action that congress through statutory text created,but it may not create a right that congress has not.gonzaga,at.i f congress wishes to create new rights enforceable under,it must do so in clear and unambiguous terms.
in determining whether congress intended to create a federal right in a particular statutory provision,we examine three factors.first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.blessing,at.in answering this initial inquiry,we must determine whether the statute creates an individual entitlement,gonzaga,at,that is unambiguously conferred,id.at.internal quotation marks omitted,by the use of language,id.at.see harris olszewski,cir applying gonzaga to this prong of the blessing test.
here,our analysis need not proceed further than this first step of the blessing test because there is no federal statute that references any of the procedures set forth in subsection f although subsection f was promulgated to implement the exceptions to the freedom of choice provision set forth in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,including the provider exception,a b repealed,congress decided to repeal such provision in.see medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of,h,a,stat.thus,whatever the effect of hhs decision to retain the implementing regulation after the repeal of the statute,guzman can not contend that such regulation entitles him to a right enforceable in the claim he has brought here.
as we have stated in the past,the supreme court sandoval and gonzaga decisions,taken together,compel the conclusion that agency regulations can not independently create rights enforceable through.save our valley,at.such conclusion should surprise no one,as it results directly from the broader,venerated constitutional law principle that congress,rather than the executive,is the lawmaker in our democracy.id.
accordingly,guzman is unlikely to succeed on the merits of his claim that he has an enforceable federal right to a hearing prior to the imposition of his temporary suspension from the program.
finally,guzman argues that even if he is not entitled to a hearing under federal medicaid law,the fourteenth amendment of the united states constitution affords him such a remedy.the fourteenth amendment protects against governmental deprivations of life,liberty,or property without due process of law.const.amend.xiv.to state a cognizable due process claim,guzman must have a recognized liberty or property interest at stake.schroeder mcdonald,cir.we have previously held that a provider such as guzman does not possess a property interest in continued participation in medicare,medicaid,or the state health care programs.erickson united states ex rel.dep t of health human,cir.thus,under our precedent,guzman must demonstrate that he possesses a liberty interest that will be jeopardized by his temporary suspension from.
the liberty guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment is necessarily broad.see bd.of regents roth,d.to that end,guzman argues that dhcs failure to provide him with a hearing deprived him of three protected liberty interests his right to contract with the state his interest in pursuing the occupation of his choice and his reputation for honesty and morality.although all three interests are protected under the fourteenth amendment,guzman must first demonstrate that he was actually deprived of at least one of these interests before he can establish that he is entitled to relief.see cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d.
guzman argues that because his temporary suspension denies him the ability to receive reimbursement for treating patients,he has been deprived of his right to contract with the state.in support of such assertion,guzman relies on the circuit decision in trifax district of columbia,which indicates that formally debarring a corporation from government contract bidding constitutes a deprivation of liberty that triggers the procedural guarantees of the due process clause.id.at.however,guzman reliance on such authority is misplaced.participation in the program entitles guzman to reimbursement for treating patients who receive benefits it does not involve bidding on government contracts as the seventh circuit explained in medley city of milwaukee,cir,there is no authority for the proposition that a private party,such as guzman,has a liberty interest in participation in a government assistance program designed to provide benefits for a third party.id.at.accordingly,we must conclude that dhcs action does not deprive guzman of his interest in contracting with the state.
guzman next argues that his temporary suspension denies him his liberty interest in pursuing the occupation of his choice.the supreme court has not defined the boundaries of an individual right to pursue his chosen profession,but it has stated that there is some generalized due process right to choose one field of private employment.conn gabbert,d.the court has emphasized,however,that all cases recognizing such a right have deal t with a complete prohibition on the right to engage in a calling,and not a sort of brief interruption.id.at.emphasis added.indeed,the liberty interest in pursuing one chosen profession has been recognized only in cases where a plaintiff challenges the rationality of government regulations on entry into a particular profession,see,schware bd.of bar exam rs,d,or a state seeks permanently to bar an individual from public employment,see,roth,at.
guzman claim does not fall into either of these two recognized categories.with respect to the first,dhcs has temporarily suspended guzman from,thereby preventing him from receiving reimbursement for treating patients.dhcs has not,however,revoked or suspended his license to practice medicine.thus,guzman case is distinguishable from those in which plaintiffs have challenged the rationality of a barrier to entering a particular profession,such as a testing or licensing requirement.see,schware,at.recognizing the liberty interest of an individual denied the right to sit for a state bar exam.
as to the second category,guzman is not a public employee,nor has dhcs decision to suspend him deprived him of future public employment.consequently,the suspension did not impose a complete bar o
