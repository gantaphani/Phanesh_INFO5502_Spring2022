we must decide whether a federal district in california may impose reciprocal discipline by disbarring an attorney on the basis of his disbarment from practice in new york.
in,steven kramer was disbarred from practice in the state of new york.the misconduct that gave rise to his disbarment is described in in re kramer kramer i,where the first department of new york appellate division found kramer guilty of professional misconduct based on his misdeeds in two separate cases one in new york,in which a federal district court dismissed kramer client complaint and imposed sanctions on kramer,id.at,and one in new jersey,which resulted in kramer suspension from practice before the courts of new jersey for a period of six months,id.at.the appellate division then referred kramer case to the first department disciplinary committee to consider evidence in mitigation or aggravation,and to recommend the appropriate sanctions.id.
after a hearing,the committee recommended disbarment.the appellate division agreed,noting that over the course of eleven years,kramer had been sanctioned,criticized,or otherwise disciplined times for professional misconduct involving numerous clients in re kramer kramer ii,collecting cases.accordingly,after reviewing the proceedings before the committee,the appellate division ordered that kramer be disbarred from practice as an attorney and in the state of new york,and that his name be struck from the roll of attorneys and in the state of new york id.at.
shortly after new york disbarred kramer,the central district of california acted to impose reciprocal discipline on him pursuant to local rule which provided that 
u pon receipt of reliable information that a member of the bar of this court has been disbarred from the practice of law by the order of the bar,supreme court,or other governing authority of any state,this court shall immediately impose an order of suspension or disbarment.
this court order of suspension or disbarment shall be filed by the chief judge without the necessity of any notice to the affected attorney or any hearing 
cal.local rule.in accordance with this rule,the district court entered an order disbarring kramer.kramer appealed,arguing that the district court rule failed to provide him due process.
we agreed with kramer.in in re kramer kramer iii,cir,we recognized that district courts have the authority to supervise and discipline the conduct of attorneys who appear before them.id.at.that power,however,must be exercised within the parameters of due process.id.we recognized that in federal court reciprocal disbarment proceedings a state court disciplinary action is not conclusively binding on federal courts.see also stephen gillers,regulation of lawyers problems of law and ethics ed.a state court determination of disbarment is not conclusively binding on the federal courts.internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,we explained,while federal courts generally lack subject matter jurisdiction to review the state court decisions,a federal court may examine a state court disciplinary proceeding if the state court order is offered as the basis for suspending or disbarring an attorney from practice before a federal court.id.at.we then observed that 
f rom the sparse record available to us here,it does not appear that the district court,prior to disbarring him,gave kramer any notice,conducted any hearing or issued him an order to show cause.there is also no evidence that the district court engaged in an independent review of the new york court record.instead,kramer disbarment appears to have been based solely on the new york court order.
id.at.we opined that this approach was inconsistent with the supreme court opinion in selling radford.we concluded that under selling,at a minimum,the district court should issue an order to show cause to kramer and,unless he concedes that the action of the new york courts satisfies selling and its progeny,the district court should review the state court record.kramer iii,at.because the district court had not done this,we reversed and remanded 
on remand,the district court issued kramer an order to show cause why he should not be disbarred.kramer was allowed to submit a brief in response to the order.moreover,after granting kramer various requests for continuances spanning nine months,the district court held a hearing on the order to show cause,at which kramer testified.after the hearing,and after considering the papers filed by kramer,the argument and testimony at the hearing and the record from the proceedings in new york,the court found that kramer had not shown that his new york disbarment suffered from any of the three infirmities identified in selling.accordingly,it issued an order imposing reciprocal disbarment upon kramer,based on his new york disbarment.kramer timely filed this appeal.
as we explained in kramer iii,under selling,a federal court imposition of reciprocal discipline on a member of its bar based on a state disciplinary adjudication is proper unless an independent review of the record reveals a deprivation of due process insufficient proof of misconduct or grave injustice which would result from the imposition of such discipline.kramer iii,at citing selling,at.as a threshold issue,we must determine who bears the burden of proof under selling,and what,exactly,that burden is.
while this court has not yet spoken on the issue,those courts that have generally have concluded that in reciprocal discipline cases,it is the respondent attorney burden to demonstrate,by clear and convincing evidence,that one of the selling elements precludes reciprocal discipline.see,in re calvo,cir the burden is on the disbarred attorney to show good cause why he should not be disbarred,and the district court is not required to conduct a de novo trial in the first instance of the attorney fitness to practice law.instead,it must determine whether the record underlying the predicate state disbarment reveal s the kind of infirmities identified in selling.in re hoare,cir in re friedman,cir as selling makes clear,it was friedman burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the new york procedures were wanting.we find these cases persuasive,and we agree.
kramer argues for the inverse result.relying principally upon in re crayton,he contends that a court must find by clear and convincing evidence that none of the three selling factors is met.see id.at a court may disbar or suspend an attorney only upon the presentation of clear and convincing evidence.kramer,however,conflates reciprocal discipline with direct imposition of discipline.crayton dealt with the imposition of disbarment by a bankruptcy court as a sanction for misconduct in that court.recognizing the severity of a sanction of disbarment,which for all practical purposes ends an attorney career before the relevant court,the bap required clear and convincing proof of misconduct to justify the sanction.this case,in contrast,is about reciprocal discipline in such cases,an attorney misconduct has already been adjudicated by another court or disciplinary agency.thus,a court seeking to impose reciprocal discipline engages in a function far different from a court seeking to impose discipline in the first instance.before imposing reciprocal discipline,a court need only conduct a deferential review of the proceedings that resulted in the initial discipline imposed to satisfy itself that the discipline was not inappropriate under one or more of the selling factors.see in re caranchini,cir explaining that in reciprocal disbarment cases,high respect is given to the judgment of the state court in its disbarment proceedings.
we therefore hold that,in cases where a federal court seeks to impose reciprocal discipline on a member of its bar based on discipline imposed on the attorney by another court or disciplinary authority,it is the attorney burden to demonstrate,by clear and convincing evidence,that one of the selling elements precludes reciprocal discipline.
turning to the merits,we observe that kramer raises a swirling miasma of arguments against the propriety of reciprocal disbarment.kramer first contends that the district cou
