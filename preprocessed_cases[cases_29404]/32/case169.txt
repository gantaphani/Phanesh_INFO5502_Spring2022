baron earl earl,a parole agent,was disciplined by his employer,the california department of corrections and rehabilitation department for conducting a purportedly unlawful search of a residence,and after an administrative hearing the discipline was upheld by the state personnel board board.earl appeals from the trial court denial of his administrative mandamus petition,seeking to overturn the board decision.he first contends that his motion to dismiss should have been granted due to lack of timely notice.he next argues that no substantial evidence shows the search was unlawful,adding that because the law applicable to the search was unclear,his conduct if errant is unlikely to reoccur.therefore,he argues,the level of discipline by the department and later upheld by the board reflects an abuse of discretion.
because we agree that notice was untimely,we need not reach earl remaining contentions.we reverse with directions to issue a writ commanding the board to grant earl motion to dismiss.
background 
because of the narrowness of our holding,the facts surrounding the search and the subsequent discipline imposed are not relevant.
the parties do not dispute that the department learned of earl actions during a hearing regarding another employee conducted on may,and served a letter of intent on earl by certified mail on may,notifying him that the investigation was complete and that the allegations of an improper entry were sustained.earl position that this notice was not adequate under the relevant statute was rejected by the board,which upheld discipline,and the trial court,which denied earl administrative mandamus petition.
earl timely appealed from the judgment.
discussion 
earl contends he was entitled to actual notice of the contents of the letter of intent within one year of the date of discovery,not service by mail as perfected by the department.amici curiae,groups of public safety officers,concur we agree with this position.
we review questions of law,which would include statutory interpretation,de novo.see pollak state personnel bd.th.
within the state civil service laws,division,part of the government code,provision is made for service of specified documents,including a notice of disciplinary action,in part as follows the appointing power shall provide service of the following actions by personal service or by certified mail with return receipt requested or express service carrier,subd.a.service by certified mail is deemed complete as provided for in code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,subd.a b.a different section partly provides adverse action is valid only if a written notice is served on the employee prior to the effective date of the action,as defined by board rule.the notice shall be served upon the employee either personally or by mail,subd.a.
however,peace officers are subject to an entirely separate statute,be they state or local peace officers,namely,the public safety officers procedural bill of rights act popularly known as pobra et,located in division,part of the government code,which provides in relevant part as follows 
except as provided in this subdivision and subdivision g,no punitive action shall be undertaken for any act,omission,or other allegation of misconduct if the investigation of the allegation is not completed within one year of the public agency discovery by a person authorized to initiate an investigation of the allegation of an act,omission,or other misconduct in the event that the public agency determines that discipline may be taken,it shall complete its investigation and notify the public safety officer of its proposed discipline by a letter of intent or notice of adverse action articulating the discipline that year,except as provided in paragraph.the public agency shall not be required to impose the discipline within that period,subd.d,emphasis added.
earl persuasively contends that the word notify as used in the emphasized portion of the statute means actual notification,not constructive notice,such as by mail.he relies on the rule,stated in many cases,that u nder settled principles of statutory construction,a statute requiring that a notice shall be given,but which is silent as to the manner of giving such notice,contemplates personal service thereof.hoschler sacramento city unified school dist.th,hoschler see simpson city of los angeles cal d,simpson stockton automobile confer cal,stockton johnson barreiro d,johnson.
the department contends that notify in section,subdivision d embraces both actual and constructive notice,relying on a somewhat strained and,as we explain,flawed chain of reasoning,as follows in mays city of los angeles cal th mays,the california supreme court interpreted section,subdivision d to give an agency a full year to conduct an investigation into misconduct,after discovery of the facts because giving actual notice to a public safety officer would often take more than a day,requiring actual notice would encroach on the year allotted to investigation to avoid this,the term notify in section,subdivision d must be read to mean that service of notice on the last day of the investigative year suffices,and section provides that service is complete on the day of mailing and therefore,the service of notice by mail on the last day of the year in this case comported with statutory requirements.
the trial court,relying on mays and our decision in sulier state personnel bd.th sulier,agreed with the department.however,mays and sulier actually undermine the department argument,as we shall explain.
in mays,our supreme court granted review to address the question of whether the notice required by section d is satisfied by informing an accused officer,within the statutory period,that the agency proposes that certain misconduct charges be adjudicated by a board of rights.mays,supra,cal th at.our high court held that t he notice contemplated by the language and context of section d is simply notice that the public agency,having completed its investigation into the alleged misconduct within the statutory period,has decided that it may take disciplinary action against the officer for specified misconduct.although the agency is not precluded from proposing specific discipline at that time,it is not required by section d to do so.a notice informing an officer of a proposed board of rights adjudication not only informs him or her that disciplinary action may be taken as the result of the investigation into the alleged misconduct the notice required by the statute but also identifies the procedural mechanism by which the officer punishment,if any,will be determined.mays,supra,cal th at.
in the course of its discussion,our supreme court explained why it was not necessary to provide notice of the specific punishment to be imposed,as follows 
viewing the terms of section d as a whole,it appears clear that the fundamental purpose of this provision is to place a limitation on investigations of officer misconduct.the one year period runs from the time the misconduct is discovered.once the public agency decides that discipline may be warranted that discipline may be taken ibid,it must so inform the public safety officer must notify the public safety officer of its proposed disciplinary action ibid.in this context,it seems most reasonable to interpret the language proposed disciplinary action as referring to the agency determination that discipline may be taken.ibid.not only completion of the investigation,but also the requisite notification to the officer,must be accomplished within a year of discovery of the misconduct.this interpretation is consistent with the apparent purpose of the subdivision,which is to ensure that an officer will not be faced with the uncertainty of a lingering investigation,but will know within one year of the agency discovery of the officer act or omission that it may be necessary for the officer to respond in the event he or she wishes to defend against possible discipline.
a contrary conclusion that section d requires notification of the specific discipline contemplated by the public agency prematurely would impose a requirement that is unreasonable in view of the timing
