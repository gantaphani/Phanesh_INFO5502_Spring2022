an attorney who switches sides during litigation is disqualified from representing his or her former adversary.the disqualification extends to the attorney entire new law firm.but a city attorney office is not a law firm within the meaning of the vicarious disqualification rule.as we shall explain,in an ordinary civil case,disqualification of a nonsupervisorial deputy city attorney should not result in the vicarious disqualification of the entire city attorney office.such would deprive the city of its counsel of choice,result in an unnecessary burden on the public fisc,and provide an unnecessary litigation disadvantage to the city.
to be sure,the appearance of justice is important and the courts should,when necessary,do everything in their power to protect the confidentiality of attorney client communications.however,in the presenting circumstances,the creation and maintenance of an ethical wall or ethical screen is sufficient to protect the confidentiality of attorney client communications,as well as the integrity of the judicial process.
on june,water and sewage from a city main flooded portions of the stensons house on edgewater way in santa barbara.the city contends this incident occurred because the stensons did not equip their sewer lateral with a working backflow device.the stensons contend they are not required to install a backflow device and that the incident occurred because the city failed properly to maintain and repair the sewer line.
the stensons retained hatch parent to represent them in litigation against the city for damages caused by the incident.two hatch parent lawyers,eric berg and sarah knecht,worked on the matter.between early december and february,knecht performed over hours of legal services for the stensons,representing about percent of the total time billed by hatch parent.among other things,she met with stenson to discuss the factual and legal basis for the lawsuit and to develop a strategy for pursuing the claim against the city.knecht reviewed documents,videotapes and photographs submitted by stenson and inspected the property.she also conducted legal research and drafted discovery requests.
in early february,knecht informed hatch parent that she had accepted a job at the city attorney office.her first day of work for the city was march.in the interim,the stensons informed both the city attorney and janet mcginnis,the assistant city attorney responsible for this litigation,that they would move to disqualify the office based on knecht conflict of interest.
mcginnis constructed an ethical wall to prevent knecht access to any information,documents or other materials related to the stenson litigation.mcginnis does not supervise knecht and her staff does not work for or with knecht.everyone in the office has been instructed to prevent knecht from being involved in communications about this case or having access to any records or documents related to this case.litigation files are segregated from files on matters and are stored in or near mcginnis office.knecht does not work on litigation matters and has had no reason to access any cabinet with litigation files.mcginnis does not attend office staff meetings or report on litigation to any member of the office other than the city attorney,stephen wiley.
trial court ruling 
the trial court concluded an ethical wall was not sufficient and that disqualification of the entire city attorney office was required by the vicarious disqualification rule.in its writ petition,the city contends the order should be vacated because its ethical wall will protect the stensons confidences.the stensons concede that knecht has not disclosed their confidential communications but they do not waive the conflict.they maintain they should not be required to trust that their adversary in litigation will refrain from using confidential information against them.
first impression case 
as the stensons point out,no california court has sanctioned the use of an ethical wall under the circumstances present here an attorney with direct,personal knowledge of client confidences goes to work for the clients adversary while the litigation is pending,moving from a private law firm to the public law office representing the adversary,which office has established an ethical wall to prevent the disclosure of confidential information.cases that have accepted ethical screening for public lawyers have involved lawyers who did not personally work on the matter in which the conflict is raised chambers superior court d,lawyers involved in criminal prosecutions chadwick superior court d,or lawyers who were physically and functionally separated from their adversaries.people christian th,d castro los angeles county bd.of supervisors d.cases rejecting ethical walls have involved public lawyers who personally represented the client and who also have managerial,supervisory and responsibilities in the public law office.see,people lepe d.younger superior court d.
an appellate court reviews routine attorney disqualification orders for abuse of discretion.people ex rel.of corporations speedee oil change systems cal th,d,hereafter,speedee oil change.but this is not a routine case.indeed,the trial court did not even purport to exercise discretion ruling instead that vicarious disqualification was mandatory.when the trial court issued its order and when we issued our order to show cause,no published california case had considered vicarious attorney disqualification in the context of an entire city attorney office.we decide the question of law on a de novo basis.
attorney disqualification 
a trial court authority to disqualify an attorney derives from the power inherent in every court t o control in furtherance of justice,the conduct of its ministerial officers,and of all other persons in any manner connected with the judicial proceeding before it,in every matter pertaining thereto.code civ,subd.a speedee oil change,supra,cal th at,d.motions to disqualify counsel are especially prone to tactical abuse because disqualification imposes heavy burdens on both the clients and courts clients are deprived of their chosen counsel,litigation costs inevitably increase and delays inevitably occur as a result,these motions must be examined carefully to ensure that literalism does not deny the parties substantial justice.id.at,d.at the same time,we recognize that disqualification of counsel is necessary under certain circumstances,to protect the integrity of our judicial process by enforcing counsel duties of confidentiality and loyalty.id.at,d,see also flatt superior court cal th,d.
an attorney ethical duties to maintain undivided loyalty to his or her clients and to preserve the confidentiality of client communications require that the attorney refrain from simultaneous or successive representation of clients with adverse interests.state bar rules conduct,rule at a minimum,standards of professional responsibility mandate that an attorney not switch sides during pending litigation,moving from the representation of one party in a lawsuit to the representation of that party adversary in the same matter.switching sides suggests to the to the public at the attorney is completely indifferent to the duty of loyalty and the duty to preserve confidences.however,the attorney actual intention and motives are immaterial,and the rule of automatic disqualification applies.speedee oil change,supra,cal th at,d.
