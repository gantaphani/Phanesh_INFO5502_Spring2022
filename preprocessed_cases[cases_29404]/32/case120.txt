in october,the alaska right to life political action committee arl pac circulated a questionnaire to the twelve alaska state court judges who were seeking retention votes in the november election.the questionnaire solicited the judges views on a variety of legal and political issues such as abortion and assisted suicide.only four judges responded.none indicated a view with respect to any of the positions listed in the questionnaire but all provided explanations for their decisions not to participate,including concern that responding would require subsequent recusal,provisions of the alaska code of judicial conduct code that prohibit judges from pledging,promising,or committing to particular conduct in judicial office,one judge personal code of judicial ethics,and advice from judicial conduct commission in my state.
in october,approximately one month prior to alaska general election,arl pac and individual michael miller collectively plaintiffs brought suit against eight named members of the alaska commission on judicial conduct commission and six named members of the disciplinary board of the alaska bar association bar,challenging the constitutionality of three provisions in the alaska code of judicial conduct code requiring disqualification from any proceeding in which a judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned prohibiting judicial candidates from making pledges or promises of particular conduct in judicial office and restricting statements that commit or appear to commit a judicial candidate to a particular view or decision regarding a case likely to come before the court.arl pac and miller alleged that the two canons containing these three restrictions chilled judicial candidates from responding to their survey,in violation of the first amendment.arl pac did not circulate a questionnaire to any of the ten judges who were seeking retention in the election prior to the filing of the complaint,and neither the commission nor the bar ever threatened to enforce any provision of the code against judges who might have chosen to respond to such a questionnaire.the district court nonetheless concluded that arl pac and miller suit was justiciable.on the merits,the court invalidated the canon that prohibits pledges and promises of conduct in judicial office and statements that commit or appear to commit a judicial candidate to a particular view or decision but rejected plaintiffs challenge to the canon requiring disqualification from proceedings in which a judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned.the parties.arl pac and miller also appealed the district court orders denying their motion for attorneys fees and costs against the commission and granting steve van goor motion for attorneys fees and costs against plaintiffs.
because arl pac and miller constitutional challenges were not ripe,we vacate the district court order and judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss.without a more fully developed factual record,including evidence of some real threat of enforcement,and without a showing that withholding federal adjudication would impose hardship on plaintiffs,we conclude that the district court should have declined jurisdiction for lack of a justiciable case or controversy.this conclusion renders moot plaintiffs appeal from the order denying its motion for attorneys fees and costs against the commission and their motion to dismiss the portion of their appeal regarding their challenge to the constitutionality of alaska disqualification clause.we affirm the district court order granting attorney fees and costs to van goor.
alaska selects its supreme court justices and lower court judges through a nomination and appointment procedure.when a vacancy arises on the state bench,the alaska judicial council council nominates two or more candidates,one of whom the governor then appoints to the position.alaska const.art.iv.justices and judges are subject to a nonpartisan retention vote during the first general election that takes place more than three years after their appointment to the bench.id.thereafter,each justice stands for retention every ten years and each judge stands for retention every six years.id.
among its other duties,the alaska supreme court is charged with mak ing and promulgat ing rules governing the administration of all courts,id,including the alaska code of judicial conduct.these two appeals concern two canons of the code canon,which requires that a judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge impartiality might reasonably be questioned,and canon d,which establishes that 
a candidate for judicial office d shall not i make pledges or promises of conduct in judicial office other than to faithfully and impartially perform the duties of the office ii make statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate to a particular view or decision with respect to cases,controversies or issues that are likely to come before the court.
subclause i of canon d is commonly referred to as a pledge and promise clause subclause ii is known as a commit clause.only the alaska supreme court may impose sanctions against judges for violations of the code,see alaska stat.d,b that court therefore has exclusive authority definitively to interpret the code provisions.
the commission however,bears the initial burden of investigating allegations of judicial misconduct,including alleged violations of the code.alaska stat.a,b.after conducting an investigation and hearing,the commission may either exonerate the judge or refer the matter to the supreme court with a recommendation that the judge be reprimanded,suspended,removed,or retired from office or publicly or privately censured by the supreme court.id.d.in addition to its investigation and recommendation duties,rule a of the commission rules of procedure authorizes,but does not require,the commission to issue a formal advisory opinion upon written request of a state judicial officer such an opinion provides an absolute defense in any subsequent disciplinary proceedings based on that conduct.pursuant to rule d,however,informal verbal guidance provided by commission members and staff has no legal effect and does not provide a recognized defense to a later disciplinary charge.
the disciplinary board of the alaska bar association is an entirely separate entity charged with supervis ing the investigation of all complaints against attorneys.bar counsel c see also bar counsel a providing that appointed bar counsel will investigate alleged misconduct of attorneys.while the bar has authority to enforce alaska rule of professional conduct b,which requires that lawyers who are candidates for judicial office comply with the applicable provisions of the code of judicial conduct,and therefore derivatively to interpret the code of judicial conduct,it has never done so.this power presumably applies only prior to an individual attorney initial appointment to the bench,as a judicial candidate seeking a retention vote is already a judicial officer subject to the commission enforcement of the code.
in october,arl pac,which describes itself as a membership corporation organized to provide assistance to the unborn child and to promote social welfare and the common good and general welfare of the people of the states of alaska,circulated a questionnaire to the twelve judges who were seeking retention in the upcoming november election.the questionnaire listed nine positions relating to abortion,assisted suicide,in vitro fertilization and cloning,wrongful life,and wrongful birth and asked respondents to check agree,disagree,undecided,or decline in response to each position a footnote to the decline option stated that checking this response indicated the judge good faith belief that under a reasonable construction of applicable canons of judicial conduct or because my recusal would be subsequently required,i must decline to respond to this particular question.a cover letter from arl pac executive director karen vosburgh explained the organizations intention to inform interested voters of your response and further stated that if you choose not to respond to our questionnaire,we will advise our members to vote for.
on october,the commission executive director marla greenstein sent vosburgh a letter that expressed her concerns with alaska judges responding to the questionnaire in any other way than decline.in greenstein view,
questions that reflect a of a controversial issue or a judicial philosophy that could predict the outcome in a case are to be avoided.so too,questions that,if answered,are likely to lead to disqualification it is my professional opinion that judges who answer the questions in your questionnaire would be creating situations that would require them to be disqualified from sitting on cases involving those issues.
greenstein also referenced the united states supreme court decision in republican party of minnesota white,d,which struck down a provision of minnesota code of judicial conduct that forbid any candidate for judicial office from announc ing his or her views on disputed legal or political issues.id.at.greenstein noted that the alaska code did not contain such a clause,that distinguishable provisions of the alaska code restricted judicial speech,and that white arose in the context of a contested judicial election scheme rather than alaska retention scheme.greenstein copied this letter to all alaska judges.
of the twelve questionnaires it distributed,arl pac received four responses.justice walter carpeneti checked decline in response to each question and,on each page of the questionnaire,handwrote might in place of would in the footnoted phrase my recusal would be subsequently required.in an accompanying letter,which,like greenstein letter was dated october,justice carpeneti explained,i am not at all certain that responding to your group questions is allowed under the alaska code and that it would not subject me to later recusal.he did,however,list three cases in which he participated as an alaska supreme court justice that rais ed some of the issues covered in your questionnaire.
judge charles pengilly checked decline in response to all nine questions and submitted a letter,also dated october,expressing his uncertainty as to whether the supreme court decision in white had any impact on the constitutionality on alaska own code of judicial conduct.he also relayed that he had discussed the questionnaire with greenstein,who shares my ambivalence about the impact of white but does advise against responding to your questions on the ground that recusal would be required in the event any of these issues come sic before the court.he concluded,i hesitate to answer only because it is far from clear that judges in alaska have that freedom to discuss the issues in the questionnaire.
judge sigurd murphy did not complete the questionnaire but submitted a letter,dated october,announcing his decision to decline to respond to your questionnaire generally for the reasons set forth in the october,letter addressed to you from the alaska commission on judicial conduct.judge murphy also expressed his view that responding to the questionnaire would violate his own judges code which i prepared and have given to attorneys and others interested in my view of the judicial ethics that i live by.
judge jane kauvar returned the questionnaire,checking decline in response to each question.at the end of the questionnaire judge kauvar wrote simply based on advice from judicial conduct commission in my state.no judge sought a formal advisory opinion from the commission.
arl pac chose not to publish any of these responses nor did it distribute a questionnaire to any of the ten judges who sought retention in the next general election,which took place in november.instead,on october,arl pac and miller,an individual and resident of the state of alaska,filed a action in the united states district court for the district of alaska against eight named members of the commission and six named members of the bar,all sued in their official capacities.the complaint raised first amendment challenges to alaska canons and d i and ii,asserting that the former was unconstitutional on its face and that both were unconstitutional as applied to the questionnaire.arl pac and miller also asserted that the commission enforcement policy of both canons,as expressed in greenstein october,letter,unconstitutionally chilled protected political speech.alleging injury to plaintiffs rights to in arl pac case also to campaign speech,the complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief,costs and attorneys fees.
after arl pac voluntarily dismissed all bar members except defendant van goor,who serves bar counsel,van goor filed a motion to dismiss the claims against him.the district court granted the motion,in light of plaintiffs concession that their lawsuit did not involve and that van goor had no authority to enforce the code against judicial officers.
the commission and arl pac and miller then filed for summary judgment on the first amendment challenges to canons and d i and ii.the district court held that arl pac and miller claims were justiciable and that abstention was neither warranted nor appropriate.arl pac feldman,d.on the merits,the district court held that canon d i and ii violated the first amendment but that canon was constitutional.id.at.in a order,it denied arl pac and miller motion for costs and attorneys fees pursuant to on grounds that their successful challenge to canon d i and ii was significantly compromised by their lack of success in challenging the recusal clause in canon.in a separate order the district court granted in part van goor motion for costs and attorneys fees.
the commission timely appealed the district court summary judgment invalidating canon d i and ii in.arl pac and miller timely appealed the district court summary judgment upholding canon,denying their motion for fees and costs against the commission,and awarding fees and costs to van goor in.after briefing for this appeal was complete,arl pac and miller filed a motion to dismiss the portion of their appeal in challenging the district court judgment as to the constitutionality of canon.in light of our conclusion that plaintiffs claims are not ripe and that the district court should have declined jurisdiction over their cause of action,we deny the motion as moot.

federal jurisdiction is limited to actual cases and controversies.allen wright,d.this principle of justiciability has both constitutional and prudential components.see id.at.explaining justiciability doctrines.relevant here are the doctrines of standing and ripeness.
article iii standing is a controlling element in the definition of a case or controversy.hein freedom religion found,d internal quotation marks omitted.at an irreducible constitutional minimum,article iii standing requires proof that the plaintiff suffered an injury in fact that is concrete and particularized and actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical of a causal connection between that injury and the conduct and that a favorable decision will likely redress the alleged injury.see lujan defenders of wildlife,d.in addition to these article iii requirements of injury in fact,causation,and redressibility,prudential standing concerns require that we consider,for example,whether the alleged injury is more than a mere generalized grievance,whether the plaintiff is asserting her own rights or the rights of third parties,and whether the claim falls within the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by the constitutional guarantee in question.see johnson stuart,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
like standing,the ripeness doctrine has both constitutional and prudential components.see park hospitality ass dep t of the interior,d the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to ex
