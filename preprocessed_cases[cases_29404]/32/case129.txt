california attorney richard canatella canatella filed a suit against the california state bar and others,raising first and fourteenth amendment challenges to four california state bar statutes and one rule of professional conduct.the district court dismissed the claims under the doctrine and on the basis of younger harris,questioning further whether canatella had standing and whether his claims were ripe for review.we must decide whether applies to canatella claims in light of changed circumstances,and whether canatella was involved in an ongoing proceeding under younger.because we conclude the answer to both questions is no,we must also decide whether canatella claims satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of article iii.
background 
canatella has practiced law in california since.he is licensed to practice in california and the district of columbia,and is a member of the bars of the northern and central districts of california,the ninth circuit court of appeals,and the supreme court of the united states.
prior to,canatella had no record of discipline before any court or bar.between and,federal and state courts imposed monetary sanctions against canatella on occasions,in an amount totaling approximately canatella was sanctioned for such reasons as vexatious litigation,filing of frivolous actions and appeals,and the use of delay tactics.of the sanctions arose in the context of two sets of proceedings in the first,canatella filed a series of civil actions on behalf of a babysitter and her parents,after appellate reversal of the babysitter conviction for second degree murder and child abuse.in the second,canatella represented two civil defendants in a series of collection actions.all of the sanctions levied against canatella concern his activities as an advocate of his clients interests in judicial proceedings.
in,the state bar of california state bar initiated a disciplinary investigation into the multiple sanctions orders.in response,canatella filed a action seeking to enjoin the state bar from taking disciplinary action against him,and to declare facially unconstitutional several provisions of the california business and professions code and one provision of the california rules of professional conduct while the sanctions orders themselves generally arose for violations of rules of court,such as fed.civ.proc.b,or fed.proc,canatella challenged the state bar statutes and professional rule under which he could ultimately be subject to discipline or disbarment by the state bar.the district court abstained from exercising jurisdiction under younger,and canatella appealed to this court.
pending appeal,the state bar filed formal charges against canatella.canatella agreed to a stipulated settlement requiring days actual suspension from legal practice,and an stayed suspension subject to reinstatement upon any finding of rule violations during an probationary period.the california supreme court approved the stipulated discipline on august,in a final disciplinary order.in light of the settlement,this court dismissed canatella appeal as moot on november.see canatella state bar of california,cir.the district court subsequently denied without prejudice canatella motions for vacatur of the abstention order,and for leave to amend his complaint.
in march of,canatella filed a second suit in district court,again seeking an injunction prohibiting the state bar from taking further disciplinary action against him under the challenged provisions,and a declaration that the provisions are unconstitutional.canatella alleged that facially and as applied,the challenged provisions are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad,in violation of the first and fourteenth amendments.canatella also alleged that the provisions deprive him of his judicial proceedings privilege under color of state law.in raising these claims,canatella alleged a strong likelihood of further state bar disciplinary charges for a sanction entered against him by a magistrate on january,in a separate action 
the district court dismissed canatella complaint under the doctrine and on younger abstention grounds,further questioning whether canatella had standing and whether his claims were ripe for review.canatella now appeals.
two events of significance have occurred after canatella filed the immediate appeal.first,this court vacated the magistrate judge sanction order on january,with the mandate issuing on february.see chan bay area air quality management,cir.second,on march,canatella completed his probationary sentence under the stipulated settlement and final order issued by the supreme court of california in the original state bar proceedings.
ii.analysis 
the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over canatella claims under the doctrine,which derives from rooker fidelity trust,and district of columbia court of appeals feldman,d.the doctrine is jurisdictional,see olson farms,barbosa,cir,and subject to de novo review.see garvey roberts,cir.feldman holds that prevents federal courts from asserting jurisdiction over final judicial determinations by state supreme courts id.at.
the district court determined that canatella suit was,in effect,an action to review the california supreme court final disciplinary order approving the settlement between canatella and the state bar.the court reasoned that because canatella was still on probation,a grant of his requested injunctive and declaratory relief would effectively nullify the california supreme court approval of canatella probationary status.the court was rightly concerned that asserting jurisdiction might require review of a final state court decision,particularly one potentially subject to revision in the state court system,richardson district of columbia court of appeals,but this situation no longer obtains.on march,canatella completed his probationary sentence under the stipulated discipline approved by the supreme court of california.he has done so without incurring further disciplinary sanction.review of his first and fourteenth amendment claims no longer raises the specter of review of a final state court decision,and the question of whether applies is moot 
the district court also abstained from jurisdiction on the basis of younger harris.this court reviews de novo whether abstention is required.green city of tucson,cir en banc.younger and its progeny teach that federal courts may not,where circumstances dictate,exercise jurisdiction when doing so would interfere with state judicial proceedings.see middlesex county ethics comm.garden state bar ass n,d.a district court must abstain and dismiss a suit on the basis of younger where state proceedings are ongoing important state interests are involved and the plaintiff has an adequate opportunity to litigate federal claims in the state proceedings.see id.at.however,we recently held that the middlesex inquiry is triggered only when the threshold condition for younger abstention is is,when the relief sought in federal court would in some manner directly interfere with ongoing state proceedings.green city of tucson,at.
of course the green interference inquiry presumes the existence of an ongoing state proceeding to be interfered with,which is precisely what the first prong of the middlesex test requires the district court to consider we consider whether the state court proceedings were ongoing as of the time the federal action was filed.see beltran state of california,cir.
at the time canatella filed his federal complaint,the magistrate sanctions order had issued.we must decide whether canatella act of reporting to the state bar the sanctions order,as required under the terms of his stipulation,gave rise to ongoing judicial proceedings for younger purposes california law guides the inquiry.see middlesex.hirsh justices of supreme court of california,cir.brotsky state bar of california,cal d,indicates that,as a general matter,state bar actions during disciplinary proceedings are judicial in nature.see also hirsh,at.however,no affirmative action had been taken by the state bar against canatella at the initiation of the federal suit.in fact,canatella successfully secured an order from the magistrate judge staying any state bar disciplinary proceedings pending the outcome of canatella direct appeal of the sanctions order to this court.the only procedural step that had occurred at the time the complaint was filed was canatella act of.
relying on our decision in hirsh,canatella argues that california disciplinary proceedings commence only when the state bar serves the accused attorney with a notice of disciplinary charges or a notice to show cause.hirsh presented issues similar but not identical to those raised here.facing pending attorney disciplinary proceedings by the california state bar,two lawyers filed a action in federal court alleging various constitutional deprivations.id.at.the plaintiffs sought an injunction to stop the disciplinary proceedings,a declaratory judgment that the state bar disciplinary system was unconstitutional,and monetary damages.id.the district court abstained from jurisdiction and dismissed the suit under younger,and we affirmed.
in reciting the factual background concerning the california state bar disciplinary system,the court stated,disciplinary proceedings are commenced by serving the accused attorney with a notice to show cause.id.at.by itself,this conclusory assertion in a statement of facts should not be read as a holding,but the opinion goes on 
each appellant faced ongoing disciplinary proceedings when he brought a suit in federal court.see beltran state of california,cir stating that abstention requires proceedings to be ongoing at the time plaintiff initiates federal proceedings.notices to show cause had been directed to two defendants,and the california supreme court had not yet filed an order regarding the bar court recommendations with respect to two other defendants.
this language,coupled with the court background statement that disciplinary proceedings commence only by service of a notice to show cause,suggests that disciplinary proceedings are not ongoing for younger purposes until the state bar issues such a remain ongoing at least until the supreme court of california issues orders regarding the state bar proceedings.
to begin,we do not read hirsh to require younger abstention in a california state bar disciplinary proceeding where the appellant has done nothing more than report a sanction to the state bar.however california law offers little,if any,guidance in advancing our inquiry further at best the california courts provide related holdings concerning the nature of state bar proceedings themselves.see,in re rose,cal th,d,cal state bar and its court merely an administrative arm of the california supreme court and not invested with judicial functions.however,younger principles apply even to pending state administrative proceedings that are judicial in nature and involve important state interests,see fresh international agricultural labor relations board,cir middlesex,at,concluding that being judicial in nature a state bar disciplinary proceedings are of a character to warrant deference,and the characterization of state bar proceedings as merely administrative is a distinction without a difference in the attempt to identify when such proceedings commence.
because our reading of california law does not allow us to determine when judicial proceedings have begun for younger purposes,we rely on the supreme court decision in middlesex to determine when they have not.in considering whether state bar disciplinary hearings constituted ongoing judicial proceedings under new jersey law,the court relied on a decision of the new jersey state supreme court that held from the very beginning a disciplinary proceeding is judicial in nature,initiated by filing a complaint with an ethics and grievance committee.middlesex,at.quoting toft ketchum.toft thus articulated a clearly identifiable moment in the state bar disciplinary scheme at which a proceeding was initiated,namely,the filing of a complaint.based on this clearly identifiable rule,the court concluded that under new jersey law,the mere receipt of a complaint by the new jersey state bar constitutes an ongoing state proceeding for younger purposes.
middlesex thus found a definitive starting point for ongoing proceedings in the state bar disciplinary context only on the basis of an explicit rule.absent any such rule in california law,we can not say that receipt of a complaint by the california state bar gives rise to disciplinary proceedings,and certainly can not say that such proceedings begin merely with the of a disciplinary sanction to the state bar 
applying our reading of middlesex to this case,we can not say that canatella of the magistrate judge sanction initiated an ongoing judicial proceeding for younger purposes.because this was the only action that had taken place at the time canatella filed his federal complaint,we conclude that there was no ongoing state proceeding for the district court to interfere with by exercising jurisdiction,and that the court erred in dismissing the action on grounds of younger abstention 
because neither the doctrine nor younger require that the district court abstain from jurisdiction,we must also consider whether the district court erroneously concluded that canatella lacks standing to bring his claims,and that his claims are not ripe for review.
the district court decision to grant or deny standing is reviewed de novo.loyd paine webber,cir.standing is one of the cluster of prudential doctrines mediating the article iii requirement that federal courts take jurisdiction only over definite and concrete,not hypothetical or abstract cases and controversies.thomas anchorage equal rights commission,cir en banc.a plaintiff generally demonstrates standing by showing an injury in fact traceable to the challenged action and redressable by a favorable decision.see friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl,d.in the particular context of injunctive and declaratory relief,a plaintiff must show that he has suffered or is threatened with a concrete and particularized legal harm,lujan defenders of wildlife,d,coupled with a sufficient likelihood that he will again be wronged in a similar way.city of los angeles lyons,d.see also berner delahanty,cir.and while the plaintiff must show that the feared harm is actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical,lujan defenders of wildlife,d,o ne does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury before challenging a statute.babbitt united farm workers union,d.
the district court concluded that canatella had no standing because he could show no imminent threat of injury based on the magistrate sanctions order.nor did the district court accept the contention that canatella suffered harm by the threat of sanctions in the future.however,we are not so quick to render canatella a hapless plaintiff between the scylla of intentionally flouting the law and the charybdis of forgoing what he believes to be constitutionally protected activity in order to avoid becoming enmeshed in a disciplinary proceeding.committee thornburgh,cir quoting steffel thompson,d babbitt,at.canatella personally faced discipline under the challenged provisions.he stipulated to a probationary sentence that allowed him to retain his license and continue practice after a actual suspension.he has nowhere conceded that he will refrain from the type of expression that he believes is constitutionally protected,is necessary to the performance of his duties as an advocate,and is the basis upon which he may be disciplined under the challenged statutes in the future.nor has the state bar conceded that it will not rely on the challenged provisions to bring disciplinary proceedings against canatella should he be sanctioned again.
on the record before us,we believe not only that t he parties remain philosophically on a collision course,berner,at,but that there is a strong likelihood canatella may again face discipline under the challenged provisions.his threat of future prosecution is not merely hypothetical and conjectural,but actual.in relying on canatella disciplinary record to reach our conclusion,we do not maintain that past prosecution by itself gives rise to a present case or controversy.but we have no reason to doub
