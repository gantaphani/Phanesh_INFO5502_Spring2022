this is the latest episode in the battle between attorney stuart stein and the disciplinary board of the supreme court of new mexico the board.stein and the stein law firm plaintiffs have apparently won a long struggle over the application of state disciplinary rules to their advertising,but stein has lost a separate disciplinary matter regarding his representation of a client.now before us is the appeal from dismissal of a civil suit filed by plaintiffs in the united states district court for the district of new mexico,a suit that arose from both sets of proceedings.plaintiffs claims in the suit expanded considerably over time.this appeal concerns only certain claims against the board chief disciplinary counsel,virginia ferrara two deputy assistant disciplinary counsel,sally and sarah karni and the new mexico supreme court itself.these claims allege that plaintiffs constitutional rights were violated by ferrara,when she a did not serve them with a copy of the opinion by a board hearing committee in the advertising matter that it could not issue a declaratory judgment,b provided the supreme court with a copy of the hearing committee opinion,and c requested the supreme court to appoint a special review committee to review the opinion by ferrara,and karni in pursuing disciplinary charges regarding stein representation of a former client when they had inadequately investigated the allegations and by the supreme court when it issued a order and later rejected the hearing committee opinion on declaratory judgments.the district court dismissed all the claims on the grounds of absolute immunity.we affirm the dismissal.we hold that ferrara actions in the advertising matter did not infringe any constitutionally protected interest of plaintiffs and that all other actions of the defendants were absolutely privileged.
background 
the events leading to plaintiffs current litigation began in june when the board threatened stein with disciplinary action if he did not modify his legal advertisements to comport with the new mexico rules of professional conduct.stein protested that the advertising restrictions were unconstitutional.plaintiffs claim that stein informed the board disciplinary counsel that the legal advertising committee was applying the rules in an unconstitutional fashion and that despite being aware of united states supreme court precedent on the matter,disciplinary counsel ignored his protests.
in july plaintiffs filed their first suit in federal court,requesting,among other relief,an injunction to prevent the board from acting against stein with respect to the advertising.the district court held that younger harris,d,required it to abstain from hearing the case because the state disciplinary proceeding was ongoing.it dismissed the case without prejudice,noting that stein would have an opportunity to raise his constitutional claims in the state proceeding.see stein legal adver.comm.of the disciplinary,d,stein i.two later federal cases brought by plaintiffs within the next year on the same grounds reached the same result.see stein legal adver.comm.of the disciplinary,d,stein ii stein legal adver.comm.of the disciplinary,d unpublished stein iii.
in october,while stein i was pending,the board filed formal charges against stein relating to his advertising.in may he brought his constitutional challenges in a petition to the board for a declaratory judgment.that november the board appointed a hearing committee chaired by norman thayer the thayer committee to consider the petition.while the thayer committee was considering the petition,the disciplinary charges were stayed.when the thayer committee had not reached a decision by december,stein moved the committee for judgment,contending that the legal advertising committee had defaulted.plaintiffs claim that the thayer committee never responded.
meanwhile,in july the board had filed a second set of allegations against stein,apparently arising out of his representation of a client.a year later a board hearing committee found four violations of ethical requirements.the new mexico supreme court imposed sanctions on stein in september.
on july,plaintiffs filed the current lawsuit stein iv in federal district court.the original complaint contended that plaintiffs rights were violated by a state rule protecting the confidentiality of disciplinary proceedings.this state rule is not at issue on appeal.
on august,stein renewed his motion before the thayer committee for a default judgment on his petition.in a letter dated september,ferrara disclosed to stein and the attorney for the legal advertising committee that the thayer committee had already filed its opinion which said that the committee had no authority to issue declaratory judgments.she also informed them that the new mexico supreme court had been requested to appoint a special panel to review the opinion.ferrara letter apologized for the oversight in not providing the attorneys with copies of the opinion.but in a letter dated september,she explained to stein that the parties had not been provided with copies because findings are generally distributed to the parties when the board chair announces which board members will serve as a panel to review the committee opinion,and no panel had yet been designated.in that letter she also wrote that the reason for requesting a special review panel composed of persons not members of the board was that plaintiffs were suing the board.
at the time that stein learned of the thayer committee opinion,plaintiffs appeal in their third federal case,stein iii,was pending before this court.the district court had dismissed the case after finding that the conditions requiring younger abstention continued to be met.see stein iii,d.on october,one month before the scheduled oral argument,the new mexico supreme court sua sponte ordered the plaintiffs and the legal advertising committee to show cause why the court should not reject the thayer committee opinion that it did not have jurisdiction to consider a declaratory action and remand the matter to the board.on october,the supreme court ruled that the board did have the authority to consider a declaratory action and sent the case back to the board.
in this court december,decision in the stein iii appeal,we took judicial notice of the october order of the new mexico supreme court and upheld the district court dismissal of the case.see stein legal advertising comm.of disciplinary.cir unpublished.we explained the state of new mexico is attempting to provide stein with a forum to present his federal challenges to new mexico attorney advertising rules t he proceedings continue to meet the conditions that require a younger abstention.id.at.
on january,the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in this action,including,in addition to its previous challenge to the state confidentiality rule,new claims under arising from disciplinary counsel handling of the thayer committee opinion and the october and july charges and the supreme court issuance of the order and rejection of the thayer committee opinion.count iii of the complaint alleges that ferrara acted in violation of plaintiffs rights in not timely serving stein with the thayer committee opinion and by contacting the supreme court ex parte to request a special committee to review that opinion.it also alleges that she wrongfully supplied the supreme court with a copy of the thayer committee opinion.count iv alleges various improprieties in the handling of the july charges,including that the ethical charges were baseless and filed against stein in retaliation for plaintiffs federal lawsuit,that and karni failed to investigate adequately the accusations of stein ethical violations,that they failed to provide him with proper notice of the charges,that they failed to produce discovery when required to do so,and that they failed to take action when they realized that one of their witnesses had lied to keep information from plaintiffs.the count also alleges that,karni,and virginia ferrara became overly friendly with the complainant.ferrara,it contends,approved the actions of and karni and did not adequately supervise them or respond to complaints about their conduct.and count v alleges that the supreme court issuance of the order and its rejection of the thayer committee opinion were without jurisdiction and in violation of plaintiffs and rights.
defendants moved for dismissal or summary judgment.among their contentions were that the challenges were not ripe for adjudication that the allegations against ferrara regarding her handling of the thayer committee opinion failed to state a constitutional claim and she was entitled to qualified immunity that disciplinary counsel were entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity for their actions regarding the july charges and that the justices of the new mexico supreme court were entitled to judicial immunity for their issuance of the order and the opinion rejecting the thayer committee opinion.plaintiffs responded to these arguments on the merits they also moved for limited discovery and for leave to amend their complaint thereafter.
the district court dismissed the claims challenging the state rule,agreeing that they did not present a case or controversy.it granted summary judgment on the claims,holding that they were barred by absolute prosecutorial and judicial immunity.the court also denied the plaintiffs motions for limited discovery and for leave to amend on the grounds that no rule entitles a party to discovery for the purpose of amending a complaint,that the claims the plaintiffs sought to add were distinct in time,parties,and relevance from the complaint before the court,joint app.vol.at,and that the plaintiffs had failed to comply with a local rule requiring the proposed amendment to accompany the motion to amend.
ii.discussion 
plaintiffs appeal the grant of summary judgment on their claims but do not challenge the dismissal of the claims regarding the state confidentiality rule.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard that applies in district court.see allstate ins.murray motor imports,cir.summary judgment is proper if the pleadings,depositions,answers to interrogatories,and admissions on file,together with the affidavits,if any,show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.id.quoting.c.
the conclusion of plaintiffs opening brief also requests that we order the district court to permit limited discovery and an amended complaint,but the brief fails to present any argument on these issues,so we decline to address them.see adler stores,cir arguments inadequately briefed are waived.
absolute immunity 
the district court held that all defendants were absolutely immune from suit under.the supreme court has recognized the defense of absolute immunity from civil rights suits in several contexts involving the judicial process.snell tunnell,cir.as we have explained 
the rationale for this defense is to incorporate traditional common law immunities and to allow functionaries in the judicial system the latitude to perform their tasks absent the threat of retaliatory litigation.because the judicial system often resolves disputes that the parties can not,the system portends conflict.win or lose,a party may seek to litigate the constitutionality of circumstances which required him to endure a lawsuit or suffer defeat.such suits by dissatisfied parties might target judges,prosecutors and witnesses.though such suits might be satisfying personally for a plaintiff,they could jeopardize the judicial system ability to function.
id.at.footnote and citations omitted.typically,judges,prosecutors,and witnesses enjoy absolute immunity.see id.at valdez city and county of denver,cir.but such immunity is not always available to them.the supreme court has adopted a functional approach that is,immunity is justified and defined by the functions it protects and serves,not by the person to whom it attaches.forrester white,d.
specific claims 
handling by counsel of thayer committee decision 
count iii alleges that chief disciplinary counsel ferrara violated plaintiffs rights under the fourteenth amendment when she did not timely serve a copy of the thayer committee opinion on plaintiffs and opposing counsel,and she improperly contacted the new mexico supreme court by supplying it with a written copy of the thayer committee opinion and requesting the appointment of a special committee of persons who were not members of the board to review that opinion.the district court held that ferrara was protected against these claims by prosecutorial immunity.we understand plaintiffs to be arguing that ferrara is entitled only to qualified immunity,rather than absolute immunity,because her acts were administrative in nature.
in addition to investigating and prosecuting disciplinary actions,counsel for the board perform administrative functions.the new mexico supreme court has charged disciplinary counsel with maintain ing permanent records of all matters processed and the disposition thereof,and acting as the general administrative officer for the disciplinary board under its direction and supervision.rule c.vesting this mix of functions in one person can obscure the line between acts taken by the chief disciplinary counsel as a prosecutor and acts taken by the chief disciplinary counsel as an administrator.but prosecutorial immunity applies only to actions taken by a prosecutor in the role of advocate.see,kalina fletcher,d.in our view,the allegations against ferrara in count iii do not emanate from her role as an advocate.we now proceed to explain why,beginning with a brief description of the new mexico procedures.
under the new mexico disciplinary rules,formal hearings are conducted by a hearing committee appointed by the board.see rules a appointment of a hearing committee,hearings.after conducting the hearing,the committee issues findings of fact,conclusions,and a recommended disposition,which it transmits to the board.see id.d.the board chairman is then to transmit copies of the committee opinion to disciplinary counsel,the respondent,and respondent counsel.see id.before rendering its decision,the board or a panel of board members may permit briefing and oral argument,but will not consider evidence other than what is in the hearing committee record.see id.the board decision is subject to review by the state supreme court.see id.
turning first to ferrara failure to notify stein of the hearing committee opinion,the rules provide that the method of transmission is from the hearing committee to the board chairman to the respondent stein.if ferrara was to assist in that transmission,it would not be as a party to the proceeding after all,the chief disciplinary counsel is to be notified by the board chair at the same time as the respondent is notified.see id.d.rather,her involvement in any notification would be as an accommodation to the board and the hearing committee.such involvement should be treated as action in her capacity as administrator for the board.
we reach the same conclusion as to ferrara notifying the supreme court of the hearing committee opinion so that it could appoint a panel as an alternative to a panel of board members.this was not the action of a party seeking relief from a higher authority.she was not appealing the committee opinion.the opinion by itself has no effect.it is a report and a recommendation,akin to a report and recommendation to a federal district court from a magistrate judge.the actual decision must be made by a panel of board members.ordinarily,selection of the panel would be the duty of the board chair.see id.a.but with all board members apparently disqualified by stein suit against the board,ferrara had to notify the state supreme court of the need for special action.her notification to that court was,again,an act in her capacity as administrator for the board,not as an advocate.that the new mexico supreme court proceeded to take the matter itself,rather than appoint a special panel of members,was not the consequence of her appealing a board decision to the court which could well be characterized as part of her prosecutorial duties.she filed no such appeal.
in short,as ferrara acknowledges,t
