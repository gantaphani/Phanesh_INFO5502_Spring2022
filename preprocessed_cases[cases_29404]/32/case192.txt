attorney and respondent sanford ehrmann was sued by his former client,appellant norman fritz,for malpractice in connection with a promissory note prepared by ehrmann in.the malpractice action was filed in,approximately seven months after ehrmann was replaced as counsel in litigation that ensued over an ambiguity in the note.the court granted ehrmann motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds,ruling that the statute accrued and ran on the malpractice action many years before ehrmann began to represent fritz in the prior litigation.we conclude that the facts do not indisputably show that the statute accrued until shortly before the prior litigation commenced.we further hold that the statute was tolled while ehrmann represented fritz in that litigation under the continuous representation tolling provision of the attorney malpractice statute of limitations.accordingly,it was error to rule that the statute of limitations barred the action as a matter of undisputed fact.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
factual and procedural background 
the underlying malpractice complaint 
on november,fritz brought suit against ehrmann.the complaint alleged that ehrmann committed legal malpractice in,when fritz retained him to negotiate and draft a promissory note made payable to fritz with third parties shirish,pushpa,arun,and priti patel the patels as the payees or maker.according to the complaint,ehrmann failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in performing legal services in connection with the note.
motion for summary judgment 
ehrmann moved for summary judgment.comparing the parties competing statements of facts establishes that the following facts were undisputed by either side in,fritz sold a motel to the patels in return for a promissory note secured by a deed of trust in the amount of,with interest at percent.the note called for interest only payments,and for the principal to be due and payable at the end of the note term.in addition,for the first five years,of the interest was to be deferred and paid at the end of the note term the amount of deferred interest that accrued under this provision was.
the original note stated that the maker reserves the privilege of making principal reduction payments in whole or in part at any time without penalty.in september,fritz entered into an oral agreement with the patels whereby they agreed not to prepay the note in exchange for a reduction in interest from percent to percent.fritz then asked ehrmann to prepare a new promissory note to reflect the parties understanding.ehrmann had been fritz lawyer for many years and had represented him with respect to numerous matters the second note prepared by ehrmann contained the new interest rate,but was silent as to the deferred interest and contained the same provision as in the original note allowing the patels to prepay principal the entire principal sum continued to be due on september.the patels executed the second note in or around september 
the patels made monthly interest payments on the second note until november.at that time,they submitted a partial prepayment of principal in the amount of,which fritz accepted.in august,the patels proffered a second partial repayment of principal in the amount of.fritz accepted that payment as well.in january,the patels made their last final payment to pay off note in full via two for and one for.fritz accepted these checks.however,when the patels requested a reconveyance of the deed of trust secured by the note,fritz contended that they still owed him the deferred interest of.
the patels brought suit to clear their title to the motel in june.appellant filed a seeking payment of the deferred interest.ehrmann represented appellant in the lawsuit until april,when a substitution of attorney was filed.the lawsuit was settled in october,with the patels agreeing to pay fritz an additional in return for reconveyance of the deed of trust.as we have seen,the underlying malpractice complaint was filed one month later.according to both parties statements of undisputed facts,ehrmann admitted that he mistakenly failed to include provisions in the second promissory note regarding the deferred interest and precluding the patels from making a of principal and the second promissory note prepared by ehrmann was allegedly deficient in that it still provided that the patels could,and was ambiguous with respect to the issue of the deferred interest.
the basis for summary judgment was that,despite the admitted deficiencies in the second note,the statute of limitations provided a complete defense.ehrmann took the position that fritz suffered actual harm either when the note was signed in or in november,when the patels prepaid some of the principal on the note.he argued that the statute of limitations accrued on the date of injury and that his representation of fritz in the litigation with the patels over the note until april was not continuous,as required to toll the statute.as ehrmann saw it,by the time he agreed to represent fritz in the litigation over the note,the statute of limitations had already expired.
in a declaration submitted in opposition to the motion for summary judgment,fritz explained that when he accepted the first prepayment from the patels,he did not know about the flaws in the promissory note and did not know that the patels intended to object to paying the deferred interest.the prepayment came about because shirish patel called and asked permission to make an early principal payment,explaining that it would be a good idea for tax purposes.fritz agreed to accept the payment on that basis.
in his reply,ehrmann contended that fritz declaration was contradicted by a declaration he submitted in the patel lawsuit.the referenced declaration primarily discussed the in deferred interest,which appears to have been the focus of the patel lawsuit.in refuting the argument that he had intended to waive payment of the deferred interest in the agreement that preceded the september note,fritz had stated there would be no reason in the world for me to reduce the interest rate in and do away with in principal that was due to me,just to receive a prepayment penalty clause that i never received anyway.there was no tax savings to me to avoid payment in full on the note in just to reduce the interest rate and give away especially in light of the fact that the patels prepaid the modified note anyway.
the court granted the motion for summary judgment,stating in its order that t here is no triable issue of material fact with respect to when fritz suffered actual injury.judgment was entered,and this appeal followed.
discussion 
section of the code of civil procedure section,the special statute of limitations for attorney malpractice actions,provides in pertinent part an action against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission,other than for actual fraud,arising in the performance of professional services shall be commenced within one year after the plaintiff discovers,or through the use of reasonable diligence should have discovered,the facts constituting the wrongful act or omission,or four years from the date of the wrongful act or omission,whichever occurs first.in no event shall the time for commencement of legal action exceed four years except that the period shall be tolled during the time that any of the following exist the plaintiff has not sustained actual injury the attorney continues to represent the plaintiff regarding the specific subject matter in which the alleged wrongful act or omission occurred.
because of the tolling provisions,it is often the case that neither the date the plaintiff acquires knowledge of wrongdoing nor the date of the wrongful act is meaningful in determining whether the statute of limitations has run.injury may not occur until much later,and attorneys,having been alerted to a potential mistake,generally will do all they can to rectify the matter by representing the client during any litigation that ensues.
for many years,the majority of courts believed that injury did not occur until settlement or entry of final judgment in any litigation that arose from or was related to the neglectful conduct.see,karno biddle th,d.the supreme court adopted such a rule for certain types of malpractice in itt small business finance niles cal th,d,itt,wherein the court held that in transactional legal malpractice cases,when the adequacy of the documentation is the subject of dispute,an action for attorney malpractice accrues on entry of adverse judgment,settlement,or dismissal of the underlying action.id.at,d.however,the holding in itt was called into question by the court later decision in adams paul cal th,d,which held that i n the classic missed statute situation,in which the attorney negligently fails to file the underlying lawsuit within the applicable statutory period and does nothing further,the plaintiff suffers actual harm at the time the statutory period lapses because,assuming the claim was otherwise viable,the right remedy of recovery on the action has been substantially impaired.id.at,d.
the supreme court recognized a discrepancy between the two holdings,and itt was formally overruled in jordache enterprises,brobeck,phleger harrison cal th,d,jordache.in jordache,the supreme court explained that the actual injury tolling provision contained in section,subdivision a was derived from the case of budd nixen cal d,budd,wherein the court had said if the allegedly negligent conduct does not cause damage,it generates no cause of action in tort.citation.the mere breach of a professional duty,causing only nominal damages,speculative harm,or the threat of future yet not suffice to create a cause of action for negligence.citations.hence,until the client suffers appreciable harm as a consequence of the attorney negligence,the client can not establish a cause of action for malpractice.jordache,supra,cal th at,d,quoting budd,supra,cal d at.
the court in jordache further explained that the actual injury provision in section,subdivision a,effectively continues the accrual rule budd established.under budd,the cause of action could not accrue until the plaintiff suffered actual loss or damage resulting from the allegedly negligent conduct.citation.after sustaining damages compensable in a negligence action,the plaintiff could establish a cause of action for professional negligence,and the limitations period commenced.citation.under section,the limitations period commences when the plaintiff actually or constructively discovers the facts of the wrongful act or omission,but the period is tolled until the plaintiff sustains actual injury.id.at.
the court contrasted actual injury,which causes the statute to accrue,with speculative or contingent damage,which does not s peculative and contingent injuries are those that do not yet exist,as when an attorney error creates only a potential for harm in the future.citation.an existing injury is not contingent or speculative simply because future events may affect its permanency or the amount of monetary damages eventually incurred.citations.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.
the facts in jordache illustrate the supreme court interpretation of the term actual injury.the client in that case jordache learned of a potential mistake made by its former attorneys brobeck in december when new counsel explained that jordache should have presented a claim to its insurers in after being sued for allegedly marketing counterfeit guess jeans.new counsel tendered defense of the action to jordache insurers in.but one of the defenses raised by the insurers was untimely notice and substantial prejudice.the legal malpractice action against brobeck was not filed until several years later,after jordache settled the original action and received a partial reimbursement from a separate settlement with its insurers.at the time of the settlement,a ruling had been issued by the trial court stating that whether one of the insurers had been substantially prejudiced by the late notice was an issue of fact that could not be determined on summary judgment.
on these facts,jordache argued that the statute of limitations did not accrue or was tolled until the insurers settled for a lesser amount than might have been obtained had the claim been presented in.the brobeck firm contended that that statute began to run in,because by that time,jordache had knowledge of the alleged mistake and had incurred actual injury in the form of monies used for defense costs in the underlying action that might otherwise have been paid by the insurers.the trial court agreed with brobeck and entered judgment.the court of appeal sided with jordache,and reversed.
the supreme court agreed with the trial court actual injury refers only to the legally cognizable damage necessary to assert the cause of action.there is no requirement that an adjudication or settlement must first confirm a causal nexus between the attorney error and the asserted injury.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.instead,the court held,t he test for actual injury under section turns on the issue of whether the plaintiff has sustained any damages compensable in an action,other than one for actual fraud,against an attorney for a wrongful act or omission arising in the performance of professional services.id.at,d.distinguishing between an actual,existing injury that might be remedied or reduced in the future,and a speculative or contingent injury that might or might not arise in the future,the court concluded that jordache sustained actual injury no later than because by then it had expended millions of dollars to defend the original action and lost millions of dollars from profitable investments forgone to pay defense costs.id.at,d.these actual,existing injuries,and the diminution of jordache insurance policy rights the late tender occasioned,did not first arise when the coverage litigation was settled.ibid.
the supreme court was clear in jordache that the determination of when attorney error has caused actual injury under section,subdivision a,can not depend on facile,bright line rules.citation.instead,the particular facts of each case must be examined in light of the wrongful act or omission the plaintiff alleges against the attorney.id.at,d.the court stated that,generally,the facts and circumstances of each case must be analyzed by the trier of fact to determine when the plaintiff sustained actual injury.jordache,supra,cal th at,d.however,w hen the material facts are undisputed,the trial court can resolve the question as a matter of law ibid.
applying these standards to the present case,it is apparent that there were two potential bases for injury to fritz from ehrmann negligence in drafting the second note.first,he could have been injured by the patels prepayment of principal,assuming he could not thereafter reinvest the principal and obtain a similar rate of return.second,he could have been injured by the failure to specify in the note that the deferred interest was to be repaid at the end of the term.both injuries were speculative at the time of the preparation of the note.the patels might never have had the funds or the inclination to prepay principal,and they might have paid the deferred interest in accord with the parties original understanding without regard to any ambiguity in the second note.
our conclusion that injury was still speculative and contingent in is supported by the supreme court decision in adams paul in which it states that in some circumstances,the actual loss of the underlying remedy may remain contingent,that is,the attorney negligence may have created only the potential for future harm.adams paul,supra,cal th at,d.the court gave as an example an attorney negligent preparation of trust documents,where damage did not occur until the trust was challenged and plaintiffs were force to pay legal fees to defend the documents,quoting horne peckham d.like the negligent preparation of trust documents,and unlike the failure to file a lawsuit within the statute of limitations,ehrmann alleged acts and omissions in may never have led to any harm.see baltins james th,d baltins date that husband,acting on advice of counsel,signed a quitclaim deed conveying community property of his first marriage to his second wife was not the date of actual injury for malpractice purposes instead it presented only a threat of future yet realized because t hat action created only a potential for adverse consequences until the first wife challenged the transfer and the trial court ruled against the couple.
ehrmann takes the position that if summary judgment can not be based on actual injury occurring in,such injury occurred no later than november,when the patels asked for and received permission to prepay a lump sum of principal.ehrmann avers that injury resulted because fritz lost the right to collect additional interest on the prepaid principal.we do not agree either that fritz necessarily suffered injury when some of the principal was prepaid or that injury from prepayment of principal caused the statute of limitations to run on the deferred interest claim.fritz stated in his declaration that shirish patel sought and received his permission to submit the partial prepayment and that,at the time,both parties were operating under the assumption that prepayment was not permitted under the terms of the second note he stated that he decided to accept the partial prepayment after being persuaded there would be tax benefits to receiving the principal in increments over several years.if the facts are as fritz contended,the partial repayment caused him no injury.the provision forbidding prepayment was for his benefit.if he chose to waive a provision both parties believed the note contained,he suffered no actual harm.
ehrmann contends that fritz declaration submitted in opposition to the underlying summary judgment should be disregarded because it contradicted a declaration submitted in the patel litigation.in the earlier declaration,he had stated there would be no reason in the world for me to reduce the interest rate in and do away with in principal that was due to me,just to receive a prepayment penalty clause that i never received anyway.there was no tax savings to me to avoid payment in full on the note in just to reduce the interest rate and give away especially in light of the fact that the patels prepaid the modified note anyway.we do not agree that this prolix statement contradicts fritz underlying declaration.ehrmann interpretation is that fritz was saying there was no tax savings at all from avoiding payment in full in a single year.it seems more likely that he was trying to convey that there was no tax savings worth and a reduced interest rate.in either event,the statement has no bearing on whether there were tax savings to be had by spreading principal payments out over three years rather than having to declare a lump sum as income in.moreover,even under the broadest interpretation,the statement only goes to fritz motive for waiving a prepayment prohibition that he and the patels believed existed.he needed no reason to waive the provision,and the declaration from the patel litigation did not contradict that shirish patel asked for and received permission to prepay,and that both parties believed permission was required under the terms of the second note.
ehrmann also contends that fritz declaration was contradicted by his discovery responses in which he stated that ehrmann committed malpractice both by failing to account for the deferred interest and by failing to include the prepayment prohibition in the second note and that he fritz was entitled to recover from ehrmann as damages interest on the from the date of breach until the present as well as interest on the amounts that should not have been.the former is a simple statement of fact or at least of the facts as fritz understands them.the latter appears to be an attempt to keep the issue of damages from prepaid principal alive without stating that there were any such damages.neither is directly contradictory to the underlying declaration.
more importantly,the injury fritz may or may not have suffered in november from the failure to amend the prepayment clause in the second note should be analyzed separately from the injury caused by the failure to account for the deferred interest.the deferred sum was not due until,and fritz purportedly had no reason to believe that the patels would refuse to pay due to the omission in the second note until sometime after january.
the trial court apparently believed that both injuries should be seen as one event.the notion that a portion of a malpractice claim should defeat the entire claim is not supported by any authority it was expressly rejected in baltins,supra,th,d.plaintiff there had consulted defendant attorney in in connection with the dissolution of his marriage.in,he and his second wife also a plaintiff retained defendant to oppose the first wife motion to set aside the marital property division and support judgment.the second wife motion was granted in.defendant initially continued to represent plaintiffs during the appeal and process.he gave them further advice about how to deal with the disputed property and the first wife support claims pending resolution of the appeal.in,plaintiffs terminated defendant.in,the court of appeal affirmed the trial court orders regarding the dissolution.also in,the first wife brought claims based on actions plaintiffs had undertaken on defendant advice regarding putting the second wife name on disputed property,and plaintiffs incurred substantial attorneys fees and other damages as a result.the couple filed a malpractice action against defendant in.the trial court sustained a demurrer on statute of limitations grounds to plaintiffs original complaint and to their first amended complaint.
on appeal,defendant argued that all of plaintiffs damages flowed from the trial court order,which had been alleged as a basis for the plaintiffs malpractice in the original complaint but had been dropped in the amended complaint.explaining why the amended complaint did not represent an attempt to avoid demurrer by omitting essential facts or pleading inconsistent facts,the court stated here the plaintiffs have not omitted facts without explanation or pleaded inconsistent facts to avoid the statute of limitations.instead,they have dropped their claims for negligence related to the orders setting aside the initial property division and increasing the husband support obligations,and to defense of the collateral lawsuit.they reasserted only the claims that defendant negligently advised them about the prior appeal effect,and that the negligent advice caused the second wife embroilment in the property division dispute and the finding that the husband violated fiduciary duties.the allegations in the amended complaint are consistent with those in the original complaint.where the original complaint essentially alleged three instances of negligent conduct,and three types of resulting damage,the amended complaint alleges only the negligent advice and the damages related to that advice.consequently,we do not concern ourselves with the superseded negligence claims.baltins,supra,th at,d.
here,as in baltins,there were two separate and distinct acts of negligence with separate and distinct potential injuries and statutes of limitations.injury from prepayment of principal could arise at any time during the note term injury from the failure to address the deferred interest would not necessarily manifest itself until it became due at the note end.we perceive no reason why fritz could not simply have omitted all discussion of the prepayment prohibition and gone forward with the complaint based on impairment of the deferred interest only.the fact that the former may have been barred by the statute of limitations does not mean the latter must be similarly barred.
our conclusion that the statute of limitations did not accrue in or for purposes of the deferred interest portion of fritz claim does not end our inquiry.the facts put forth in ehrmann papers established that the patels refused to pay the deferred interest and that fritz became aware that their refusal was due to ambiguity in the second note sometime between january,when the patels claimed to have made their last final payment,and june,when they filed the quiet title lawsuit.the malpractice action was not filed until november.ehrmann alleged that even if the statute accrued in,fi
