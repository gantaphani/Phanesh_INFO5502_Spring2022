the inspector general of the legal services corporation petitioned for summary enforcement of a subpoena to appellant legal services of new york city.the district court granted the petition,and appellant now seeks review.we affirm.
appellant provides legal services to the poor.each year,it and other grantees receive federal grants administered through the legal services corporation.in a series of audits beginning in,the corporation inspector general discovered improprieties in some grantees reports to the commonly,overstatement of the number of cases handled and failure to keep adequate records.that led the general accounting office to audit five grantees,including appellant,and it concluded that of the cases reported by these grantees,approximately were questionable.expressing concerns about the inaccuracies in grantees reports,a congressional committee requested that the inspector general assess the case service information provided by the grantees and report no later than july,as to its accuracy.
the inspector general then required grantees,including appellant,to produce for inspection two different sets of data on the cases they had reported closed during.the first production,or data call,required that for each case,identified only by case number,the grantee must select one of problem codes to describe the subject matter of the representation.the problem codes vary from the specific parental rights termination,black lung to the general education,and the other individual rights,other miscellaneous.appellant complied with the first data call.
the second data call required that for each case,again identified only by case number,grantees identify their client.appellant,along with one other grantee,refused to comply.it informed the inspector general that,absent client consent,both privilege and its attorneys professional obligations prevented it from disclosing client names associated with case numbers,because to do so would allow the inspector general to match client names with the problem codes previously produced.that linkage,appellant argued,would impermissibly reveal the subject matter of clients representations.though the inspector general disagreed that production was barred,he nevertheless proposed to set up a chinese wall separate staffs,equipment,storage,prevent any linkage.the inspector general then issued subpoenas for the data.appellant refused to comply,and the inspector general petitioned the district court for summary enforcement.
the district court granted the petition.it rejected appellant blanket claim of privilege as insufficient to demonstrate privilege regarding any given record.the court also turned aside appellant claim based on professional obligations,holding that the subpoenas were within the inspector general statutory powers.appellant had contended that the subpoenas were in addition unduly burdensome because the same verification could be performed without the damage this disclosure might cause to clients perceptions of confidentiality,but the court deferred to the inspector general as to requirements of the audit appellant renews its arguments here.
the inspector general contends,and the district court agreed,that appellant has not made out a valid claim of privilege.in rejecting appellant unparticularized assertion of privilege,the court stated that its ruling was not intended to foreclose specific claims of privilege as to individual clients.d at.in other words,as to some matters,appellant might be able to introduce contextual information demonstrating that the representation subject matter is itself confidential.in its reply brief,appellant expressly reserves the right to present particularized privilege claims to the district court in the event that we reject its unparticularized claim.this possibility led us to question our jurisdiction.appellant asserts that it lies under,which authorizes review of district courts final decisions,or in the alternative under a,which provides for interlocutory appeals from district court orders regarding injunctions.
we find no authority for treating an order enforcing a subpoena as an injunction appealable under a.courts have consistently held that grand jury and civil subpoenas are not injunctions appealable under that provision.see,united states ryan,d.review is instead procured by refusing to comply and litigating the subpoena validity in the contempt proceeding that ensues.see id.at.office of thrift supervision dobbs.administrative subpoenas are horses of a slightly different color,since upon noncompliance the issuing agency seeks enforcement in the district court.see app.a kemp gay.the ensuing district court order,either granting or denying enforcement,is appealable under once final.see id.at.in light of that there is even less reason to regard an administrative subpoena,either before or after enforcement,as an injunction.
section,which authorizes appeals of district courts final decisions,presents a more viable jurisdictional ground.as noted,orders enforcing administrative subpoenas are appealable under once final.see ftc invention submission.here,however,the district court has indicated its willingness to entertain particularized claims of privilege.see d at.so it can be asked why the order is final.the answer lies in the breadth of appellant claim.it argues that the privilege properly understood allows it to refuse to provide any more justification for invoking the privilege than it has.it is not obliged to offer a particularized showing in individual situations.since this argument is phrased so broadly,it follows that the district judge rejection of it is final even though he offers the possibility of more limited relief in individual cases.that is so because under appellant view of the scope of the privilege his order would encroach on the privilege.
the considerations we employ to evaluate finality are more practical than technical and do not require that the order appealed be the last order possible in the matter.see gillespie united states steel,d in re grand jury investigation,per curiam in this case,the matters potentially remaining to be resolved below are substantively different than the claims disputed on appeal,would arise if at all only upon rejection of the appealed claims,and would require of appellant a potentially onerous effort.in other words,the potential inefficiencies of a piecemeal appeal do not outweigh the danger of hardship and denial of justice through delay.dickinson petroleum conversion.insofar as appellant contends that the current record justifies an assertion of privilege without particularized showings,we have jurisdiction over that claim.
unfortunately for appellant,although its claim is phrased broadly enough to provide us jurisdiction,its very breadth is untenable.courts have consistently held that the general subject matters of clients representations are not privileged.see,in re grand jury subpoena,cir.nor does the general purpose of a client representation necessarily divulge a confidential professional communication,and therefore that data is not generally privileged.to be sure,there are exceptions,but as always the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the privilege lies with those asserting it.see in re lindsey,per curiam in re sealed case.that burden requires a showing that the privilege applies to each communication for which it is asserted,see lindsey,at,which,of course,appellant has not done.
we turn to appellant contention that the subpoena conflicts with its attorneys professional obligations and is unduly burdensome,which the district court flatly rejected.appellant explains that new york state and american bar association ethics rules protect both privileged information,discussed above,and unprivileged information deemed secret.see model rules of prof l conduct cmt.of prof l responsibility dr a.those rules preclude attorneys from revealing any or to the representation of a client who has not consented to the disclosure,particularly where that information would be embarrassing or detrimental to the client.see model rule a dr b
