as his first witness,brownstein called john eustace,who had an extensive history performing mental health evaluations.eustace first saw brownstein in late december,after the bar grievance proceedings began.in his opinion,brownstein had a seriously advanced major depressive disorder.brownstein met seven out of nine criteria for major depressive disorder and eighteen out of the criteria on the beck depression scale.he further asserted that this disorder was recurrent,affecting three different periods of brownstein life.the prior episodes did not last as long,however,and were less serious.based on his diagnosis,eustace recommended that brownstein become involved in a comprehensive program of mental health treatment,including medication,individual treatment,and family treatment.eustace last saw brownstein shortly before testifying and stated it was his opinion that there was marked improvement,including his observations that brownstein was no longer exhibiting suicidal ideations,had more energy,was beginning to interact with family and friends,and was willing to face the consequences of his bad acts.eustace opinion was that the misconduct was a symptom of the but for the depression,he would not have committed the acts.
brownstein then called myer cohen,the executive director of florida lawyers assistance fla,who discussed how fla supervises the attorneys who have signed contracts with them.as his third witness,brownstein called tod aronovitz,one of his friends.aronovitz testified that he noticed that there was a period of several years where brownstein was not as happy as he was more serious or melancholy than usual.in december,brownstein talked to aronovitz about the problems he was having.aronovitz never would have guessed brownstein could have a problem with the bar because brownstein had a very high reputation in the legal community and was regarded as an honest person.although aronovitz was not familiar with all of the charges against brownstein,he asserted that any misconduct was an devoted his entire life to doing things right.
next,brownstein called ester sardina,his executive assistant and former secretary.when she first started working for him,brownstein was upbeat and generous,a good boss and person.however,around may,he changed.he started asking her to hold his calls and would shut the door and lie on his couch.he would show up for work later and later.although this behavior appeared rarely at first,it progressed and became more frequent.clients would complain to her that he was not returning their calls.when she walked into the office,he was frequently asleep on his couch with his light off.in fact,the behavior was so obvious that the other secretaries kidded her about what an easy job she had since her boss just slept.brownstein paid her salary himself,and a few times the checks bounced.sardina also learned that brownstein failed to pay to the government the withholding taxes from her salary.brownstein also did not pay the payroll taxes which were owed for sardina social security benefits.through the date of the hearing,these payments still were not made.
brownstein was the final witness.he first detailed his years as an attorney.although there were times in his life when he was not functioning on all cylinders,brownstein did not admit his condition or seek medical treatment until after the bar began its investigation in.the last episode of the depression lasted for a significant period and got progressively worse until it was a struggle to come to his office at all.he tried to work but could not function,so he would lie down and sleep for hours.rather than confront the problem,he withdrew further.
brownstein discussed the misconduct relating to the strax matter first.while he was generally in a depressed mood during this time,there were times when he was up for a few days,until his mood took another.brownstein explained how during one of his great lucid moments,he convinced the client that his firm had the ability to defend the strax case.the client chose brownstein as its attorney,and brownstein helped settle the matter for,which was significantly less than the high amount initially sought by the trustees.brownstein was also able to get the insurance company to assume half of the coverage.the client paid,which went into the firm trust account,and the insurance company paid the other,which went into the brownstein trust account.brownstein paid the trustee the that was in the firm trust account and then paid the trustee from the brownstein trust account,leaving due.brownstein,however,used this money for personal uses.when the trustee asked about the remaining funds due,brownstein lied,telling the trustee that the money had not come in yet but that he would pay it himself if there was any problem recovering it.after months passed,the trustee filed a motion to compel settlement.brownstein borrowed the missing money from a friend and then gave a cashier check to the trustee,who withdrew the motion to compel settlement.
when he was asked whether he had ever used trust account money before,brownstein testified that he remembered taking a client funds once in the and then putting the money back into the trust account.from the period of through,he did use trust account funds for his own use,although he could not recall on how many occasions this occurred.when he did take out any money,brownstein stated that he put it back again,and no client ever complained or lost money.
when asked why he did this,he told the court that he had no excuse but that he was not mentally healthy during the time.he then explained how different he was from his normal self and how his depression affected all aspects of his life.when asked whether his motive in taking the money was selfish or dishonest,brownstein replied,i do think so.i do believe so.dishonest,i guess,is a relative term.by taking it,i knew that it was improper.so i ca say.he denied that he was trying to deprive his client of any money,asserting that he could have easily borrowed the money from a number of people to pay back the money.
brownstein also addressed the charges of check kiting,explaining that even though he had two different accounts,one personal and one for the firm,the firm account was basically all his because the other partner had a different account.he explained that he would write a check,thinking that he had money coming in.when the money did not come in sufficiently to cover the checks he had already written,the bank called him,asking for him to cover it,so he would write a check from his other account.brownstein admitted that he knew he did not have the money in the account at that time.during the period in question,he used this as a mechanism when he was short of funds to solve the problem until he got the money.the bank charged him fees for the bounced checks,and since the money eventually came in,he asserted that the bank was not out any money.the bank never closed his accounts because of this problem.
brownstein also admitted to other misconduct that was not charged.brownstein had not filed income tax returns for the years,and.he also failed to pay his secretary irs taxes.at the time of the hearing,brownstein asserted that he was attempting to rectify the irs problem by hiring a certified public accountant to prepare the necessary documents to resolve the problems regarding his delinquent taxes and his secretary withholding taxes.brownstein also admitted that he failed to give the bar all of the records they needed and asserted that he did not have any client ledger cards and journal.while brownstein recognized that he knew he should have a client ledger,he testified that he did not have a high volume of clients with trust fund about thirty clients over four it was simpler not to have one.brownstein explained that the reason why he failed to turn over all of his records when they were first subpoenaed was because at that time,brownstein was avoiding anything that could be a conflict,including requesting money from his friends.he did not want to take any affirmative action,even though he knew that by not acting,the consequences would be far worse.brownstein further asserted that he believed this was the same reason why he failed to file his tax was not emotionally ready to sit down and think about those matters.
at the time the misconduct began,brownstein was grossing up to to a month.in fact,a couple of years before,brownstein made up to approximately a year on several occasions.this income subsequently dropped to.brownstein explained that even though he was in a deep depression,he was still able to make a relatively high salary because he did a lot of nominal work for one client that did not take a lot of concentration.in addition,based on his good reputation in the community,he also had referrals on a regular basis.he later learned,however,that because he was not getting all this work done,his firm starting pulling work from him.
brownstein asserted that at the time of the hearing,he was feeling much better,although he recognized that he was still not completely himself.he was now taking medication and saw a professional once a week.brownstein expressed his remorse,telling the referee that he felt as bad as one could feel because he knew that he had let down his family,his good friends who referred cases to him,and the bar as a whole.brownstein did not believe that this type of misconduct would occur in the future because he was better able to recognize the problem and he would not avoid treatment.at the same time,he also admitted that he needed more treatment before he could begin to practice law again.
the referee issued a written recommendation and report which found brownstein guilty of the following rule violations rule c a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation and rule d a lawyer shall not engage in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice of the rules of professional conduct and rule a nature of money or property entrusted to attorney rule b application of trust funds o
