this appeal presents the question whether a federal district court,in its criminal justice act plan,may require members of its indigent defense panel to be members not only of the district court own bar,but also of the state bar of california.we uphold the requirement.
background 
the criminal justice act,a,authorizes each federal district court to place in operation throughout the district a plan for furnishing representation for criminal defendants who are financially unable to obtain adequate representation.pursuant to this statute,the united states district court for the northern district of california issued,and the ninth circuit judicial council approved,general order.sets forth the criminal justice act plan for the northern district.the plan directs the chief judge of the district to appoint members of an administration committee,which is responsible for establish ing,maintain ing,and administer ing a panel of private attorneys who will represent indigent criminal defendants in the northern district,iii a.among other requirements,members of the indigent defense panel must be members in good standing of the bar of the northern district of california and of the state bar of california,iii c.
plaintiff jeffrey russell is a member of the northern district of california bar,but is not a member of the state bar of california.although the northern district of california currently conditions membership in its bar on membership in the state bar of california,russell is one of a number of lawyers who have been grandfathered into the northern district california bar from a time in which membership in the northern district did not depend on membership in the california bar russell complaint alleges that he has sixteen years experience prosecuting federal criminal cases as an assistant united states attorney,including six years in the northern district of california.
when russell applied for membership on the northern district indigent defense panel,his application was denied,as requires,on the ground that he is not a member of the california bar.russell then filed this action against the judges of the district court and the members of the ninth circuit judicial council,contending that contravenes various statutes and violates his constitutional rights.the district court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim,see.b,and denied leave to amend

discussion 
in his attempt to invalidate,russell raises ten contentions.he argues that violates 
title vii of the civil rights act,et.
the equal protection component of the fifth amendment 
the right and justice standard under this court supervisory authority 
the privileges and immunities clause of article iv,section 
the privileges or immunities clause of the fourteenth amendment 
the first amendment.
we conclude that none of these arguments has merit.we address russell contentions in turn.
does not violate.
russell contends that the district court criminal justice act plan is a rule within the meaning of,and that it is invalid because the district court failed to give public notice and provide an opportunity for comment as required by b.we conclude,however,that the plan is not a rule governed by.
it is true that congress amended in to provide that all rules of a district court must be promulgated under.see f.but that amendment adds nothing to russell argument it is still necessary to determine whether the plan is a rule.we conclude that it is not.
well before congress amended to make it the exclusive avenue for the promulgation of district court rule s,it had enacted the criminal justice act,which provided in the means for adopting a criminal justice plan to furnish representation for indigent defendants.this statute sets out in considerable detail the requisite components of a criminal justice plan,the means of selecting and paying counsel,the requirements for provision of other necessary services such as experts,authority for the establishment of federal public defender and community defender organizations,and other matters.there is no requirement of public notice and an opportunity for comment.
when congress amended to make it the exclusive authority for the promulgation of any rule of the district court,it indicated no intent to amend or repeal.nothing in the very general provisions of suggests that it is intended to substitute for or partially replace the detailed and specific provisions of regarding a criminal justice act plan for provision of counsel for indigent defendants to accept russell contention,we would have to conclude that congress,by the very general terms of,impliedly repealed,in whole or in part,the specific provisions of.all presumptions are against such a conclusion,and we decline to embrace it.see,hagen utah,d repeals by implication are disfavored morton mancari,d where there is no clear intention otherwise,a specific statute will not be controlled or nullified by a general one,regardless of the priority of enactment.
is not inconsistent with q and.
russell contends that is inconsistent with subsections and of q,which set forth requirements for counsel in federal death penalty cases.among other things,subsection requires that at least one attorney have been admitted to practice in the court in which the prosecution is to be tried for not less than five years.subsection requires that at least one attorney appointed after judgment must have been admitted to practice in the court of appeals for not less than five years.
we see no inconsistency between these requirements and those of.section q does not state that the requirements it sets forth are exclusive they are far more reasonably understood as minimum requirements for death penalty cases.for example,q does not expressly require any attorney to have been admitted to any state bar,or to have passed a bar examination anywhere.of course,an attorney admitted to and experienced in a federal court will certainly have done both,but that fact simply illustrates that federal courts may add requirements to those expressly set forth in q.section q is no obstacle to the validity of.
does not violate d.
russell next argument is that violates d,which provides,among other things,that e ach judicial council shall make all necessary and appropriate orders for the effective and expeditious administration of justice within its circuit.it provides further that a ny general order relating to practice and procedure issued by a judicial council shall be made or amended only after giving appropriate public notice and an opportunity for comment.this statute and its notice and comment requirement apply,however,only to orders that the judicial council itself makes,not to orders made by the district court.see d.in this case,the judicial council did not itself make an order,nor did it act pursuant to d when it approved the district court plan instead,it acted in compliance with,which requires that the judicial council approve the district court plan.as a consequence,d by its terms does not apply to the action taken by the judicial council here.
there is good reason why congress may have elected not to subject approvals made by the judicial council pursuant to to the same public notice requirement as orders made by the judicial council pursuant to d.the delegation of power to the judicial council under is much narrower than the delegation of power to it under d the council under can only approve one type of very specific plan created by the district court.congress could easily have concluded that there was no need to place a check on the power exercised by the judicial council under,while continuing to require the check of notice and comment under d.in any event,congress did not write a notice and comment requirement into,and that fact is sufficient to defeat russell argument.
does not violate.
russell contends that violates b,which provides that the rules authorized by subsection a shall not abridge,enlarge or modify any substantive right.he argues that the right to practice law is a privilege conferred under the privileges and
