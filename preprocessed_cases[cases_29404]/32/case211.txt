in this writ proceeding,petitioner richard fine,an attorney,seeks to have set aside an order of contempt issued by respondent los angeles county superior court,and arising out of the filing by fine of a code of civil procedure section challenge against commissioner bruce mitchell.we deny the petition for a writ.
factual and procedural background 
class action complaint.on may,a class action was commenced by fine on behalf of representative plaintiffs against ehg national health services and others.the complaint alleged tort causes of action arising from medical examinations conducted by an imposter doctor on behalf of an insurance company.paul deflores et ehg national health services et,nonpub.opn.deflores i.
stipulation appointing commissioner mitchell.the parties executed the following stipulation for the appointment of commissioner mitchell as temporary judge.it is understood between the undersigned attorneys and parties that the below described matters in this case have been assigned to a superior court commissioner for the county of los angeles,who is a member of the bar of the state of california,and that said commissioner appointment as a superior court commissioner is in accordance with article,section,of the constitution of this state,and further,that said commissioner has taken the oath of office as to all matters assigned.pursuant to article,section,of the constitution of this state,each of the parties litigant stipulates,and the court thereupon orders,that commissioner bruce mitchell is appointed and empowered to act in this case as a temporary judge for all pretrial proceedings,specifically including,without limitation,those matters assigned to department by the superior court local rules,rules,and each of the parties litigant thereby waives any right they might otherwise have to hereafter withdraw this stipulation to commissioner mitchell as temporary judge for the described proceedings.this stipulation is binding upon all successor parties in interest,parties in pro per after withdrawal of counsel,and all successor counsel.
class certification.in february,the trial court granted fine motion to certify a liability class and appointed fine as class counsel for liability issues only,determining that numerous individual issues precluded certification of the damage claims.by virtue of being certified as class counsel,fine became counsel for approximately additional clients.paul deflores et superior court brent,et,nonpub.opn.deflores ii.
settlement agreement.in june,the parties entered into a stipulation of settlement,which provided for a global settlement,not only settling the claims of the class representatives on behalf of themselves and the class but also the individuals in the consolidated class for a total settlement of million,million of which was to be paid to some of the individual plaintiffs with the balance to be deposited into an interest bearing account for the class members that counsel for the representative plaintiffs and counsel for the individual plaintiffs would receive attorney fees of of the recovered amount a method of distributing the settlement monies to the claimants in accordance with a plan of allocation as provided by the court and for prompt application to the trial court for approval of the s tipulation and entry of a judgment consistent with it,the court retaining jurisdiction to implement and enforce the terms of the settlement.deflores 
settlement approval.on june,following a hearing before commissioner mitchell on the fairness of the stipulation,the court approved the settlement.about a week later,commissioner mitchell signed a document entitled stipulated order for entry of judgment.the stipulated order approved all of the terms of the settlement,certified the class,dismissed the defendants and from the action,and provided that t he court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter to effectuate this judgment,to supervise and approve the claims administration process,and to enforce the terms of the stipulation.deflores 
claim processing phase.after the stipulation of settlement was entered,the claim processing phase of the case began,during which it was to be determined how the settlement proceeds were to be allocated.deflores 
stay of proceedings.on december,the trial court,at the behest of attorney diane goldman,halted the claims administration process because a disqualification statement had been filed by fine against commissioner mitchell.goldman represents a number of plaintiffs,and has the title liaison counsel.
sanction order.on february,the trial court entered an order imposing sanctions against fine pursuant to section.the order recounted the long history of fine persistent,and the trial court concluded inappropriate,efforts to obtain an advance of attorney fees from the settlement proceeds.the trial court refused to advance additional fees because of the uncertainty as to the precise amount of attorney fees to which fine would be ultimately entitled.deflores 
removal order.on march,the trial court entered an order removing fine as class counsel.the court indicated that each class member would be permitted to select whom he or she desired to represent him or her,including fine.deflores 
appeal of sanction and removal orders.on april,paul deflores,on behalf of plaintiffs represented by fine,appealed from the sanction order against fine and the order removing him as class counsel.fine was not a party to the appeal.deflores 
on october,we issued an opinion dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.as to the sanction order,we concluded that the appellants lacked standing to appeal,as fine,alone,was entitled to challenge the sanction order.as to the removal order,we concluded that appellants were not adversely affected by the order and thus lacked standing to appeal it.in a footnote,we stated,we note,however,from a careful review of the record that were we to reach the merits of appellants claims regarding fine removal,we would conclude that the trial court possessed the authority to do so and that the reasons for doing so,as set forth in the trial court lengthy march,order,amply supported its exercise of discretion.deflores 
december,status conference.on december,a status conference was conducted in the trial court before commissioner mitchell.on january,fine and a number of plaintiffs,identified as members of the settlement class that selected richard fine to represent them in the claims administration process,filed a notice of appeal from the orders of december,including but not limited to removing from the private judge the decision of the amount of money each claimant would receive in the claims administration process the removal of richard fine as counsel for all the members of the settlement class that selected richard fine to represent them individually in the claims administration process without notice and the order that the counsel instead of the private judge determine the amount of monies that each claimant would receive in the claims administration process amongst other orders that day.deflores ii.
fine disqualification challenge.on august,fine filed and served on commissioner mitchell a disqualification challenge.fine asserted that the commissioner was disqualified to preside at any further proceedings because he is biased and prejudiced and has abused and misused the judicial process by engaging in a concerted action with diane goldman,counsel for certain plaintiffs who opposed the class action,by unlawfully delaying the claims administration process by stopping such on december,at the request of goldman in violation of section,subdivision d,by soliciting and offering to pay goldman from the settlement fund on april,to represent him in the present appeal of the december,orders which goldman is doing in conflict of the interests of her clients in having a private judge decide the value of their claims,by allowing goldman to interfere with the attorney client relations of fine and his clients as admitted in the declaration of diane goldman dated july,paragraph ln,by not punishing goldman for placing her return address on the court notice without permission thereby allowing claimants to believe she has a special status in the case,by not sanctioning goldman for breaking the june,non solicitation order for writing the july,letter to richard bagdasarian,and by hearing a motion for disqualification of fine which duplicates the present appeal of the december,orders brought by goldman in violation of section while knowing that he is prohibited from hearing such.fine,who signed the affidavit under penalty of perjury,asserted that he first discovered these facts as a pattern on august,through august.
order of contempt.on september,commissioner mitchell issued an order and judgment of contempt against fine based on the filing of the august,disqualification challenge it was noted that this was the ninth such challenge filed against commissioner mitchell by fine in the deflores matter,and that these challenges began when the commissioner set an order to show cause osc in november to consider whether fine should be removed as class counsel in one of six class actions fine had pending before commissioner mitchell.the order found that the disqualification challenge was false and meritless and thus a direct contempt of court that could be punished summarily.
as to commissioner mitchell authority to adjudicate the contempt,the order noted that pursuant to the first stipulation executed by the parties commissioner mitchell was appointed and empowered to act as a temporary judge for all pretrial proceedings.the court concluded that t his litigation is still in pretrial proceedings.the court files reflect the following no trials have yet been held.the defendants entered into a global settlement,paid approximately million into court similar to an interpleader,and were dismissed.now there are plaintiffs who all have claims to that fund.none of those claims has received an individual final value,and if claims can not be resolved by further settlement procedures then they will have to go to trial.none of the plaintiffs waived their right to a jury trial.instead,because defendant ehg national health services insurance policy was a burning limits policy,being reduced by defense costs,all plaintiffs agreed that million was fair as a global settlement,but that plaintiffs would litigate among themselves for a pro rata distribution.some of the claims alleged are very serious,including one wrongful death claim,and may need to be tried.because this litigation is still in pretrial proceedings,the stipulations signed by attorney fine apply with full force.
the stipulation contained within the stipulated order for entry of judgment signed by the parties in june was construed as follows moreover,when the parties entered into their stipulation of settlement,and in their motion to certify a settlement class,they all agreed,including attorney fine,that the same court that had conducted the previous continue to preside over the settlement adjudication phase.this is consistent with the superior court local rules on class actions.
as to whether an evidentiary hearing was required,the court noted that it had considered carefully whether setting an osc would be appropriate,and concluded that an osc would be of no value.this is now attorney fine ninth meritless challenge for cause in this case.in responding to each prior challenge this court has pointed out that the challenge was meritless,and has repeatedly cited legal authority to fine that a false or meritless challenge for cause is contemptuous.fully aware of the law,he continues to file such challenges.further,when on past occasions this court has disciplined attorney fine he has typically retorted with further insolence and insults to the court.the court has no reasonable basis to believe that this instance would be any attorney fine has any genuine interest in learning why his actions are inappropriate,or offering any sincere explanation or apology.
according to the court,fine ninth challenge was contemptuous for two independent reasons first,the ninth challenge contained false,insulting,and scandalous allegations against commissioner mitchell,alleging judicial dishonesty or misconduct,unsupported by any facts,in violation of section,subdivision a.second,the ninth challenge,the last act in a two year pattern of false and meritless challenges for cause,tended to disrupt these judicial proceedings in violation of section,subdivision a.
in concluding that fine filed the ninth disqualification challenge as a delaying tactic,the order set forth past acts on fine part,including the filing of numerous disqualification challenges in several other class actions pending before commissioner mitchell.it was noted that t he court of appeal has summarily denied every petition for a writ which attorney fine has filed concerning the denial of,or striking of,his various challenges.the court noted that nine times in this case alone this court has had to put aside other pressing business and responded,as a priority within the days the law permits,to one insulting allegation after another.the filing of each challenge abated these proceedings as a matter of law until it was resolved.attorney fine baseless challenges have disrupted and delayed these proceedings.
as to the likelihood of an apology from fine,the court noted,w hile an apology,if offered,should be considered when adjudicating a contempt,no apology has been offered by attorney fine since commissioner mitchell filed the order striking the ninth challenge on september,nor,for that matter,did attorney fine offer an apology for any of his previous eight meritless challenges for cause after they were denied on their merits or stricken on their face.
the court concluded that there were no mitigating factors in fine favor when determining the penalty for contempt,but concluded there were several serious aggravating factors t he egregious nature of the allegations in the ninth challenge themselves,which contain repetitive,and false allegations of judicial misconduct,asserted in a wholly conclusory manner t his is the latest in a two year pattern of false and baseless challenges fine pattern of misconduct has persisted although the court has repeatedly warned him,in commissioner mitchell responses to fine prior challenges for cause,that his false and meritless challenges were contempt of court and fine has already been monetarily sanctioned over for prior misconduct,and money sanctions have failed to halt his misbehavior.
the court opined that imprisonment is the only appropriate punishment for this flagrant contempt,and the maximum of five days in jail is wholly appropriate.in imposing the sentence,the court noted that the facts recited within the order occurred in the immediate view and presence of this court.
petition for writ of certiorari.execution of sentence was stayed to allow fine an opportunity to file this petition upon receipt of this petition,we issued a temporary stay,and set an order to show cause.
appeal from december,proceedings.on february,this court issued an opinion dismissing the appeals from the orders purportedly made on december.as to fine removal of counsel claim,we noted that the trial court made no orders on december,removing fine.we found that commissioner mitchell oral statements at the december status conference merely reiterated the orders of march,which removed fine as class liability counsel and from any and all interests he acquired by being appointed class counsel.the march order made clear that the court was removing fine as counsel for individual class members in the claims administration process because those positions were obtained by virtue of the court appointment of fine as liability class counsel.the order of removal did not apply to the clients fine represented under separate retainer agreements prior to his being certified as class counsel.we concluded that because it is clear that appellants seek to the removal of fine in march under the guise of seeking review of the december order,and because the march,order is final we need say nothing further in that regard.we rejected fine remaining arguments as either meritless or unsupported by the record.deflores ii.
fine contends that commissioner mitchell had no power to adjudicate the contempt,and that the order of contempt is insufficient on its face to support the jurisdiction of the trial court and is not supported by the record.
iii.discussion 
standard of review 
in reviewing an adjudication of contempt,the sole question before us is one of jurisdiction of the trial court to render the judgment under review,and in such a case the review of the evidence is limited to determining whether there was any substantial evidence to sustain the jurisdiction of the trial court.citations.in re buckley,supra,cal d at.the power to weigh the evidence rests with the trial court.in re ciraolo cal d,ciraolo.
b.a commissioner has the power to adjudicate a direct contempt of court.
fine contends that commissioner mitchell had no authority to adjudicate the contempt.we disagree.
as a general rule,only a duly elected or appointed judge can exercise the judicial power of a trial court of this state.the california constitution,however,provides an exception to this rule.on stipulation of the parties litigant the court may order a cause to be tried by a temporary judge who is a member of the state bar,sworn and empowered to act until final determination of the cause.cal,art.vi,italics added.a cause is the proceeding before the court.citation.the appointment of a temporary judge to hear a particular cause carries with it the power to act until the final determination of that proceeding.citation.mccartney superior court d,citing sarracino superior court cal d.
fine concedes that the first stipulation signed by the parties empowered commissioner mitchell to handle all pretrial proceedings.fine claims,however,that after the final judgment was entered in june the stipulation authorizing commissioner mitchell to act in connection with all pretrial proceedings was no longer effective and that the commissioner was,therefore,without authority to issue the order of contempt.fine relies on nierenberg superior court d.nierenberg in support of his argument.
nierenberg,however,is distinguishable.in that case,during a criminal trial,a commissioner sitting as a temporary judge cited a deputy public defender for direct contempt,with the hearing to be held at the conclusion of the trial.nierenberg,supra,d at.five days after the criminal defendant acquittal and release,the contempt hearing commenced.id.at.at the outset of the hearing,the public defender and his counsel expressly refused to stipulate that the commissioner could serve as a judge or that he had the power to act as a judge at the contempt hearing.ibid.the commissioner presided over the contempt hearing without a stipulation,adjudged the public defender in contempt,and fined him.on petition for writ of certiorari,the court of appeal annulled the order adjudging the deputy public defender in contempt.id.at.the court held that the acquittal of the criminal defendant,discharge of the jury,and order releasing the defendant from custody marked the final determination of that cause in which the parties litigant had stipulated to empower the commissioner to act as a judge pro tempore,and that after final determination of the criminal action,the stipulation no longer was effective to confer judicial power on the commissioner to adjudicate the contempt,which was a cause distinct from the underlying criminal proceeding,and one which required a stipulation of the parties litigant thereto to vest the commissioner with the power to act as a temporary judge under california constitution,article vi,section.nierenberg,supra,d at.
in nierenberg the cause had become final by the time the temporary judge held the contempt hearing.here the temporary judge commissioner mitchell continued to conduct proceedings in the cause pursuant to a new and different stipulation.
the record reflects that the stipulation executed by the parties when the case was first filed empowered commissioner mitchell to conduct all pretrial proceedings.according to the order of contempt,commissioner mitchell views the proceedings occurring subsequent to entry of judgment in june as pretrial proceedings because no determination has yet been made concerning the amount of money each class member will receive,and thus a trial may be required in order to determine what allocation is to be made.such an interpretation,we conclude,is strained.what the language of the stipulation executed by the parties when the case commenced makes clear is that when the class action lawsuit was initiated,the parties contemplated that unless settled,the case would proceed to trial,and commissioner mitchell could act as a temporary judge in connection with all pretrial proceedings.when the case settled,and an order of judgment was entered,the pretrial phase of the action ended,as did commissioner mitchell authority to act as a temporary judge pursuant to the first stipulation.
this brings us to the question of whether language contained within the settlement documents empowered commissioner mitchell to act in the underlying case,and if so,to what extent.as fine points out,the stipulation contained within the stipulated order for entry of judgment does not specifically authorize commissioner mitchell to conduct any proceedings.rather,the parties stipulated that the court was authorized to conduct such proceedings.fine concludes,therefore,that the parties did not intend commissioner mitchell to act in any capacity.fine takes too narrow a view of the parties stipulation.where,as here,the parties agree that pretrial proceedings will be heard by a certain commissioner,and that commissioner thereafter executes a settlement agreement providing that t he court retains jurisdiction to perform certain tasks,it is clear that the parties have,in effect,agreed that the commissioner who previously conducted pretrial hearings and approved and executed the parties settlement agreement is to perform those tasks specified in the stipulation.we therefore construe the stipulation contained within the stipulated order for entry of judgment to mean that commissioner mitchell was authorized to preside over the proceedings as specified in the parties settlement agreement.
fine contends that even if this court construes the language of the stipulation contained within the stipulated order for entry of judgment to allow commissioner mitchell to conduct proceedings,in the absence of language within the stipulated order authorizing him to issue orders of contempt,he had no authority to do so.fine is wrong.while the parties to an action have the power to define and circumscribe the authority of a temporary judge in re steven th,d,no express authority to issue contempt orders need be granted such authority is inherent in the trial court power to exercise reasonable control over its proceedings,subd.a.
temporary judges who act under stipulation have full judicial powers until final determination of the cause.in re mark cal d.one of those judicial powers is to punish for contempt.section provides that e very judicial officer shall have power.to preserve and enforce order in his immediate presence,and in proceedings before him,when he is engaged in the performance of official duty.to compel obedience to his lawful orders as provided in this code.to compel the attendance of persons to testify in a proceeding before him,in the cases and manner provided in this code.to administer oaths to persons in a proceeding pending before him,and in all other cases where it may be necessary in the exercise of his powers and duties.section provides that f or the effectual exercise of the powers conferred by the last section,a judicial officer may punish for contempt in the cases provided in this code.
the following acts or omissions in respect to a court of justice,or proceedings therein,are contempts of the authority of the court disorderly,contemptuous,or insolent behavior towards the judge while holding the court,tending to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial proceeding abuse of the process or proceedings of the court,or falsely pretending to act under the authority of an order or process of the court and any other unlawful interference with the process or proceedings of a court.direct contempt is that committed in the immediate view and presence of the court or of the judge at chambers all other contempts are indirect which by definition occur outside the presence of the court.nierenberg,supra,d at.the california supreme court has held that the filing of a false affidavit of disqualification is a direct contempt.in re ciraolo,supra,cal d at,citing lamberson superior court cal,contempt order upheld where attorney presented degrading accusations under the guise of mere belief,without the aid of supporting facts and blodgett superior court cal.
because the cause was still pending before commissioner mitchell when fine direct contempt occurred in august,and because commissioner mitchell was acting as a temporary judge pursuant to the parties stipulation,we conclude that commissioner mitchell had the authority both to cite fine for contempt and to summarily adjudicate the contempt.
c.the record contains evidence sufficient to support the order of contempt.
fine contends that the order of contempt fails to satisfy the requirements of code of civil procedure section which establishes the procedure that is to be followed in adjudging a person in contempt of court.
section,subdivision a provides when a contempt is committed in the immediate view and presence of the court,or of the judge at chambers,it may be punished summarily for which an order must be made,reciting the facts as occurring in such immediate view and presence,adjudging that the person proceeded against is thereby guilty of a contempt,and that he or she be punished as therein described.
section,subdivision a provides upon the answer and evidence taken,the court or judge shall determine whether the person proceeded against is guilty of the contempt charged,and if it be adjudged that he or she is guilty of the contempt,a fine may be imposed on him or her not exceeding one thousand dollars,or he or she may be imprisoned not exceeding five days,or both.
where,as here,the contempt consists of the filing of a false affidavit of disqualification,due process is satisfied if the trial court makes an order reciting the facts constituting the contempt,adjudging the person guilty,and prescribing the punishment.ciraolo,supra,cal d at.the order of contempt must recite the facts with sufficient particularity to demonstrate on its face that petitioner conduct constitutes a legal contempt.in re littlefield cal th,d.the requirement is not met by a mere statement of the trial judge conclusions regarding the nature of the conduct giving rise to the contempt.the order adjudging a person guilty of contempt must be stated with sufficient particularity to demonstrate on its face,without aid of speculation or reference to any extrinsic document,that a contempt actually occurred.citations.ibid.although t ranscripts of pertinent hearings attached to the written contempt judgment may be considered in order to ascertain the context in which the contempt occurred,the written order adjudging a person guilty of contempt nonetheless must state on its face the specific act constituting the contempt.id.at,fn,d.
ciraolo is instructive.in that case,the alameda county public defender office represented a criminal defendant with assistant public defender michael ciraolo assigned as trial counsel.the case was assigned to judge robert kroninger for trial.on the same day,ciraolo filed an affidavit for cause against judge kroninger.ciraolo declared that in connection with a separate case involving another deputy public defender,judge kroninger had declared that the public defender and his office were incompetent.ciraolo claimed that due to this statement the court was prejudiced against him,and that the defendant he was representing could not,therefore,have a fair and impartial trial before judge kroninger.ciraolo,supra,cal d at.ciraolo challenge was heard before another judge who found that judge kroninger had not made the statement attributed to him or any statement to that effect and therefore was not disqualified.judge kroninger then conducted the criminal trial,with ciraolo acting as trial counsel.id.at.following the sentencing hearing,with ciraolo in court,judge kroninger conducted a summary proceeding,at the conclusion of which he found the public defender in contempt for his conduct in the filing of the unsupported challenge and of the false affidavit in connection therewith.id.at.ciraolo then sought habeas corpus.in denying relief,the supreme court stated the judgment and commitment order in this case recite that ciraolo had filed the offending affidavit quoting it under penalty of perjury that the factual allegations in the affidavit were wholly false,although ciraolo had declared such facts to be true of his own knowledge that they charged the judge with judicial misconduct,with slander and with intended neglect of duties that upon being given opportunity to produce evidence and to explain the filing of the affidavit ciraolo replied in substance only that his purpose had been to obtain a continuance of the trial that in the premises ciraolo did not in good faith believe the truth of his assertions but instead used the affidavit and the disqualification motion simply as one of a number of sequential efforts to obtain continuances that as a result of ciraolo actions the court,its attaches and potential jurymen were idled pending the hearing on petitioner challenge.id.at.the court concluded,c ontrary to ciraolo contention,such a recitation is obviously adequate to support the order adjudging ciraolo in contempt for misbehavior in office,for violation of his duty as attorney,assistant public defender and as officer of the court,and for abuse of process.id.at.the court also held that the record obviously supports the inference that petitioner filed his false affidavit as a device in his repeated efforts to secure further continuances.ciraolo,supra,cal d at.
fine august,disqualification statement asserted that on six occasions commissioner mitchell,acting in concert with attorney diane goldman,abused and misused the judicial process.fine provided few facts in support of the allegations contained within his statement of disqualification.we conclude,therefore,that the statement of disqualification was properly stricken.see,subd.c urias harris farms,d,citing in re morelli d.holding mere conclusions of the pleader are insufficient.the question presented by this petition,however,is whether the order of contempt is sufficient to show whether any of fine assertions that commissioner mitchell,acting in concert with goldman,abused and misused the judicial process were false.we discuss each of fine allegations of judicial misconduct separately.
fine alleged that commissioner mitchell,acting in concert with goldman,abused and misused the judicial process by unlawfully delaying the claims administration process by stopping such on december,at the request of goldman in violation of section,subdivision d.
as to this allegation,the order of contempt provides in fact,the court records reveal that claims administration needed to be abated until fine original section challenge,and then the osc re his removal as class counsel were resolved,so that it was clear which attorney represented which claimants,as the title of goldman application,filed december,clearly states plaintiff ex parte application for an order staying all further meetings or hearings until resolution of challenge osc re removal of class counsel.staying the proceedings was not only a lawful exercise of this court discretion,it was absolutely necessary.
the record reflects that on december,fine filed his first disqualification statement against commissioner mitchell,the commissioner responded by filing an answer,goldman then filed an ex parte application for a stay of proceedings pending resolution of fine disqualification challenge,and on december,commissioner mitchell issued a minute order granting goldman motion.fine allegation that the commissioner illegally delay ed the claims administration process is based on his contention that commissioner mitchell had no authority to issue a stay order while fine section december,disqualification challenge was pending.
section,subdivision a provides that w henever a judge determines himself or herself to be disqualified,the judge shall notify the presiding judge of the court of his or her recusal and shall not further participate in the proceeding,except as provided in section,unless his or her disqualification is waived by the parties as provided in subdivision b.
section,subdivision a provides as follows a disqualified judge,notwithstanding his or her disqualification may do any of the following take any action or issue any order necessary to maintain the jurisdiction of the court pending the assignment of a judge not disqualified.request any other judge agreed upon by the parties to sit and act in his or her place.hear and determine purely default matters.issue an order for possession prior to judgment in eminent domain proceedings.set proceedings for trial or hearing.conduct settlement conferences.
section,subdivision d provides that e xcept as provided in this section,a disqualified judge shall have no power to act in any proceeding after his or her disqualification or after the filing of a statement of disqualification until the question of his or her disqualification has been determined.
fine contends that because a motion to stay proceedings is not listed in section,subdivision a,commissioner mitchell had no power to hear the motion.we disagree.the record shows that upon receipt of the december,statement of disqualification,commissioner mitchell filed an answer to the challenge and took several motions off calendar.a few days later,commissioner mitchell issued a stay of the proceedings in order to maintain the jurisdiction of the court pending resolution of fine disqualification statement,subd.a.we find nothing unlawful in such an act.we note,however,that even if commissioner mitchell erred in issuing the stay,his act of doing so can not on this record be construed as an abuse and misuse of the judicial process.moreover,nothing contained within the record indicates that commissioner mitchell acted in concert with goldman in issuing the stay of proceedings.
we conclude that the statement contained within fine affidavit of disqualification that commissioner mitchell abused and misused the judicial process by unlawfully delaying the claims administration process by issuing a stay of proceedings on december,is false,and thus contemptuous.
fine alleged that commissioner mitchell,acting in concert with goldman,abused and misused the judicial process by soliciting and offering to pay goldman from the settlement fund on april,to represent him in the present appeal of the december,orders which goldman is doing in conflict of the interests of her clients in having a private judge decide the value of their claims.
as to this allegation,the order of contempt provides in fact,as the court minute order of april,reveals,the court advised all parties that the court would not be filing an opposition to fine bogus appeal wherein he alleges he was removed as class counsel at the december status conference,instead of the march,order removing,but that the court recognized that at least one of the real parties in interest must file an opposition,and that whomever assumed that task might later have a claim for attorney fees for having conferred a common benefit,but that the issue would have to be fully briefed later,and the court could not promise payment.a copy of the april,minute order was attached to the order of contempt.
this allegation is perhaps the more serious accusation of judicial misconduct set forth by fine in his statement of disqualification.the order of contempt accurately summarizes the comments made by the trial court on april,with respect to the appeal filed by fine.a review of the minute order attached to the order of contempt shows that commissioner mitchell,when advised that fine had appealed from the order purportedly made on december,properly suggested that a response to the appeal would be in order and that the party responding could be entitled to attorney fees 
as to the validity of fine appeal from the december,proceedings,that appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because there were no appealable orders properly before this court.moreover,this court determined that commissioner mitchell had made no orders on december,removing fine that fine was merely seeking to his removal in march,under the guise of seeking review of the december,proceedings.deflores ii.
we conclude that fine accusation that commissioner mitchell abused and misused the judicial process by soliciting and offering to pay goldman to represent him in fine appeal from the orders purportedly made on december,is false,and thus contemptuous.
fine alleged that commissioner mitchell,acting in concert with goldman,abused and misused the judicial process by allowing goldman to interfere with the attorney client relations of fine and his clients as admitted in paragraph of goldman declaration dated july.fine provided no additional facts.nor did he attach a copy of the declaration purportedly filed by goldman to his disqualification statement.
as to this allegation,the order of contempt provides no factual explanation is offered,and a factually unsupported allegation which demeans judicial integrity is contemptuous.a ttorney goldman is the liaison counsel in this role attorney fine formerly held but was removed from for as such she has certain administrative responsibilities a critical fact which fine omits.attorney fine also fails to identify which clients he is referring to,and may well be referring to his former clients,for whom he was removed as class counsel,and with whom he now has no relationship.
fine suggests that because commissioner mitchell was aware of goldman declaration,the commissioner was required to address the language contained therein in the order of contempt in order to prove that fine allegation was false.commissioner mitchell had no such obligation.a charge of judicial misconduct unsupported by facts constitutes a groundless attack upon the integrity of a judicial officer,and is on its face contemptuous.see lamberson superior court,supra,cal.at.when faced with such an attack,the judicial officer is required to do no more than state within the order of contempt that the charge of judicial misconduct is unsupported by fact and is false.
fine has attached a copy of a declaration filed by diane goldman to this petition.it is dated july.we assume that this is the declaration referred to in fine disqualification statement.paragraph provides as follows as liaison counsel,i have received numerous telephone calls from class members,inquiring into the status of this action.in accordance with the orders of this honorable court,i have provided information as to the status,including a fine has been removed as class counsel b class members will be receiving a notice from the court that very thoroughly explains the next stage of the litigation,including the of counsel c the attorneys representing other claimants are available to represent class members,as more particularly set forth in the upcoming notice d i can not estimate how long the rest of the litigation will take,how the final claims valuation will be determined,and i have been chosen to assist the court in preparing notices to class members and other claimants.
as commissioner mitchell noted in the order of contempt,the allegation that the commissioner allowed goldman to interfere with fine attorney client relations with his clients is conclusory and unsupported by facts.moreover,nothing contained within paragraph of the goldman declaration attached to this petition suggests that commissioner mitchell allowed attorney goldman to interfere with the attorney client relations of fine and his clients.we thus conclude that fine allegation is false and thus contemptuous.
fine alleged that commissioner mitchell,acting in concert with goldman,abused and misused the judicial process because he failed to punish goldman for placing her address on the court notice without permission thereby allowing claimants to believe she has a special status in the case.
as to this allegation,the order of contem
