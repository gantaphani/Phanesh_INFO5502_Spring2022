your pervasive practice of viewing pornography from the computer in your chambers resulted in frequent computer viruses infecting your computer.courthouse software quarantined the viruses on your computer which in turn,had to be removed by technology staff members either from a remote location or in person by reporting to your office to remove the viruses from your computer.

ii.failure to disclose a juror written communication.
in the case of state wilson,case you failed to advise the lawyers representing the state of florida and the defendant that you had received a written communication from a juror during the trial.the handwritten note from the juror allegedly advised you that said juror was concerned about a fellow juror sleeping during the trial and was further concerned about the fairness of the proceedings due to the sleeping juror.
you failed to disclose the note to the lawyers even after defense counsel,who independently learned of the sleeping juror,requested a continuance of the sentencing hearing to explore legal options on behalf of wilson.in addition to denying the continuance,you also conducted legal research and cited to foraker state,so d dca,in support of your decision to proceed with the sentencing of wilson notwithstanding the sleeping juror.in so ruling,you stated that there was insufficient evidence of the sleeping juror to require a hearing.you made this representation knowing that you had direct evidence in the form of a juror communication evidencing that a fellow juror had in fact seen the juror sleeping during the trial.
defense counsel learned about the juror communication after the courtroom bailiff who received the note from the juror reported the existence of the note to the state attorney office who in turn notified defense counsel.
you claim to have destroyed the note instead of producing the note to the lawyers or placing the note in the court file.the withholding of the juror communication in this case led to your disqualification.
