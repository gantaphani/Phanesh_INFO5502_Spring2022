appellant anthony jaramillo,a small business owner operating under the name of radar water geophysics,entered into a written contract with david deuling,a landowner in anza,california,to provide a computer profile of subsurface conditions to locate groundwater on deuling property the anza parcel.jaramillo,who is not a licensed geophysicist,has never studied geophysics and was not working under a licensed geophysicist,advertised his business on a web site titled radar water geophysics,which represented that he specialized in acquifer location and used electronic techniques for analysis of groundwater resources to identify the acquifer geologic characteristics 
respondent board for geologists and geophysicists of the state of california department of consumer affairs the board cited jaramillo under business and professions code section for practicing or offering to practice geophysics for others in violation of section,subdivision a hereafter a and ordered him to pay a fine.following an evidentiary hearing,the administrative law judge the alj found that jaramillo was practicing geophysics without a license in violation of section a and issued a proposed decision that sustained the citation and ordered him to pay the fine and cease and desist from violating sections and a.the board adopted the alj proposed decision as its own.
jaramillo challenged the board decision by filing in superior court a petition for writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section the petition,which the board opposed.the court denied the petition following oral argument.
jaramillo contends that the administrative decision affected his fundamental right to operate his business,and thus the court committed reversible error when it failed to apply the independent judgment standard of review,finding that no fundamental right was implicated in this case even if the court properly applied the substantial evidence test,there is no substantial evidence to support the court decision upholding the board decision and he was denied a fair hearing because the board failed to provide adequate notice of the charges against him.
we conclude the court did not err by applying the substantial evidence test,substantial evidence supports both the board decision and the judgment entered by the court,and jaramillo was not denied a fair hearing.accordingly,we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
contract and services rendered 
in late deuling hired jaramillo to locate groundwater on the anza parcel.jaramillo,through his radar water geophysics business,entered into a written contract with deuling under which jaramillo agreed to provide a computer profile of subsurface conditions to locate groundwater on deuling property.after jaramillo conducted site surveys and profilings,deuling paid jaramillo with a check and then stopped payment on that check.jaramillo brought a small claims action against deuling to collect the payment he claimed deuling owed him for his services,and deuling filed a complaint against jaramillo with the board alleging that jaramillo was providing geophysics services without a license.
in january the board executive officer,paul sweeney,acting on behalf of the board under authority provided by title california code of regulations section issued citation the citation citing jaramillo for practicing or offering to practice geophysics without legal authorization in violation of sections see fn,ante and a see fn,ante of the geologist and geophysicist act et hereafter occasionally referred to as the act.the citation ordered jaramillo to pay an administrative fine in the amount of and to cease and desist from violating sections and a.
in its description of jaramillo violation of the act,the citation stated in part jaramillo conducted a site geophysical reconnaissance and site inspection,and evaluated the potential for subsurface water at the anza parcel.jaramillo provided geophysical consulting services documented in the signed radar water geophysics invoice,dated november,to deuling.these activities constitute the professional practice of geophysics in the state of california.the aforementioned work completed by jaramillo demonstrate s that jaramillo conducted analyses and made interpretations,conclusions and recommendations constituting the professional practice of geophysics in the state of california.consequently,jaramillo violated section a when he engaged in the practice of geophysics,interpreted the site geophysical dat a,and made recommendations based on geophysical interpretations.these violations constitute grounds for disciplinary action under section a.board records show that jaramillo has not held registration as a geologist,geophysicist or professional engineer in the state of california on or about the times of the work completed at the anza parcel.therefore,at all times relevant jaramillo was not licensed to practice geophysics or offer to practice geophysics for others in the state of california.
administrative hearing 
jaramillo contested the citation,and an alj conducted an evidentiary hearing on the matter.the parties stipulated to the admission of seven exhibits the citation and various pleadings the board march certification that jaramillo is not and never has been licensed as a registered geologist,registered geophysicist,certified engineering geologist,or certified hydrogeologist,copies of the act,the board rules and regulations including,and relevant statutes including a photographs of highway signs advertising jaramillo business printouts of jaramillo web sites jaramillo november contract with deuling for which the board cited jaramillo and jaramillo letter to deuling,dated december,on radar water geophysics letterhead.the court also received in evidence a copy of a november temporary restraining order prohibiting jaramillo from practicing or offering to practice professional geology or professional geophysics,and from maintaining web sites that engage in or advertise such practices,pending resolution of the board citation against him.
the board called two witnesses tony sawyer and sweeney.sawyer,a licensed california geologist and hydrogeologist who is the chairman of the board technical advisory committee and who assists in writing regulations for the board,testified that jaramillo was offering geophysical services to the public.sweeney,the board executive officer,testified that jaramillo was offering to provide geophysics services without a license.
in his defense,jaramillo testified on direct examination that he had provided nonprofessional services to deuling,and thus he was exempt from licensure under section of the regulations,which exempts those who are doing nonprofessional geophysics or geologic work.
in rebuttal,the board recalled sawyer as a witness.sawyer testified that jaramillo was not exempt from licensure because his work required the interpretation of geology,he did not have a degree,he was not licensed,and he was not working toward getting a license.
alj proposed decision 
after the hearing,the alj issued a proposed decision upholding the citation and setting forth various findings of fact and conclusions of law.in factual finding,the alj found that jaramillo did not hold any registration as a geologist,geophysicist or professional engineer in california and had not held such a registration at any relevant time,and thus he was not authorized to practice geophysics or to offer to practice geophysics for others in the state.
in factual finding,the alj found that the services jaramillo provided to deuling constituted the professional practice of geophysics.specifically,factual finding of the alj proposed decision stated jaramillo owns a business that performs water locating services for property owners.he advertises that he can locate water and performs such services for those that hire him.in november,jaramillo conducted a site geophysical reconnaissance,site inspection,and evaluation of the potential for subsurface water on the anza parcel for customer deuling.jaramillo provided geophysical consulting services at the anza parcel and documented the geophysical services in an invoice he gave deuling entitled radar water geophysics dated november.jaramillo conducted analyses and made interpretations,conclusions,and recommendations all of which constituted the professional practice of geophysics.the activities jaramillo provided to deuling at the anza parcel constituted the professional practice of geophysics in the state of california.italics added.
the alj factual finding rejected jaramillo testimony that he was performing only nonprofessional services and thus was exempt from licensing.specifically,factual finding of the proposed decision stated jaramillo testified at the hearing that he does not believe he is doing anything wrong in his business.he claims he is performing only services for his customers and such services are exempt from the laws requiring a license to practice geophysics.however,the expert testimony to the contrary is overwhelming and very persuasive.the evidence is clear that jaramillo is indeed engaging in the unlicensed practice of geophysics.such unlicensed practice is a threat to the public,particularly in light of the fact that jaramillo does not have the training or education required for licensure.italics added.
the alj proposed decision concluded that cause existed to sustain the citation for violation of sections and a and ordered jaramillo pay to the board a fine in the amount of within days of the effective date of the board final decision.it also ordered jaramillo to cease and desist from violating sections and a.
board decision 
the board adopted the alj proposed decision as its own and stated it shall become effective immediately.
f.the petition 
jaramillo challenged the board decision by filing the petition in superior court.jaramillo supporting points and authorities asserted that the trial court was required to apply the independent judgment standard of review because the board decision involved his fundamental vested rights in that his right to operate his business and thereby make a living is at stake.jaramillo argued that the issue to be decided was whether his activities were nonprofessional such that he was exempted from the statutory licensing requirements for professional geophysicists.he asserted that the board proceeded without or in excess of jurisdiction because his services were nonprofessional and,as such,exempt from licensure.he also asserted that the board abused its discretion because it did not proceed in the manner required by law,its decision was not supported by the findings,and the findings were not supported by the evidence.specifically,jaramillo maintained that the evidence was insufficient to support the board claim that he was not exempt from licensure because the only charge he faced was the unlicensed practice of geophysics,and the board proof was based entirely on the testimony of sawyer,who was not licensed in the field of geophysics and thus was not qualified to testify as an expert about geophysics.
the board filed written opposition to the petition,arguing that the substantial evidence test applied because jaramillo was not licensed,he was not a member of the geophysical profession,and thus no fundamental vested right was involved.the board asserted that it was authorized under section of the regulations discussed,post to issue the fine against jaramillo for the unauthorized practice of geophysics,jaramillo was not denied a fair trial,the board findings and decision were supported by substantial evidence,and the board did not abuse its discretion.noting that sawyer was a licensed geologist,not a licensed geophysicist,the board also argued that as the chairman of the board advisory committee that writes the rules and regulations for the board,sawyer had the background,education and experience to understand the scope of work of a geophysicist,and he properly testified as an expert on board law.
court denial of the petition 
the court denied the petition following oral argument.finding that jaramillo did not have a legally or legitimately acquired fundamental vested right to provide unlicensed services to the public,the court applied the substantial evidence test.the court found that the board did not abuse its discretion,the board had jurisdiction under section of the regulations,and the administrative record contained substantial evidence that supported the board finding that jaramillo practiced or offered to practice geophysics without a license and without legal authorization in violation of sections and a.citing evidence code section,subdivision a,and tennant civil service commission d,tennant,the court also found that jaramillo had waived his challenge to sawyer qualifications and testimony by failing to object at the administrative hearing.jaramillo timely appeal followed.
discussion 
istandard of review 
jaramillo contends the board administrative decision affected his fundamental right to operate his business,and the court committed reversible error when it found that no fundamental right was implicated in this case and failed to apply the independent judgment standard of review.as he did below,jaramillo contends that the board findings must be reviewed under the independent judgment standard because the board decision infringes a fundamental vested right his right to operate his business and thereby make a living.we conclude the court did not err by applying the substantial evidence test.
applicable legal principles and standard of review 
code of civil procedure section sets out the procedure for obtaining judicial review of a final administrative determination by writ of mandate.fukuda city of angels cal th,d,fukuda.subdivision b of that section provides that t he inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether the agency has proceeded without,or in excess of jurisdiction whether there was a fair trial and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.subdivision c of that same section provides in full where it is claimed that the findings are not supported by the evidence,in cases in which the court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.in all other cases,abuse of discretion is established if the court determines that the findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.italics added.
if,in an administrative mandamus case,the underlying administrative decision substantially affects a fundamental vested right,the trial court,in determining under code of civil procedure section whether there has been an abuse of discretion because the findings are not supported by the evidence,must exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and find an abuse of discretion if the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence.strumsky san diego county employees retirement cal d,italics added see also goat hill tavern city of costa mesa th,d goat hill tavern.
if the administrative decision does not substantially affect a fundamental vested right,the trial court considers only whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.strumsky,supra,cal d at,goat hill tavern,supra,th at,d.

in support of his contention that the board decision infringes upon what he asserts is his fundamental vested right to operate his business and thereby make a living,jaramillo relies primarily on,and quotes,goat hill tavern,supra,th at page,d for the proposition that the right to continue operating an established business in which he has made a substantial investment constitutes a fundamental vested right,and thus the court committed reversible error when it found that no fundamental right was implicated in this case.jaramillo reliance on goat hill tavern is misplaced.
in goat hill tavern,a tavern that had been in continuous operation for years and had existed as a legal nonconforming use,sought a writ of administrative mandamus ordering the city of costa mesa to set aside its denial of the tavern owner application for renewal of the tavern conditional use permit,which had allowed the tavern to operate a game room it had constructed in an adjoining commercial space without a building permit or land use approval.goat hill tavern,supra,th at,d.finding that the tavern owner,who had invested million in refurbishing the property,had a vested property right,the trial court applied the independent judgment test,found the city decision to deny renewal of the permit was not supported by the evidence,and granted the writ.id.at,d.the city appealed,contending the trial court applied an incorrect standard of review,the owner had no fundamental vested right in the tavern,and thus the trial court review should have been limited to a determination of whether substantial evidence supported the city decision.ibid.
affirming the judgment granting the writ of mandate,the court of appeal held that the rights affected by the city refusal to renew the tavern conditional use permit were sufficiently personal,vested and important to preclude their extinction by a nonjudicial body.goat hill tavern,supra,th at,d.rejecting the city contention that the tavern owner right to continued operation of his business was not a fundamental vested right,the court of appeal characterized the owner right as the right to continue operating an established business in which he has made a substantial investment.ibid.the court explained,however,that the facts of the case were unique,and its decision was not based solely on the fact that the tavern was an established business in which the owner had made a substantial investment.noting that cases applying the independent judgment test in land use matters are few,the court stated,we uphold its application here because of the unique facts presented.we might conclude differently were this,as the city attempts to suggest,a simple case of a property owner seeking a conditional use permit to begin a use of property.but it is not.rather,the tavern is an existing business and a legal nonconforming use.id.at,d,italics added.the court then quoted board of zoning adjustment d,with approval for the proposition that w here a permit has been properly obtained and in reliance thereon the permittee has incurred material expense,he acquires a vested property right to the protection of which he is entitled.goat hill tavern,supra,th at,d,italics added.
the goat hill tavern court emphasized that its decision to set aside the city denial of the permit renewal application was based on the fact that the tavern had operated legally for many years,stating by simply denying renewal of its conditional use permit,the city destroyed a business which has operated legally for years.the action implicates a fundamental vested right of the property owner,and the trial court was correct in applying the independent judgment test.goat hill tavern,supra,th at,d,italics added.in a footnote,the court added h ad the tavern never built its game room expansion,it would still be operating as a legal nonconforming use,fn,italics added.
here,jaramillo complains that he has a fundamental vested right to continue operating his business because he has spent years building and successfully operating his business in which he has made a substantial investment in time and resources.however,unlike the tavern owner in goat hill tavern,jaramillo has not shown,and can not show for reasons we shall explain,below,in concluding that substantial evidence supports the court decision that he has operated his radar water geophysics business legally.
we thus conclude that goat hill tavern,supra,th,d,the principal authority on which jaramillo relies,is distinguishable.we also conclude that the court did not err by finding jaramillo has no fundamental vested right in the continued operation of his business,and thus the court did not err by applying the substantial evidence,rather than the independent judgment,standard of review.
sufficiency of the evidence 
jaramillo also contends that even if the court properly applied the substantial evidence test,there is no substantial evidence to support the court decision to uphold the board decision.we reject this contention.
the citation charged jaramillo with practicing or offering to practice geophysics without legal authorization in violation of sections see fn,ante and a see fn,ante of the geologist and geophysicist act.for purposes of the act,the term geophysics is statutorily defined as that science which involves study of the physical earth by means of measuring its natural and induced fields of force,including,but not limited to,electric,gravity,and magnetic,and its responses to natural and induced energy and the interpreting of these measurements and the relating of them to the physics of the earth,italics added.
section,subdivision e of the regulations defines the term professional geophysical work as work performed at a professional level rather than at a subprofessional or apprentice level and requires the application of scientific knowledge,principles and methods to geophysical problems through the exercise of individual initiative and judgment in investigating,measuring,interpreting and reporting on the physical phenomena of the earth.implicit in this definition is the recognition of professional responsibility and integrity and the acknowledgment of minimal supervision.
during the administrative hearing,jaramillo admitted on that he had never been licensed as geophysicist,geologist or hydrogeologist,and he had never taken a college course in geophysics,geology or hydrogeology.jaramillo also admitted that he was not working under a licensed geologist when he performed his services for deuling at the anza parcel site.nothing in the record indicates that jaramillo has ever worked under a licensed geophysicist,geologist or hydrogeologist.
the parties stipulated to the admission in evidence of various exhibits,including jaramillo contract with deuling for which the board cited jaramillo.the contract letterhead identified jaramillo as radar water geophysics.italics added.the board called two witnesses sawyer and sweeney.sawyer stated he is a licensed california geologist and hydrogeologist,he is the chairman of the board technical advisory committee,and he assists in writing regulations for the board.he testified with respect to jaramillo highway signs,the references on those signs to jaramillo web sites,and the contents of the web sites and the written contract with deuling.
after offering his interpretation of the signs,the web sites and the contract,sawyer testified
