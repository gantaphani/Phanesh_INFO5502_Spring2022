on the second day of trial in this drug trafficking prosecution,during the of defendant appellant aurora lopez avila,the prosecutor read back supposed testimony of lopez avila from her earlier change of plea hearing.what he read back seemed to contradict lopez avila earlier statements on direct examination.using this supposed prior testimony,the prosecutor assistant attorney ausa jerry albert,of the u.attorney office for the district of arizona accused lopez avila of having lied to the federal magistrate presiding at an earlier hearing.
but the prosecutor quotation was only part of what he represented was a question asked the defendant under oath by the magistrate judge.it was a.without telling the court or defense counsel,the prosecutor presented to court and counsel an altered version of the prior hearing question and answer,and the altered version of such dialogue made it appear as though lopez avila had contradicted herself on a material point,when she plainly had not.the district court naturally assumed the prosecutor had read the question and answer whole,and allowed the questioning to proceed.when the prosecutor misrepresentation was discovered by defense counsel,he moved for a mistrial,which the court swiftly granted.the defense then moved to dismiss the indictment with prejudice,on double jeopardy grounds,but the district court denied that motion.lopez avila appeal from the denial of that motion is the legal issue before us.
we affirm the district court denial of the motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds.in addition,we take several steps to ensure that ausa jerry albert actions are properly investigated,and that he is disciplined if the relevant authorities deem it proper.in so doing,we bear in mind that ausa albert conduct is not directly before us,and we express no judgment as to what sanctions,if any,are proper.
defendant aurora lopez avila attempted to enter the united states from mexico at the nogales port of entry in arizona.upon a tip from an informant,customs officials searched her car and found kilograms of cocaine behind the back seat cushion.lopez avila was charged by indictment with possession with intent to distribute over kilograms of cocaine in violation of a and b a ii ii.
lopez avila initially pleaded guilty.at the guilty plea hearing,lopez avila was asked a standard set of questions by a magistrate judge,including questions put to ascertain whether lopez avila was knowingly and voluntarily entering a plea of guilty to the charges against her.the questioning included the following colloquy 
court in the last hours have you had any drugs,prescription medication,or alcoholic beverage 
defendant no.
court have you ever been treated for a mental condition 
defendant no.
court lopez,has anyone threatened you or forced you to plead guilty 
defendant no.
court has anyone made any promises to you as to what would happen in your case 
one month later,during a presentence interview,lopez avila stated that she had been forced to commit this offense,or she would face dire consequences.lopez avila had not earlier mentioned to defense counsel that she had been threatened to transport the contraband.her counsel forthwith moved to withdraw the guilty plea in light of this new information.following a hearing,the court granted the motion to withdraw the guilty plea.
the case proceeded to trial.lopez avila conceded that she had been transporting contraband and therefore,as the district court later stated,the whole issue in the case was whether lopez avila was under duress,or threatened,or forced to commit this crime.the government took approximately days.during that time,according to the district court,there were no big surprises during the testimony of the government three witnesses.rather,the government was moving forward as it had expected as the evidence was being presented.
on the afternoon of the second day of trial,lopez avila took the stand in her own defense.she testified she had been coerced to transport the drugs found in her car.during,the prosecutor jerry albert of the attorney office in tucson attempted to impeach lopez avila testimony regarding such coercion by asking questions regarding what lopez avila had said during her initial guilty plea hearing.defense counsel objected,and at sidebar defense counsel argued that there was an agreement that this change of plea and her admitting guilt was not going to be a part of this record.the prosecutor stated that he wanted to use certain questions and answers from that hearing to impeach lopez avila but that,pursuant to counsels agreement,he would not bring out that she pled guilty.in particular,the prosecutor requested that he be allowed to recite to lopez avila the following question and answer from the initial guilty plea hearing 
court lopez,has anybody threatened you 
defendant no.
the court overruled the objection and allowed the prosecution to proceed.
the prosecution then asked lopez avila about that exchange 
q do you recall testifying under oath on february,and being asked this question by the court by the magistrate judge 
lopez,has anyone threatened you 
and you gave did you give the following answer 
did you tell that under oath to magistrate judge guerin 
defendant yes.
q was that a lie 
defendant how is that i do understand.
q well,are you you now admitted that you in fact told the judge that you were not threatened in this case.and i asking you was your testimony on february,while you were under oath,was that a lie did you lie to the judge about not being threatened 
defendant yes.
emphasis added.
proceeded for approximately forty more minutes,when the court took a brief recess.at the recess,defense counsel asked the prosecution for a copy of the transcript from the guilty plea hearing.immediately upon reviewing the transcript,defense counsel noticed that the prosecutor had misquoted the magistrate judge question to lopez avila,without notifying the court or defense counsel of his alteration.at the guilty plea hearing,lopez avila was asked the following question 
court lopez,has anyone threatened you or forced you to plead guilty 
defendant no.
emphasis added.
at trial,however,the prosecutor omitted the latter clause of the magistrate question or forced you to plead guilty when he purported to quote from the transcript of the prior proceeding.the prosecutor represented to court and counsel the exchange was 
court lopez,has anybody threatened you 
defendant no.
the defense immediately moved for a mistrial.defense counsel contended that the prosecutor had made it seem as though lopez avila had been asked whether she had been threatened to commit the offense,when the magistrate judge in fact had asked lopez avila a different question whether she had been threatened to plead guilty.the prosecutor admitted that his misquoting of the transcript had been intentional but claimed that his reading was a fair one the transcript did say threaten you to plead guilty.so i was going to mention force you to plead guilty.that not i read exactly the way it was.and it to me,that says anyone threatened you period.but,of course,the prosecutor had not read the question magistrate question exactly the way it was.ausa albert omitted an important ellipsis between the words threatened you and the end of the magistrate question,which ellipsis would reveal that words were missing.here,that missing phrase made all the difference.
the court agreed that the defense had the better reading of the real question and answer that lopez avila was answering whether she been threatened or forced to plead guilty and not whether she had been threatened or forced to commit any other act.the court told the prosecutor that it would have been helpful to bring this to the court attention at sidebar in advance.after a brief recess to consider the matter,the court concluded that it could not cure the error by giving a jury instruction.the court then declared a mistrial.
following the mistrial order,defense counsel moved to dismiss the case on double jeopardy grounds.at the hearing on that motion,the court said that it was very surprised the prosecution had attempted to present that evidence in that way to this jury.however,the court denied the motion.it correctly stated that under oregon kennedy,the double jeopardy clause bars retrial after a defendant requests a mistrial only where the governmental conduct in question is intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.kennedy,at.considering what had occurred at trial up to that point,the court found no evidence that this was a strategy decision on the prosecution part to abort the trial.instead,the government was moving forward as it had expected as the evidence was being presented,and the prosecutor presentation of the edited transcript was a deliberate strategy to attempt to convict the defendant,or present evidence that the prosecution felt was supporting guilt rather than presenting evidence in order to go to a mistrial.
lopez avila took an interlocutory appeal challenging the district court denial of her double jeopardy motion.the district court divested itself of jurisdiction over the case and allowed the appeal to proceed because of its conclusion that the claim presented by this interlocutory appeal is colorable.
as a preliminary matter,this court has jurisdiction to hear this interlocutory appeal.even though a denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds is not a final decision of a district court,d enials of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds have long been considered immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine so long as the double jeopardy claim is at least colorable.united states alvarez moreno,cir internal quotations and citations omitted.a colorable claim in this context is one for which there is some possible validity.id.quoting richardson united states.the district court held that lopez avila claim is colorable,and the government does not object to this court exercising jurisdiction.as explained below,although lopez avila claim fails,it is not a frivolous double jeopardy claim that this court could dismiss on jurisdictional grounds.see alvarez moreno,at.
when reviewing a denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds before trial,this court review s de novo legal questions but review s factual findings,including those on which denial may be based,for clear error.united states ziskin,cir.
lopez avila makes two arguments for why double jeopardy should bar retrial in this case retrial is barred under oregon kennedy goading exception to the usual rule that double jeopardy does not bar retrial where a mistrial is granted with the defendant consent,and retrial is barred by the arizona supreme court interpretation of its state constitutional protection against double jeopardy,which interpretation is incorporated into federal proceedings in arizona through.both contentions fail.the double jeopardy clause provides no bar to lopez avila retrial.
because a defendant motion for a mistrial constitutes a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact,oregon kennedy,internal quotations and citation omitted,the double jeopardy clause usually does not bar retrial when a mistrial is declared with the consent of the defendant.instead,o nly where the governmental conduct in question is intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial may a defendant raise the bar of double jeopardy to a second trial after having succeeded in aborting the first on his own motion.id.in adopting this standard,the supreme court expressly rejected the idea that double jeopardy would bar retrial when mere bad faith conduct or harassment on the part of the judge or prosecutor provoked the defense to ask for a mistrial.id.at.in other words,in the language of veteran trial lawyers,the double jeopardy clause bars retrial when a prosecutor misconduct aims to burn the jury,but not when he merely aims to convict the defendant by methods foul.
in practice,the kennedy standard is rarely met.that is because i t does even matter that the prosecutor knows he is acting improperly,provided that his aim is to get a conviction.the only relevant intent is intent to terminate the trial,not intent to prevail at this trial by impermissible means.united states perlaza,cir quoting united states oseni,cir.lopez avila cites no published ninth circuit case since kennedy that has held that retrial was barred after the defense consented to a mistrial motion.nationwide,such cases are few and far between.see,sheldon shapiro,double jeopardy as bar to retrial after grant of defendant motion for mistrial,supplements collecting cases from state and federal courts.
lopez avila points to a single fact in the record that supposedly shows why the government may have been unhappy with the way the trial was proceeding and therefore attempted to sink its case the fact that the border patrol agent who searched lopez avila car testified that there was no evidence that lopez avila knew she was transporting cocaine.in particular,agent lozania testified that lopez avila consistently maintained during questioning that she did not know the vehicle contained cocaine.but this fact would provide no reason for the prosecution to subvert its case,since it did not affect any element needed for conviction.while lopez avila said that she thought she was importing diet pills,she admitted that she knew such importation would be unlawful.that admission is enough to satisfy the statute intent requirement under ninth circuit law.see united states carranza,cir notably,agent lozania gave no testimony to bolster lopez avila claim that she had been coerced to carry the diet pills she admitted she was smuggling.
as the district court found,all of the evidence led to the conclusion that the prosecutor conduct was deliberate,a trial strategy used to attempt to convict the defendant.these are all findings of fact,made by the trial judge,who heard the evidence and observed the conduct of ausa albert.we review such findings for clear error.united states ziskin,cir.of course,there was abundant evidence to support the district court quoted findings.there was no error,much less clear error.retrial is not barred by the double jeopardy clause based on oregon kennedy goading exception.
lopez avila second argument is that the double jeopardy clause bars retrial in light of,which governs ethical standards for government lawyers.states that an attorney for the government shall be subject to state laws and rules,and local federal court rules,governing attorneys in each state where such attorney engages in that attorney duties,to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that state.emphasis added.lopez avila contends that this statute,which by its terms applies to rules governing attorneys,also means that the arizona supreme court interpretation of the arizona constitution double jeopardy clause applies in federal criminal proceedings in arizona.therefore,lopez avila contends,an arizona state double jeopardy case,pool superior court,applies in this proceeding.as a final step,lopez avila contends that under pool,which is more than kennedy,her retrial should be barred.
to begin with,lopez avila admits that she did not raise this argument below,so we can review only for plain error.united states olano.but lopez avila contention on fails under any standard of review.
first,her argument is contradicted by the plain text of,which states that an attorney for the government shall be subject to state laws and rules governing attorneys.a emphasis added.the supreme court has said that the constitution protection against double jeopardy in the fifth amendment affords a criminal defendant a valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.kennedy,at emphasis added internal quotations omitted.even if one of the purposes of the double jeopardy clause is to protect against prosecutorial overreaching,the right itself is plainly a right held by a criminal defendant,not one that directly governs the conduct of prosecutors.there is simply no language in that would allow this court to apply arizona substantive interpretation of the double jeopardy clause in its own state constitution to th
