petitioner charles benninghoff,a former lawyer who resigned from the state bar of california state bar with disciplinary charges pending,seeks an extraordinary writ reversing an order whereby the court assumed jurisdiction over his practice.the court found benninghoff had been illegally practicing law by representing parties before federal and state agencies as a lay representative.benninghoff contends that laypeople may represent parties in state administrative hearings,and so this kind of representation must not constitute the practice of law.because he was not practicing law,he argues,the court lacked any basis to assume jurisdiction over his lay practice.
benninghoff conclusions do not follow from his premise.representing parties in state administrative hearings constitutes the practice of law.as a lay representative,benninghoff used his legal knowledge to offer legal advice and counsel,prepare legal documents,and attempt to secure his clients legal rights.if laypeople are allowed to engage in this kind of issue we need not would be an exception to the general rule that only active bar members may practice law.at most,the exception would allow laypeople to practice law in state administrative hearings.it does not render this work anything other than the practice of law.by representing parties in state administrative hearings,benninghoff practiced law in he has lost the right to do by reason of his resignation from the state bar with disciplinary charges pending.
but benninghoff is correct on one point.the court could not assume jurisdiction over his federal practice,because federal regulations governing practice before federal courts and agencies preempt state law prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law.thus,we grant his petition to this extent only.
in,benninghoff pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the united states and three other federal felonies he resigned from the state bar with disciplinary charges pending.in his resignation letter,benninghoff acknowledge d that he will be ineligible to practice law or to advertise or hold him self out as practicing or as entitled to practice law.
no longer an active member of the state bar,benninghoff plied his trade outside the court system.he represented professional licensees in state administrative hearings and federal prisoners in prison transfer applications.he sent direct mail solicitations and operated websites advertising his services as a professional advocate.eventually,the medical board of california medical board asked the state bar to clarify whether benninghoff could represent parties in its disciplinary hearings.while the state bar investigated the matter,two administrative law judges ruled on petitions to disqualify benninghoff from medical board hearings.both judges found that benninghoff was practicing law by representing parties in administrative hearings.
the state bar filed an application asking the court to assume jurisdiction over benninghoff practice.the court granted the order.benninghoff petitioned for an extraordinary writ,and later filed a motion for a partial stay to allow him to continue representing federal prisoners.
discussion 
this is the first appellate opinion construing business and professions code section which authorizes a court to assume jurisdiction over the law practice of an attorney who dies,resigns,becomes an inactive member of the state bar,is disbarred,or is suspended from the active practice of law one explanation for the dearth of appellate opinions is that an order granting an application to assume jurisdiction is not appealable review may be sought only by a writ petition.
the first issue we must address is the standard of review.as usual,we review the court implied and express factual findings for substantial evidence,and review its statutory interpretation independently.see winograd american broadcasting th,d when the trial court has resolved a disputed factual issue,the appellate courts review the ruling according to the substantial evidence rule see also harbor island holdings kim th,d questions of law reviewed de novo.
but the ultimate determination to assume jurisdiction over a law practice rests in the court discretion.the statute says the court may make an order assuming jurisdiction if the lawyer dies or ceases active membership in the state bar,italics added accord,in re richard cal d,the ordinary import of may is a grant of discretion.also,we imagine that when most lawyers die or resign,clients usually pick up their files and obtain new counsel without court intervention.the court decision to assume jurisdiction over a practice to protect the clients is akin to a decision to appoint a receiver,which calls for the exercise of discretion.city and county of san francisco daley th,d.thus,we will review the order assuming jurisdiction over benninghoff practice for an abuse of discretion.
benninghoff may not represent parties in state administrative hearings 
benninghoff contends that laypeople may represent parties in state administrative hearings.he relies on various sections of the administrative procedure act,et,hereinafter apa that refer to a party attorney or other authorized representative.he also relies on several regulations that refer to a party counsel or other representative.
the state bar hedges its bet on the question.in its brief,it assumes for the sake of argument that laypeople may represent parties in state administrative hearings.but it also directs our attention to the medical board amicus curiae brief filed below,which contended that laypeople have no such right.the medical board relied primarily on government code section.this statute requires agencies to notify parties that they have the right to be represented by an attorney at their own expense,but makes no mention of any right to be represented by a layperson.it also relied on other apa sections referring to a party attorney without mentioning any other kind of representative.it contends that the apa sections and regulations mentioning authorized representatives or other representatives should be construed to refer to corporations,who have the right to represent themselves in agency hearings and must do so through a natural person,a representative.
we decline to resolve this issue.to decide this case,we need not resolve the broad question of whether laypeople in general may represent parties in state administrative agencies.rather,we will assume that laypeople may do so,and turn to the specific question of whether benninghoff may do so,too.
our specific question arises because benninghoff is not the typical used to be lawyer.the statute prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law treats true laypeople differently than lawyers who have lost their bar membership.section,subdivision a addresses true laypeople.it provides that a ny person practicing law who is not an active member of the state bar,or otherwise authorized pursuant to statute or court rule to practice law in this state at the time of doing so,is guilty of a misdemeanor.italics added.section,subdivision b addresses lawyers like benninghoff.it provides that a ny person who has resigned from the state bar with charges pending,and thereafter practices or attempts to practice law is guilty of a crime punishable by imprisonment in the state prison or county jail.thus,a true layperson may practice law when authorized pursuant to statute or court rule a defrocked lawyer like benninghoff may not practice law at all,subds.a b.
this leads us to determine whether the representation of parties in state administrative hearings constitutes practicing law.the state bar act,section et,was enacted in to set forth a comprehensive scheme regulating the practice of law in the state.birbrower,montalbano,condon frank superior court cal th,d,birbrower.it provided that only active state bar members may practice law,but did not itself define the term practice law.id.at,d.thus,as subsequent courts found,the state bar act implicitly adopted the common law definition of practice law as the doing and performing services in a court of justice in any matter depending therein throughout its various stages and in conformity with the adopted rules of procedure.but in a larger sense,it includes legal advice and counsel and the preparation of legal instruments and contracts by which legal rights are secured although such matter may or may not be depending in a court.id.at,d.
the california supreme court addressed what it means to practice law in baron city of los angeles cal d,baron.there,the court held that the state bar act preempted a city ordinance governing lobbyists to the extent it purported to apply to lawyers practicing law.id.at.thus,it had to differentiate lawyers engaged in lobbying from lawyers engaged in practicing law.it conceded that i t is difficult to draw logical distinctions among the varied services performed by lawyers id.at,and that ascertaining whether a particular activity falls within this general definition of the practice of law may be a formidable endeavor.id.at.
nonetheless,our supreme court had no difficulty resolving the l ess perplexing question of whether participation on behalf of another in hearings and proceedings before a board or commission constitutes the practice of law.baron,supra,cal d at.the cases uniformly hold that the character of the act,and not the place where it is performed,is the decisive element,and if the application of legal knowledge and technique is required,the activity constitutes the practice of law,even if conducted before an administrative board or commission.ibid.
we conclude that benninghoff practiced law by representing parties in state administrative hearings.by his own admission,he made numerous appearances before various administrative and regulatory agencies in the state of california.the record suggests that,as part of his lay practice,he analyzed agency disciplinary guidelines,advised clients how to defend against disciplinary charges,responded to discovery requests,prepared hearing books and declarations,and examined witnesses at hearings.in representing a client before the california nursing board,he advised her what her best defense would be and the evidence needed to support her defense,prepared declarations,requested a continuance,prepared her to testify,began trial preparation,and negotiated a settlement.benninghoff thus gave legal advice to his clients and prepared legal documents attempting to secure their legal rights,which called for the application of his legal knowledge and technique.baron,supra,cal d at,see also birbrower,supra,cal th at,d.this is the practice of law.
we reject benninghoff suggestion that representing parties in state administrative hearings can not constitute practicing law because laypeople arguably are allowed to do so.as we explained ante,the law differentiates between laypeople and defrocked lawyers.lawyers who resign with disciplinary charges pending may not practice law,without exception,subd.b.in contrast,laypeople may practice law when authorized pursuant to statute or court rule,subd.a.if the various apa sections and regulations that benninghoff cites do in fact allow laypeople to represent parties in administrative hearings,they constitute the statutory authorization contemplated by section,subdivision a.
two early cases clarify the legislature prerogative to create statutory exceptions by which laypeople may practice law.in a bar act case,in re hittson,the court held that a disbarred attorney could represent parties in the justice courts,because at that time the code of civil procedure allowed any person to represent a party in a justice court,and precluded disbarred attorneys only from practicing as such attorney in re hittson,at,italics added.the court concluded that disbarment does no more than take away the rights granted to lawyers by the order of admission to practice.id.at.but the court went on to state,w ithout doubt the l egislature would have the right to provide that any person who had been disbarred from the practice of law should be ineligible to appear in a justice court to represent another,and we venture the suggestion that such legislation is both appropriate and desirable.ibid.nine years later,the legislature enacted the state bar act,which it later amended to include section barring defrocked lawyers from practicing law.
in eagle indem.industrial acc.com.cal,the supreme court allowed a layperson to recover attorney fees for his successful representation of an injured employee before the industrial accident commission.id.at.the parties did not dispute that the services performed by the layperson in the prosecution of the claim before the commission were legal services.id.at.and the court noted that as a general rule,no one may practice law without a license.ibid.but it also noted that e xceptions to this general rule have been established and long recognized.ibid.it then reviewed the workmen compensation act,and concluded that the l egislature has therein provided a further exception to the general rule,as to practice before the industrial accident commission.id.at.if the apa allows lay representation,presumably it does so as another exception to the general rule against laypeople practicing law.it does not remove that representation from the practice of law,or invalidate the absolute bar against defrocked lawyers practicing law.
we give little weight to the other sources upon which benninghoff relies.he submitted an amicus curiae brief filed below by a law professor and an attorney general opinion concluding that the apa allows lay representation.neither source considered whether defrocked lawyers,as opposed to true laypeople,may represent parties in state administrative hearings he also submitted a legislative counsel opinion,which did opine that defrocked lawyers may do so.but the opinion overlooked section,subdivision b,which bars defrocked lawyers from practicing law in california.notably,the attorney general and legislative counsel agreed that representing parties in state administrative hearings constitutes practicing law.
thus,benninghoff,whom the state bar act prohibits from practicing law,may not represent parties in state administrative hearings.this representation constitutes the practice of law,from which defrocked lawyers are categorically barred.
our conclusion is bolstered by public policy considerations.benninghoff was convicted of four federal felonies,including conspiracy to defraud the united states and making false statements.disbarment was an inevitable formality,as the supreme court shall summarily disbar an attorney convicted of any felony requiring the specific intent to defraud or make false statements,subd.c.in addition,his offenses were crimes of moral turpitude,which is an independent basis for summary disbarment.see also in re lesansky cal th,d,offense reveals moral turpitude if it shows a deficiency in any character trait necessary for the practice of law such as trustworthiness,honesty,or candor.moral turpitude has been defined by many authorities as an act of baseness,vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen,or to society in general.in re craig cal d.benninghoff avoided the indignity of actual disbarment only by resigning from the state bar with disciplinary charges pending.nonetheless,he suffers the same disqualifications as a bar member who has been tried on disciplinary charges and found wanting,subd.b.he is unfit to practice law he has forfeited the privilege of speaking for others under the law.
as our supreme court noted shortly after the state bar act passed,a ttorneys and counselors at law have for centuries been required to undergo certain courses of preparation and to assume certain solemn obligations not only with respect to their relation to the courts,but also with regard to their relation to the public at large.state bar of california superior court cal.the public interest must be safeguarded against the ignorances or evil dispositions of those who may be masquerading beneath the cloak of the legal and supposedly learned and upright profession.ibid.the public interest is best served by preventing benninghoff from masquerading as a lay representative.thus,the court did not abuse its discretion in assuming jurisdiction over benninghoff
