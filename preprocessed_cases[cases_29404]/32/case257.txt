we review a referee report recommending that respondent,dewey homer varner,be found guilty of professional misconduct and be suspended from the practice of law for days.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.for the reasons expressed below,we approve the referee findings of fact and recommendations as to guilt,but reject the referee recommended discipline.the serious and cumulative nature of varner misconduct warrants a suspension.
the florida bar filed a complaint against varner alleging numerous violations of the rules regulating the florida bar.following a formal hearing,the referee filed a report containing the following findings 
varner has been a member of the florida bar since october.in the florida bar file,varner received a private reprimand for advertising violations.in florida bar varner,so d,he received a suspension for filing a fictitious notice of voluntary dismissal.
in february,a client hired the law firm of varner thorne,to represent him in connection with two workers compensation accidents.initially,patricia thorne,varner law partner,took primary responsibility for the client files,but in november transferred the files to varner due to medical issues.varner never informed the client that his cases were no longer being handled by thorne.
in august,opposing counsel had scheduled and noticed a physician deposition.upon receiving the notice,varner telephoned opposing counsel and requested that the deposition be cancelled.opposing counsel stated that she would agree to cancel the physician deposition if varner voluntarily dismissed the case.varner filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of one of the client claims.varner directed a copy of the notice of voluntary dismissal to be faxed to opposing counsel.
the notice of voluntary dismissal stated that the client,through his legal counsel,sought the voluntary dismissal of all pending claims in his workers compensation case.varner intended to communicate that the client was aware of and consented to the dismissal of this case.varner knew,however,that the client did not know of it and had not authorized it.
before the referee,varner falsely testified that thorne expressly communicated the client authorization to file the notice of voluntary dismissal.this was untrue,as thorne did not communicate the client permission to file the voluntary dismissal to varner at any time.in fact,thorne did not receive the client authorization and did not know of the filing of the notice of voluntary dismissal until she received a letter from the client nearly a year later telling her so.
the motion to voluntarily dismiss the client case was granted,and opposing counsel cancelled the scheduled deposition.
varner never told the client that the notice of voluntary dismissal had been filed or that his case had been dismissed.after varner had voluntarily dismissed the case,the client called the firm several times inquiring about his case.varner failed to respond.it was not until june a sympathetic member of varner law firm support staff surreptitiously revealed it to the the client learned that his case had been dismissed.the client then called the court himself and officially learned of the dismissal.
neither varner nor anyone else from his law firm had ever informed the client that the law firm of varner thorne had stopped representing him.neither varner nor anyone else from his law firm ever returned the client file or took any steps to protect his interests after his case was dismissed.moreover,before filing the motion to dismiss,varner never considered or reviewed the applicable statute of limitations and therefore did not know that,absent extraordinary remedies,the voluntary dismissal would deprive the client of his cause of action.after discovering that his case had been voluntarily dismissed,the client had significant difficulty in reopening his case,as the statute of limitations had run.
the referee recommended that varner be found guilty of violating several rules regulating the florida bar violation of the rules of professional conduct is a cause for discipline the commission by a lawyer of any act that is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice,whether the act is committed in the course of the attorney relations as an attorney or otherwise,whether committed within or outside the state of florida,and whether or not the act is a felony or misdemeanor,may constitute a cause for discipline a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client a a lawyer shall abide by a client decisions concerning the objectives of representation,and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued b a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation d upon termination of representation,a lawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client interest,such as giving reasonable notice to the client,allowing time for employment of other counsel,surrendering papers and property to which the client is entitled,and refunding any advance payment of fee that has not been earned a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client a a lawyer shall not violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct,knowingly assist or induce another to do so,or do so through the acts of another c a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation and d a lawyer shall not engage in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.
the referee found the following aggravating factors prior disciplinary offenses dishonest or selfish motive a pattern of misconduct multiple offenses and substantial experience in the practice of law.the referee also found mitigating factors of personal or emotional problems and character or reputation.
as to discipline,the referee recommends a suspension.further,the referee awarded costs to the bar in the amount of.
varner seeks review of the recommendations as to both guilt and the recommended discipline.
varner appeals several of the referee factual findings as well as the recommended discipline.we first address the factual findings and then discuss the appropriate discipline.
a.the referee factual findings 
varner primarily argues that the referee findings that varner failed to abide by the client decisions and that he engaged in dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation are not supported by competent,substantial evidence.that is,varner challenges the referee findings that thorne had little control over the client case and that no conversation occurred between varner and thorne about the client consent to file a notice of voluntary dismissal.varner argues that he relied on thorne assertions that the client consented to the voluntary dismissal.
this court review of a referee factual findings is limited to determining whether they are supported by competent,substantial evidence.this court will not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the referee.bar frederick,so d,see also.bar jordan,so d.a respondent contesting factual findings can not simply point to contradictory evidence when competent,substantial evidence supports the findings.bar committe,so d.bar nowacki,so d.
varner primarily argues that evidence contradicts the referee findings and that he relied on thorne alleged assertions.the referee,however,who observed varner demeanor,found incredible varner testimony that he relied on thorne assertions and found that varner filed the notice of voluntary dismissal even though he knew that the client had not authorized it.the referee decision to discount varner testimony is supported by competent,substantial evidence in that all witnesses,including varner,testified to thorne compromised mental health and general inability to function as a lawyer during the period in question opposing counsel testified that varner and his associates handled the client case because thorne had mental difficulties and successor counsel testified that the client told him that varner had been hand
