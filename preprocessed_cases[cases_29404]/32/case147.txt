in march,the supreme court of florida suspended montgomery blair sibley from the practice of law for three years for two counts of misconduct contempt of court for his failure to pay child support and filing frivolous claims and appeals.sibley is a member of the bar of this court.pursuant to rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure and this court inherent powers,we issued an order to show cause why the imposition of reciprocal discipline on sibley would be unwarranted.we subsequently appointed amicus curiae to assist the court and heard argument at sibley request.the issues before the court are whether the procedures employed by the florida supreme court and the referee appointed by that court were so lacking in notice or the opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process and whether the florida supreme court issued a sanction with such infirmity of proof as to require further review.we find that sibley has failed to demonstrate that there was a lack of notice or infirmity of proof and thus suspend sibley from practicing before this court for three years,nunc pro tunc to may,on the same conditions as imposed by the florida supreme court.
background 
pursuant to a marital settlement agreement,sibley was obligated to pay his former wife per month in child support if he moved out of south florida.sibley moved out of the area in may and failed subsequently to pay any child support.on august,the circuit court of the eleventh judicial circuit found that sibley financial situation had not substantially changed since he agreed to the marital settlement and,therefore,found him to be in contempt of court for wilfully failing to pay the support in violation of the court order.the court sentenced sibley to a deferred days of imprisonment pending an opportunity for sibley to purge himself of the contempt by making three monthly installments to satisfy his overdue child support obligations.the court subsequently increased the sentence for contempt to an indefinite term or until the contempt was purged.when sibley missed the first payment,the eleventh judicial circuit ordered sibley immediate incarceration.on appeal,the third district court of appeal upheld sibley contempt and child support orders finding that sibley could either sell personal property or ask his wealthy father for the amount.sibley sibley,so d.the appellate court noted that sibley conduct constituted the very epitome of a wilful,contemptuous refusal to obey a binding order of the court.id.at.one judge dissented,noting that the record did not adequately support the proposition that sibley had sufficient personal property to sell to obtain the purge amount and that the assets of sibley father were not considered by the trial court and thus could not be considered on appeal.id.at cope,dissenting.sibley unsuccessfully petitioned for review by the florida supreme court,sibley sibley,so d,and the supreme court of the united states denied sibley motion for a stay,d,as well as his petition for writ of certiorari,d.
in a related proceeding,the third district court rejected an appeal by sibley of two circuit court orders compelling payment of attorneys fees for sibley former wife and tuition for sibley children.the third district court granted sibley former wife motion for sanctions and barred sibley from representing himself in further appeals.sibley sibley,so d.the court noted that sibley had initiated appeal proceedings in florida courts,of which were found meritless,and filed at least federal court actions in florida all dismissed against various judges assigned to his cases,the court system,and his former wife,plus a federal action in delaware against his former wife which was dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.because sibley numerous appeals served as an unending source of vexatious and meritless litigation,the appellate court barred sibley from further in that court.id.at.the florida supreme court denied sibley petition for review,sibley sibley,so d,and the united states supreme court denied certiorari,d.
based on a recommendation from the second judicial circuit grievance committee,on july,the florida bar filed a complaint against sibley alleging two violations of the rules regulating the florida bar.count i alleged that sibley violated florida bar rule h,which provides that a lawyer engages in misconduct if he should wilfully refuse,as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction,to timely pay a child support obligation.count ii alleged that sibley violated florida bar rule,which prohibits a lawyer from making a claim in court unless there is a basis in law and fact for doing so that is not frivolous.pursuant to florida bar rule a,a referee was designated to handle sibley case.
sibley sought extensive discovery from the florida bar and sought subpoenas for the depositions of the judge on the circuit court of the eleventh judicial circuit and judges on the florida third district court of appeal,as well as documentary evidence to contradict the findings of fact in the third district court of appeals decision.sibley also filed several writs of prohibition.all of the motions were denied.sibley then responded to the charges with affirmative defenses the referee struck the defenses pursuant to a motion from the florida bar but noted sibley could raise the same issues during the final hearing.when the referee was unable to reach sibley to set a mutually convenient time for the final hearing,the referee scheduled the final hearing for april.five days prior to the hearing,sibley filed a motion to dismiss or,alternatively,fifth affidavit and motion to disqualify,or alternatively,motion to continue hearing.in his motion,sibley indicated he had professional obligations that would prevent him from appearing in april but that he would make himself available by telephone for a scheduling hearing.the referee denied the motion.on the final hearing date,sibley failed to appear and the referee conducted the hearing without him.after the final hearing both parties submitted proposed reports to the referee.sibley also filed a request with the florida supreme court to subpoena the referee so he could advance his theory that the referee was acting improperly.
the referee issued his report concluding that a court of competent jurisdiction had found that sibley wilfully refused to pay his child support obligation in a timely manner and,therefore,recommended that sibley be found guilty of violating rule h.the referee also concluded that the third district court of appeals sanction of sibley for filing vexatious and meritless litigation warranted recommending that sibley be found guilty of violating rule.the referee recommended a suspension in light of six aggravating factors sibley dishonest or selfish motive,his pattern of misconduct,multiple offenses,intentional failure to comply with rules or orders of the disciplinary agency,refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of the conduct,and his substantial experience in the practice of law.
the florida supreme court,after full briefing but without oral argument,approved the referee report and entered a suspension order.florida bar sibley,so d,cert.denied,d.the suspension order was stayed until may,to allow sibley to seek review in the supreme court of the united states.sibley then filed motions challenging the authority and power of the referee and some of the florida supreme court justices to act as constitutional officers specifically,sibley asserted that they were without authority to act because they allegedly failed to properly execute loyalty oaths with their respective courts.the florida supreme court rejected this argument.florida bar sibley,so d,cert.denied,d,wl.
