in,this court ordered petitioner ronald robert silverton disbarred based on his felony convictions for conspiracy to obtain money by false pretenses and to present a fraudulent insurance claim as well as for soliciting another to commit or join in the commission of grand theft.in re silverton cal d.after three unsuccessful applications,petitioner was reinstated as a member of the state bar on october.less than two years later,he began a series of client transactions that became the subject of another disciplinary proceeding charging violations of rules and of the rules of professional conduct the review department of the state bar court review department ultimately concluded that petitioner violated rule with respect to three matters and violated rule with respect to one other matter and recommended that petitioner be placed on two years stayed suspension and three years probation with various conditions,including a period of actual suspension.
in determining the appropriate level of discipline to recommend to this court,the review department considered the rules of procedure of the state bar,title iv,standards for attorney sanctions for professional misconduct standards,including standard a effect of prior discipline standard a.standard a directs that the degree of discipline imposed on a member with a prior record of discipline shall be greater than that imposed in the prior proceeding unless the prior discipline imposed was so remote in time to the current proceeding and the offense for which it was imposed was so minimal in severity that imposing greater discipline in the current proceeding would be manifestly unjust.italics added.however,the review department declined to apply standard a,which would have resulted in disbarment,based solely on its belief that doing so would,in our view,be manifestly unjust,particularly in light of the fact that petitioner prior record is very remote in time.
silverton petitioned for our review.cal.rules of court,rule a.we denied the petition but granted review on our own motion to settle important questions of law concerning the discipline of attorneys who had previously been disbarred and to consider whether the discipline recommended here was appropriate in light of the record as a whole.cal.rules of court,rule a.as explained below,we reject the review department recommendation and conclude instead that silverton should be disbarred for a second time.
the procedural history of this disciplinary proceeding is lengthy but largely irrelevant to the issue presented here.we therefore need discuss only the misconduct found by the review department and the recommended discipline.
the hou matter case 
on june,janette hou was injured in a traffic accident with a truck operated by durham transportation,durham.janette retained attorney david watson to represent her and her children,raymond and philip,in their claims against durham.janette,fan hou,also retained watson.under the retainer agreements,watson was to receive a contingent fee of of the gross recovery if the claims were settled before filing suit or demand for arbitration and percent thereafter.the agreements also entitled watson to of any excess medical pay he was able to recover on their behalf.
watson eventually filed a lawsuit against durham and,on june,associated silverton to assist in the hou matter.watson informed the hous of this arrangement and assured them it would not result in an increase in fees.later that month,silverton arranged to settle the hous lawsuit against durham for,of which was allocated to janette and her sons and was allocated to fan.after deducting attorney fees and costs,janette recovery was to be and fan recovery was to be.janette and her sons,however,had medical bills of fan had medical bills of.
watson,in the meantime,had received in medical payment coverage from the hous automobile insurer,century insurance.from this sum,watson deducted as fees and placed the remaining in his trust account of this latter amount,janette and her son were allocated approximately,and fan was allocated approximately.thus,after taking into account medical bills and the medical payments from century insurance,janette net recovery was minus plus,and fan net recovery was minus plus.
at that point,silverton proposed,and janette and fan signed,an authorization to compromise doctor bill,which gave the silverton law offices the right to compromise their medical bills and keep the amount saved by said compromise as an addition to its fees and costs for handling said accident case.in return,silverton offered janette an additional,increasing her recovery from to,and offered fan an additional,increasing her recovery from to.the authorization recited that it was given in consideration for the fact that the silverton law offices has reduced the medical bills in considering the disbursement to me and has accepted as its risk the possibility that the doctor may not compromise to the extend sic i have been benefitted sic by the consideration of said compromise on the disbursement sheet.silverton distributed the settlement proceeds to janette and fan in checks dated august.the settlement drafts,however,were not actually issued by durham until september.
silverton eventually compromised all of the medical charges,which were originally,for.as a result,silverton retained,in addition to the sums provided in the original contingent fee agreement,a total of,which represented the reduction in the medical bills less the amount advanced to the hous.in other words,silverton retained over of the reduction in the medical bills.
the review department determined that the arrangement involving a compromise of the medical bills was a business transaction,in that the authorization to compromise constituted an immediate transfer from the hous of both the ownership and possessory interest in all funds remaining after payment to the hous of their distributive share of the settlement proceeds and the payment of attorney fees as called for in the original retainer agreement in exchange for an upfront payment by the attorney.the transaction was therefore barred unless silverton could show that a the transaction or acquisition and its terms are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which should reasonably have been understood by the client and b the client is advised in writing that the client may seek the advice of an independent lawyer of the client choice and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek that advice and c the client thereafter consents in writing to the terms of the transaction or the terms of the acquisition.rule see generally fletcher davis cal th,d.the review department determined that silverton failed to disclose to the hous information necessary for a reasonable understanding of the transaction,failed to provide the hous with written notice of their right to seek independent legal counsel,and failed to discharge his burden to show the transaction was fair and reasonable to the hous.in particular,silverton failed to share with his clients,as he had with cocounsel watson,his confidence that the medical bills could be compromised at a lower amount.see mayhew benninghoff th,d.in addition,the review department found that silverton committed uncharged violations of rule by giving the hous their settlement checks,which were drawn on silverton client trust account,more than a week before durham actually paid the settlement.
the kelly and de jonge matters case 
on november,wilma kelly kelly and verna de jonge de jonge each retained silverton to represent them and their respective children,who had suffered injuries in an automobile accident the previous day.each agreement provided that silverton was to represent these parties as their attorney at law in a cause of action against all responsible parties whosoever may be liable,arising out of an auto accident that occurred on granted him a special power of attorney to settle or compromise any claim on client behalf which,in attorney sole judgement sic is fair and reasonable and entitled him,as his attorney fees for the services described,of any amounts recovered by way of settlement or otherwise,if the matter was settled before suit or request for arbitration is filed,and percent of any amounts recovered thereafter.each agreement also provided that silverton may,at his sole discretion,compromise any medical bill,and said attorney may retain as an additional fee the difference between the compromised amount and the bill for medical services,if anything.
silverton settled the kelly claims for.after deducting in attorney fees and in costs,the kelly recovery was was less than the medical bills of.in february,silverton proposed to increase the kelly share of the settlement by offering to pay them out of his fees for the right to compromise the medical bills.in proposing this postsettlement agreement,silverton represented that he already had the right,under the november retainer agreement,to compromise the kelly medical bills and to retain any savings.kelly accepted the offer.this postsettlement agreement was not in writing.
silverton achieved a compromise of the medical bills at,for a savings of.after learning that silverton had obtained such a large reduction in the medical bills,kelly asked for a share.silverton paid her an additional according to silverton,he paid kelly the additional out of the empathy he had for her over her financial plight.
silverton also settled the de jonge claims for.after deducting in attorney fees and in costs,the de jonge recovery was after subtracting the medical bills of,the net recovery was.in february,silverton proposed to increase the de jonge recovery from to by offering an additional for the right to compromise the medical bills and to retain any resulting savings.silverton advised de jonge,as he had done with kelly,that he already had the right,under the retainer agreement,to compromise the medical bills and keep any savings.de jonge accepted the offer and,as with kelly,the postsettlement agreement was not in writing.the record is silent as to whether silverton was able to compromise the de jonge medical bills.
the review department rejected the hearing department finding that rule was violated by the provision in the retainer agreements that permitted silverton to compromise the kelly and de jonge medical bills and keep any savings as an additional fee but did agree with the hearing department that this provision was an agreement for an unconscionable fee,in violation of rule.although silverton was entitled to contract for,charge,and collect a reasonable fee for providing that service,he did not do so.he unequivocally contracted for a percent contingency fee of any reduction he was able to negotiate.at least within the context of the present case,that fee is clearly unreasonable,unconscionable,and improper.the review department also found that silverton committed an uncharged violation of rule by failing to disclose the terms of the kelly and de jonge postsettlement agreements in writing,failing to obtain their written consent to the transaction,failing to advise them of their right to seek independent counsel or to give them the opportunity to seek such advice,and failing to establish the fairness of the transaction.
he belenki matter case 
on may,boris belenki belenki retained silverton to represent him in connection with personal injuries belenki suffered in an auto accident on may.the retainer agreement recited that belenki had retained silverton to represent him as his attorney at law in a cause of action against all concerned parties whomsoever may be liable,arising out of auto accident of and stated that silverton was to receive,as his attorney fees for the services described in the agreement,of any amounts recovered prior to filing suit and percent of any amount recovered thereafter.the agreement also contained the provision,like that in the kelly and de jonge agreements,authorizing silverton to compromise the client medical bills and retain any savings as an additional fee.
in october,silverton settled belenki claims for.after deducting attorney fees of and in costs,belenki recovery was after deducting medical bills of,belenki net recovery was.silverton proposed to increase belenki recovery from to by offering an additional for the right to compromise belenki medical bills and retain any savings.belenki accepted and executed an authorization to compromise medical bills,which stated that the additional payment to belenki was given in consideration for the fact that the silverton law offices has accepted as its risk the possibility that payment of some of the medical bills ma y be required from the attorney fee and recited that belenki has been informed that he may consult with any other attorney concerning this matter and has declined to do so.
silverton succeeded in reducing belenki medical bills from to,for a savings of.
as in the kelly and de jonge matters,the review department rejected the hearing department finding that the retainer agreement had violated rule but did find that the challenged provision permitting silverton to compromise belenki medical bills and to keep percent of the negotiated savings as an additional fee was an agreement for an unconscionable fee in violation of rule.the review department also found that the postsettlement agreement constituted an uncharged violation of rule and that the issuance of a settlement check to belenki before the defendant insurer had paid the settlement constituted an uncharged violation of rule.
recommended discipline 
the review department recommended that silverton be suspended from the practice of law for two years that execution of the suspension be stayed and that he be placed on probation for three years with various conditions,including an actual suspension of minor sanction.in re morse cal th,d.the review department found,as aggravating factors,his prior disbarment std b i the existence of multiple acts of misconduct std b ii three uncharged violations of rule with respect to the postsettlement agreements with kelly,de jonge,and belenki see edwards state bar cal d,evidence of uncharged misconduct was relevant to establish a circumstance in aggravation and three uncharged violations of rule involving silverton payment to belenki and to the hous of their shares of the settlement proceeds prior to the deposit of the settlement funds in the client trust account.the review department found,as mitigating factors,that silverton actually and reasonably believed that he was entitled to negotiate the postsettlement agreements at arm length std e ii and that no party suffered significant harm std e iii.
the review department granted the state bar request to take judicial notice of silverton prior disbarment.yet,in selecting the appropriate sanction,the review department declined to rely on standard a,which would require that we recommend silverton disbarment d oing so would,in our view,be manifestly unjust,particularly in light of the fact that silverton prior record of discipline is very remote in time.the review department then turned to standard,which provides that an attorney culpability of a willful violation of rule,such as entering into fee agreements for an unconscionable fee,shall result in at least a actual suspension from the practice of law,irrespective of mitigating circumstances.but the review department declined to rely on this standard,either.ultimately,it chose to follow in the matter of hultman review cal.state bar.rptr,wl,which it deemed a comparable case to silverton and in which the recommended discipline was an actual suspension.attorney hultman,however,was charged only with a single count of violating rule and did not have a prior record of discipline,let alone a disbarment.
we have undertaken an independent determination of the law and facts in this matter in re rose cal th,d,and accept and adopt the conclusions of the review department that silverton violated rule with respect to the hou matter and rule with respect to the kelly,de jonge,and belenki matters.the only issue before this court is the appropriate form and degree of discipline for this misconduct.in re brown cal th,d.
in attorney discipline matters,we generally accord great weight to the review department
