this consolidated appeal presents the issue of whether photographs and videotapes of deputy sheriffs engaging in sexually explicit,conduct available for on the internet is entitled to first amendment protection.the district court granted the motion to dismiss of the sheriff who approved the terminations of the participating deputy sheriffs.we affirm.
background 
ronald thaeter and timothy moran were deputy sheriffs with the palm beach county sheriff office pbcso.prior to the fall of,they had agreed to participate in sexually explicit photographs and videotapes for dissemination on websites operated by elizabeth maxwell,the wife of a third deputy sheriff,jack maxwell,who also was a participant elizabeth maxwell conducted a photographing session in a hotel room during which hundreds of photographs as well as videotapes were taken of group sexual activity.the participants understood that the photographing and videotaping were being created for distribution on her website.deputies thaeter,moran,and maxwell did request that their faces be obscured or disguised because of their concern for the sensitivity of their jobs as deputy sheriffs,but the film editing was not successful in preventing them from being identified.
deputy thaeter appeared in still photographs showing acts of intercourse,masturbation,and oral sex with multiple partners.these photographs together with photographs that involved the use of a pbcso marked police car were posted on several pornographic websites on the internet.deputy thaeter additionally participated in production of a streaming video or movie,in which he engaged in intercourse,masturbation,and oral sex with his wife,sorphea thaeter,for broadcast on three websites.deputy moran participated in explicit group sexual activity shown in still photography disseminated over the websites,but he was not featured in any streaming videos.
in october,a private citizen made an anonymous complaint to the pbcso and reported the participation of the deputies in sexual activity displayed on the websites.the citizen also stated that the graphic materials portrayed included a nude female posing on marked patrol cars possibly owned by the pbcso.consequently,pbcso captain mills submitted employee misconduct charges for the deputies to the office of professional regulation,which ordered an investigation by the bureau of internal affairs.
investigator paula kronsperger conducted the investigation and interviewed the three deputies and elizabeth maxwell.she also contracted for memberships in the four websites involved to inspect visually the subject photographs and videos.after reviewing hundreds of photographs,investigator kronsperger located a few where the faces of deputies thaeter,moran,and maxwell were identifiable,but she found no association with the pbcso discernible to anyone not personally acquainted with the deputies.she further noted that all the photographic materials appeared to involve consensual sexual activity.
investigator kronsperger report focused on three areas of misconduct by the deputies use of a pbcso patrol vehicle,an ethical violation under the code of ethics used by the pbcso,and other identifiable misconduct.because investigator kronsperger investigation revealed that the implicated pbcso vehicle involved only deputy maxwell and his wife,who were not parties in this case in district court and,consequently,not parties in this appeal,we need not consider that issue investigator kronsperger described her investigation into an ethical violation by the deputies as determining whether or not the deputies appearance on the rises to the level of an ethics violation.folder i,exh.a at.the code of ethics utilized by the pbcso makes only this statement pertaining to a deputy personal life i will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all.id.
investigator kronsperger explained her reasoning for concluding that the subject code of ethics ii had not been violated because of policy failure as follows 
the nature of the deputies actions is not in question.the application of the policy is where questions arise.the above referenced policy statement is vague,in that,the intended communication of the policy to the employee is completely.certainly,there are many acts that would sully or tarnish one private life.which acts,and in this case acts,are to be applied to the policy i researched the canons of ethics in order to locate any other guidelines that would govern the conduct of maxwell,thaeter,and moran.that search also met with negative results.
as an investigator,i am charged with the responsibility of identifying specific facts and making recommendations,based solely on those facts,as to whether or not a preponderance of evidence has been established to prove or disprove the existence of a policy violation.as there is no place for personal opinion in a investigation,i must therefore recommend this aspect of the code of ethics be viewed as a policy failure.due to it s general verbiage,this particular policy statement would inevitably entail the rendering of a subjective opinion individual interpretation in order to arrive at any finding,whether sustainable or not.i would be remiss in my responsibilities as an investigator if i did not raise this issue for consideration.
investigator kronsperger also identified other misconduct with respect to the rules and regulations governing employment of pbcso employees sheriff office personnel shall obtain prior written approval from the sheriff,using the approved request form,before engaging in other employment,occupation,profession or commercial enterprise.id.ix employment,pbcso rules and regulations.in analyzing this identified misconduct by the deputies,investigator kronsperger determined that t he deputies did not seek or obtain written approval from the sheriff in order to participate in their activities on the.certainly,their requests would have been denied.id.while the implicated deputies contended that they were not engaging in outside employment because they had no ownership in the websites,investigator kronsperger concluded that 
there is a violation of policy as it relates to employment.maxwell,thaeter and moran did involve themselves,and take part in,elizabeth maxwell and bob hall pornographic business enterprises.the participation included the following 
posing for photographs depicting multiple partner sexual encounters.
knowledge that the sole purpose of their appearances in the photos and attendance at the photo shoots was to acquire enough photographic material to fill photo galleries for three pornographic.
signing a release allowing elizabeth maxwell to have exclusive rights to the use of the photographs.
receipt of financial gains,albeit indirectly through their spouses,from earnings acquired from the.
id.at second emphasis added.
investigator kronsperger additionally determined that 
the deputies participation in the,by design,was meant to be secretive.this is supported by the following facts 
the faces of the three men are obscured in all but a handful of the photographs on the.
failure to request written permission to participate in pornographic.
the two that featured the wives of moran and thaeter were immediately shut down when thaeter and moran received notification of this investigation.the remaining site featuring elizabeth maxwell was not shut down,but at that point maxwell had already resigned his position with the palm beach county sheriff office and was openly appearing on her with no effort to conceal his identity.
the were registered only in the names of the women.any financial gains were,therefore,reportedly only paid to the women.the acquisition of earnings from the being paid only to the women is a technicality dwelled upon by deputies in order to create the appearance of separating themselves from the business aspects of the.all parties performed on the.even if the financial gains were paid only to the women,the deputies certainly would have had an expectation of financial gain through their own participation.
id.at emphasis added.accordingly,investigator kronsperger recommended finding that the deputies violation of ix employment had been sustained factually.
on december,administrative manager frank demarco of internal affairs of the pbcso reversed investigator kronsperger findings,which he addressed to assistant director arthur owen of the office of professional regulation.demarco,who initially had been with the new york city police department and had been with the pbcso for years,explained his reasoning for recommending reversal of investigator kronsperger factual findings based upon the code of ethics of the sheriff department that officers are to keep their private lives unsullied as an example to all 
what one does in the privacy of their home is something that is sacred,should not be compromised,and is protected by the constitution.however,i believe that once these individuals made a conscious,adult decision to involve themselves and their wives in pornography on the net,they crossed the line and exposed themselves to both criticism and scrutiny of this agency.the fact that what they are doing may not be illegal does not have a bearing on whether or not the conduct is offensive or embarrassing to the palm beach county sheriff office.it is also true that whether or not this conduct is immoral or offensive to the community should not have any impact on this agency ability to denounce the individuals or to punish them.
there is another equally compelling reason for my reversal of investigator kronsperger finding and that is officer credibility.during my tenure with the public defender office,it was common practice for all trial attorneys to do internal affair backgrounds on law enforcement officers prior to trial.the reasoning is obvious attack officer credibility.an allegation such as this,whether sustained or not,would destroy any officer credibility and would not be limited to moral or judg ment issues.
i have encountered deplorable behavior on the part of law enforcement officers during my tenure as a police officer,but i find what these individuals have done is unconscionable and truly an embarrassment to all members of this agency and to the law enforcement community in general.in order for law enforcement to have the respect of the community they serve,they must hold themselves to a higher standard of behavior at all just while on duty.
i would be remiss in my duty as administrator of internal affairs to stand by,remain silent,and allow these men to blemish the integrity,honor and reputation of this fine agency and the men and women who serve our community.

lieutenant ann burke,executive officer of the internal affairs bureau rejected investigator kronsperger recommendations,concluded that the deputies behavior violated the code of ethics ii of the sheriff department,and warranted referral for disciplinary action 
the investigation revealed that deputy jack maxwell,deputy ron thaeter,and deputy tim moran were involved in sexually explicit photographs depicting acts of intercourse,masturbation,and oral sex,all of which were with multiple partners.these photographs were posted on several different pornographic web sites on the internet,which also involved the use of a pbcso marked police car.deputy thaeter and deputy maxwell were discovered to have appeared in streaming video,better described as pornographic movies depicting live sex,masturbation,and oral sex.these movies made no attempt to disguise either the face of deputy maxwell or deputy thaeter.
several of the pornographic photographs that appear on these web sites did make an attempt to disguise the faces of deputy maxwell,deputy thaeter and deputy moran.during their sworn statements to investigator kronsperger,both deputy moran and deputy thaeter admit that they demanded to have their faces disguised in the photographs because they are deputies and their actions,during their hours,would cause scrutiny.however,despite the fact that they are deputies and the inherent risk involved,all three of these deputies agreed to participate in pornographic images and movies that could be viewed anywhere,anytime,by anyone in the world with internet access and a credit card.furthermore,their involvement in this pornographic internet sex show was a business endeavor,from which all three deputies received financial benefit.
the actions of deputy maxwell,deputy thaeter,and deputy moran clearly demonstrate a violation of moral character and,certainly,their commitment to keep their private lives unsullied as an example to all.as law enforcement officers,we are held to a higher standard of moral character.we must recognize that the badge of our office is a symbol of public faith and public trust.the poor judg ment exercised by deputy maxwell,deputy thaeter,and deputy moran with regard to their conduct is exceptionally egregious.their direct involvement in publicly viewed pornography sullies not only their personal life and professional reputation it sullies the public perception of the palm beach county sheriff office.
exh.c at decision of lieutenant ann burke,office of internal affairs,emphasis added.
following notification that the internal investigation tentatively had substantiated allegations of violating regulation sections relating to employment and the code of ethics for public officers and employees,deputies thaeter and moran participated in the internal administrative process in response to the allegations against them.each deputy,represented by counsel,had a determination meeting,conducted by captain michael gauger.on april,captain gauger issued a discipline notification to both deputies and recommended that they be terminated from employment with the pbcso on the first page of the discipline notification,sheriff bieluch wrote i concur and signed his name the under sheriff wrote strongly concur folder i,exh.thereafter,lieutenant ann burke notified each deputy that he was terminated effective april.
upon receiving their respective terminations,both deputies appealed their terminations as disciplinary actions to the hearing review board,conducted by captain terrence rowe.commissioner james moore of the criminal justice professionalism program,by letter,notified sheriff bieluch that the criminal justice standards and training commission,an independent regulatory commission,had no basis to pursue any action against either deputy,although that decision did not reflect upon the investigation,findings,conclusions,disciplinary action of the pbcso folder,exh.through counsel,the deputies challenged the regulations under which they had been terminated.specifically,they argued that the requirement that a deputy must lead an unsullied life was both void for vagueness and overbroad,impinging on constitutional rights of freedom of speech and expression as well as privacy.
the hearing review board determined that the matter was not sustained due to a policy failure as to the violation of the code of ethics and that there was no violation in regards to outside employment.folder,exh.nonetheless,sheriff bieluch wrote on the bottom of the decision i do not concur with the board findings.the original charge and discipline stands.id.in an attached memorandum,sheriff bieluch explained his reasons for disagreeing with the hearing review board and directed that his memorandum be provided to each member of a termination review board if the deputies pursued administrative review of their terminations 
the former deputies,timothy moran,ronald thaeter,and jack maxwell,iii admitted to participating in the web site.this was done for economic gain,thus it is a job or business venture,which requires approval from each employee respective chain of command prior to engaging in outside employment.reversal of the finding regarding that portion of the sustained internal affairs investigation simply makes no sense.they needed the permission of the sheriff office supervisors,and they did not have it.it is obvious that they violated this rule.i reject the board to vote to overturn that sustained finding.
the board cited policy failure as the reason for voting to in reversing the sustained code of ethics violation,and my decision to terminate the aforementioned employees.had the board called lieutenant ann burke to answer why she overturned the initial findings of investigator kronsperger,and had the members reviewed sop iv e,they would have known that policy failure did not occur,and did not apply.that sop states policy policy or procedure does not properly address the allegation.confusion,or conflict in policy led to the alleged conduct.
the actions of pornographic activity would best be addressed by the code of ethics.certainly,the code of ethics is not so confusing that it would lead the former deputies to engage in pornographic acts.those are the elements necessary to cite policy failure.those elements are not present.i reject the board to vote to overturn that sustained finding.
in conclusion,the pornographic activity was not restricted to the privacy of the former deputies homes.instead,it was on the internet,which is accessible by the public.when an allegation of misconduct is presented to the sheriff office,it is mandated by policy and statute that an investigation be conducted.the public,if not already aware,then becomes aware of the incident because of the public records law in florida.it is my stated belief that pornographic activity by deputies is something which would cause embarrassment to other officers,to the sheriff office itself,which is the premiere law enforcement agency in palm beach county,as well as to me personally and professionally as the sheriff.
whether the florida department of law enforcement seeks to have a probable cause hearing is irrelevant.internal affairs investigations are based on a preponderance of evidence,and i believe that the preponderance requirement has been met.
the hearing review board determinations are rejected in whole.the terminations of former deputies moran,and thaeter will stand.
folder,exh.o at first,second,sixth,eighth,ninth and tenth emphases added.
pursuant to standard operating procedure,deputies thaeter and moran requested that the hearing review board convene a termination review board to review the sheriff overruling the decision of the hearing review board regarding their terminations.in a letter to the chairman of the termination review board,counsel for deputies thaeter and moran pursued her arguments that the police officer code of ethics requirement that an officer must keep his or her private life unsullied as an example to all was vague and that a police officer can not be disciplined for involvement in activity protected by the first amendment.folder,exh.r at.in a decision,the termination review board determined that deputies thaeter and moran should be returned to work.based on that decision,counsel for deputies thaeter and moran then wrote sheriff bieluch to reinstate the deputies 
when sheriff bieluch did not reinstate deputies thaeter and moran,they subsequently filed individual complaints for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as well as monetary damages in federal court against the pbcso and sheriff bieluch.in seeking to be reinstated as deputies in good standing at the pbcso,they raised various causes of action,including an action under that their rights of free speech and association protected under the united states and florida constitutions had been violated.the district judge dismissed with prejudice the deputies complaints for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted.he specifically noted the plaintiffs in any event by their complaint s do not deny their participation in the sexually explicit photographs and video tapes in question,which are described in narrative form in kronsperger final investigative report as derived from taped interviews with the three officers in question,but rather,challenge the authority of the sheriff to terminate their employment,consistent with first amendment precepts,based upon that activity.at thaeter case at moran case.this appeal followed in which the deputies argue that the district judge erred in dismissing their complaints under federal rule of civil procedure b by concluding that the,sexual conduct of the deputies did not constitute protected expressive conduct under the first amendment 
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
our review of a district court dismissal for failure to state a claim under rule b is de novo.behrens regier,cir.when considering a motion to dismiss,all facts set forth in the plaintiff complaint are to be accepted as true and the court limits its consideration to the pleadings and exhibits attached thereto.grossman nationsbank,cir per curiam citation omitted.a complaint may not be dismissed for failure to state a claim under rule b unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.magluta samples,cir per curiam quoting conley gibson,d.
employment 
deputies thaeter and moran contend that their participation in explicitly sexual or pornographic pictures and videos offered for pay over the internet for which they were compensated was protected speech under the first and fourteenth amendments that could not constitute the basis for their terminations these deputy sheriffs,however,were subject to rules and regulations of their government employer,the pbcso.notably,a specific regulation of the pbcso required them to obtain prior written approval from the sheriff using the approved request form,before engaging in other employment,occupation,profession or commercial enterprise.folder i,exh.a at ix employment,rules and regulations of the pbcso emphasis added.additionally,the pbcso required its employees to adhere to its adopted code of ethics,which mandated that employees must keep their private lives unsullied as an example to all.folder i,exh.a at.the obvious purpose of the regulation was to prevent damage to public confidence in the pbcso by employees employment,and the ethical rule similarly required employees to conduct their private or lives so as not to place the pbcso in disregard.
there is no dispute that deputies thaeter and moran did not seek or obtain prior written approval from sheriff bieluch before their participation in the pornographic pictures and videos for compensation.although a government employee does not relinquish all first amendment rights otherwise enjoyed by citizens just by reason of his or her employment,nonetheless a governmental employer may impose certain restraints on the speech of its employees,restraints that would be unconstitutional if applied to the general public.city of san diego roe,d per curiam see brown glines,d even when not confronted with the special requirements of the military,we have held that a government employer may subject its employees to such special restrictions on free expression as are reasonably necessary to promote effective government.collecting cases kelley johnson,d upholding regulation of police department against a first and fourteenth amendment challenge when an employee violates a specific rule or regulation to which he or she is subject,the government employer position is strengthened.connick myers,d citing healthy city school dist.bd.of educ.doyle,d.
significantly,the rule requiring prior written approval before engaging in employment is not obtuse or ambiguous.see colten kentucky,d explaining that a rule should comport with a rough idea of fairness and be sufficiently specific to provide fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited.the rule is easily understood by persons of ordinary intelligence.zook brown,cir concerning failure of deputy sheriff to obtain prepublication review from the sheriff before submitting a letter for publication in a local newspaper see connally general constr.determining that a regulation is facially vague when it either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.therefore,failure to comply with the rule requiring prior written approval from sheriff bieluch before engaging in any employment evidences deliberate disregard for this rule governing the employment of deputies thaeter and moran.their knowledge of this rule is further shown by the deputies attempts to conceal their identities in the pornographic videos in which they participated,demonstrating their realization that this conduct was done in contravention of the rules governing their pbcso employment.additionally,the termination of the two websites that featured the wives of deputies thaeter and moran occurred when the deputies received notice of the internal investigation.
in the particularized context of government employees exercising their first amendment rights,the supreme court confirmed in roe that the appropriate analysis is the balancing test established in pickering board of education of township high school district,d,and clarified by connick at.at.this test requires balancing the speech by the government employee with the proper functioning of government offices,which can not be compromised roe,at.at.roe concerned a police officer who made a sexually explicit video of himself masturbating,which he sold over the internet on the section of ebay.following an investigation,the police officer was terminated for violating specific police department policies,including conduct unbecoming of an officer,outside employment,and immoral conduct.id.at.at see pena deprisco,cir t he fact that an officer is does not prevent him or her from giving assurances about what he or she or other police officers will or will not do when acting as police officers.in upholding the terminations of deputies thaeter and moran against the contrary decision of the hearing review board,sheriff bieluch stated certainly,the code of ethics is not so confusing that it would lead the former deputies to engage in pornographic acts.folder i,exh.o at.the roe court clarified that connick augmented pickering by making the threshold test for engaging in the pickering balancing analysis a determination of whether the government employee speech involved a matter of public concern,defined as a subject of legitimate news interest that is,a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public at the time of publication.at.at.
similar to the pornographic conduct of the police officer in roe,the paid participation of deputies thaeter and moran in pornographic photographing and videotaping for internet display for a fee does not qualify as a matter of public concern under any view of the public concern test.id.at.at.additionally,despite their attempts to disguise themselves while engaging in sexually explicit acts,the deputies expressive conduct and the fact that they were recognized as deputy sheriffs with the pbcso by paying internet voyeurs was detrimental to the mission and functions of the employer it reflected on their fitness as deputies and undermined public confidence in the pbcso.id.because their participation in pornographic photographs and videos for pay is within the context of restrictions by governmental entities on the speech of their employees,the pickering balancing test is not applicable to the subject sexually expressive conduct of deputies thaeter and moran.id.at.at.the district judge properly dismissed the deputies cases 
iii.conclusion 
in this consolidated appeal from the granting of pbcso and sheriff bieluch motion to dismiss,deputies thaeter and moran maintain that their first amendment rights were violated when they were terminated for participating for compensation in sexually explicit photographs and videos available for paid viewing on the internet.as we have explained,the deputies not only violated the regulation requiring prior approval from sheriff bieluch before engaging in employment,but also their expressive conduct does not qualify for the pickering balancing test because it does not involve a matter of public concern and could affect the efficiency and reputation of the pbcso regarding the public.on the facts at this stage,there is no legal basis for this case to proceed.accordingly,the district judge granting motion to dismiss is affirmed.
maxwell was not a party in the lawsuit because he voluntarily resigned his position after the internal affairs investigation commenced.
regarding the website belonging to elizabeth maxwell,investigator kronsperger reported the primary visitor page did show two photographs of a female leaning against a marked sheriff office patrol vehicle.the female,who was leaning against the side of the car,obscured the county name on the side of the vehicle.in one of the photographs,the female was handcuffed and nude.the second photograph showed her partially clothed.while the viewer of the photographs would certainly draw the inference that the vehicle was associated with law enforcement,there were no clear identifying marks to associate the vehicle with the palm beach county sheriff office.additionally,there was no agency name visible anywhere on the i,exh.a at.in interviewing deputy maxwell,investigator kronsperger reported that he said that the vehicle in the picture was,in fact,the marked palm beach county sheriff office patrol vehicle that had been issued to him.maxwell said that he was not,however,the person who took the photograph,nor was he present when the picture was taken.id.at.because of her inability to obtain a statement from elizabeth maxwell,investigator kronsperger found that the charge for ix improper conduct,intentional abuse of sheriff office equipment was not sustained.id.at.she noted,however,that w hile the placement of the vehicle on the would rise to the level of a policy violation,elizabeth maxwell is not subject to the rules and regulations of the palm beach county sheriff office.id.
in pertinent part,captain gauger discipline notification explains his reasons for recommending the deputies terminations the supervisor of the office of professional regulation under sheriff robert neumann,frank demario and the supervisor of the internal affair division,lieutenant ann burke both sustained two areas of violation.the first was the violation of section ix off duty employment.the policy of the palm beach county sheriff office requires deputies to obtain prior written approval from the sheriff,using the approved request form,before engaging in other employment,occupation,profession or commercial enterprise.your decision to engage in the business of your wife,becoming an active participant in the display of intimate,sexual behavior for remuneration,does violate sheriff office second violation sustained against you describes section ix code of ethics for public officers and employees.this section mandates that public officers strictly adhere to the code of ethics and canon of law enforcement ethics.again,your decision to engage in conduct that is construed by society to be pornographic of nature and to be viewed only by adults,for remuneration violates the code of ethics when the code states,i will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all.the attempt to disguise your identity fosters the image that you realized the behavior was inappropriate and took steps to conceal your law enforcement work has been exceptional,but your decision to engage in the web site activity is conduct that can not be condoned by our department.i am recommending that your employment with the palm beach sheriff office be,exh.g at emphasis added.
in relevant part,commissioner moore explained this decision is based upon the finding that insufficient grounds exist under the guidelines of chapter,florida statutes,to pursue any disciplinary action by the commission.the misconduct is considered a violation of agency policy as evidence is lacking to classify the misconduct as a violation of law or any moral character violation as defined under rule,florida administrative,exh.
in the letter to sheriff bieluch,counsel noted that deputy thaeter did not ha ve the opportunity to present his evidence to a review board,since after the board ruled that there was a policy failure,they did not convene his hearing.folder,exh.s at.
concerning the pbcso regulation and ethical code section that are involved in this case,the deputies also have raised on appeal constitutional vagueness and overbreadth challenges that they had presented in district court.we address these contentions within our first amendment analysis.since the deputies expressi
