gerald north,an attorney,appeals an order of the district court for the district of arizona upholding his prior suspension from the practice of law before that court.we hold that the rule generally barring jurisdiction over denials of applications to district court bars does not deprive us of jurisdiction to consider north appeal that north claim that the district court followed improper procedures in suspending him from its own bar on the basis of his suspension from the state bar of arizona is moot because north suspension from the state bar has expired and does not fall into the category of cases capable of repetition yet evading review north claim that district of arizona local rule a is generally invalid because it could permit insufficient review of state court suspension procedures is not properly before us and that,although the question is not moot,north has not shown that rule a violates precedent governing membership requirements for district court bars.we therefore affirm the district court.
factual and procedural background 
we recite the following facts based on north own brief to this court and a limited record below,as he is the only party to this appeal and the district court did not make detailed factual findings.gerald north is an attorney whose primary practice is in patent and antitrust law.he was admitted to the bars of arizona,iowa and illinois,and apparently had a successful practice before retiring in.as of,he maintained inactive status in all three states in which he was admitted.
in,the state bar of arizona filed a complaint against north.many of the violations alleged by the state bar involved a settlement north conducted in.north was counsel for plaintiffs in a products liability suit he settled the suit without receiving the consent of all of his clients.on march,the arizona supreme court suspended north from the state bar for a period of six months and one day his suspension period from the state bar of arizona expired in september.
due to his arizona suspension,north was reciprocally suspended from the iowa and illinois state bars.these bars have since reinstated north to practice.however,even though his suspension period is over,north has not sought reinstatement to active status in the state bar of arizona.north says that he does not want to be reinstated as an active member of the arizona bar because his practice is entirely based in federal court and that he has no plans to become an active member of the arizona bar in the future.
north was admitted to the bar of the united states district court for the district of arizona in.in,the district court received a notice from the state bar of arizona that north had not paid his annual dues at that time,the district court suspended north and informed him that he would not be reinstated until he submitted a copy of a reinstatement letter from the arizona bar.north never received a copy of this suspension order from the district court,apparently because it was sent to a former address of his in europe.north corrected the problem and was reinstated to the arizona bar in october,but he did not so inform the district court.
subsequently,in march,the arizona supreme court suspended north state bar membership for the disciplinary reasons explained above.on november,the district of arizona sent north a letter informing him that it had been notified of the arizona supreme court decision and that his district court suspension would remain in effect.this order relied on district of arizona local rule c,which permits the district of arizona to impose reciprocal discipline against lawyers sanctioned in other jurisdictions north objected to the district court november order,claiming that he had never been notified about the summary suspension,and advancing many of the arguments that we discuss below in challenging the disciplinary suspension.
on march,the district court entered a formal,reasoned order rejecting north objection to his suspension from the district court bar.in that order,the district court relied on its local rule a.rule a states that admission to and continuing membership in the bar of this court is limited to attorneys who are active members in good standing of the state bar of arizona.the district court reasoned that because when suspension is from the state bar of arizona the attorney becomes disqualified from continuing membership in the bar of this court,and thus t he issue is not one of reciprocal discipline but of qualification for continuing membership in the bar of this court.currently,north is eligible for reinstatement to the arizona bar.however,he insists that he does not want to be a member of the arizona bar and will not reapply or pay dues.the district court concluded that the order of suspension dated november,remains in effect.it is the march order that north asks us to review here.
standard of review 
a district court failure to conduct adequate review of a state bar disciplinary procedure is a question of law reviewed de novo.see in re kramer,cir applying de novo review to this legal question without expressly articulating a standard of review.challenges to the legality of a district court local rule are also questions of law reviewed de novo.see giannini real,cir.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
we first consider whether we have jurisdiction to review the district court order.ordinarily,appellate jurisdiction to review an order by the district court denying admission to practice generally before it is lacking because the denial of a petition for admission to a district court bar is neither a final order appealable under nor an interlocutory order appealable under.gallo united states dist.court,cir.
we have,however,consistently asserted jurisdiction to review orders suspending or disbarring attorneys from practicing before the bars of federal district courts within our circuit.see kramer,at in re county pioneer soc y,cir see also in re snyder,d noting that a district court decision to suspend an attorney from practicing before the district court would be subject to review by the court of appeals.
here,although the district court based its order on local rule a,which regulates a dmission to and continuing membership in the bar of the district of arizona,the district court order was clearly an order of suspension and not a denial of admission.the district court was considering a motion by north challenging his suspension from the district court bar,and the district court relied on rule a in order to conclude that its previous order of suspension remained in effect.north has asked for review of the order of suspension,not a denial of admission he has not formally applied for to the district of arizona and the district court itself believed it was considering an attorney suspension order we therefore conclude that the district court march order was a final decision on attorney suspension reviewable under our prior cases concerning attorney suspension and disbarment.bankers trust mallis,d looking to the intent of the district court in issuing an order when considering a question of appellate jurisdiction.
we have not previously stated whether our jurisdiction to consider orders suspending or disbarring attorneys from the district court bars arises under,our inherent authority to regulate the practice of law in the lower federal courts within our circuit,or under some other authority.without resolving whether there might be alternative sources of jurisdiction,we hold that the district court order in this case is reviewable under as a final decision of the district court that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.lovell chandler,cir quoting catlin united states.see also in re surrick,cir holding that an order from the district court suspending an attorney from the district court bar is a final order reviewable under.
north due process arguments about his suspension 
north argues that the district court erred in relying on rule a to uphold his suspension,because rule a allowed the district court to evade its obligation to review his suspension from the state bar.when imposing discipline on mem
