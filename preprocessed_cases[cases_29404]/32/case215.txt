plaintiff served a set of requests for inspection and production of documents and propounded a set of interrogatories.defendant responded with,inter alia,boilerplate objections of privilege and work product privilege.plaintiff brought motions to compel and to preclude defendant from making any further objections.at the hearing on the motions,the court essentially held that defendant failure to produce a privilege log resulted in the waiver of its right to object based upon privilege and granted the motions to compel.a minute order filed by the trial court several days later recast its order by stating it had overruled the privilege objections because defendant had failed to substantiate them.
this petition by defendant followed.we issued an alternative writ because interlocutory review is appropriate when a petition alleges a discovery order will result in disclosure of information protected by the privilege or the work product privilege.hernandez superior court th,d.because the trial court order was in excess of the authority conferred by statutory and decisional law,we will issue a writ directing it to set it aside and to enter a new and different order directing defendant to properly respond to plaintiff discovery requests.
factual and procedural background 
on july,plaintiff served its first set of requests for inspection and production of documents that evidence,refer or relate to the issues raised by the lawsuit.on that same day,plaintiff also served its first set of special interrogatories that sought identification of all persons,documents and facts relating to the issues raised by the pleadings.
on september,defendant responded to both discovery requests with boilerplate objections,including privilege and work product privilege.
a meet and confer process did not resolve plaintiff concerns about defendant boilerplate objections.
plaintiff then filed two motions.
one was a motion to provide a full and complete statement of compliance,without further objection,to plaintiff first set of requests for inspection and production of documents.italics added.the motion claimed plaintiff requests did not relate to privileged matters.it also urged defendant responses,including its assertions of the and work product privileges were raised in a repetitive,meaningless boilerplate fashion with no attempt to link the specific objection to the specific documents defendant purports are privileged or otherwise not discoverable.plaintiff conceded the categories of documents it sought may encompass documents that are subject to a privilege but that if defendant intended to raise that privilege,it must prepare a privilege log setting forth sufficient information to determine whether or not any privilege applies defendant fails to do so.failure to produce a privilege log is an implicit admission that the privilege objection is without merit and is made in bad faith the objection should be overruled as stated because it is too broad and not specified in any manner.plaintiff cited no pertinent statutory or decisional authority to support these legal arguments.
plaintiff other motion was to compel further responses to its interrogatories without objection.the motion urged that defendant responses had been entirely evasive,incomplete,without merit or substantial justification,and in bad faith.in regard to the objections of privilege and work product,plaintiff claimed its interrogatories did not seek disclosure of any protected communications or documents but only the identity of such document,the title,author,date subject matter of the document in a manner sufficient for the issuance of a subpoena duces tecum.plaintiff claimed defendant had never explained how disclosure of this information invaded the privilege and argued that defendant failure to specify,during the meet and confer process,how the interrogatories invades the privilege or attorney work product doctrine is an admission that this objection is without merit and is made in bad faith.plaintiff,however,offered no authority statutory or decisional as to why the defendant purported delicts would preclude defendant from continuing to raise these two objections.
on october,defendant filed separate oppositions to each of plaintiff motions.each opposition claimed plaintiff motions were now moot because further responses and documents have already been voluntarily provided to plaintiff counsel.defendant argued it had been necessary to file its and timely objections because plaintiff had refused to grant it reasonable extensions of time to permit it prepare full responses.
on november,the court conducted a hearing on the motions.the court had not been provided with defendant supplemental responses.plaintiff counsel first stated he had the discovery responses,but the same objections are posed and then concluded i do withdraw a request to have the court overrule these objections and order real responses.defendant counsel responded these are real responses that stated after having time to get these documents together,work with our client,said we would produce all nonprivileged documents responsive to plaintiff request.the court asked if defendant had furnished a privilege log.defense counsel replied we are putting it together now.the court retorted here we are now at the motion.this is not a process.if you do support your objections and demonstrate that there are privileged documents that have been produced,this is the point where that falls apart,where the rubber meets the road.at another point,the court stated that because defense counsel had not yet tendered a privilege log they defendant lose all of their objections on the grounds of privilege.when defense counsel explained he had not had sufficient time to go through the file and find the attorney privilege letters and enumerate them all,the court replied at the point where you served your opposition to this motion to compel was the point that that showing had to be made.it has been made.you have the burden to support the privilege objection with admissible evidence.you have missed something if you think you do have to support your objections at the hearing on the motion to compel with admissible evidence.any objection on the grounds of or privilege is by the board here as a result of no privilege log verified.
the court minute order for the november,hearing reads defendant objections are overruled.the motions to compel are granted.
on november,in response to an ex parte application from defendant to stay its earlier order the court filed a lengthy order.it reads,in pertinent part 
defendant has applied ex parte for a stay of the court order of november,overruling defendant objections to discovery requests and granting plaintiff motion to compel.the application shows that it misunderstands the court november,order.it contends the court erred in ruling that defendant had waived the privilege.the court in that order did not rule that a waiver had taken place the court overruled defendant objections on the ground that it had not shown that any documents were subject to the privilege.
the party asserting privilege,in this case defendant,has the burden,when challenged,of showing that the evidence it seeks to suppress is within the terms of the statute establishing the privilege,a communication between a client and a lawyer.citations.another way of putting the rule is that,if a timely motion to compel has been filed,the burden is on the responding party to justify any objection.citation.
defendant did not demonstrate that any documents constitute communications between the client and its attorneys.when faced with plaintiff motion to compel,it was defendant burden to show by competent evidence that documents being withheld constituted communications that were between the client and her attorney.this is normally done with a properly authenticated privilege log 
in the case at bar,defendant did not supply a properly authenticated privilege log as part of its
