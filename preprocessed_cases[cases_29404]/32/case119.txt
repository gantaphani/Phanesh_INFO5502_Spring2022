we must decide whether a disbarred attorney may collaterally attack his state bar disciplinary proceedings in federal court.
in,the state bar of arizona initiated disciplinary proceedings against george mothershed,an attorney who was licensed by the oklahoma bar association but who lived and practiced in arizona.in response to the disciplinary board allegation that he had unlawfully practiced law in the state,mothershed entered a special appearance and moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that he had not received a summons.the hearing officer denied this motion,and mothershed subsequently refused to participate further in the disciplinary proceedings.a default judgment was entered against him,and the supreme court of arizona issued an order censuring mothershed for engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.see in re mothershed,no.lexis.
the oklahoma bar association thereafter initiated its own disciplinary proceedings against mothershed.a trial panel found that he had unlawfully practiced law in arizona,and the supreme court of oklahoma entered an order disbarring him.see state ex rel.bar ass mothershed.
mothershed responded by filing suit in the united states district court for the district of arizona against the justices of the oklahoma supreme court,the three members of the oklahoma disciplinary trial panel,and several officials of the oklahoma bar association the oklahoma defendants.he also sued the justices of the arizona supreme court,the clerk of the arizona supreme court,the members of the arizona supreme court disciplinary commission,the hearing officer in the arizona disciplinary proceedings,and a state bar staff counsel the arizona defendants.mothershed alleged that the arizona disciplinary proceedings were invalid because he had not been served with a summons.he contended that the oklahoma proceedings were likewise defective because his hearing did not occur between thirty and sixty days after appointment of the trial panel,as required by rule of the oklahoma rules governing disciplinary proceedings based upon these alleged procedural shortcomings,mothershed asserted a claim under for due process and other constitutional violations,as well as state law tort claims for interference with contractual relationships,defamation,abuse of process,malicious prosecution,false light,and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
mothershed also contended that arizona supreme court rules d and which set forth the pro hac vice admission requirements for attorneys and the standards for admission to the state bar of arizona,violate arizonans first amendment right to consult with an attorney and contravene both the sherman antitrust act,and the arizona uniform state antitrust act.stat.mothershed requested damages totaling more than million and an injunction reinstating his membership in the oklahoma bar association and prohibiting the defendants from interfering with his arizona law practice.
after the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on various grounds,the district court dismissed the oklahoma defendants due to the absence of personal jurisdiction.the court later dismissed the claims against the arizona defendants on the ground that mothershed was improperly seeking review of the arizona bar disciplinary proceedings in a lower federal court and that subject matter jurisdiction was therefore absent under the doctrine.mothershed timely appealed.
in the face of growing judicial uncertainty about the doctrine parameters,the supreme court recently reiterated that its applicability is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name cases brought by losers complaining of injuries caused by judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.exxon mobil saudi basic indus,d see also rooker fid.trust.court of appeals feldman,d.
we must therefore decide whether mothershed claims fall within the doctrine narrowed scope.
under,lower federal courts are without subject matter jurisdiction to review state court decisions,and state court litigants may therefore only obtain federal review by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the supreme court of the united states.see rooker,at.holding that a federal district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a suit that effectively sought review of an indiana state court decision feldman,at.holding that a federal district court was without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to a decision of the district of columbia court of appeals see also final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a state in which a decision could be had,may be reviewed by the supreme court by writ of certiorari.
the doctrine does not,however,prohibit a plaintiff from presenting a generally applicable legal challenge to a state statute in federal court,even if that statute has previously been applied against him in state court litigation.this distinction is well illustrated by the feldman decision itself.there,two aspiring attorneys had petitioned the district of columbia court of appeals for a waiver of a bar rule requiring applicants to have graduated from an accredited law school.feldman,at.after the court of appeals denied their petitions,the plaintiffs filed suit in federal district court challenging both the bar rule general constitutionality and the district of columbia court decision in their particular cases.id.at.the supreme court held that the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction over the former claim but not the latter.id.at.the court explained 
united states district courts have jurisdiction over general challenges to state bar rules,promulgated by state courts in nonjudicial proceedings,which do not require review of a final judgment in a particular case.they do not have jurisdiction,however,over challenges to decisions in particular cases arising out of judicial proceedings even if those challenges allege that the state court action was unconstitutional.review of those decisions may be had only in this court.

similarly,in craig state bar of california,cir per curiam,the plaintiff filed a claim in federal court against the california bar after the state supreme court denied review of the california committee of bar examiners refusal to modify the oath to comport with his religious beliefs.we held that subject matter jurisdiction was absent because the plaintiff was seeking review of his individual claim and did not present a general challenge to the california bar policy.id.we reasoned that a 
plaintiff can challenge the state supreme court denial of bar admission to a particular applicant,the validity of the state rules governing admission,or both.lower federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over the first type of challenge in contrast,a general attack on a state admissions rules may be heard by lower federal courts because a state supreme court acts in a nonjudicial capacity when it promulgates such rules.
id.citation omitted.
mothershed alleges that the oklahoma defendants denied him due process and committed various state law torts because the oklahoma bar disciplinary panel did not hold its hearing within the time frame required by rule of the rules governing disciplinary proceedings.because mothershed does not contend that rule is systematically disregarded in all attorney disciplinary proceedings or that the rule is itself facially invalid,he is not asserting a general challenge to a state bar rule.feldman,at.rather,mothershed is alleging that the oklahoma defendants failed to apply rule during his own state bar disciplinary hearing,which constitutes a challenge to a decision in a particular case.id.under the doctrine,the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review mothershed oklahoma disciplinary proceedings,and we therefore affirm the dismissal of the oklahoma defendants 
mothershed claims premised upon the alleged absence of a summons directing him to appear at the arizona disciplinary hearing are likewise barred by the doctrine because these claims constitute a particularized challenge to the arizona disciplinary proceedings results.the district court therefore correctly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over mothershed and state law tort claims against the arizona defendants,all of which are premised upon his failure to receive a summons.
mothershed also alleges,however,that the admission requirements set forth in arizona supreme court rules d and violate arizonans first amendment right to consult an attorney of their choosing and contravene both the sherman antitrust act and the arizona uniform state antitrust act.these claims pertain to the rules validity as applied to all attorneys within arizona and,indeed,all arizona residents and thus do not present an individualized challenge to mothershed bar disciplinary proceedings.the feldman plaintiffs general constitutional attack on the bar accreditation claims constitute a general challenge to the rules governing admission to the arizona bar.see hoover ronwin,d entertaining a sherman act challenge to the arizona bar exam grading methodology brought by an attorney who had earlier contested his own exam results in separate arizona state court proceedings.
because a general attack on a state admissions rules may be heard by lower federal courts,craig,at,the district court erred by concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over mothershed first amendment and antitrust claims against the arizona defendants.
although the district court did indeed possess subject matter jurisdiction over mothershed general challenges to the arizona supreme court rules,we may affirm the district court dismissal on any ground supported by the record.wolfe strankman,cir.we first consider mothershed antitrust claims and then turn to his first amendment challenge.
in parker brown,the supreme court held that the sherman act does not apply to certain categories of state action.later decisions have held that one of these categories is the regulation of attorneys by a state supreme court.in bates state bar of arizona,d,for example,the plaintiffs alleged that an arizona bar disciplinary rule prohibiting advertising by attorneys violated the sherman act.the court determined that the arizona supreme the state the real party in interest.id.at.that court had adopted the rules,and was the ultimate body wielding the state power over the practice of law,id.at.because the advertising restrictions were compelled by direction of the state acting as a sovereign,id.internal quotation marks omitted,they were not amenable to a sherman act challenge.
likewise,in hoover ronwin,at,a plaintiff who had failed the arizona bar exam filed suit against the members of the committee on examinations and admissions alleging that the manner in which they graded the exam violated the sherman act.although the individual members of the committee were the named defendants,the court concluded that the suit was barred by parker exception because the arizona supreme court necessarily delegated the administration of the admissions process to the committee and retained the sole authority to determine who should be admitted to the practice of law in arizona.id.at.accordingly,the conduct being challenge d was in reality that of the arizona supreme court.goldfarb.state bar,d holding that a minimum fee schedule enforced by the virginia state bar did not fall within the parker exception because the fee schedule was not mandated by the virginia supreme court and thus it could not fairly be said that the state of virginia through its supreme court rules required the anticompetitive activities.
here,mothershed alleges that arizona supreme court rules d and violate the sherman act.these claims are squarely foreclosed by bates and hoover.although mothershed claim is nominally against certain state bar officials and the supreme court justices in their individual capacities,it is the supreme court of arizona that is the real party in interest because the state bar rules that mothershed is challenging are promulgated by the court in its supervisory role over the practice of law in arizona.see in re shannon,the determination of who shall practice law in arizona and under what condition is a function placed by the state constitution in this court internal quotation marks omitted.rules d and are therefore compelled by direction of the state acting as a sovereign,bates,at.internal quotation marks omitted,and are exempt from sherman act challenges.
mothershed also asserts a state antitrust claim under arizona law.the arizona uniform state antitrust act is interpreted in conformity with the federal antitrust laws.arizona maricopa county med.soc y,cir,rev on other grounds,d see also wedgewood inv.int l harvester,the arizona legislature clearly intended to strive for uniformity between federal and state antitrust laws.indeed.stat.explicitly provides,it is the intent of the legislature that in construing the uniform state antitrust act,the courts may use as a guide interpretations given by the federal courts to comparable federal antitrust statutes.bunker glass pilkington,plc,acknowledging the federal antitrust laws general importance to the interpretation of the uniform state antitrust act,while also observing that arizona courts need not rigidly follow federal precedent on every issue of antitrust law regardless of whether differing concerns and interests exist in the state and federal systems.
no court has previously had occasion to consider whether there exists a exception to the arizona antitrust laws.nevertheless,in light of the arizona legislature avowed desire to achieve uniformity between the uniform state antitrust act and the federal antitrust laws,the arizona supreme court would most likely follow bates and hoover and hold that its rules governing attorney conduct are not amenable to state law antitrust challenges.see assurance of am.wall assocs.llc of olympia,cir w hen interpreting state law,federal courts are bound by decisions of the state highest court.in the absence of such a decision,a federal court must predict how the highest state court would decide the issue internal quotation marks and citation omitted.mothershed state law antitrust claim therefore fails for the same reason as its federal counterpart.
mothershed contends that arizona supreme court rules d and violate the first amendment right of arizonans to consult with a lawyer of their choosing.because mothershed does not allege that he has himself suffered a first amendment injury,we must first determine whether he has standing to pursue this claim on behalf of other arizonans.
a plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and interests,and can not rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.warth seldin,d.this limitation is relaxed in the first amendment context,however,because when there is a danger of chilling free speech,society interest in having the statute challenged may outweigh the prudential considerations that normally counsel against standing.sec y of state joseph munson,d.a plaintiff ability to invoke overbreadth standing has nothing to do with whether or not his own first amendment rights are at stake but instead depends upon whether the plaintiff satisfies the requirement of,and whether he can be expected satisfactorily to frame the issues in the case.id.at.see also gospel missions of am.city of los angeles,cir the requirements of overbreadth standing are and the ability to frame the issues in the case satisfactorily.
