in july,this court ordered harry demell to show cause why he should not be referred to this court committee on attorney admissions and grievances the committee for investigation of the matters described in that order.in a subsequent order,filed in november,the court found demell response to the july order unsatisfactory and referred him to the committee for investigation and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.
during the committee proceedings,demell had the opportunity to address the matters discussed in the court referral order,to testify under oath at a hearing held on june,and to present a brief and a subsequent supplementary letter.demell was represented in the proceedings by roger adler.presiding over the hearing were committee members evan davis,and deirdre daly.in january,the committee filed with the court the record of the committee proceedings and its report and recommendations.thereafter,the court provided demell with a copy of the committee report,and demell filed a response,which contains a number of objections to the report.
in its report,the committee concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence that demell had engaged in conduct unbecoming a member of the bar within the meaning of federal rule of appellate procedure c.specifically,the committee found that demell had engaged in conduct inimical to the administration of justice,in re snyder,d,and had neglected matters entrusted to him as a lawyer,new york disciplinary rule a,by failing to timely respond,or timely request an extension of time to respond,to a motion to dismiss,resulting in prejudice failing to file form in a case,resulting in its dismissal and failing to timely submit papers,or timely request an extension of time,in several other cases see report at.
the committee also found that there were several aggravating and mitigating factors.the following were found to be aggravating factors there were multiple instances of misconduct,establishing a pattern,although the committee found that the facts only fell slightly on the side of aggravation,id.at demell failed to demonstrate complete candor with the committee,demell failed to demonstrate an adequate commitment to corrective action,id.at and the victims of his misconduct were vulnerable,id.at.the following were found to be mitigating factors absence of a prior disciplinary record evidence of good character or reputation and remorse,except insofar as he argued that he was not at fault regarding one of the defaulted cases.id.at.
based on its factual findings,the committee recommended that demell be publicly reprimanded for his misconduct,and required to submit to the committee periodic status reports concerning his federal practice.
upon due consideration of the committee report,the underlying record,and demell objections,we adopt the committee factual findings concerning demell misconduct in this court,except as discussed below.we also adopt the committee conclusion that demell misconduct was sufficiently serious that it warrants both a public reprimand and a requirement that he submit the period reports described in the committee report.the following discussion is intended to supplement the committee report in several respects,and to address demell objections to the report.
demell responsibility for the default in constantine gonzales,
demell argues in his response to the committee report that he is being unfairly scapegoat ed for the petitioner failure in constantine to file an opposition to the government motion to dismiss.see response at.demell claims that,once the petitioner new attorney informed demell that he was being replaced,which occurred in late december,he could take no further action in the case and the new attorney should have remedied the default.id.at,letter dated june.however,demell objection ignores the committee rationale for finding that demell engaged in misconduct in the constantine case a the government served its motion on november or,b under the applicable rule,opposition to the motion was due,at the latest,by december,and c it is undisputed that demell was the petitioner counsel until late december,but did not file any opposition papers or present any reason for not doing so.see report at.
demell may be correct that the petitioner new attorney also neglected the case,but that is irrelevant to the committee analysis.we are in complete agreement with the following statement from the committee report 
a significant contributing cause of the failure to file opposition failure that demell concedes was prejudicial to constantine,hearing tr.was demell failure to file a timely response or a timely motion for an enlargement of time.when demell passed on the file to the new attorney on or about january,he passed it on,either knowingly or negligently,with a substantial procedural default that was brought about due to his own,and no one else,inaction.whether the new attorney thereafter acted with sufficient diligence to remedy that default would not create a mitigating factor in demell favor.a failure of substitute counsel to remedy a problem does not as an ethical matter excuse the misconduct of the lawyer who created the problem in the first instance by failing to file a timely opposition finally,demell as the departing lawyer failed to explicitly call the existing problem to the new attorney attention,thereby contributing to the default.
report at.demell failure to address any aspect of the committee rationale is mystifying.we can only speculate that he did not understand the committee report,he remains unaware of his ethical obligations,or he simply sought to distract attention from his own poor performance by focusing on another attorney poor performance.in any event,he has not taken responsibility for his lack of action in the case.
production of interview notes 
prior to the committee june hearing in this matter,a committee representative spoke by telephone to the attorney who had replaced demell in the constantine case and retained notes from that conversation.see hearing tr.at report at.demell request for a copy of those notes was denied on the grounds that the committee would not be relying on any statements made by the attorney in that conversation,and that any potentially exculpatory information was already available to demell.see report at see also id.at stating that committee recommendation is not based on any disputed fact resolved adversely to demell.in his response to the committee report,demell argues that the committee refusal to provide him with a copy of the interview notes was fundamentally unfair and legally erroneous.response at.however,demell provides no analysis or citation to authority in support of that argument.
under the rules governing the committee proceedings,an attorney who is the subject of a committee investigation has the right to examine all documents in the record,unless a protective order is obtained from the grievance panel.rule c of the rules of the committee on attorney admissions and grievances.additionally,we assume that due process requires the committee to make available to the attorney under investigation all evidence that will be used against the attorney and all evidence that is either exculpatory or may lead to exculpatory evidence.in this context,demell argument is construed as an assertion that the notes at issue were part of the record,could have led to exculpatory evidence,and therefore should have been turned over in the absence of a protective order.it is not entirely clear from the report whether the committee applied the rule c and due process standards,but even if it did not,any possible error would have been harmless.
demell does not suggest that the new attorney had any conceivable information relating to the relevant time period immediately following the filing of the government motion to,the time period in which demell should have filed a response to that motion.nor does demell suggest that he himself was unable to contact the new attorney directly,or that the committee findings or recommendation were affected in any way by his inability to review those notes.since the committee findings relating to the constantine case are based entirely on demell inaction prior to the involvement of the new attorney,and demell has failed to show that the failure to grant access to the notes prejudiced him in any way,we reject demell objection to that aspect of the proceedings.
vulnerable clients as aggravating factor 
as noted above,the committee found that the vulnerability of demell clients was an aggravating factor.see report at.demell objects that this finding lacks a factual basis in the record.see response at.
an attorney who is the subject of disciplinary proceedings must have adequate notice of,and adequate opportunity to address,any aggravating factor at issue.because the committee report does not make clear the factual basis for its finding that demell victims were vulnerable,or the nature of notice provided to demell,we decline to adopt this aggravating factor.however,as explained below,the absence of this aggravating factor does not alter our conclusion 
multiple instances of misconduct as aggravating factor 
in his response to the committee report,demell suggests that the defaults discussed by the committee were isolated instances and neither systemic nor pervasive over a career spanning some three decades.response at.we find that the committee report properly characterized the scope of demell defaults as only falling slightly on the side of aggravation.report at.additionally,we note that demell objection cuts both ways.while the number of defaults discussed by the committee may not have been high,demell many years of experience is an aggravating factor,since a reasonable attorney with thirty years experience a clearly would know that defaulting on a client case leaves open the possibility of severe prejudice and b should have office and calendaring practices in place to avoid defaults.see aba standards for imposing lawyer sanctions i,listing substantial experience in the practice of law as possible aggravating factor.
conclusions 
although we do not adopt the committee finding that demell victims were vulnerable,we find that the final disposition recommended by the committee remains warranted.we are particularly disturbed by demell failure to acknowledge,or even address,his default in constantine.in that regard,demell response to the committee report is similar to his response to this court july order,which commenced this proceeding.that earlier response was found unsatisfactory due to demell failure to address important issues and to provide important details that a reasonable person should have known were highly relevant to our inquiry.thus,it remains unclear whether demell fully accepts the fact that he engaged in serious misconduct and whether he is fully committed to mending his ways.
upon due consideration,it is hereby ordered that,except as noted above,the committee findings and recommendations are adopted by the court,and demell is publicly reprimanded for the misconduct described in the committee report.it is further ordered that demell submit to the committee the periodic status reports proposed in the committee report,in compliance with the deadlines stated therein.
this order must be disclosed in any future disciplinary proceeding or bar application,and if required by any bar or court rule or order.furthermore,the clerk of court is directed to release this order to the public by posting it on this court web site and providing copies to members of the public in the same manner as all other published decisions of this court.the text of this court july and november orders and the committee report are also to be released to the public,as appendices to the present order.
the clerk of court also is directed to serve a copy of this order on demell,this court committee on attorney admissions and grievances,the attorney disciplinary committee for the new york state appellate division,first department,the attorney disciplinary officials for the executive office of immigration review,and all other courts and jurisdictions to which this court distributes disciplinary decisions in the ordinary course.

we have initiated this proceeding as a result of certain allegations that were made in constantine gonzales,cir,an appeal in which demell was the initial attorney of record for the petitioner.the docket sheet for the appeal indicates that the government filed a motion to dismiss the petition on november,and served a copy of the motion on demell.see constantine,motion filed.however,demell did not file a response to the motion,or any other document in the case,despite the fact that the motion was not decided until february.see,order filed.

text of november order 
for the reasons that follow,harry demell is referred to this court committee on admissions and grievances the committee for investigation of the matters described below and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.see second circuit local rule h.we express no opinion here as to an appropriate disposition.the committee may,of course,in the first instance,determine the appropriate scope of its investigation.
in july,this panel ordered demell to show cause why he should not be referred to the committee for investigation of the matters described in that order.see demell,order filed july.for the reasons discussed below,we find demell response to that order to be unsatisfactory.
for present purposes,familiarity with both the july order and demell response is assumed,and we note in the following paragraphs only the matters which do not appear to be adequately addressed in the response.both the july order and demell response will be forwarded to the committee with the present order.
with respect to the allegations made in constantine gonzales,demell has addressed some,but not all,of the pertinent issues.demell primarily argues that he was not at fault when a timely response to the government motion to dismiss was not filed,and suggests that any fault lies with constantine subsequent attorney.see demell,at.the conflicting assertions as to which attorney was at fault would require a credibility determination,which can not be made based on the papers currently before this panel.however,certain important issues are not addressed in demell response.although demell states that constantine and his family informed him that they did not wish him to proceed and wished to substitute counsel,demell does not indicate when this communication occurred.see,at.demell further indicates that he was later called by constantine subsequent counsel and that she took some time to fax him a substitution letter,but does not indicate when that call occurred.id.at.demell concedes that he may have failed to timely file an answer or a substitution of counsel,but does not indicate whether,and when,he was aware of the motion to dismiss or what actions he took to protect his client interests,at.
with respect to halimi ridge,demell alleges that the case had been transferred to this court from a district court pursuant to a government motion,at.although demell states that he did not oppose the transfer,he also states,without explanation,that t he appeal should have been dismissed by this court in that he believe d that jurisdiction was lacking in the court of appeals,at.demell also alleges that he is not sure who is responsible for filing form,but will now do so if it is required to close out this matter properly.id.at.however,he does not address the fact that this court docket indicates that a court employee twice contacted demell about the failure to file form,that demell informed the employee that it would be submitted asap,and that the case was dismissed for failure to do so.demell also fails to explain why it was reasonable to allow the case to be dismissed on default,or why,if he believed this court lacked jurisdiction,he did not oppose the government request to transfer it to this court,or request a transfer to a proper court,rather than taking no action.
with respect to the cases in which demell failed to timely file briefs or other documents,demell fails to provide an explanation for why extensions of time were not sought prior to the due dates for the filing of those documents,at.see second circuit dockets in late brief referred to as in demell response late supplemental brief failure to file documents in support of motion late brief.demell response with respect to khoma gonzales,in fact,does not mention the untimeliness of the filing at all.
finally,we note that demell also failed to timely file his brief in torres gonzales,and,instead,requested leave to file the brief two weeks late.see torres,motion filed,order granting motion filed.
upon due consideration of the matters described above,it is ordered that harry demell is referred to this court committee on admissions and grievances for investigation and preparation of a report,pursuant to federal rule of appellate procedure,this court local rule h,and the rules of the committee on admissions and grievances.

january report of the committee on attorney admissions and grievancesreport recommendationre in re harry demell introduction 
by order dated november,the referral order,the united states court of appeals for the second circuit the court referred harry demell to this committee for investigation of his conduct before the court and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.
demell has what he characterizes as a high volume immigration practice.the referral order raises a number of instances where demell failed to timely file briefs in cases before the court and made applications to file a late brief only after the deadline had passed.in one such instance,constantine gonzalez,however,no brief in opposition to the government motion to dismiss was ever filed,which demell concedes resulted in prejudice to his client.he contends that substituted counsel should have filed the brief,but the due date for the brief had already passed by the time the possibility of new counsel came to his attention.in view of a number of instances of allowing deadlines pass without arranging for an extension,and in light of aggravating and mitigating circumstances discussed below,the committee concludes demell neglect of this matter is of sufficient magnitude to justify a sanction.
the committee recommends that demell be publicly reprimanded for his conduct,and,as described more fully below,that he be required,in connection with his practice in any federal court in the second circuit or in any federal administrative agency whose action is subject to the second circuit review,to submit to the committee sworn statements identifying under oath each and every instance during each of four reporting periods described below in which a submission is not filed or filed out of time or an application is made for permission to make a late filing only after the due date has passed.the following constitutes the committee report and recommendation to impose discipline on demell.
ii.the disciplinary proceeding

on april,the committee sent a letter to pankaj malik,an immigration attorney who was subsequent counsel in the constantine appeal,stating that it sought to interview her in connection with its investigation of certain conduct of demell.the committee also requested from malik documents relating to the constantine appeal,which were received on may,on may,the committee interviewed malik regarding the constantine appeal.
on may,the committee sent a letter to demell requesting that he affirm under oath his response and provide a description of the documents that were sent to malik as incoming counsel.the committee may letter also informed demell of a hearing in this matter.in his may,response,demell affirmed his response and described the documents sent to malik.
on may and may,the committee informed demell of the documents that might be referred to at the hearing,provided him the documents that had been furnished by malik,and advised him that the committee would not call any additional witnesses at the hearing.
on june,evan davis and deirdre daly of the committee met with demell and his attorney for purposes of conducting a hearing.amin kassam,of the committee,and andrew dean,assisting the committee,were also present.at the hearing,demell attorney requested any committee notes of the malik interview.on june,the committee denied demell request for its notes of the malik interview,stating that it would not be relying on any statements made by malik to the committee,and that to the extent that there was any information in malik statements that might be deemed exculpatory,such information was already available to demell from the sequence of events reflected in the docket sheet and related documents,in addition to malik submissions,all of which were provided to demell.on june,demell objected to the committee decision not to provide him the notes of the malik interview.
demell was permitted two weeks from the date of receipt of the hearing transcript to submit a brief.on june,demell submitted a copy of the file that he affirmed to have sent to the malik firm on or about january.on june,demell submitted a brief,and on november,demell submitted a letter.
iii.background

the court initial show cause order 
as described in the referral order,the court ordered demell in july to show cause why he should not be referred to the committee for investigation of the matters described therein the initial order.the initial order stated that the proceeding was initiated in connection with allegations that were made against demell in constantine gonzales,an appeal in which demell was counsel of record.in constantine,the government filed a motion to dismiss on november,and demell did not file a response to the motion.the motion to dismiss was ultimately decided on february,without benefit of opposing papers.
the initial order stated that a new attorney in the case,pankaj malik,filed two motions on march,requesting that she be substituted as counsel and that the motion to dismiss be recalendared.malik papers stated that she had been retained by the petitioner in and that in early february she learned that demell had not filed a motion for substitution,that the motion was calendared for february,and that demell had not filed a response.
the initial order also raised the issue of demell conduct in halimi ridge,an appeal that was dismissed for failure of petitioner attorney to file form.a court employee contacted demell twice about filing the form,and on the second occasion demell stated that the form would be submitted asap.the form was never submitted and the case was dismissed.
the initial order also indicated that demell had failed to timely file briefs in four other matters,although dismissal had not resulted,
demell response to the court initial order 
on july,demell responded to the court initial order the initial response,with respect to the constantine appeal,demell stated that petitioner family contacted him about obtaining substitute counsel,but he could not recall when such contact occurred.he also stated that malik contacted him about taking over the appeal and that s he assured me that she would take action to substitute her appearance.according to the initial response,on january,days or weeks after his initial conversation with sent him a substitution note,and he then sent malik via federal express papers related to the appeal.the initial response stated that demell in good faith passed on these papers to another lawyer who had informed me that she was taking over this case and trusted in her actions.he also stated that i t may be that i failed to timely file an answer or a substitution of counsel.i at all times assisted new counsel and did what was in my client interests and within what i believed were the laws and rules of this court.
with respect to the halimi case,demell stated that he was not sure who is responsible for filing form.if your office determines that this needs to be done at this time in order to close out this matter properly i will do so.
demell also addressed each of the late filed briefs,which are discussed in more detail below.
the court referral order 
the referral order described demell initial response to the july order as unsatisfactory.the referral order stated that important issues were not addressed in the initial response,such as when demell was contacted by constantine new counsel and when constantine family told him that they wished to substitute counsel.in addition,demell failed to state what actions he took to protect his client interests,as he claimed to have done.also,because demell suggested that fault in failure to respond to the motion to dismiss lied with malik,the referral order stated that conflicting assertions as to which attorney was at fault would require a credibility determination,which can not be made based on the papers currently before this panel.
with respect to the halimi case,the referral order stated that the initial response did not explain his failure to file the form in light of the fact that a court employee twice contacted him about filing the form,demell also failed to explain why it was reasonable to allow the case to be dismissed on default,or why,if the court lacked jurisdiction,he did not oppose the government request to transfer it to the second circuit.
with respect to demell failure to timely file briefs or other documents in other matters,the referral order stated that demell fails to provide an explanation for why extensions of time were not sought prior to the due dates for the filing of those documents.
iv.legal standard 
under the rules of this committee,
an attorney may be subject to discipline or other corrective measures for any act or omission that violates the rules of professional conduct or responsibility of the state or other jurisdiction where the attorney maintains his or her principal office,or the rules of professional conduct of any other state or jurisdiction governing the attorney conduct.an attorney may also be subject to discipline or other corrective measures for any failure to comply with a federal rule of appellate procedure,a local rule of the court,an order or other instruction of the court,or a rule of professional conduct or responsibility of the court,or any other conduct unbecoming a member of the bar.
rules of the committee on admissions and grievances,rule.
a court of appeals may discipline an attorney who practices before it for conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply with any court rule.fed.c.conduct unbecoming a member of the bar may include any conduct contrary to professional standards that show s an unfitness to discharge continuing obligations to clients or courts,or conduct inimical to the administration of justice.in re snyder,d.for m ore specific guidance,the court may look to case law,applicable court rules,and the lore of the profession,as embodied in codes of professional conduct.id.at.
courts have consistently treated neglect of client matters and ineffective or incompetent representation as sanctionable conduct.see,gadda ashcroft,cir amnesty am.town of hartford,cir matter of rabinowitz,united states song,cir matter of kraft,in re bithoney,cir.such conduct is also sanctionable under the applicable professional rules and standards.the american bar association standards for imposing lawyer sanctions call for a range of sanctions from reprimand to disbarment for various forms of lack of diligence and lack of competence.aba standards.the disciplinary rules of new york lawyer code of professional responsibility require that a lawyer shall not n eglect a legal matter entrusted to the lawyer,a in addition,the code ethical canons require that the lawyer should represent his or her client zealously,canon,and that he or she be punctual in fulfilling all professional commitments,canon.
any finding that an attorney has engaged in misconduct or is otherwise subject to corrective measures must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.rules of the committee on admissions and grievances,rule h.once misconduct has been established,in determining the sanction to be imposed,the committee should generally consider a the duty violated b the lawyer mental state c the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer misconduct and d the existence of aggravating or mitigating factors.see aba standards.this committee may recommend to the court grievance panel a range of sanctions,including disbarment,suspension,public or private reprimand,monetary sanction,removal from pro bono or criminal justice act panels,referral to other disciplinary bodies,supervision by a special master,counseling or treatment,or such other disciplinary or corrective measures as the circumstances may warrant.rules of the committee on admissions and grievances,rule.
alleged misconduct 
constantine gonzalez 
on october,demell submitted,on behalf of his client ricardo constantine,a petition for review of a decision of the board of immigration appeals bia dated july.on november,the government moved to dismiss on two grounds the court lacked jurisdiction as an earlier appeal of the matter had been dismissed and transferred back to the district court where the matter was still pending,and the petition for review was untimely because it was filed more than days after the bia order.on january,the constantine docket indicates a notice to counsel that the motion was returnable on february.no opposition papers were filed.on february,the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction 
demell acknowledges that constantine was prejudiced by the failure to file opposition papers,hearing tr,but contends that the failure to file an opposition was not his fault because constantine had retained new counsel,pankaj malik,and demell had forwarded the file to malik on january.it is demell position that it was the responsibility of new counsel to file an opposition to the motion to dismiss.
according to malik,on or about december,constantine sought to have malik represent him in connection with the appeal.on or about january,malik sent a letter to demell confirming the change of counsel and asking demell to send her constantine file,initially,malik did not recall having received any documents from demell,although she later confirmed that on or about january,she received documents from demell.records from federal express confirm that malik firm signed for such a package from demell firm on january.however,malik claimed that the documents she received did not constitute the entire file and that there was nothing in the documents that reflected the existence of the motion to dismiss or that it was calendared for february.demell disputed this and produced a copy of the file purportedly sent to malik that included the government motion to dismiss,the committee credits his testimony on the ground that he would have no reason not to produce the entire file to malik and that there is a lack of clarity in malik account of what she received.
malik filed a notice of appearance on behalf of constantine on february,but no motion for substitution of counsel was filed until march.malik claimed that demell was responsible for filing a motion to substitute counsel demell claimed that it was malik responsibility.in view of the reasons the committee believes justify a sanction,the committee does not decide that issue and notes that the matter appears not to be clearly addressed in the federal or local rules.in a motion paper dated february,malik moved to the return date of the motion to dismiss,but due to the absence of a motion for substitution of counsel,the motion to was not docketed until march,upon filing of the motion for substitution of counsel.on march,the motion for substitution of counsel was granted,and on march,the motion to was denied.
halimi ridge 
in halimi,demell conceded that he failed to file the form,which is a statement in an administrative matter.hearing tr.the committee asked demell why he did not file the statement even though the clerk of the court asked him to submit it,and he responded 
i wish i could be very specific but overworked,it fell through the cracks,and i believe at the time i thought the case was,as we say,going south.i should have filed it.there was some question as to whether i had responsibility or the assistant attorney,because it was a referral based on their request,but i should have filed it.hearing tr.
filing of untimely briefs or papers 
the court also noted that demell filed late briefs or other documents in bugayong ashcrosft,gray gonzales,khoma gonzalez,matadin gonzales,and torres gonzalez.in bugayong,demell filed a brief,along with a motion to accept the late brief,nearly five months late.the court granted the motion to file the late brief.demell stated that the brief was initially rejected as a result of improper formatting,and that he did realize the brief was that late.hearing tr.in gray,demell filed a supplemental brief,along with a motion to accept the late supplemental brief,nearly one week late.the court granted the motion to file the late brief.demell stated that the brief was late as the result of a recent supreme court decision that could have had some impact on case strategy and that he was overworked.hearing tr.in khoma,demell did not file a brief,but he explained that there were difficulties in obtaining the bia record,which is supported by the docket entries in the case,and that the client disappeared.in matadin,demell filed a brief approximately ten days late,demell filed a motion for extension of time the day after the brief was due,which was subsequently approved by the court.on november,demell informed the committee that the second circuit ruled favorably for his client in the matadin case.finally,in torres,demell filed a brief,along with a motion to accept the late brief,approximately two weeks late.the court granted the motion to file the late brief.demell could not recall why he filed the brief late.hearing tr.
vi.disciplinary action is warranted 
based on clear and convincing evidence,the committee finds that disciplinary action is warranted in this case based on conduct unbecoming a member of the bar.fed.c.specifically,demell has engaged in conduct inimical to the administration of justice,in re snyder,d,and neglected a matter entrusted to a lawyer,a,by failing to timely respond,or timely request an extension of time to respond,to a motion to dismiss,resulting in prejudice failing to file form as directed by the court and failing to timely submit papers,or timely request an extension of time,in several other cases.the committee notes that there is no dispute over any fact that serves as a basis for disciplinary action.
as previously noted,in constantine the government motion to dismiss was filed on november.under second circuit local rule,opposition to this motion was due days after service in person or days after service by mail.thus,from a time well before new counsel was retained and up to the time demell transmitted the file to malik on january,the filing of an opposition would have required a motion to file a late brief.
