factual and procedural background 
proceedings in the trial court 
appellant song represented edward ward,who was charged with four misdemeanors.on the first day of trial,the trial court explained its courtroom procedures and specifically stated,i have a rule against speaking objections against both sides.
during trial,the prosecutor questioned long beach police officer victor vidriales regarding a prior incident of domestic violence.the officer testified that he heard screaming inside.when the door was opened,he saw defendant straddling a woman on the bed,holding her hair with one hand and holding his other hand up as if to strike her.officer vidriales did not see defendant strike the woman,but it appeared as though she had been struck or injured.
on,song established that officer vidriales never saw the defendant strike the victim.on redirect examination,the prosecutor had officer vidriales reiterate his previous testimony,and then the following colloquy took place 
prosecutor she had visible injury 
officer vidriales she did have injuries.exactly where the injuries were,i ca recall exactly where they were at.
prosecutor any doubt in your mind that he had beaten her 
song objection that asking for the officer opinion.there no basis for all of this.this is all hearsay 
the court hold on.no speaking 
song prosecutorial misconduct.
the court sir,no speaking objections.
song very well.
the court that the rule.no foundation.
the prosecutor requested a sidebar,then stated case law,there an accusation of prosecutorial misconduct before the jury,the jury needs to be excused.we need to have a hearing to hear whether or not there was any misconduct,and the judge needs to make a finding.the court excused the jury,and the following took place 
the court song,you made an accusation of prosecutorial misconduct.do you want to tell us what you think occurred 
song no,not at this time,your honor.
the court well,i going to admonish you please to not make such a claim,ever,in front of a jury.if there something that you think has occurred,you have every right to bring it to the court attention,but it just not a good thing to do in front of a jury.i do think it helps anybody.
the prosecutor requested the court sanction song for his unfounded allegation of prosecutorial misconduct,calling it misconduct intended to inflame and prejudice the jury.the trial court responded that since song had withdrawn the objection,all the court could do was to make the determination that the objection was unfounded.the court declined to decide the matter until the conclusion of the trial.
the following day,the prosecutor requested that the trial court admonish the jury that the accusation of prosecutorial misconduct was unfounded and the jury was not to consider it.song responded that he did not believe the accusation was unfounded,and he was ready to explain why.he explained that the prosecutor had committed misconduct by vouching,being leading and suggestive,and officer vidriales conclusion.
the trial court told song well,you should have done it in front of the jury.that number one.it should be done outside the presence of the jury.she should cite you for misconduct,you should cite her for misconduct.that a matter for the court and the parties at this point,song interrupted there is case law to support 
the trial court interjected yes.i gave you a specific instruction at the beginning of the trial,no speaking objections,and if the accusation of prosecutorial misconduct is that,i do know what is.if you would object,you would say hearsay,you would say irrelevant,whatever your objection is.that a nonspeaking objection.the conclusion is that the prosecutor has engaged in conduct you deem to be prosecutorial misconduct,but you do say that in front of a jury,ever.it not a matter for the jury to be aware of or to deal with.
if i found prosecutorial misconduct,i would probably dismiss the case,but that what i think the court remedy would be.for the jury to hear that,it highly inappropriate,no matter what the circumstances are.that my job to deal with conduct by counsel.and i think it was misconduct by you,sir,to say it in front of the jury.it highly prejudicial.
the trial court told counsel it would tell the jury it had made no finding of misconduct and admonish the jury to ignore it.the court added i do want to hear in front of this jury prosecutorial misconduct.
later,as the prosecutor was the defendant,ward,she asked him whether he had told the police that he had not hit the victim or had hit her in.the defendant testified he had not told the police those things.
after the defendant finished testifying,and out of the presence of the jury,song accused the prosecutor of misconduct by improperly questioning the defendant about what he told the police after his arrest the prosecutor responded that the defendant had not invoked his right to remain silent but had made statements to the police.song requested a mistrial or a curative instruction.the trial court denied his request.
in his argument to the jury,song stated now,the prosecutor,she has done certain things here in this case,and i would just like to point out,and it not necessarily a matter of or personal stuff,but i mean,as a prosecutor you in a special position in society in that you as jurors hold more esteem for prosecuting attorneys than other attorneys,so when a prosecuting attorney makes representations,they should play by the rules,and one of the rules is this under the constitution,under case law,ward has a right to remain silent.but she violated that by asking ward a question.she also violated that by writing on the chart right up there.something like this was no statement from ward.there was was no statement from ward regarding whether the victim was the aggressor.
at that point,the trial court interrupted and the following colloquy took place 
the court song,i going to ask you 
song and that is prosecutorial misconduct.
the court song,i going to admonish you not to make that argument.it is untrue.
ladies and gentlemen,you to disregard that argument.ladies and gentlemen,there is no evidence of any prosecutorial misconduct in this case.song,get to 
song ladies and gentlemen,we are here.we should all play by the rules 
the court song,i going to admonish you again do not make this argument.
song but that mean,this all about what happened on january.it not about all this other stuff.i mean,they bringing all this other stuff.let focus on what the real issue is.the real issue is what happened january.
after the jury began deliberations,the trial court told song that he had violated the court order,and the court was going to hold a contempt hearing.it explained 
the court song i asked you not to raise the issue of prosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury and you repeatedly did so.you directly violated my ruling,too.
song i,your honor,thought that you want to hear that with regards to objections,but 
the court you ca argue prosecutorial misconduct to the jury.you argue that to me.
song your honor,there did argue that.i did ask for it.it grounds for a dismissal.denied t allow for curative jury instructions.
the court song,it grounds for you to get in trouble,big trouble.you directly violated my order,repeatedly,after i instructed you in front of the jury the first time not to bring up prosecutorial misconduct.after i advised you yesterday,you did it again.it very serious.
the court i suggest you think about it.i ordering you to come back here one week from today,march,at,and we going to address it at that time as a possible contempt.it serious.you directly violated my order in front of the jury,repeatedly.
i would have an attorney with me.understood.
song it understood.
the trial court later added that in addition to contempt,the court was considering a sanction under section.the prosecutor filed points and authorities requesting a finding of contempt,a report to the state bar and a fine.
at the hearing on the matter,the trial court indicated that its findings would be based on song using the term prosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury,being told not to do so,then using it again during his argument.song counsel explained that deputy public defenders are trained to object on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct under certain circumstances in order to prevent the objection from being waived on appeal.song questioned how he could make such an objection if the trial court precluded him from doing so.his counsel suggested that song actions might be a reflection of the fact he was a relatively new and inexperienced lawyer.
song counsel added that song erroneously objected on the ground of griffin error when he meant to object on the ground of doyle error.counsel acknowledged that neither ground was applicable but argued that song should not be punished for making an incorrect objection lawyers make the objections,and it is up to the trial court to determine whether they are correct or not.
song counsel also pointed out that section contains an exception for advocacy.he asserted that argument is advocacy,and therefore song could not be sanctioned for statements made during argument.
song then apologized to the trial court for not following the court orders.he also apologized to the prosecutor,explaining that he had not intend his objections to be personal attacks.
the trial court accepted song apology,admonished him and purged the contempt.it imposed sanctions of under section for failing to obey a court order 
proceedings in the appellate division 
song appealed the sanction order to the appellate division of the superior court.in its judgment,the court first addressed appellant argument that the trial court order was unlawful because it misunderstood the law concerning preservation of an objection based on prosecutorial misconduct.the court found the argument obfuscates what occurred in this case.the trial court first order prohibiting speaking objections was not the reason for the imposition of sanctions.it was the court second counsel not mention prosecutorial misconduct in front of the was violated by appellant.the court declined to address appellant argument and instead focused on whether the second order was a proper exercise of the court inherent power to control the proceedings.it concluded that the order was proper.
the court was not persuaded by appellant contention that advocacy of counsel includes the right to violate a lawful court order.additionally,it concluded appellant statements were not in advocacy on behalf of his client.the purpose of closing argument is for counsel to argue the evidence presented during the trial,and to argue the inferences or conclusions that the jury should draw after applying the law to the evidence.the question whether there has been prosecutorial misconduct,by contrast,is a legal issue for the court,and not a factual issue for resolution by a jury.therefore,while an attorney w ithin the scope of protecting his client,has the right to press legitimate argument and to protest an erroneous ruling,appellant argument was improper,and closing argument was not the forum to protest the court determination of no prosecutorial misconduct.
however,the court concluded,the trial court erred in failing to prepare a written order explaining its issuance of sanctions,as required by section.for this reason,the court reversed the trial court order.it noted however,that because it found that appellant violated a lawful court order,the trial court could reissue its order imposing sanctions with the requisite explanation.
appellant then filed a petition to transfer the case to the court of appeal.on december,we granted the petition in order to settle an important question of law.
discussion 
appellant raises the same contentions here that he did below he contends that monetary sanctions were unlawful because the order violated was not a lawful court order rather,it was based upon a misunderstanding of the applicable law.he also contends that section was inapplicable,since it does not apply to advocacy,and argument to the jury is advocacy.in addition,appellant contends the appellate division erred when it remanded the matter to the trial court for correction of the sanctions order.
standard of review 
appellant asserts that our review of the trial court order imposing monetary sanctions under section is de novo.he is incorrect.we review the order for prejudicial abuse of discretion.people tabb d.
the imposition of monetary sanctions under section is within the discretion of the trial court.that discretion must be exercised in a reasonable manner with one of the statutorily authorized purposes in mind and must be guided by existing legal standards as adapted to the current circumstances.winikow superior court th,d,quoting from moyal lanphear d.discretion is abused when it exceeds the bounds of reason,all of the circumstances being considered.moyal,supra,at.
lawfulness of the trial court order 
it is appellant view that the trial court misunderstood the nature of a prosecutorial misconduct objection,which requires that counsel state that the objection is based on prosecutorial misconduct.the trial court order not to say the words prosecutorial misconduct,appellant contends,therefore was unlawful.we disagree.
it is true that a claim of prosecutorial misconduct must be raised in the trial court or it is forfeited on appeal.people hill cal th,d.defendant must make a timely and specific objection and request a curative admonition to preserve the claim.people bolden cal th,d,hill,supra,at,d.the question raised by the parties is whether those specific words,prosecutorial misconduct,must be said in order to preserve the claim.
even assuming arguendo that defense counsel must specifically say the words prosecutorial misconduct,there is no requirement that those words must be said in front of the jury.defense counsel can object and ask to approach the bench,where the specific objection can be made outside the presence of the jury see,people valencia cal th,d,or object to the particular conduct and later,out of the presence of the jury,raise the issue of misconduct see,people bennett cal th,d.
as this court has observed,trial courts have the inherent power,derived from the state constitution,to control the proceedings before them.cottle superior court th,d.the courts may adopt their own rules of procedure so long as those rules are not inconsistent with due process statute or statewide rules of court.elkins superior court cal th,d.as discussed above,it is not required by law that defense counsel say the words prosecutorial misconduct in front of the jury.the trial court order that appellant not do so therefore was lawful.
appellant also analogizes to cooper superior court cal d,which states that it is not contempt for a lawyer to seek respectfully to make and press upon a trial court,even though the court does not desire to hear him at that time,some objection or other contention which he deems it necessary to make in the interests of his client.such conduct on the lawyer part is not a contempt because,as this court and the district courts of appeal have held,it is not only the lawyer right,it is his duty,at all times to protect and advance the interests of his client.at.
cooper involved a situation in which the trial court interrupted jury deliberations to comment on the evidence.the appellant interrupted the court in order to object that the court was invading the province of the jury,and the court held him in contempt.cooper
