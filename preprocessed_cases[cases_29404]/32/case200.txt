in this action for false arrest and wrongful imprisonment brought by ben charles christie,the court set aside a nonsuit and dismissal in favor of the city of el centro,the el centro police department,and el centro police officers ray bonillas and efran coronel collectively,the city.the court granted a new trial for irregularity of the proceedings because the judge who granted nonsuit,the honorable barrett foerster,had discussed the case with a previously disqualified judge,the honorable jeffrey jones.the court found judge foerster disqualified to rule on the nonsuit motion as a result of the discussion,and the resulting dismissal was set aside as void.
on appeal,the city asserts there was no legal or factual basis for granting the motion for new trial based upon irregularity in the proceedings,and there was no showing of prejudice or denial of a fair trial to christie sufficient to support a new trial.
we conclude that because judge foerster was disqualified at the time he granted the city motion for nonsuit,that ruling was void and must be vacated regardless of a showing of prejudice and even if a showing of prejudice or denial of a fair trial were necessary,that showing has been met by christie.accordingly,we affirm the order granting a new trial and remand the matter for a new trial on christie claims.
factual and procedural background 
facts underlying christie claim 
on november,stephanie hernandez,the wife of an el centro police officer,stopped her pickup truck in a lane of travel in the parking lot at a costco in el centro,california.hernandez was waiting for the closest parking space to the store in that row to become available.christie entered the same lane.he stopped his truck behind two smaller cars that were waiting behind hernandez pickup.while he was waiting,the two smaller vehicles between himself and hernandez passed her vehicle to the right.christie asserts that he then tried to drive his vehicle around hernandez vehicle on the right side and at that point his truck slightly contacted her bumper on the right side.he also contends that the impact was so slight that her vehicle did not move and no damage resulted to either vehicle.
christie then honked his horn to try to get her to move,but hernandez remained stopped in front of him.he exited his truck and went up to her vehicle to request her to move.however,she rolled up her windows up,turned her back to him and began talking on her cell phone.christie went back to his car and waited,along with other vehicles behind him,until a couple came out of the store with their groceries,loaded them into the vehicle parked in the first space and left.hernandez pulled into the vacated space and parked.according to christie,he waited close to minutes before the first space opened up and hernandez parked her vehicle.christie then proceeded to the tire shop to have a tire fixed and went into the costco to do some shopping.
in the meantime,hernandez called the el centro police department.she identified herself as,shorthand for police officer wife.she also gave police a description of christie vehicle,its colors,and its license plate number,described where it was parked,and indicated where she would be waiting for them.hernandez told police that christie had rammed her car several times with increasing force.according to hernandez,christie then approached her vehicle in a threatening manner,and she was afraid for herself as well as the safety of her children and niece and nephew,who were also in the truck.officers coronel and bonillas arrived at the scene and took her statement,which again related the ramming incident and her fear.
when officers coronel and bonillas arrived at the costco,christie was inside shopping,and hernandez was waiting outside.as christie was shopping,he was approached by officer bonillas who told him he needed to talk to him about the incident where he rammed a woman three times.christie told officer bonillas that there had been no ramming and that he had only accidentally contacted hernandez bumper once,and there was no damage to her vehicle.officer bonillas then escorted christie out of the store.
christie watched as the police officers conversed with hernandez in spanish.according to hernandez,she told the officers that her truck was at first tapped by christie as he tried to get around her.however,he then backed up directly behind her and rammed her truck hard three times with his truck.hernandez claimed that the force of the impacts were so strong that they made her vehicle rock and she feared for her life and the lives of her passengers.
armistead,a passenger in christie vehicle,was interviewed by officer bonillas.he told officer bonillas that the vehicles bumpers touched only once and it was accidental.he also confirmed that hernandez had blocked the lane of travel and they had been unable to pass her.
both hernandez and christie trucks had chrome bumpers that were in perfect condition before the incident.officer bonillas examined hernandez vehicle and claimed he found an area where dust had been disturbed.he took photographs of the bumper.officer bonillas also interviewed another passenger in christie car,bobby camp.officer coronel prepared a police report of the incident,wherein he stated that christie and his passengers had all confessed to christie purposefully striking hernandez vehicle.officer coronel interviewed the niece and nephew of hernandez,who were passengers in her vehicle.however,according to christie,none of their statements were recorded in the police report.according to christie,both of these witnesses stated when interviewed that they did not see,feel or hear anyone ramming hernandez vehicle.
christie was arrested and taken to jail.he was strip searched,and remained in jail for six days.according to christie,because of his incarceration,he was unable to attend the planned grand opening of his restaurant in san felipe,baja california,on thanksgiving day.
b.the criminal trial 
at christie arraignment,he was offered a plea bargain to reduce the charges to disturbing the peace,a misdemeanor.christie refused the plea offer and went to trial on charges of assault with a deadly weapon,assault,and reckless driving.at trial,officer coronel testified that the prosecutor sent him to interview the two witness passengers in hernandez vehicle.he conducted the interview but never gave a report to the prosecutor.the pictures police took of hernandez bumper were not produced at trial.officers coronel and bonilla testified at trial that christie and his passenger armistead both admitted that christie had intentionally struck hernandez vehicle.officer bonillas testified that he had located disturbed dust in the center of hernandez bumper.
after presentation of the evidence,the jury deliberated for approximately one hour,and then acquitted christie of all charges.
c.the civil suit and trial 
in november christie filed this action against the city,asserting causes of action for assault and battery,false arrest,false imprisonment,malicious prosecution,violation of civil rights,conspiracy,negligence,and infliction of emotional distress,and his wife joan filed a claim for loss of consortium.on november,christie filed a peremptory challenge to the first judge assigned to the matter,judge jones.
the matter went to trial before judge foerster in march.at the conclusion of the presentation of evidence in the case,judge foerster granted the city motion for nonsuit,finding that hernandez report to police provided probable cause for the arrest,thereby barring all of christie causes of action as a matter of law.on april,the court filed a formal order dismissing christie action with prejudice.
d.the motion for new trial 
on april,christie filed a motion for new trial,asserting that the court erred in granting the motion for nonsuit because his evidence,viewed in its most favorable light,demonstrated a prima facie case of a violation of his federal constitutional rights the city had not met its burden of proving probable cause and he was entitled to a jury trial on his malicious prosecution claim even if the officers had probable cause for the initial arrest.the hearing on the motion for new trial was held on may.
during the hearing on the new trial motion,counsel for christie told judge foerster that he was informed and believed that judge foerster had consulted with judge jones prior to granting the motion for nonsuit and that christie had previously filed a peremptory challenge against judge jones.counsel argued that if that occurred,the motion for new trial should be granted on that basis as well.
the court did not respond to this information on the record.however,after taking the motion for new trial under submission,judge foerster issued a written disclosure wherein he acknowledged that judge jones had been disqualified and that he had spoken with him concerning the law and procedures that might be applicable to the matter.he further stated that he was not aware of the disqualification when he spoke to judge jones,and neither was judge jones.judge foerster also stated,judge jones did not advise me as to how this case should be decided.in arriving at my decision in granting the motion for nonsuit,i relied on my own legal research and analysis.therefore,my recusal is not necessary or appropriate.
on that same date,judge jones sent a letter to counsel confirming the conversation with judge foerster and stating that he did not indicate to judge foerster how he should rule on the motion for nonsuit.he also disclosed a second conversation with judge foerster before the hearing on the motion for new trial.according to judge jones,the only subject discussed at that meeting was scheduling a court reporter to cover the motion for new trial due to a shortage of court reporters at the el centro courthouse.judge foerster sent a letter to counsel the next day indicating that judge jones recollections concerning the subject matter of their conversations were generally consistent with my own.
challenge for cause 
christie filed a challenge for cause against judge foerster.christie stated in the challenge that the communication between judge foerster and judge jones concerning the case was inappropriate because of judge jones previous disqualification and because it immediately preceded and concerned the pending motion for nonsuit.christie asserted that judge foerster was disqualified as of the time of the first communication with judge jones and also that he was biased against christie case.
in response to the challenge,judge foerster filed an answer reciting the contacts with judge jones and again asserting that judge jones had not opined as to how he should rule on the matter.he also indicated that his first conversation with judge jones occurred immediately prior to his grant of the motion for nonsuit.
ruling on challenge for cause 
the challenge for cause was assigned by the judicial council to the honorable christopher warner,a judge of the superior court of san bernardino county.judge warner issued a written order,finding that judge foerster was disqualified in the matter.judge warner first found that the allegations of actual bias were unsupported and amounted to nothing more than christie disagreement with judge foerster rulings in the matter.however,judge warner found that judge foerster was disqualified because of his communications with judge jones,under code of civil procedure section,subdivision c because a person aware of the facts might reasonably entertain a doubt that the judge would be able to be impartial.judge warner found that judge foerster was charged with knowledge of the previous disqualification of judge jones because it was in the court file and that,because of the disqualification of judge jones,the consultations created an appearance of impropriety.judge warner stated,the appearance of impropriety is patent.a judge should simply not speak with another judge about a case in which the latter has been disqualified.such conduct,no matter how innocent and well intentioned,can only undermine public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.judge warner did not find any malice or evil motive associated with the contacts between the two judges,but rather that the communications were the result of unfortunate error in failing to be aware of the previously filed peremptory challenge.nevertheless,judge warner found that a reasonable person aware of the facts would entertain a doubt as to the propriety of judge foerster actions in communicating with judge jones and might reasonably entertain a doubt that judge foerster would be able to be impartial 
judge warner also gave notice to the parties that the question of disqualification was not an appealable order and that it could be reviewed only by a petition for writ of mandate within days of notice to the parties of the decision.the city did not file a petition for writ of mandate challenging the disqualification of judge foerster.
hearing on motion for new trial before new judge 
following the disqualification order,the case was reassigned to judge donnelly for a hearing on christie motion for new trial,now based upon both an alleged error of law,and irregularity in the proceedings based upon the disqualification of judge foerster at the time he granted the city motion for nonsuit.the court granted christie motion for new trial based upon irregularity in the proceedings of the court.judge donnelly found that judge warner had found a violation of canon a of the california code of judicial ethics in ordering judge foerster disqualified,and that such violations have been held to constitute prejudicial irregularity in the proceedings.elaborating,judge donnelly stated in effect,a disqualified judge made a dispositive ruling against the plaintiff.that alone is an irregularity justifying a new trial.the plaintiff also challenges the fairness of the hearing.just as the appearance of impropriety has been found to be patent unfortunately,the taint of an appearance of unfairness is palpable.under these circumstances,there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the disqualifying communications between judges,and the resulting appearance of impropriety,did materially and prejudicially affect the plaintiff right to a fair and impartial hearing and trial.the plaintiff motion for new trial on the ground of irregularity in the proceedings is granted in full.the court denies plaintiff motion for new trial on the ground of error of law relating to the probable cause issue in the motion for nonsuit.
this timely appeal follows.
discussion 
city challenge to disqualification order 
in support of their appeal asserting the court erred in granting a new trial,the city challenges the finding by judge warner that there was an appearance of impropriety sufficient to render judge foerster disqualified.however,the determination of the question of the disqualification of a judge is not an appealable order and may be reviewed only by a writ of mandate from the appropriate court of appeal sought within days of notice to the parties of the decision and only by the parties to the proceeding,subd.d.this applies to both motions granting and denying a motion to disqualify,and to both peremptory challenges and challenges for cause.in re sheila th,d.
it is undisputed that the city did not file a petition for writ of mandate with this court and therefore the contention that judge warner did not have adequate grounds to find that there was an appearance of impropriety justifying the disqualification of judge foerster is not reviewable on appeal.
effect of disqualification on grant of nonsuit and dismissal 
the city contends that judge donnelly erred in granting a new trial because there was no actual prejudice or a denial of a fair trial as a result of judge foerster actions.we conclude that because judge foerster was disqualified at the time he granted the city motion for nonsuit,that ruling was null and void and must be vacated regardless of a showing of prejudice.we further conclude that even if a showing of prejudice or denial of a fair trial were necessary,that showing has been met.as judge warner found,judge foerster conversation about the city motion for nonsuit with judge jones,who had previously been disqualified in the matter,immediately prior to judge fo
