we have for review a referee report and a partial amended referee report recommending that anna brown be found guilty of professional misconduct,publicly reprimanded,and required to complete ethics instruction by the florida bar.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.for the reasons set out below we conclude that brown should be suspended for ninety days.
procedural and factual background 
the florida bar filed a complaint alleging brown engaged in unethical conduct.a referee was appointed.prior to a hearing on the merits,the referee granted brown motion to dismiss one of the claims against her,a conflict of interest claim.the remaining claims proceeded to hearing.the referee filed a report with the court finding the bar had proved three of the remaining claims,but failed to prove a fourth.the bar petitioned for review of the dismissal of the conflict of interest claim and of the recommendation of a public reprimand.brown for review of the guilt recommendations.following briefing by the parties,the case was remanded to the referee for a hearing on the conflict of interest claim,following which the referee filed an amended report addressed solely to that claim and finding that the bar failed to prove the claim.the bar petitioned for review of the findings and recommendation that brown be found not guilty on the conflict of interest claim.additional briefing followed.
the referee made the following findings and recommendations in his reports.renfred spillman and his cousin,antoine parks,were traveling in a car together,in october,when they were stopped by a florida highway patrol officer.parks,who had been driving,was charged with speeding and driving while license suspended habitual revocation,a felony.spillman was charged with possession of a firearm by convicted felon,a felony.the firearm that led to spillman charge was discovered by the patrol officer beneath the tray in the center console of the car,located between the seats where spillman and parks had been seated.
spillman and parks visited brown office together and signed retainer agreements presented to them by brown paralegal.spillman paid at that time and agreed to pay a month until the fee for his representation was paid.when spillman left brown office,he believed he had hired brown to represent him.
brown entered a notice of appearance on behalf of parks,but arranged for another attorney,peter flood,to file a notice of appearance on spillman behalf brown actively represented spillman,but failed to diligently represent him or to adequately communicate with him.further,brown failed to clearly communicate to the trial court and spillman whether she represented parks and spillman or just parks.her actions toward spillman were more often those of someone who did represent him rather than someone who did not.she accepted money from spillman,appeared in court for him,and filed official pleadings suggesting she represented him.she never personally told spillman that another lawyer was representing him.at best,there was some indication of that fact in some written documents.
based on these findings,the referee recommended that brown be found guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representation a failing to keep client reasonably informed of status of case and c engaging in conduct involving misrepresentation.the referee further recommended that brown be found not guilty of violating rules a representing clients with adverse interests and b representing a client when the lawyer exercise of independent professional judgment in the representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer responsibilities to another client.he found that the evidence established only the possibility of what might have been or conceivably could have been,under some circumstances,an adverse interest between spillman and parks and that the evidence did not rise to the level of knowledge or interest as defined by rule a or b,by clear and convincing evidence.critically,the referee found the bar had failed to prove that brown knew that parks,like spillman,was a convicted felon and at risk of being charged with possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.the referee further found insufficient evidence to prove that spillman suggested to brown that the firearm was not his or that he asked brown about any possible defenses to the charge until after brown representation of parks had ended.
as for discipline,the referee recommended that brown be publicly reprimanded,required to attend ethics training,and pay of the bar costs of.
the bar petitioned for review of the findings and recommendation of not guilty on the conflict of interest claim and of the recommendation of a public reprimand.brown for review of the referee recommendations that she be found guilty of violating rules competence,a communication,and c misrepresentation,and ordered to reimburse the bar of its costs.
we first address brown contention that the referee erred in recommending that she be found guilty of violating rules,a,and c.brown does not challenge the findings of fact that support these recommendations.we approve these findings without further discussion.in reviewing a referee guilt recommendations,we assess whether the referee factual findings are sufficient under the applicable rules to support the recommendations.bar spear,so d.
rule is violated when a lawyer fails to act with reasonable diligence or promptness in representing a client.rule a is violated when a lawyer fails to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter or to promptly comply with reasonable requests for information.
the referee found that brown had actively represented spillman and that spillman reasonably believed he had hired brown as his lawyer when he signed the retainer agreement and began paying her fee.from that point on,brown never did anything to unequivocally inform spillman that she did not represent him or that another attorney did.as found by the referee,her actions were those of a lawyer who was representing spillman.these facts support the referee recommendations that brown be found guilty of violating rules and a.
rule c is violated when a lawyer engages in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation.the referee found that brown failed to clearly communicate to spillman and the trial court whether she represented both parks and spillman or just parks.he also found that brown acted more frequently as if she did represent spillman,including accepting money from the client and appearing in court and filing official pleadings suggesting she represented him.nevertheless,she arranged for another lawyer to file a notice of appearance on spillman behalf so that this other lawyer was spillman attorney of record.this was enough to prove a misrepresentation.
brown argues that the bar failed to prove that brown misrepresentation was intentional,so a rule c violation was not shown.while it is true that in order to prove a violation of rule c,the bar must show that the misrepresentation was intentional,the intent element is satisfied by a showing that the misleading conduct was deliberate or knowing.bar brown,so d.the facts in this case,as set forth above,demonstrate that brown actions were deliberate and knowing and,thus,misrepresentation on brown part.accordingly,we approve the referee recommendations of guilt as to a rule c violation.
next,we address the conflict of interest claim.the right to effective assistance of counsel encompasses the right to representation free from actual conflict.mungin state,so d.were this a criminal appeal or postconviction proceeding,the criminal defendant would bear the burden of proving that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer performance.id.that is not the case in a disciplinary proceeding.the version of rules a and b,in effect during the relevant period,focused on the actual interests of the clients involved.rule a provided 
a representing adverse interests.a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that client will be directly adverse to the interests of another client,
