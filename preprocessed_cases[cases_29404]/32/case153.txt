michael bender bender appeals from a final decision by the united states district court for the district of columbia that granted summary judgment upholding a disciplinary action taken by the director of the united states patent and trademark office the pto or agency to exclude bender from practicing before the pto.bender dudas,wl,sj order.because the pto findings were supported by substantial evidence,and because the disciplinary action was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law,we affirm.
background 
this case involves the pto continuing efforts to regulate the conduct of patent agents and attorneys registered to practice before it and to provide assurance to inventors of effective counsel in filing and prosecuting applications for patents in the united states.the background of this case reads like a novel but represents the true story of hopes dashed,fees wasted,and dreams lost by hundreds of individual inventors caught up in the world of promoters who promise the world and deliver very little.
in the area of patent law,as in most other areas of the law,sophisticated clients generally are able to determine the kinds of legal representation they need and where to find counsel with the skills,integrity,and character appropriate for the matter at hand.individual inventors,however,are often unfamiliar with even the most basic principles of patent law,do not know where to turn for help,and are vulnerable to those who seek to take advantage of their inexperience.commonly available sources of guidance often are of little help,either because they are too simplistic or too generalized to be of any particular assistance or because they are too complex to be readily understood.even mainstream media sources frequently confuse and misunderstand basic intellectual property law precepts.how often do we read articles confusing the forms of protection applicable to an invention,to a symbol indicating origin,or to a work of authorship with expressions like,copyrighted his invention,trademarked his idea,or patented her textbook 
the pto has recognized the need to regulate those who practice before it.to this end,the pto has determined minimum levels of legal competence and has rigorously administered testing of those who seek to become registered patent agents and attorneys.it has also established minimum standards of ethical conduct expected of registered practitioners and has promulgated rules implementing those standards and providing a mechanism for their enforcement.
for individual inventors,the pto listing of registered patent agents and attorneys is a basic resource and an assurance of legal competence and good moral character.but as sophisticated as the pto is in regulating practitioners who appear before it and in providing information about registered practitioners on its website and in other publicly distributed materials,it frequently finds itself challenged by invention promoters who exploit unsophisticated inventors,heap every invention with praise regardless of the merits or the real prospects of legal protection,and entice inventors into engagement agreements filled with hollow guarantees of patent protection and promises of licenses that seldom yield anything of any significant value.
in seeking to protect the public from unscrupulous invention promoters,the pto has aggressively sought to monitor and enforce its disciplinary rules against those registered practitioners who act in concert and participation with these promoters in the prosecution of patent applications before the pto.this case is about one such practitioner who became complicit in the activities of an invention promoter involving over unsuspecting inventors.
these unsuspecting inventors first sought help from american inventors corporation aic,an invention promoter.according to testimony and declarations of past employees and clients,aic would solicit inventors to present their ideas,tell each inventor that their idea was great,and then perform a patent search.after the search,aic would conduct a sales presentation that provided the inventor with a positive evaluation of the invention and offered aic services in procuring a patent and promoting the invention to manufacturers and other interested parties.the inventor then signed a standard form contract in which he or she paid a flat fee or a combination of a flat fee and a percent of royalty income in exchange for aic promise to hire a patent attorney on the inventor behalf,pay all legal fees associated with prosecuting a patent application,and conduct various marketing activities to promote the invention.aic also guaranteed that it would refund of the inventor flat fee if a patent was not procured.the contract did not specify what type of patent would be obtained or in any way explain the differences in protection between a design patent and a utility patent.indeed,according to past employees and clients,aic general policy and practice was to conceal those differences from the inventors.
after the contract was signed,aic would forward the inventor disclosure to a patent attorney.initially,that patent attorney was leon gilden.although a number of the inventors disclosures indicated that they sought to protect the useful and functional features of the opposed to drafted design patent applications in every case.in addition,gilden allegedly employed draftsmen to add decorative ornamentation or surface indicia to the drawings of the inventions even though such embellishment was not invented by the named inventor.gilden would send the completed design patent application to aic,which would get the inventor signature,and the application would then be filed using gilden registration number.at no point did gilden consult with the inventors regarding the filing of a design patent application or the embellished drawings because,according to a former aic employee,direct contact between the inventors and the attorney was emphatically discouraged by aic.
the alleged purpose of this scheme was to make it easier to obtain a patent and to avoid a refund of the inventors fee under aic guarantee.gilden alleged involvement in the embellishment scheme prompted the pto to initiate disciplinary action against him in the early.the pto also sent each applicant a request for information rfi asking the inventors whether they invented the patterns on the drawings,whether they intended to apply for a design patent over a utility patent,and whether they understood the difference between a design and a utility patent.ultimately,gilden entered into a settlement agreement with the pto and received a suspension.
in,aic contracted with bender,a registered patent attorney,to continue the prosecution of over design applications that had formerly been handled by gilden the gilden applications.the contract provided bender with up to as compensation for both attorney fees and prosecution costs.bender sent each gilden applicant an engagement letter that included,among other things,the rfi that gilden had failed to provide to the client and a brief discussion of the differences between a design patent and a utility patent.the engagement letter to each applicant was essentially the same it did not provide any advice or inquiries that directly related to the particular invention at issue,the type of patent best suited to protect the invention,or the consequences of pursuing a design patent or a utility patent in each particular inventor case.furthermore,other than instructing the inventors to respond to the rfis,bender did not attempt to determine whether the gilden applicants had intended to file design patent applications and whether that decision had been made on an informed basis.as the responses to the rfis indicated,a number of the inventors either did not understand the difference between a design and utility patent or had wanted a utility patent at the time the application was filed.bender nevertheless continued to prosecute the gilden applications as design patent applications,taking steps only to have gilden improperly added embellishments removed.
in the late,the office of enrollment and discipline at the pto began investigating bender after receiving information indicating that he had violated the pto code of professional responsibility.during that investigation,the office of enrollment and discipline sent bender several rfis posing questions about his actions and conduct.in august,a meeting of the committee on discipline was held in which it was determined that there was probable cause to bring charges against bender for violations of pto regulations.an administrative complaint and notice dated june,set forth ten counts alleging violations of pto rules governing attorney conduct.
the charges against bender were tried before an administrative law judge from march through march.in a thorough opinion,the administrative law judge found that bender had violated numerous pto rules on attorney conduct and that exclusion from practice was warranted.bender sought review of that initial decision under.in an equally thorough opinion,the general counsel for the pto issued a final decision that adopted some of the violations found in the initial decision and affirmed the sanction of exclusion.specifically,the general counsel found that bender had neglected an entrusted legal matter in violation of c accepted employment where professional judgment may be affected in violation of a and accepted compensation from a person other than a client without a full disclosure to the client in violation of a and engaged in conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of b.bender requested reconsideration of the final decision under c.reconsideration was largely denied.
bender then filed a petition in the district court for the district of columbia to challenge the pto final decision.based on the administrative record,bender and the government filed for summary judgment.bender alleged procedural and due process violations lack of jurisdiction improper application of statutes,precedent,and agency regulations and lack of a factual basis for the administrative law judge and general counsel decisions.see sj order,at.the district court confirmed that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to those issues a each of bender arguments,finding them unpersuasive.see,at.accordingly,the district court denied bender motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the government,at.

ii.discussion 
the pto has statutory authority to suspend or exclude from further practice before the patent and trademark office,any person,agent,or attorney shown to be incompetent or disreputable,or guilty of gross misconduct,or who does not comply with the regulations established under section b d of this title.section b d delegates to the pto the authority to establish regulations governing the conduct of attorneys practicing before the pto.id.b d.pursuant to that statutory authority,the pto has enacted disciplinary rules,see b listing the various disciplinary rules,and has established procedures and standards for determining whether those rules have been violated and what sanction should be imposed.
the disciplinary action taken by the pto is subject to review by the district court for the district of columbia according to the provisions of the administrative procedure act.see.under that act,the agency choice of sanction is held unlawful only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.see also butz glover livestock comm,d w here congress has entrusted an administrative agency with the responsibility of selecting the means of achieving the statutory policy the relation of remedy to policy is peculiarly a matter of administrative competence.citation omitted.the underlying factual findings used to support such a sanction are reviewed for substantial evidence.lipman dickinson.we review the district court decision on summary judgment without deference,reapplying on appeal the same standards applicable to the district court.lacavera dudas.
bender argues that substantial evidence does not support the pto findings that he violated various disciplinary rules,that the pto exceeded its authority and violated his constitutional rights,and that the pto abused its discretion in determining that exclusion was an appropriate sanction.we disagree and address each of bender arguments in turn.
substantial evidence 
the agency found that bender violated multiple regulations governing attorney conduct before the pto.
first,the pto found that bender neglect ed a legal matter entrusted to the practitioner in violation of c.as the gilden applicants responses to the pto indicated,many of bender clients did not appreciate the substantive difference between a design patent and a utility patent at the time the application was filed.some applicants indicated that they had wanted to file a utility patent application.although bender was aware of those responses,he continued to prosecute the gilden applications as design patents.the brief discussion of the difference between design and utility patents provided by bender engagement letter was an entirely hollow and formalistic gesture because it did not provide any of the gilden applicants with advice that directly related to the particular inventions at issue,the type of patent best suited to protect these particular inventions and the inventor interests therein,or the consequences of pursuing a design patent instead of a utility patent.this failure is even more glaring in view of aic guarantee that a patent would issue without regard to the type of patent that would be procured.because design applications had already been filed in each case,and because aic guarantee motivated continued prosecution of those applications as design applications,the information provided by bender engagement letter was an inadequate response to the confusion demonstrated by his clients earlier responses to the rfis.any reputable attorney would have appreciated that the wholesale filing of design applications under such circumstances and the unauthorized addition of design embellishments were driven in large measure if not entirely by aic guarantee.such an attorney would have identified that motivation to each inventor,explained that such a motivation was not necessarily in the inventor best interests,educated that inventor on the steps needed either to fix the improperly embellished design applications or to file continuation utility applications,and otherwise advised that inventor on how best to proceed in his or her particular case.as the pto correctly found,bender communications to the gilden applicants at the outset of his representation fell far short of these minimum standards.
bender also fell short in neglecting to notify some of his clients of final rejections in their applications until after the period for responding to those rejections had expired.bender does not dispute this failure,but instead explains that he purposefully delayed action in those cases pending the resolution of an appeal in a test case that directly related to the rejections while such an explanation might justify advising the client to seek an extension of time under or a stay of proceedings pending resolution of the test case,it does not justify an absolute failure to notify the client at all that a final rejection had issued,let alone the response needed,until after the period for response expired.although bender argues that the delayed notification had no adverse impact on the applications,prompt notification of the final rejection accompanied with an explanation of the available options would have given bender clients the choice as to how best to proceed and would have avoided depriving them of the right to avoid paying late filing surcharges 
because substantial evidence supports the pto determination that bender neglected to advise his cli
