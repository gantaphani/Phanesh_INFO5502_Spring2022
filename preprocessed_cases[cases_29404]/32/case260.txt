in this case we review the determination by the judicial qualifications commission jqc that seventeenth judicial circuit judge cheryl aleman violated the code of judicial conduct and its recommendation that judge aleman be publicly reprimanded and charged the costs of investigation and prosecution.for the reasons discussed below,we approve the jqc determination and recommendation.
facts and procedural history 
the charges stem from judge aleman behavior in response to three motions to disqualify her made by assistant public defenders sandra perlman and bruce raticoff on january,the second day of jury selection in state braynen,a murder case on the morning of january,perlman sought to disqualify judge aleman based on what perlman perceived to be judge aleman aggressive and intimidating questioning of prospective jurors during voir dire the previous afternoon.because the motion was oral,perlman requested a reasonable amount of time to reduce the motion to writing as required by rogers state,so d judge aleman denied the request for additional time and immediately denied the motion on its merits.
the second motion to disqualify related to judge aleman allegedly preferential treatment of assistant state attorney peter holden.judge aleman had granted holden a delay in the start of the afternoon proceedings while denying a similar request from perlman.when perlman requested at least an hour to reduce this second oral motion to writing,judge aleman responded that the court would be in recess for five minutes.during this time,judge aleman conferred with another jurist,who suggested that defense counsel be given a pad of paper and a pen to prepare a written motion.when the proceeding resumed at,judge aleman did just that she gave perlman paper and pen and stated that,if defense counsel subsequently wished to substitute a typed motion,she would allow it.but rather than giving counsel an hour,judge aleman gave the defense attorneys fifteen minutes to transcribe the motion,stating that the court would adjourn until 
intending to research and type the motion,perlman and raticoff left the courtroom to return to their office.in their haste,they ran past a number of prospective jurors who were sitting and standing in the hallway.at,when the proceeding reconvened,neither assistant public defender was in the courtroom.judge aleman took a recess until defense counsel returned.
by,raticoff had returned,but perlman had not.at that point,judge aleman mentioned the prospect of holding both public defenders in contempt 
the court the court go ing to issue a rule to show cause,and we hold this in abeyance until conclusion of the trial.the court had given counsel additional minutes to handwrite a motion,provided a paper and pen for counsel to do so,and when the court returned back neither defense counsel was here,and now it and we still missing one of defense counsel.
again,good grounds for the rule to show cause is failure to abide by the court order with respect,and we hold that in abeyance until the concluding of the proceeding.
raticoff judge,just so the record 
the court directly to both counsel,raticoff and perlman.and we be in recess until perlman arrives.
upon returning to the courtroom at,perlman inquired into the status of the contempt charge.there was some confusion as to whether judge aleman actually issued the order to show cause.at first,judge aleman suggested that she did not.upon further inquiry by defense counsel,however,judge aleman indicated that she had,in fact,issued the order.
raticoff then moved to withdraw from the case,citing the conflict between defending his client on one hand and defending himself on the other.in addition,raticoff expressed his concern that he would not be able to represent braynen effectively.judge aleman denied the motion,finding no reason to believe that the defendant had not received effective assistance of counsel.judge aleman eventually denied the second motion to disqualify,finding it legally insufficient.
judge aleman order to show cause triggered defense counsel third motion to disqualify.again,perlman requested a reasonable time to reduce the motion to writing,and again judge aleman granted fifteen minutes.when perlman objected,reminding judge aleman that fifteen minutes was previously insufficient,judge aleman instead granted twelve minutes.once again,perlman objected,and judge aleman eventually gave defense counsel minutes to prepare the written motion.
this time,when the court reconvened,both public defenders were the motion was not.afraid to violate the court order,perlman had returned to the courtroom without finishing the motion and requested an additional five minutes to do so.judge aleman expressed her concern for the jurors who had been sitting in the hallway since,but agreed.when presented with this third motion,judge aleman denied it as well.
the next day,when raticoff asked judge aleman to reconsider or vacate her order to show cause,judge aleman declined to hold a hearing on the matter,stating instead that i believe everyone is entitled to due process.ultimately,judge aleman never issued a written order to show cause,and the issue of contempt was never acted upon.
based on these events,an investigative panel of the jqc charged judge aleman with violating canons,and of the code of judicial conduct.a hearing panel of the jqc heard testimony from several witnesses,including public defenders perlman and raticoff,assistant state attorney holden,and judge aleman.the jqc concluded that 
judge aleman conduct involving her denial of the motions for disqualifications sic without giving counsel a reasonable time to prepare the motions in writing and in threatening contempt by announcing entry of an order to show cause and then refusing to vacate the order to show cause constituted conduct which was arrogant,discourteous,and impatient to the lawyers appearing before her and others appearing in the braynen case she acted in a manner that erodes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.
more specifically,the jqc hearing panel found that judge aleman did not give the public defender adequate time to prepare the first motion in writing before denying it,it was improper to have the lawyers in the case run up and down in front of the prospective jurors in order to avoid being held in contempt,t he order to show cause which was never reduced to writing and which was never acted upon caused conflicts and further delays,the time limits imposed by judge aleman were unreasonable under all of the circumstances,and f orcing an attorney to prepare a handwritten motion for disqualification of a judge within minutes or within minutes was improper in the context of this murder case in which the death penalty was being sought.
as a result,the jqc hearing panel found by a vote that judge aleman was guilty of misconduct and recommended that judge aleman be publicly reprimanded and charged the costs of the investigation.
ii.analysis 
judge aleman disputes the jqc findings,arguing a the jqc findings are not supported by clear and convincing evidence and b rather than requiring her to pay the costs of the investigation,the jqc should pay her costs because judge aleman was the prevailing party we conclude that each argument lacks merit.
clear and convincing evidence 
first,judge aleman argues that there is no clear and convincing evidence to support the jqc conclusion that her conduct was unreasonable or that she threatened the public defenders with contempt.to the contrary,we find that sufficient evidence supports the jqc conclusion in both respects.
the florida constitution vests this court with the ultimate decision in determining what constitutes judicial misconduct.specifically,article v,section c provides that t he supreme court may accept,reject,or modify in whole or in part the findings,conclusions,and recommendations of the judicial qualifications commission and it may order that the justice or judge be subjected to appropriate discipline.in in re graziano,so d,we described how we review the jqc findings of fact 
before reporting findings of fact to this court,the jqc must conclude that they are
