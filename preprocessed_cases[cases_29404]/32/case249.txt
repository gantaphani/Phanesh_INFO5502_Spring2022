background 
the florida bar filed a complaint against shankman on june,alleging violations of a number of the rules regulating the florida bar with respect to his representation of a female client.following appointment of a referee and holding a final hearing,the referee submitted a report recommending shankman be found guilty of violating the following rules under count i,rule a an attorney shall not enter into an agreement for,charge,or collect an illegal,prohibited,or clearly excessive fee under count ii,rules a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client and b a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation and under count iii,rules b conflict of interest and d conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.with respect to count iv,however,the referee recommends finding shankman not guilty of violating rule c conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit or misrepresentation.the referee also recommends that shankman be suspended for ninety days,ordered to attend the florida bar ethics school,and that costs be awarded to the bar.
shankman petitioned for review,challenging the referee recommendations of guilt with respect to counts i,ii,and iii,the recommended sanction of a suspension,and the referee ruling in which he took judicial notice of a federal district court order and report and recommendation underlying that order,issued by the united states district court,middle district of florida,tampa division,case.the case,brought by shankman in a petition for quantum meruit,involved the client with whom shankman conduct gave rise to these proceedings the bar,challenging the referee recommendation of not guilty as to count iv,the finding of no aggravating factors,and the recommended discipline.in an order dated march,the court suspended shankman for a period of six months,effective thirty days from the date of the order.the opinion of the court now follows.
judicial notice 
shankman challenges the referee ruling taking judicial notice of the federal district court judge order and the magistrate report and recommendation in shankman civil action against the client,seeking quantum meruit relief.
shankman argues that the referee misapplied section,florida statutes in addition,shankman contends that the facts in those documents tainted the instant proceedings and compromised the referee impartiality.
we reject shankman claim.bar disciplinary proceedings are not civil or criminal in nature,but therefore,the rules of evidence are not binding upon the referee.bar.tobkin,so d.t his court has reviewed referees actions regarding the admissibility of evidence in discipline cases using an abuse of discretion standard.bar rotstein,so d.the case law unequivocally supports the referee taking judicial notice of the federal report and recommendation and order in this bar disciplinary case.see.bar head,so d tobkin,so d at.bar vining,so d.bar calvo,so d.bar rood,so d.thus,the referee could properly consider the federal district court order and magistrate report,and,although not done here,the referee could have relied upon them as support for the disciplinary findings of fact.head,so d at.
recommendations of guilt 
in reviewing a referee findings of fact and recommendations concerning guilt,the court standard of review is this court has repeatedly stated that with regard to facts,this court review is limited,and if a referee findings of fact are supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record,this court will not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the referee.bar,so d.
under count i,the bar alleged shankman sought an excessive fee,in violation of rule a.in july,a woman the client hired shankman to represent her in a civil matter.the year before,during spring break in daytona beach,florida,the client had participated in a wet contest.unbeknownst to the client,the contest had been videotaped.when the videotape was broadcast on cable television,the client contacted the law firm shankman,tancredo.regarding potential claims arising out of the videotaping and distribution of the videotape.
at that time,shankman had been practicing law for less than three years and had no experience litigating in federal court.shankman associated with trenam kemker,a tampa law firm with trial and federal court experience.the client entered into a contingency fee agreement with shankman and the trenam kemker firm,providing that the attorneys would receive percent of her gross recovery.under this agreement,shankman was to receive percent of the gross recovery.because shankman was dissatisfied with trenam kemker advice to settle the case,shankman convinced the client to fire the firm.
thereafter,shankman advised the client to hire a second law firm,gary,williams,parenti,finney,lewis,watson sperando.she entered into a contingency fee agreement with the firm and shankman,which provided for a percent contingency fee to the attorneys.under this agreement,shankman share of the fees increased to approximately percent of the client gross recovery.after the gary law firm attorneys arranged a settlement conference with one defendant,shankman convinced the client to fire the gary law firm.
the client then signed a contingency fee agreement with shankman newly formed law firm,litigation concepts,shankman advised the client to hire a third law firm,arthur tifford.she signed a fee agreement addendum,providing for a percent contingency fee to be split equally between the tifford firm and litigation concepts.thus,under this agreement,shankman fee share again increased.for a third time,shankman convinced the client to fire the associated law firm.following the hiring and firing of a fourth and fifth law firm,the client fired shankman and retained new counsel.
based upon these findings of fact,the referee recommends finding shankman guilty of violating rule a,which provides that a n attorney shall not enter into an agreement for,charge,or collect an illegal,prohibited,or clearly excessive fee or cost.under rule a,
a fee or cost is clearly excessive when 
after a review of the facts,a lawyer of ordinary prudence would be left with a definite and firm conviction that the fee or the cost exceeds a reasonable fee or cost for services provided to such a degree as to constitute clear overreaching or an unconscionable demand by the attorney 
accordingly,a lawyer may properly charge his or her client for the time that reasonably should be devoted to accomplish a particular task.bar richardson,so d.moreover,rule b identifies numerous factors that can be considered in determining what constitutes a reasonable fee,including the time and labor required,the novelty,complexity,and difficulty of the questions involved,and the skills requisite to perform the legal services properly.
in recommending that shankman be found guilty of violating rule a,the referee relied upon two,that the percentage of shankman fee increased with each subsequent hiring of a new law firm and that shankman sought percent of the client recovery in his action for quantum meruit in federal court.while the record supports these findings of fact,they are an insufficient basis upon which to conclude that shankman fee was excessive.moreover,the bar did not present expert testimony to establish that shankman fee was unreasonable.therefore,we disapprove of this portion of the referee report.bar hollander,so d,clause and withdrawal clause of contingency fee agreement violated rule a because b oth clauses provided that the client promptly pay for all services,fees,charges,and expenses incurred through the date of either the termination or withdrawal,provided that hollander law firm was entitled to a fee equal to the percentage amount stipulated in the contingency fee agreement until the client,hollander firm,and any new counsel worked out a mutually agreeable fee agreement,and allowed hollander to collect twice for the same work,and thus,the agreement had the effect of intimidating a client from exercising the right to terminate representation.
count ii of the bar complaint alleged that shankman failed both to provide competent representation to the client in violation of rule and to fully explain certain matters reasonably necessary for the client to make informed decisions concerning the representation in violation of rule b.
shankman had been licensed to practice law for less than three years and had no federal court experience when he undertook the client representation.initially,he recognized that he was not competent to handle the case alone and acted in accordance with rule.under the rule,a newly admitted lawyer or one without the requisite knowledge and skill in a particular area may provide competent representation through the association of a lawyer of established competence in the field in question.in associating with the trenam kemker firm,the first firm shankman recommended to the client,it appeared that shankman was taking the proper steps to comply with rule.
however,as found by the referee,shankman problems began when he hired competent,more experienced law firms to help him and then decided not to take the advice of those firms.testimony supports the finding that the trenam firm was competent to bring the case to conclusion according to the client wishes and in her best legal interests.on the advice of shankman,however,the client fired that firm and entered into cycles of hiring and firing other associated law firms.although there was a real possibility of obtaining a settlement,as testified to at the final hearing,shankman continued to persuade his client to fire experienced who had advised settlement of the case.thus,the referee found that shankman motivation underlying his complete disregard of the advice of competent counsel was a desire to take the case to trial.
shankman challenges the referee findings and recommendation that he violated rule on the basis that he was always working toward the client primary goal of enjoining the production and distribution of the videotapes at issue.however,shankman presented no evidence that settling the case and otherwise protecting the client legal interests were mutually exclusive.moreover,the referee found that the client wanted the case to be resolved as quickly as possible.accordingly,we approve this portion of the referee report pertaining to shankman violation of rule as based on competent,substantial evidence in the record.
shankman incompetent representation of his ignoring the advice of experienced exacerbated by his failure to provide his client with sufficient information concerning the case in order for her to make informed decisions.specifically,the referee found that shankman did not discuss with the client the value of her case and the potential risks in hiring multiple law firms and failed to provide her weekly updates as she had requested.the lack of communication resulted in protracted litigation over attorney fees and delayed resolution of the case.the fact that shankman told the client stepfather about quantum meruit did not relieve him of the duty owed the client.the court,therefore,approves the referee findings of fact and recommendation as to guilt that shankman violated rule b as supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record.
under count iii,the bar alleged that shankman violated rules b 
conflict of interest and d conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.the referee found that shankman conduct in initiating the hiring and firing of a number of law firms,with the incremental increase in his percentage of the recovery with each new hiring,and the resultant delay contrary to the client goal of resolving the case constituted engaging in a conflict of interest under rule b.the referee further found that the delay occasioned by shankman inability to work with the other attorneys delayed the administration of justice and increased the cost to his client in violation of rule d.the referee,therefore,recommends shankman be found guilty of violating the two rules.we approve this portion of the referee report as supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record.
the bar alleged that shankman violated rule c conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation in count iv.the referee made the following findings each time shankman persuaded the client to fire,he instructed her not to speak with the discharged attorneys or she would owe them legal fees.shankman provided that same instruction to the client after advising her that the attorney with the third law firm had resigned from her case.shankman further promised the client that she would not owe former counsel any fees.
the referee recommends shankman be found not guilty of violating rule c.in effect,the referee found that the bar failed to present clear and convincing evidence establishing intent,a necessary element of the rule violation the lawyer was dishonest or engaged in misrepresentation,deceit,or fraud.
a referee finding with regard to intent is a factual finding which must be upheld if there is competent,substantial evidence in the record to support it.bar nicnick,so d.a referee legal conclusions,on the other hand,are subject to broader review by the court.bar beach,so d.in florida bar fredericks,so d,the court specifically stated that in order to satisfy the element of intent it must only be shown that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.id.at.thus,the issue is whether shankman deliberately or knowingly engaged in the activity in question.bar head,so d at.consequently,the referee erred as a matter of law when he required the bar to establish dishonesty,misrepresentation,fraud,or deceit in order to prove intent.we conclude that the bar established the element of intent by clear and convincing evidence in the record,based upon shankman deliberate conduct in telling his client not to speak to the fired attorneys or she would owe them fees and that she would not have to pay the other lawyers.therefore,we disapprove the portion of the referee report finding that the bar failed to establish intent and the recommendation that shankman be found not guilty of violating rule c.
discipline 
the referee recommends shankman receive a suspension and be ordered to attend the florida bar ethics school.generally,the court will not the referee recommended discipline as long as it has a reasonable basis in existing case law and the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions.bar de la torre,so d.nonetheless,in reviewing a referee recommended discipline,the court scope of review is broader than that afforded to the referee findings of fact because ultimately it is our responsibility to order the appropriate sanction.see.bar ticktin,so d.bar anderson,so d,see also art.v.const.with respect to a referee findings of aggravation and mitigation,however,as is the case with other factual findings,they carry a presumption of correctness and should be upheld unless clearly erroneous or without support in the record.bar herman,so d.
we turn first to the aggravating factors under the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions.the referee application of standard was clearly erroneous.in his report,the referee explains that his consideration of aggravation was limited to only matters unrelated to the evidence underlying the recommendations of rule violations.pursuant to standard,however,aggravating factors are any considerations or factors that may justify an increase in the degree of discipline to be imposed.accordingly,aggravating factors may well be based upon the circumstances of the rule violations at issue,as well as taking into consideration the existence of a prior disciplinary history and whether there exists a
