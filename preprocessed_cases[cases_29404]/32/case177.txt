the medical board of california board has authority to discipline a licensed physician for unprofessional conduct.bus,further undesignated section references are to the business and professions code.section,subdivision a identifies as a form of unprofessional conduct the use of alcoholic beverages to the extent,or in such a manner as to be dangerous or injurious to the licensee,or to any other person or to the public,or to the extent that such use impairs the ability of the licensee to practice medicine safely italics added.in this original mandamus proceeding,petitioner contends the italicized or in the foregoing statutory definition of unprofessional conduct must be read as and in order for section to pass constitutional muster.in other words,petitioner argues,the use of alcoholic beverages to the extent or in such a manner as to pose a danger to the physician or others may be the basis for professional discipline only if it is also proven there is a nexus between such use and the physician ability to practice medicine safely.
we reject petitioner attempt to rewrite section.although we agree there must be a nexus between the physician use of alcoholic beverages and his or her fitness to practice medicine,we conclude such nexus has been established by the legislature in all cases where a licensed physician used alcoholic beverages to the extent or in such a manner as to pose a danger to himself or others.we further conclude the imposition of discipline based on incidents that do not result in any criminal conviction does not violate the physician due process rights.because our conclusions are consistent with the decision of respondent sacramento county superior court,we deny the instant petition.
facts and proceedings 
on september,david thornton,in his capacity as executive director of the board,filed an accusation against petitioner louis watson,alleging various instances of unprofessional conduct.as amended,the accusation alleged that on november,petitioner entered a negotiated plea of no contest to battery,following an incident in which he hit another man in the back of the head in the parking lot of a home improvement store.petitioner was placed on probation for one year.the accusation further alleged four incidents between july and august in which petitioner was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol dui and four incidents in which petitioner provided false information on applications either for reappointment to hospital medical staffs or for professional liability insurance.
following an administrative hearing,the board found each of the alleged incidents had been established and provided cause for discipline.the board revoked petitioner certificate to practice medicine,but stayed the revocation and placed petitioner on probation for five years,with days actual suspension.
petitioner filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the sacramento county superior court challenging the board decision.that court granted the petition in part,concluding the board erred in relying on the battery incident to support discipline,because that incident has no bearing on petitioner qualifications to practice medicine.the court also concluded the board incorrectly relied on alleged misstatements in one of the applications for professional liability insurance regarding prior convictions,inasmuch as the application was filed after petitioner battery conviction had been expunged.finally,the court struck a finding that petitioner suffers from substance abuse disorder and struck two conditions of probation prohibiting the use of alcohol and requiring testing of bodily fluids.in all other respects,the court denied the petition.
on september,petitioner initiated the instant mandamus proceeding challenging the decision of the superior court.
on review of an administrative decision imposing discipline on a professional licensee,the superior court exercises its independent judgment on the facts.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.after a trial court exercise of its independent judgment in review of the facts,an appellate court is limited to determining whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence but may,nonetheless,independently exercise its ability to decide issues of law.marek board of podiatric medicine th,d.
here,petitioner challenges the decision of the superior court but,in so doing,relies almost exclusively on the facts as found by that court.in effect,petitioner concedes substantial evidence supports the trial court findings,challenging only the legal conclusions reached by the court.the board,for its part,relies on the various police reports of the dui incidents,on which the trial court expressly relied.we therefore quote extensively from the superior court recitation of the underlying facts.however,because the superior court rejected the battery incident as a proper basis for discipline,and that determination is not challenged here,we need not concern ourselves with that incident.
in connection with the four dui incidents,the superior court found on the night of july,petitioner was stopped after police reported observing him driving erratically making an improper left turn.petitioner was arrested after the officers observed signs of intoxication,and petitioner performed poorly on several field sobriety tests.a subsequent breath test showed petitioner alcohol level to be.a misdemeanor complaint was filed against petitioner but was dismissed on november,pursuant to penal code section.
in the late afternoon or early evening of february,petitioner was stopped after he a van at a stop light and the van driver flagged down a patrol officer and reported petitioner as being intoxicated.petitioner was arrested after the officer observed signs of intoxication,and petitioner performed poorly on some of the field sobriety tests.a subsequent blood test showed petitioner alcohol level to be,and no charges were filed.
on the night of january,petitioner lost control of his car on the freeway,skidded and hit the center divider.he claimed that he had become anxious about a car following him too closely,and lost control when he tried to move out of the way.petitioner car suffered significant damage to the left front and rear areas,but was still operable.petitioner drove his car off the freeway and to the hotel where he and his wife were staying.police officers who happened to be there observed petitioner drive his damaged car into the parking lot,approached him,and reported observing signs of intoxication.petitioner performed poorly on most of the field sobriety tests,and preliminary alcohol screening tests at the site reported alcohol levels of and petitioner was arrested,and a subsequent breath test reported an alcohol level of.no charges were filed as the result of this arrest.
on august,police reported observing petitioner make a sudden lane change to exit the freeway,which caused other motorists to brake in order to avoid him.after stopping petitioner,the officers observed signs of intoxication.petitioner performed poorly on field sobriety tests and was arrested.two subsequent breath tests recorded alcohol levels of.at the time of the administrative hearing in this matter,a criminal matter was pending against petitioner in connection with this arrest 
regarding the false applications,the superior court found p etitioner made misrepresentations on two applications for reappointment to medical staff positions and on two applications for professional liability insurance when he failed to disclose the board investigation pending accusation in this matter and his criminal charges and convictions in response to questions asking about such matters.
discussion 
iintroduction 
as we explain in the next section,conduct used as a basis for disciplining a professional licensee must demonstrate unfitness to practice the profession in question.this nexus requirement stems from constitutional due process principles.
petitioner contends this matter raises the following issue of first impression w hether a physician properly may be subjected to professional license discipline for conduct that a does not result in conviction for any criminal offense,and b not only fails to demonstrate a nexus to professional competence or ability to practice with safety to the public,but is imposed in the face of an explicit judicial finding of a lack of nexus to competence or ability to practice with safety to the public.
petitioner mischaracterizes the record in asserting the trial court made an express finding there is no nexus between the four incidents and his medical practice.although not expressly stated,petitioner apparently relies on the following discussion in the trial court decision moreover,no evidence was presented of any improper conduct,impairment or other deleterious effects occurring within the context of petitioner medical practice,the kind of red flags that would be expected,under leino view,from a physician suffering from substance abuse disorder.indeed,the only evidence of petitioner conduct within the context of his medical practice was that petitioner never showed signs of being under the influence while acting as a physician and surgeon.
the foregoing discussion came in the context of the court decision to discount the opinion of one of the board experts leino that petitioner was suffering from substance abuse disorder.the court indicated if petitioner had been suffering from such condition,he would have shown signs of it at work.however,two percipient witnesses testified petitioner never showed signs of alcohol use while on duty.there was no contrary evidence presented.
the court acknowledgement that petitioner never showed signs of being under the influence of alcohol at work does not amount to a finding of no nexus between the four incidents and petitioner practice of medicine.in grannis board of medical examiners d.grannis,a physician was disciplined for two counts of unprofessional conduct,one count based on two drunk driving convictions and the other based on the use of alcoholic beverages to the extent and in such a manner as to pose a danger to the physician or others.id.at.the court of appeal rejected the first count,because one of the convictions was based on a plea of nolo contendere and was later dismissed.id.at.however,the court found the second count was sufficient to sustain the discipline.
on the question of whether there was a nexus between the misconduct and the practice of medicine,the court noted the board expressly found grannis established that at no time had his alcoholism impaired his professional competency.grannis,supra,d at,fn.nonetheless,other evidence in the record established grannis was an alcoholic and his alcoholism had a direct relationship to the quality of patient care that grannis could give a patient if he had any alcohol whatsoever.grannis,supra,d at.in other words,despite the fact there had been no impact on patient care,the potential for such impact provided the necessary nexus.
as we explain more fully in the following sections,the existence of a nexus does not require a finding of an actual,adverse impact on the past practice of medicine,but may be satisfied by a potential for such adverse impact in the future.thus,the question presented here is whether,in order to support professional discipline,the legislature may base a finding of unprofessional conduct on conduct,where such conduct does not result in a criminal conviction,and there is no express finding of a nexus between the conduct in question and the ability to practice medicine.
the nexus requirement 
in order to satisfy constitutional due process,t he state power to regulate a profession can not be used arbitrarily to penalize conduct having no demonstrable bearing upon fitness for its practice.cartwright board of chiropractic examiners cal d.thus,conduct used as a basis for revocation or suspension of a professional license must demonstrate unfitness to practice that profession.ibid.as explained by the supreme court in yakov board of medical examiners cal d,yakov the purpose of an action seeking revocation of a doctor certificate is not to punish the doctor but rather to protect the public.citations.while revocation of a certificate certainly works an unavoidable punitive effect,the board can seek to achieve a legitimate punitive purpose only through criminal prosecution.thus,in this proceeding the inquiry must be limited to the effect of the doctor actions upon the quality of his service to his patients.id.at,fn.
in morrison state board of education cal d,morrison,a public school teacher resigned after it became known he engaged in a homosexual relationship with another teacher.thereafter the state board of education revoked his life diplomas pursuant to former education code section,which authorized discipline for immoral or unprofessional conduct.morrison,at,fn,see also id.at.the supreme court concluded terms such as immoral,unprofessional,or involving moral turpitude are too broad and amorphous to be used as a basis for the termination of a professional license.rather,it must be shown the conduct in question indicates an unfitness to engage in the profession.
the court explained terms such as immoral or unprofessional conduct or moral turpitude stretch over so wide a range that they embrace an unlimited area of conduct.in using them the legislature surely did not mean to endow the employing agency with the power to dismiss any employee whose personal,private conduct incurred its disapproval.hence the courts have consistently related the terms to the issue of whether,when applied to the performance of the employee on the job,the employee has disqualified himself.morrison,supra,cal d at.the court concluded the state board of education can not abstractly characterize the conduct in the case as immoral,unprofessional,or involving moral turpitude within the meaning of former education code section unless that conduct indicates the petitioner is unfit to teach.morrison,at.
business and professions code section 
in the present matter,petitioner contends business and professions code section,like former education code section,can be applied constitutionally only if interpreted to require a showing of a nexus between the use of alcoholic beverages and the ability to practice medicine.
section,subdivision a reads the use or prescribing for or administering to himself or herself,of any controlled substance or the use of any of the dangerous drugs specified in section,or of alcoholic beverages,to the extent,or in such a manner as to be dangerous or injurious to the licensee,or to any other person or to the public,or to the extent that such use impairs the ability of the licensee to practice medicine safely or more than one misdemeanor or any felony involving the use,consumption,or of any of the substances referred to in this section,or any combination thereof,constitutes unprofessional conduct.the record of the conviction is conclusive evidence of such unprofessional conduct.italics and underlining added.
as noted earlier,petitioner contends we must read the underlined or in section,subdivision a as and in order to satisfy the constitutional requirement of a nexus between conduct and the licensee professional competence.in other words,petitioner argues,the board must establish,by clear and convincing evidence see ettinger board of medical quality assurance d,that a licensee use of alcoholic beverages is both to the extent,or in such a manner as to be dangerous or injurious to the licensee,or to any other person or to the public and to the extent that such use impairs the ability of the licensee to practice medicine safely.
the foregoing construction of section,subdivision a would contravene the fundamental principles of statutory interpretation that require us to ascertain legislative intent brown kelly broadcasting cal d,and to determine such intent from the words of the enactment,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning trope katz cal th,d.if the legislature had intended that the board be required to prove both of the italicized clauses in section,subdivision a in order to establish unprofessional conduct,it would not have written the statute in the disjunctive.in construing a statute,we give words their usual and ordinary meaning.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.for this court to interpret the provision as petitioner suggests would require that we rewrite it in a way contrary to the legislature intent.
petitioner nevertheless contends we must read the provision as he suggests in order for the statute to be found constitutional.he notes that an ambiguous provision must be construed,if possible,so as to uphold its constitutionality.see metromedia,city of san diego cal d.however,as we have indicated,there is nothing ambiguous in the language of section,subdivision a at issue here.in the italicized language,the legislature defined two distinct ways in which a licensee use of alcoholic beverages may constitute unprofessional conduct.thus,the question is not whether section,subdivision a must be read to require proof of both parts of the italicized language,but whether,under constitutional principles,proof of the first part of the italicized language can not be the basis for disciplinary action absent proof of the second part.it is that question we address in the next section.
constitutionality of section,subdivision a 
petitioner contends section,subdivision a,as written,is unconstitutional,because it authorizes discipline for conduct without a showing of a nexus between the particular conduct in question and the ability to practice medicine.petitioner acknowledges that two published decisions,griffiths superior court th,d griffiths and weissbuch board of medical examiners d.weissbuch,recognized the board power to impose discipline under such circumstances.petitioner argues those cases are inapposite.as we shall explain,we find petitioner attempts to distinguish griffiths and weissbuch unavailing.
in weissbuch,disciplinary proceedings were commenced against a doctor under former sections and following his guilty plea to possession of marijuana.former section defined as unprofessional conduct any violation of state law regulating narcotics or dangerous drugs former section,the predecessor of section,identified the use of specified narcotics as unprofessional conduct.at the hearing before the medical board,the parties stipulated the doctor suffered the conviction and had used marijuana during a prior period.the board made findings consistent with the stipulations but further found the doctor marijuana use had no effect on his medical ability or his patients.weissbuch,supra,d at.
the court of appeal concluded the discipline was improper under the circumstances,because recent legislation had taken marijuana outside the definition of narcotics or dangerous drugs and,therefore,undermined the basis for the discipline.even though the doctor marijuana use predated the legislative change,the court concluded he was entitled to the benefit of the new legislation.weissbuch,supra,d at.
however,in reaching this conclusion,the court first considered the issue of whether the legislature may constitutionally provide for the disciplining of a licentiate in the medical profession on the basis of conduct involving the personal use of narcotics or on the basis of a violation of the laws regulating narcotics without any showing that the conduct affected the doctor professional ability or amounted to moral turpitude.weissbuch,supra,d at.the court concluded the legislature could do so,explaining in his dealing with narcotics and dangerous drugs,there is more to be considered than just the doctor ability to perform the skills required of his profession.he is,as we have said,a part of the regulatory machinery the legislature which presumptively legislated in a constitutional fashion citation,has determined that conviction of a doctor for a violation of the laws regulating narcotics and dangerous drugs or a doctor personal use of such substances evidences a sufficient danger to the public that sanctions should be imposed regardless of the availability of evidence that such conduct in fact impaired the doctor professional skill.there is no basis,constitutional or otherwise,for the courts to override that legislative determination by imposing a special requirement of nexus between the proscribed conduct and professional conduct.id.at.
in griffiths,a physician was disciplined based on his pleas of nolo contendere to three charges involving reckless driving and alcohol consumption.the second and third convictions occurred while griffiths was on probation for earlier violations.the evidence presented to the board demonstrated griffiths never treated patients while under the influence of drugs or alcohol.the board nevertheless concluded cause existed to impose discipline for unprofessional conduct in connection with the three convictions griffiths,supra,th at,d,and griffiths subsequent petition for writ of mandate was denied by the trial court id.at,d.
in the court of appeal,griffiths argued section,subdivision a is unconstitutional to the extent it authorizes discipline without a showing of a nexus between the alleged misconduct in a particular case and the ability of the physician in question to practice medicine.the court acknowledged the nexus requirement,but concluded such nexus had been established by the legislature,explaining by defining more than one misdemeanor conviction involving alcohol consumption as unprofessional conduct in section,subdivision a,the legislature has determined that a nexus exists between those convictions and a physician fitness or competence to practice medicine.the issue is whether such convictions have a logical connection to a physician fitness or competence to practice medicine.citation.we conclude that convictions involving alcohol consumption do have a logical connection to a physician fitness to practice medicine and therefore section,subdivision a is constitutionally valid.
convictions involving alcohol consumption reflect a lack of sound professional and personal judgment that is relevant to a physician fitness and competence to practice medicine.alcohol consumption quickly affects normal driving ability,and driving under the influence of alcohol threatens personal safety and places the safety of the public in jeopardy.it further shows a disregard of medical knowledge concerning the effects of alcohol on vision,reaction time,motor skills,judgment,coordination and memory,and the ability to judge speed,dimensions,and distance.citation.
driving while under the influence of alcohol also shows an inability or unwillingness to obey the legal prohibition against drinking and driving and constitutes a serious breach of a duty owed to society.moreover,griffiths december,arrest violated his probation ordered on august,and griffiths november,arrest violated his probation ordered on april.knowledge of such repeated conduct by a physician,and particularly of its propensity to endanger members of the public,tends to undermine public confidence in and respect for the medical profession.citation.repeated convictions involving alcohol use,two of which violated griffiths probation,reflect poorly on griffiths common sense and professional judgment,which are essential to the practice of medicine,and tend to undermine public confidence in and respect for the medical profession.griffiths,supra,th at,d.
in griffiths,the petitioner argued that the discipline based on section,subdivision a was invalid because no evidence showed his alcohol use impaired his medical practice.petitioner contend ed that private conduct having no effect on a physician treatment of patients can not be a basis for imposing discipline on a medical license.griffiths,supra,th at,d.in response,the court noted that,f or a nexus to exist between the misconduct and the fitness or competence to practice medicine,it is not necessary for the misconduct forming the basis for discipline to have occurred in the actual practice of medicine.ibid.
finally,relying specifically on the analysis in weissbuch regarding legislative power to define unprofessional conduct,the court concluded i f misconduct poses a sufficient danger to the public,the legislature can define it as unprofessional conduct forming a basis for imposing discipline on the licensee without any additional showing that the misconduct impaired the actual practice of m
