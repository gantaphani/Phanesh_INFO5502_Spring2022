this matter is before the court for review of the recommendation of the florida judicial qualifications commission jqc that judge george maxwell,iii,be publicly reprimanded.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.we approve the jqc findings and recommended sanction.
the jqc formally charged judge maxwell with conduct alleged to violate canons,and of the code of judicial conduct.the charges against judge maxwell stem from his actions on october.
on the morning of october,the brevard county sheriff office responded to a battery complaint at a private residence.the officers determined that the wife had committed domestic violence battery against her husband,and she was charged,arrested,and transported to the brevard county jail.later that day,the wife brother,jack platt,who is an attorney with whom judge maxwell was previously affiliated in private practice and with whom judge maxwell appeared on the firm letterhead,called judge maxwell at his residence and requested his assistance in securing the release of his sister.even though the matter was not assigned to him,judge maxwell thereafter contacted the brevard county sheriff office and authorized her release to the pretrial release program without the benefit of a first appearance.judge maxwell authorized the defendant release notwithstanding the fact that she was currently serving a sentence of five years probation for obtaining controlled substances by fraud,thus making her ineligible for the pretrial release program.
in its notice of formal charges,the jqc concluded that judge maxwell conduct,if it occurred as alleged,violated canons,and.however,the jqc and judge maxwell reached an agreement and entered into a stipulation in which judge maxwell acknowledged that he violated canons,and of the code of judicial conduct according to the stipulation,judge maxwell accepted full responsibility for the conduct,admitted that it should not have occurred,expressed his regret and apologies for such conduct,and noted that he had undertaken steps to prevent reoccurrence of the conduct judge maxwell also denied that he intended to violate the applicable canons,and contended that he acted with a good faith belief that such conduct was appropriate.because the jqc concluded that the actions were misguided but not,it recommended a public reprimand.
ii.analysis 
in in re maloney,so d,we explained 
when the jqc presents a case for our review,we are authorized under the florida constitution to accept,reject,or modify in whole or in part the findings,conclusions,and recommendations of the commission and to order that the justice or judge be subjected to appropriate discipline.art.v,c.const.this court reviews the findings of the jqc to determine if they are supported by clear and convincing evidence and reviews the recommendation of discipline to determine whether it should be approved.in re pando,so d.while the court gives the jqc findings and recommendations great weight,the ultimate power and responsibility in making a determination rests with this court.in re davey,so d.thus,we review the findings to ensure that there is clear and convincing evidence to support the alleged ethical violations and determine whether to approve the recommendation of discipline.in re andrews,so d,quoting in re kinsey,so d.additionally,where the findings of the jqc are supported by clear and convincing evidence,the court gives the findings persuasive force and great weight in considering the jqc recommendation of discipline.see in re holloway,so d,finding clear and convincing evidence to support finding that judge used the prestige of judicial office to request a scheduling favor for a family member from another judge,but insufficient evidence to support conclusion that judge abused her office based on single telephone call to a detective handling a criminal investigation involving a friend.
in re maloney,so d at.
in recommending that judge maxwell receive a public reprimand,the jqc stated that it was guided by this court decision in in re maloney.there,judge maloney had a close friend whose son was arrested for driving under the influence dui.id.at.judge maloney son was a passenger in the car,but was not charged with any violations.id.although the law prohibits the immediate release of persons arrested for dui,judge maloney nevertheless contacted the lakeland police department after picking up his own son on the morning in question and demanded the release of his friend son.id.at.the police department objected,but released the son to the custody of his father based on the judge demand.id.the jqc found that the judge actions violated canons,and,but agreed to a public reprimand after the judge admitted the allegations,acknowledged the violations of the code of judicial conduct,and agreed to the stipulated penalty.id.at.on appeal,this court approved the stipulation because a public reprimand,as disciplinary action,is consistent with governing precedent regarding sanctions for judicial misconduct where a judge uses the prestige of judicial office to obtain favorable treatment for himself or another individual.id.at.this court noted that in recommending a public reprimand,the jqc considered various mitigating circumstances,including judge maloney lack of disciplinary history,reputation as a fair,impartial,and competent jurist,candor before the jqc investigative panel,and testimony that he was unaware his conduct constituted a violation of state law.id.at.
this case does bear some similarity to in re maloney.in the instant case,judge maxwell contacted the brevard county sheriff office and sought the release of a former colleague sister to the pretrial release program,despite the fact that the law prohibited such a release because she was already on probation for a controlled substance offense.however,we also note that this case could be viewed as more serious than in re maloney because judge maxwell accepted an ex parte communication from an attorney without input from the prosecutor or any other interested party in addition,he relied on this ex parte communication in ordering the defendant release,even though it appears that judge maxwell may not have had the complete picture of the exact details of the crime or the defendant prior record 
as we have tried to make clear in our opinions on judicial discipline,and as evidenced by the code of judicial conduct,a judge has an absolute obligation to act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.of jud.conduct,canon.this provision is not an aspirational principle but a clear and unequivocal mandate.at each turn,from the oath of office to the new judges college to ongoing judicial education,we instill this ultimate responsibility in our judges.judge maxwell clearly violated this canon and admitted to so doing.in addition,it is clear and unambiguous that the communication from the attorney was an absolute violation of canon that prohibits ex parte communications except under certain limited circumstances not present in this case.moreover,by his stipulation,judge maxwell also admitted to this violation.
as one of the jqc lay members observed in his questioning of judge maxwell at the investigative hearing that forms part of this record presented to the court 
your actions brought,in my opinion,a major problem to the perception of fairness,a major problem of the person who is on the street who comes before and does know a judge and ca have his brother call him up.
judge maxwell improper conduct of calling the police to secure the defendant release was exacerbated by the fact that he was prompted to intervene by a phone call from the defendant brother,with whom he previously had practiced law.this special consideration would not be available to the general public.such misuse of judicial office tarnishes the public perception of the integrity,impartiality,and independence of the judiciary.the respect for,and adherence to,the law and the rules governing judicial conduct are the cornerstones for the public trust and confidence in the judicial branch of government.
because we find that a public reprimand in this case is consistent with
