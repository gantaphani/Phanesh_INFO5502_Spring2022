these contempt proceedings arise from two petitions for rehearing filed by attorney debra koven koven on behalf of her client,paul bashkin bashkin.in no uncertain terms koven accuses us of deliberate judicial dishonesty.in re buckley cal d.these accusations are not only false they are insolent,offensive,insulting,and impugn the integrity of this court.ibid.after we issued the orders to show cause and apparently after some reflection,koven now concedes that the accusations are both improper and inexcusable on their face she apologizes for the improper statements in the petitions,and expresses deep regret for impugning the integrity of this court,and accepts the embarrassment she has brought upon herself.
we accept koven apology.nevertheless,we do not purge koven of the contempts she committed because her unsupported accusations of judicial misconduct are patently outrageous.moreover,there is an aggravating factor.koven has engaged in a pattern of abuse.she has also impugned the integrity of the trial judge,opposing counsel,and counsel expert witnesses.see infra,at.
the court of appeal will not quietly suffer an attack upon its integrity.our obligation to preserve the integrity of the judiciary compels us to find koven guilty of two counts of direct criminal contempt of this court.we need not decide whether koven could be found guilty on more than two counts of contempt because of the multiple contemptuous statements in both petitions.in view of her apology,we do not impose any jail time.it is sufficient to fine her for each of the two petitions for rehearing.we refer koven to the state bar for investigation and,if appropriate,the imposition of disciplinary sanctions.bus.
factual and procedural background 
koven represented bashkin in a legal malpractice action brought against dewitt blase and heily blase hereafter defendants.bashkin blase et,ventura super.no.this action arose from defendants representation of bashkin in a combined legal malpractice and medical malpractice action against bashkin former attorney stephen marpet and a psychiatrist arthur sorosky.bashkin sorosky marpet,los angeles super.no.
on bashkin behalf,koven filed three appeals.we take judicial notice of the records in these cases,subd.d.the first appeal no,filed on july,was from the trial court order denying bashkin motion to disqualify defendants counsel,musick,peeler garrett.this appeal is hereafter referred to as the first disqualification appeal.on march,we filed our opinion affirming the trial court order.nonpublished opinion by yegan,gilbert,and perren,concurring.
the second appeal no,filed on may,was from the trial court order denying a new motion by bashkin to disqualify defendants counsel and an expert witness david glickman retained by counsel.this appeal is hereafter referred to as the second disqualification appeal.
on december,summary judgment was entered in favor of defendants.the third appeal no,filed on june,was from that judgment.this appeal is hereafter referred to as the summary judgment appeal.
on june,koven filed a letter requesting that all of the justices of this division division six,second district court of appeal recuse themselves in the second disqualification appeal.the justices of this division are gilbert,yegan,coffee and perren.koven alleged that a reasonable person aware of the facts would doubt their ability to be impartial.
as to justice coffee,koven asserted i have just been informed that justice coffee,while in private practice,represented defendants in an action entitled,buckley heily blase.as a result of the representation,justice coffee clearly owes a continuing duty of loyalty to defendants,which would make it difficult for him to be fair to my client 
koven alleged that justices yegan and perren were not impartial because they had sat on the bench of the ventura county superior court during the time that defendant dewitt blase was actively trying cases in that venue.koven claimed that a ventura county superior court voluntarily recused herself in the instant action,ruling sua sponte,that all ventura county superior court judges had intimate knowledge of defendants,and as such,it would be very awkward to have the case remain in ventura and be heard by judges who knew intimately both of the defendants.given the judge statements,koven asserted,justices yegan and perren would necessarily be included amongst those who could not be impartial in hearing a matter between defendants and bashkin.but judge lane did not rule that all ventura county superior court judges had intimate knowledge of defendants.she gratuitously said there probably no judge in this courthouse who does know the defendant dewitt blase.t hat might make this case awkward.he a character and very in ventura county.
furthermore,koven maintained that the justices of this division were not impartial because they had ruled against bashkin in previous matters,including his request to stay the trial court proceedings pending the resolution of the second disqualification appeal.koven alleged by failing to grant the stay request,this division has predetermined its ruling against my client in the instant appeal.koven accused the justices of division six of having repeatedly denied her client the right to equal protection under the law 
defendants filed opposition to the request for recusal.defendants counsel noted that it had submitted respondents brief,which addresses every one of the arguments made in appellant opening brief.defendants counsel stated spending this kind of time and money on briefing is hardly consistent with knowledge that the fix is in before this division.as each of you certainly knows,i have no such knowledge.
in an order signed by presiding justice gilbert and filed on july,this court denied the request for recusal as frivolous.
on july,this court ordered,on its own motion,that the second disqualification appeal be considered and heard together with the summary judgment appeal.
on april,bashkin filed his reply brief in the summary judgment appeal.oral argument in the second disqualification and summary judgment appeals was heard on may.because bashkin appeals were the last matter on the afternoon calendar and justice coffee was not on the panel of justices hearing the appeals,he left the bench before oral argument began.
on may,this court filed its opinions in both appeals.nonpublished opinions by yegan,gilbert,and perren,concurring.we affirmed the trial court order denying bashkin new motion to disqualify defendant counsel and the expert witness.in addition,we affirmed the summary judgment.koven filed petitions for rehearing in both appeals.we denied the petitions.
before denying the petitions for rehearing,we issued two orders,one for each appeal,requiring koven to show cause why she should not be adjudged guilty of contempt and punished for impugning the integrity of this court.the order to show cause arising out of the second disqualification appeal was assigned case no.the order to show cause arising out of the summary judgment appeal was assigned case no.
the order to show cause arising out of the second disqualification appeal stated that it was based on the petition for rehearing,including but not limited to the following statements 
after reading the opinion,it became painfully obvious that this court worked backwards in reviewing the issues to ensure that the ends justified the means.it is clear from the opinion that this court neither reviewed the controlling cases,nor read bashkin reply brief,which contained the authority mandating reversal.and why would this court look at cases cited by bashkin,anyhow,when it has concealed its own conflicts with defendants resulting from their prior relationships how could bashkin possibly convince this court to follow the governing law requiring expert and counsel disqualification,when this court engaged in the same type of activities that bashkin was complaining about in his motion to disqualify them bashkin never stood a chance to succeed on this appeal.if this court dared to disqualify an expert and a defense firm that failed to disclose conflicts,its own conduct could be called into question the cards were not only stacked against bashkin,but the jokers were wild 
the court conspired with defendants to defeat bashkin interest.
in fact,the justices of this court refused to disclose their conflicts of interest refused to respond to bashkin charges and refused to recuse themselves,precisely because the fix was in 
despite its obvious,this court elaborate staging of the removal of justice coffee from the panel hearing oral argument on bashkin two appeals,ironically proved three things first,that justice gilbert knew full well that bashkin charges against the other three justices were anything but frivolous.second,that all of the prior rulings against bashkin in which at least justice coffee participated were tainted.and,third,that there were still at least two justices comprising the panel yegan and perren,with personal biases in favor of defendants,who had failed to respond to bashkin recusal demands,that were going to perpetuate the fix.an independent review of the totality of the circumstances would disclose a personal bias or prejudice by the conflicted justices in favor of defendants and against bashkin this court rulings against bashkin in this appeal,each of which had no basis whatsoever in fact or law,were merely a reaffirmation that the fix was proceeding full bore.
a reasonable person,aware of the facts,would believe that this court purposely denied bashkin stay request and purposely delayed the hearing on this interim appeal,since it had already predetermined that it could by first affirming the summary judgment,and then claiming that its affirmance somehow mooted the glickman disqualification.this fix was not only in,but proceeding at full throttle.
this court predilection for prejudicial posturing 
this court manipulated an affirmance 
if this court had conducted an honest and impartial review of bashkin willful suppression claim,it would have to have found,as a matter of law,a willful suppression of evidence by mp g musick,peeler garrett 
the bottom line the record establishes the presence of judicial partiality in this court review of bashkin motion.in fact,this court finding is a complete red herring.this court purposely concocted a flimsy excuse not to rule on the merits of this issue,because it knew that to do so would have required it to reverse 
the order to show cause arising out of the summary judgment appeal stated that it was based on the petition for rehearing,including but not limited to the following statements 
i t is difficult to remain focused on what is just when faced with an unfair and biased court that predetermined its findings and worked backwards to get there,by deciding the instant appeal before the interim disqualification appeal.in light of their own inherent conflicts of interest pertaining to prior relationships with defendants not to mention,the factor of the ventura boy defendants in combination with the personal animus this court has toward bashkin,even with clarence darrow as his representative,bashkin did not stand a chance of prevailing in this court.the fix was most assuredly in.
in order to manipulate an affirmance,this court ignored issues that mandated reversal refused to apply the law that supported bashkin position failed to view the facts and inferences in the light most favorable to bashkin,all to his detriment and prejudice,and employed an approach in order to push this litigant out of the court system.
this court refused to afford bashkin an opportunity to address these additional grounds upon which his appeal was rejected,because its intent was to deny bashkin his constitutional right to equal protection under the law.
this court finding was not simply a flagrant,reprehensible breach of its ethical and legal obligations to afford every litigant,including bashkin,equal protection under the law,but it is contrary to all published legal authority in this state.moreover,it demonstrates a profound lack of integrity,by directly assaulting bashkin right to have each of his appeals reviewed by a court that had not enjoyed prior relationships with defendants which it kept concealed for the entirety of bashkin lawsuits involving them 
when this court chose to engage in a betrayal of the fundamental values and principles of the law,in order to defeat the interests of a bashkin,it undertook an approach.the ends was to eliminate bashkin from the judicial system,whatever the cost being this court integrity and continuing viability as a depository of the public trust.
far from viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to bashkin,this court spent two pages of its opinion trashing bashkin as the who allegedly ordered his doctor to alter his medical records how convenient for this court to concoct a review of this issue that fits so snugly into its own predetermined perception of this litigant 
this court misrepresented the evidence in order to manipulate an affirmance on the sorosky fraud theory of liability.
i f this panel remains steadfast to its unique interpretation of the proper review of unchallenged theories,it must publish its opinion,so that bashkin will not be singled out for special treatment which,of course,was this court intention from the outset.
the bottom line is this court refused to apply the governing principles and law to it s analysis of the facts in order to manipulate an affirmance on this issue in favor of a litigant with whom the court had a personal relationship and against a litigant it views with disdain therefore,it must now rehear and reverse the summary judgment on these fraud theories of liability,or be guilty of itself having committed fraud in betraying its duty to uphold the public trust in a fair,impartial judiciary.
on september,the california supreme court denied bashkin petitions for review in the second disqualification and summary judgment appeals.on september,koven filed a consolidated return to the orders to show cause.koven apologized for her statements in the petitions for rehearing.on october,we conducted a hearing on the orders to show cause.koven and her counsel personally appeared at the hearing.koven counsel suggested,among other things,that in light of her sincere apology,years of unblemished behavior as a lawyer,and declarations attesting to her professional demeanor,that we should vacate the orders to show cause and not find koven in contempt.
contempt impugning the integrity of the court 
a direct contempt is committed in the immediate view and presence of the court,or of the judge at chambers code civ,subd.a.it may be punished summarily.ibid.i t is the settled law of this state that an attorney commits a direct contempt when he impugns the integrity of the court by statements made in open court either orally or in writing.citations.insolence to the judge in the form of insulting words or conduct in court has traditionally been recognized in the common law as constituting grounds for contempt.citation.in re buckley,supra,cal d at.
an attorney also commits a direct contempt by impugning the integrity of the court in a document filed with the court.the california supreme court has long held that the inclusion of a contemptuous statement in a document filed in a court is a contempt committed in the immediate presence of the court and thus constitutes a direct contempt.citations.in re white th,fn,d.for example,in blodgett superior court cal,the california supreme court held that the filing of points and authorities containing contemptuous statements constituted a direct contempt.t he fact that the alleged contemptuous statements were contained in pleadings or other papers filed in court does not furnish any excuse or defense against the charge of contempt.it is well settled that contempt may be committed by incorporating impertinent,scandalous,insulting or contemptuous language reflecting on the integrity of the court in pleadings,motions,notice of motions,affidavits,and other papers filed in court.citations.hume superior court in and for los angeles county cal d.
