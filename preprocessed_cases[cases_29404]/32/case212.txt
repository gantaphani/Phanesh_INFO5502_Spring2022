as part of the posttrial settlement of this action,all parties stipulated to vacate the judgment entered in by the contra costa superior court on may.to effectuate their stipulation,the parties filed in this court an application for order vacating judgment pursuant to code of civil procedure section,subdivision a the record is not complete and briefing on the noticed appeal and has not commenced.
we shall deny the motion to vacate the judgment.
this nonjury case was tried over three days before contra costa county superior court judge joyce cram.the findings of fact and judgment after court trial hereafter findings and judgment judge cram filed on march,may be summed up as follows plaintiff george hardisty,an attorney,referred a client,james gracey,to attorney and coplaintiff john peterson.the case related to an automobile accident in in which gracey incompetent brother,todd larsen,sustained severe injuries.acting as guardian ad litem for larsen,gracey entered into a written fee agreement with peterson.the agreement required peterson to handle the case for a contingent fee of percent and provided that he would share the fee with hardisty,the referring attorney.
hulita kisi,the driver of the van in which todd larsen was a passenger,also retained peterson to represent her.when kisi was sued by other passengers,another attorney involved in the case moved to disqualify peterson from representing larsen based upon the conflict of interest posed by his representation of parties with adverse interests.the motion was granted and peterson referred the representation of larsen to the firm of hinton alfert,which agreed to substitute as attorneys of record.hinton alfert did not obtain a written fee agreement with gracey or larsen.
after larsen case settled for,hilton alfert petitioned for approval of the settlement in the alameda county superior court,where the personal injury case had been filed.at the hearing on the petition,counsel associated with hinton alfert represented to the court that the firm had a written fee agreement providing for a percent contingency fee,and that peterson was not requesting attorney fees but only reimbursement of his costs.the petition to confirm the compromise of larsen claim was granted by the alameda county superior court on august,and hilton alfert was awarded attorney fees of.
shortly after receiving the attorney fee award,hinton alfert asked peterson to document the amount of fees he felt entitled to receive in quantum meruit and his costs.peterson claimed hours at per hour,for a total of,as well as costs of.however,in addition to these amounts,peterson also asked hinton alfert to pay attorney hardisty the referral fee called for by peterson fee agreement.hinton alfert agreed to pay peterson or hardisty,but not both,though the firm did reimburse peterson for his costs.this lawsuit ensued.
the parties motion states that,by their complaint which is not now a part of the record,hardisty and peterson alleged that hinton alfert agreed to pay each of them a referral fee in connection with hinton alfert representation of todd larsen,an incompetent adult who was injured in a accident.hardisty and peterson alleged hinton alfert was contractually obligated to share of a contingency fee it collected with them.hinton alfert asserted it was not so obligated.
judge cram findings and judgment included the following determinations hinton alfert representations to the alameda county superior court were false,in that the firm had no written fee agreement with its client,and peterson had requested and been promised reimbursement in quantum meruit for the time he spent on the case prior to the substitution of hinton alfert peterson was not entitled to any attorney fees,because h e accepted representation of two parties with adverse interests,and did not have a signed waiver of the conflict hinton alfert is estopped from denying the contract which called for a referral fee to plaintiff george hardisty as t he firm adopted the terms of the contract in their representations to the alameda county court,and they realized a benefit from that adoption.had the alameda county judge been aware that there was no written contract,hinton alfert would have been able to recover only under quantum meruit.the attorneys fees they actually received as a result of adopting the contract substantially exceeded the fees to which they would have been entitled under quantum meruit and the contract adopted by hinton alfert called for a referral fee of up to to plaintiff george hardisty and t his term is sufficiently clear to be enforced.the evidence as to when a lesser referral fee would be given was that this would only happen if there was only a nominal recovery,a situation that did not occur here.
in the judgment,judge cram decreed.plaintiff john peterson shall take nothing.plaintiff george hardisty shall recover from defendant hinton alfert the sum of,representing a referral fee of,plus costs of suit.defendants peter hinton and peter alfert are entitled to judgment in their favor.
the motion to vacate the judgment avers that hinton alfert objected to the findings of fact and judgment on several grounds including that the court did not comply with california rules of court,rule e and had never taken the first procedural step that would have permitted it to request a statement of decision.although hinton alfert did not believe that the findings of fact and judgment was a valid judgment,it appealed from it out of an abundance of caution.hardisty and peterson also appealed from the findings of fact and judgment.

the parties acknowledge that motions to reverse or vacate duly entered judgments are governed by section,subdivision a.subdivision a enumerates the powers of the courts of this state.prior to,the last enumerated power,set forth in subdivision a,simply provided that every court shall have the power t o amend and control its process and orders so as to make them conform to law and justice.legislation in added to that sentence the following language an appellate court shall not reverse or vacate a duly entered judgment upon an agreement or stipulation of the parties unless the court finds both of the following a there is no reasonable possibility that the interests of nonparties or the public will be adversely affected by the reversal.b the reasons of the parties for requesting reversal outweigh the erosion of public trust that may result from the nullification of a judgment and the risk that the availability of stipulated reversal will reduce the incentive for pretrial settlement.stats,ch.
the amendment was designed to supersede the opinion of the california supreme court in neary regents of the university of california cal th,d,neary.muccianti willow creek care center th,d.neary stood for the proposition that when the parties to an action agree to settle the their dispute and as part of their settlement stipulate to a reversal of the trial court judgment,the court of appeal should grant their request for the stipulated reversal absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances that warrant an exception to this general rule.neary,at,d.the neary rule amounted to a presumption that motions for stipulated reversal should ordinarily be granted.the amendment reverses neary presumption in favor of accepting stipulated reversals and instead creates a presumption against stipulated reversals.martin shatz,reverse course ccp section a has succeeded in reversing the presumption in favor of stipulated reversals lawyer.
in effect,the legislature adopted justice kennard dissent in neary,and the statute tracks some of the language of her opinion.fearing that stipulated reversal undermines judicial efficiency by encouraging parties to try cases rather than settle them,and erodes public confidence in the judiciary by fostering the perception that litigants having sufficient wealth may buy their way out of the ordinary collateral consequences of public adjudications,justice kennard took the position that appellate courts should deny requests for stipulated reversal if there is a reasonable possibility that the interests of nonparties or the public could be adversely affected by reversal.if there is no reasonable possibility of adverse impact on third parties or the public,then the court should weigh the parties reasons for requesting stipulated reversal against the other institutional concerns,she emphasized the erosion of public trust likely to result from an appearance that the nullification of a judgment can be purchased,and the risk that the availability of stipulated reversal will reduce the incentive for pretrial settlements.neary,supra,cal th at,d,dis.opn.of kennard.the approach described by justice kennard is the one now mandated by the legislature.the judicial inquiry is no longer whether extraordinary circumstances warrant denial of a request for stipulated reversal,an enterprise not likely to receive much enthusiastic assistance from the parties,but whether the parties have satisfactorily demonstrated that reversal would not adversely affect the interests of nonparties or the public,erode the public trust,or reduce the incentive for pretrial settlement.
legislative elimination of the strong presumption in favor of stipulated reversal created a problem the neary court sought to avoid.as justice baxter stated in his opinion for the neary majority,a presumption in favor of stipulated reversal to effectuate settlement,rather than a presumption against the procedure,is also more efficient in terms of the resources required of an appellate court.under a negative presumption,the parties would have the burden of showing that their stipulation should be granted because no countervailing factors are present,a contrary public interest.presumably they would have to meet this burden by submitting memoranda of points and authorities and supporting declarations and documentary evidence.trying to prove a negative,that there is no reason why the reversal should not be granted,is,of course,difficult.moreover,the appellate court would have to fully consider these materials.this is largely unnecessary.under a presumption in favor of granting the parties request for reversal,the court need not expend significant resources unless a nonparty comes forward and objects to the settlement for some reason or unless some problem is apparent in the record.neary,supra,cal th at,d.
the burdens on parties and appellate courts neary sought to avoid,or at least minimize,are inescapable under the regime created by the new statute.the parties must now submit memoranda of points and authorities and declarations and other documentary evidence persuasively demonstrating that reversal of the judgment in question will not adversely affect nonparties or the public,erode public trust,or reduce the incentive for pretrial settlement,and the courts must now fully consider and weigh these factors on a basis.muccianti willow creek care center,supra,th,d union bank of california braille inst.of america,th,d union bank.
moreover,the amendment compounds a problem unrelated to the nature of the presumption that neary overlooked.j oint requests for stipulated reversal do not arise in the adversarial context american courts take for granted.they are by nature collaborative.norman krug real estate investments,praszker th,d conc.opn.of kline,citing barnett,making decisions disappear depublication and stipulated reversal in the california supreme court loyola.as commentators have observed,a,procedural regime such as that applicable to motions for stipulated reversal allows the parties to a dispute to conspire against the interests of unrepresented future parties and the judicial system.zeller,avoiding issue preclusion by settlement conditioned upon the vacatur of entered judgments yale.absent the adaptation of some forms of continental procedure in which the court and its staff rather than the litigants develop information,judges are to do much other than nod when the litigants join together and seek court approval.resnik,judging consent.legal.
prudent rulings on motions for stipulated reversal have always required information that is usually not in the record or readily apparent.see witkin,cal procedure,supra,appeal.the parties ordinarily possess or can obtain such information,but if the information would justify denial of their request for reversal they may not be motivated to seek it or,if they have the information,to disclose it.in,shortly after neary was decided,this appellate district addressed the problem by promulgating local rule,which was designed to call the attention of counsel to the nature of the disclosure required of parties seeking stipulated reversal.as amended in to call attention to the findings required by the amendment to section,the rule states a motion filed in this court for stipulated reversal of a judgment of a trial court must include a joint declaration of counsel that describes the parties and the factual and legal issues presented at trial indicates whether the judgment involves important public rights or unfair,illegal or corrupt practices,or torts affecting a significant number of persons,or otherwise affects the public or a significant number of persons not parties to the litigation if the judgment is against a state licensee,the declaration must also disclose whether it exposes such person to any possible disciplinary proceeding and discloses whether the judgment sought to be reversed may have collateral estoppel or other effects in potential future litigation and,if so,whether any third parties who might be prejudiced by stipulated reversal of the judgment have received notice of the motion therefor.a copy of the judgment must accompany the motion.the parties must provide a sufficient showing to support the findings required by code of civil procedure section,subdivision a,as amended effective,first,local rules,rule,motions for stipulated reversal of judgment.as recently noted in estate of regli th,d,motions for stipulated reversal may be denied for failure to comply with local rule.regli,at,fn,d.
local rule does no more than make explicit a requirement implicit in subdivision a of section the duty of counsel for parties to a joint motion for stipulated reversal to affirmatively demonstrate a basis for each of the three findings required to be made by the statute.the absence of a reasonable possibility that the interests of nonparties or the public will be adversely affected by stipulated reversal can not be demonstrated without a complete description of the legal claims advanced at trial,the rulings on those claims,and the practical consequences of those rulings,if any,for nonparties or the public.the reasons the parties request reversal can not be shown to outweigh the erosion of public trust that may result from the nullification of a judgment unless the reasons are fully revealed.finally,the risk that the availability of stipulated reversal will reduce the incentive for pretrial settlement can not be discounted unless it is shown that the parties seriously pursued settlement prior to trial or that the delay in seeking or reaching settlement is explained by a posttrial development that could not reasonably have been anticipated prior to trial.
it is unclear whether the parties were aware of local rule,but they clearly have not complied with it nor otherwise made the showings required by the statute.
to begin with,the page and a half declaration,which consists of little more than an abbreviated description of the procedural history of this case,is not the joint declaration of counsel contemplated by our rule,but the declaration only of counsel for hinton it is accompanied by a stipulation to vacate the judgment as part of a settlement of this action that is executed by counsel for all parties.nor is the declaration accompanied by a copy of the judgment we are asked to vacate,as also required by local rule.indeed,although the motion and declaration of counsel repeatedly refer to the judge cram findings and judgment,nowhere in either document is there any description of the nature and substance of her findings.we have that information only because the findings and judgment are the subject of the appeal and and were therefore required to be attached to the civil case information statements the parties
