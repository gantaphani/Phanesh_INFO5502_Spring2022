pursuant to this court local rule,it is hereby ordered,adjudged,and decreed that the findings and recommendations of this court committee on admissions and grievances the committee are adopted,except as discussed below,and oleh tustaniwsky is publicly reprimanded,and suspended from practice before this court for one year,for engaging in misconduct in this court.
summary of proceedings 
we referred tustaniwsky to the committee for investigation of his conduct in this court and preparation of a report on whether he should be subject to disciplinary or other corrective measures.during the committee proceedings,tustaniwsky had the opportunity to address the matters discussed in our referral order and to testify under oath at hearings held before committee members eileen blackwood,evan davis,michael patrick,and gerald walpin.thereafter,the committee filed with the court the record of the committee proceedings and its report and recommendations,as well as the concurring report of committee member walpin.tustaniwsky responded to the committee reports.
a.the committee findings and recommendations 
the committee found clear and convincing evidence that tustaniwsky had engaged in misconduct warranting the imposition of discipline.specifically,the committee found that tustaniwsky had defaulted on scheduling orders in cases,with ten of those defaults resulting in orders requiring him to show cause why the cases should not be dismissed based on his defaults filed substantively deficient briefs in five cases knowingly filed meritless pleadings and prejudiced at least two clients whose cases were dismissed as a result of his defaults,and exposed other clients to potential prejudice through his pattern of defaulting on scheduling orders.see committee report at concurring report at.
the committee also found several aggravating factors a lack of remorse,no more than a grudging acknowledgment of wrongdoing,a hostile and disdainful attitude toward the committee,a pattern of misconduct,and a lack of candor about his failure to respond to certain court orders.see committee report at,and.it found one mitigating factor some of tustaniwsky misconduct resulted from instructions he received from his employers.see id.at.the committee recommended that tustaniwsky be suspended from practice before this court for one year,and that,as a condition of readmission,he be required to complete at least six hours of continuing legal education cle in appellate immigration law and four hours of cle in professional ethics.id.at 
tustaniwsky response 
in his response to the committee report,tustaniwsky,inter alia,acknowledged his mistakes and transgressions in failing to comply with deadlines,stated that he had endeavored to only present viable issues to this court and to represent his clients to the best of his ability,and conceded that he had used poor judgment in filing untimely petitions for review in two cases.see response at.he asserted,however,that the clients in those two cases were not prejudiced because it was only after the deadline had passed that he was asked to file the late petitions,and he described the measures he has taken to prevent future misconduct.see id.at.tustaniwsky did not explicitly challenge the committee recommended suspension,but asked this court to c onsider its discipline in the context of all the cases in which he has represented a client before this court and take into account the measures he has taken not to repeat the mistakes and transgressions in question.id.at.
ii.discussion 
we give particular deference to the factual findings of the committee members who presided over an attorney disciplinary hearing where those findings are based on credibility determinations,and somewhat lesser deference to credibility findings based on an analysis of a witness testimony.see in re payne,cir.upon due consideration of the committee majority and concurring reports,the underlying record,and tustaniwsky response,we adopt the findings and recommendations that were agreed upon by the majority and concurring committee members.we limit our discussion to the major points of disagreement among the committee members and to the deficient briefing issue.
possible misrepresentation to court and committee 
the concurring committee member recommended that the court find that tustaniwsky knowingly misrepresented his reason for requesting an extension of time in chen mukasey,while the committee majority found tustaniwsky proffered reason to be plausible and likely not pretextual.we conclude that the totality of the evidence supports the committee majority findings on this point.
tustaniwsky request for an extension in chen was based on his asserted inability to obtain a complete transcript of an immigration court proceeding.in concluding that tustaniwsky asserted basis for the extension request was not credible,the concurring committee member argued that a diligent,proactive attorney would have pursued various remedies to obtain the missing portions of that transcript and,in any event,would have determined that the transcript was not necessary for the issues he wished to present in this court.however,in their discussion of tustaniwsky conduct in many other cases in this court,the majority and concurring committee members made clear that tustaniwsky often was not diligent or proactive,leading us to conclude that,in chen,it is just as likely that tustaniwsky did believe,based on a superficial review of the case,that the incomplete transcript provided a legitimate basis for an extension of time.under the circumstances,we accept the committee majority finding that there was insufficient evidence that tustaniwsky had made an intentional misrepresentation to the court and committee.
defaults resulting from client failure to pay attorney fees 
we agree with the concurring committee member that tustaniwsky improperly permitted cases to be defaulted based on the clients failure to pay attorney fees.in situations where an attorney does not wish to proceed with a case due to of fees or any other issue with a client,the attorney may,inter alia,request leave to withdraw from the case,or request a stay of proceedings pending resolution of the issue.see,aba,model rules of professional conduct,rules b,c,d permitting a lawyer to withdraw from representation if the client fails substantially to fulfill an obligation to the lawyer regarding the lawyer services,provided the lawyer complies with the tribunal rules and take s steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect the client interests.
but deliberately failing to take required action because of of legal fees,thereby permitting the client petition to be dismissed,or put into default,is unacceptable.bennett mukasey,cir newman,accord in re meenan,dep t holding that attorney violated disciplinary rule by stopping work on client case due to nonpayment of legal fees without seeking the tribunal leave to withdraw from the representation.this rule applies even if the attorney does not use the possibility of dismissal,default,or other prejudice to the client case as leverage to obtain payment.
however,tustaniwsky culpability for this misconduct is somewhat mitigated,to the extent he engaged in the misconduct only because instructed to do so by his employer.see in re hemlock,dep t finding,in mitigation,that junior partner only acted as an amanuensis under the direction of a senior partner who set firm policy,established fees,and directed the other attorneys in their work.but any such mitigation is minimal in the present case,even if tustaniwsky reasonably believed that he would be fired if he failed to comply with his employer instructions.see new york rule of professional conduct a a lawyer is bound by these rules notwithstanding that the lawyer acted at the direction of another person rule effective as of april,new york code of professional responsibility,disciplinary rule e essentially identical rule in effect prior to april.there is no indication that tustaniwsky,for example,discussed the ethics issue with his employer,resisted his employer instructions in any way,attempted to mitigate the effect of those instructions,sought advice fr
