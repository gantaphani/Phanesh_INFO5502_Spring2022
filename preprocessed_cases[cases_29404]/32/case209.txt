derivi construction architecture,linda derivi,and steve castellanos collectively dca appeal from denial of their motion to disqualify attorney peter whipple and his law firm on the basis that whipple is married to an attorney at another law firm that had previously been disqualified in this law suit.dca contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion by failing to consider circumstantial evidence and by following unpersuasive dicta in dch health services waite th,d.dca theory of disqualification goes beyond precedent in two regards.first,it bases the disqualification solely on a marital relationship and,second,it requires double imputation of confidential knowledge for vicarious disqualification.we decline to adopt this expanded theory of disqualification and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
dca was hired by phillip wong to design and build a restaurant.dca brought suit against phillip wong,his wife wendy kurihara wong and related entities collectively the wongs for breach of contract and foreclosure of mechanic lien to recover the value of labor,services,equipment and materials furnished by dca.the wongs filed a against dca for breach of contract and professional negligence.the wongs were represented by the law firm herum crabtree brown.
dca moved to disqualify the herum crabtree brown law firm.dca contended that herum crabtree brown was disqualified from representing the wongs in this dispute because james brown,an attorney at herum crabtree brown,had previously represented linda derivi,steve castellanos,and derivi castellanos architects,derivi construction architecture predecessor,in two lawsuits.
in opposing the motion to disqualify,brown declared that he had represented derivi and castellanos,but had not received any confidential financial information from them and any business or litigation information he received could not possibly be relevant over years later.he further declared that he had no involvement in the present case and had not discussed it with other members of the firm other than to consider the potential conflict of interest.the two attorneys at herum crabtree brown handling the case,steven crabtree and jennifer doherty,declared they had not discussed any substantive aspects of brown prior representation of derivi and castellanos with brown.
the trial court denied the motion to disqualify,finding dca failed to establish a substantial relationship between the former and current cases.
derivi petitioned for a writ of mandate in this court.this court issued an alternative writ of mandate directing the trial court to vacate its order denying the motion to disqualify the law firm of herum crabtree brown and to enter a new order granting the motion or to inform this court that it has declined to do so.the trial court vacated its original order and entered a new order granting the motion to disqualify.
the wongs substituted peter whipple and mayall,hurley,knutsen,smith green as attorneys for herum crabtree brown.whipple is married to jennifer doherty.doherty is an attorney with herum crabtree brown she had been handling the representation of the wongs.
derivi moved to disqualify whipple and mayall,hurley,knutsen,smith green from representing the wongs.derivi argued that because whipple was married to doherty,the substitution of whipple for herum crabtree brown was illusory and circumvented the intent of this court alternative writ.derivi further argued that whipple law firm was also disqualified.
in opposition to the motion to disqualify,whipple declared that no confidential information pertaining to dca had been transmitted to him by doherty or any other member of herum crabtree brown and he had not seen or reviewed their file.

discussion 
rule e of the rules of professional conduct of the state bar of california provides a member shall not,without the informed consent of the client or former client,accept employment adverse to the client or former client where,by reason of the representation of the client or former client,the member has obtained confidential information material to the employment.where the potential conflict is one that arises from the successive representation of clients with potentially adverse interests,the courts have recognized that the chief fiduciary value jeopardized is that of client confidentiality.flatt superior court cal th,d.
while a former client may seek to disqualify a former attorney from representing an adverse party by showing that the former attorney possesses confidential information adverse to the former client,a showing of actual possession of confidential information is not necessary.ahmanson salomon brothers,d.instead,courts rely on the substantial relationship test when a substantial relationship has been shown to exist between the former representation and the current representation,and when it appears by virtue of the nature of the former representation or the relationship of the attorney to his former client confidential information material to the current dispute would normally have been imparted to the attorney or to subordinates for whose legal work he was responsible,the attorney knowledge of confidential information is presumed.citation.rosenfeld construction superior court d.this rule is necessary because the former client does not have the power to prove what is in the mind of the former attorney.ibid.in applying the substantial relationship test,courts should focus on the similarities between the two factual situations,the legal questions posed,and the nature and extent of the attorney involvement with the cases.ahmanson salomon brothers,supra,d at.
the substantial relationship test mediates between two interests that are in tension in such a freedom of the subsequent client to counsel of choice,on the one hand,and the interest of the former client in ensuring the permanent confidentiality of matters disclosed to the attorney in the course of the prior representation,on the other.flatt superior court,supra,cal th,d.additionally,courts increasingly recognize that motions to disqualify counsel may be misused to harass,delay litigation,or force a settlement.gregori bank of america d.
under the imputed knowledge theory,knowledge by any member of a law firm is imputed to all attorneys in the firm,whether partners or associates.rosenfeld construction superior court,supra,d.disqualification of an attorney extends vicariously to the entire firm.flatt superior court,supra,cal th at,d.

dca contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying the disqualification motion.dca contends the trial court erred in failing to consider circumstantial evidence that whipple may receive confidential information.dca argues it presented more evidence on this point than simply whipple marriage to doherty.first,herum crabtree brown had performed considerable work for the wongs and the wongs had invested considerable money,strongly suggesting the herum crabtree brown work product would be shared with whipple although whipple declared to the contrary.second,whipple failed to disclose his relationship to doherty and herum crabtree brown,which betrayed a guilty conscience.finally,although the litigation was complex,whipple immediately noticed the depositions of derivi and castellanos upon substituting in as counsel.
speculative contentions of conflict of interest can not justify disqualification of counsel.castro los angeles
