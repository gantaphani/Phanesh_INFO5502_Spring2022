andres aranda,who was admitted to the new york state bar in and to this court bar in,was ordered to show cause why disciplinary or other corrective measures should not be imposed on him,based primarily on his numerous defaults in several appeals in this court.for the reasons stated below,we publicly reprimand aranda and suspend him from practice before this court for eighteen months,both for his misconduct in those appeals and for his failure to properly respond to our order to show cause.
defaults in this court 
aranda defaults are described in detail in the order to show cause,which will be reissued this date as a public decision.that order required aranda to provide,inter alia,an explanation for all of the described conduct.we find his response inadequate for a number of reasons.
united states thompson manigault,l 
aranda represented anthony manigault in his direct appeal from a criminal judgment sentencing him to,inter alia,months imprisonment.aranda defaulted on a number of occasions in the appeal he failed to pay the filing fee or file numerous required documents,including his brief,by the deadlines mandated by this court rules and orders.the appeal was eventually dismissed based on aranda defaults.luckily for aranda client,however,the appeal was later reinstated and,upon the government motion,the case was remanded to the district court and the client was resentenced to months imprisonment.
in his response to our order to show cause,aranda acknowledged only that he had failed to timely pay the filing fee and failed to timely file a court form.he attributed those defaults to his inexperience and unfamiliarity with the filing procedures of this court.response.he also stated that his conduct did not prejudice his client.id.
aranda explanation for his conduct in thompson is deficient for several reasons.first,he did not mention the numerous other defaults noted in our order to show cause,which extended far beyond the filing fee and a single form.second,aranda proffered reason for the defaults,his unfamiliarity with this court filing procedures,does not explain why he failed to comply with court orders that identified his defaults and instructed him to cure the defaults by specified deadlines.nor does his proffered reason explain why multiple telephone calls from the court were required before he cured some of his defaults.
third,aranda discussion of the prejudice faced by his client in thompson focused solely on the end result the resentencing to a shorter term of imprisonment without mentioning aranda own responsibility for the dismissal of the appeal,or the risk to his client that his defaults could have foreclosed the sentence reduction.see in re demell,cir a reasonable attorney with thirty years experience clearly would know that defaulting on a client case leaves open the possibility of severe prejudice.
we also note that,even if aranda defaults in thompson and in the cases discussed below caused little or no prejudice to his clients,he nonetheless caused prejudice of a different type he wasted the time of opposing counsel,court employees,and judges delayed the processing of other litigants cases and caused unnecessary expense to the public.in re gordon,cir.
united states vallejo,
aranda represented gaspar vallejo in his direct appeal from a criminal judgment sentencing him to,inter alia,months imprisonment.as noted in our order to show cause,aranda default nearly caused the dismissal of the appeal,which was avoided only through several telephone calls from this court regarding his default.aranda response to the order to show cause did not mention the default,the threatened dismissal,or the telephone calls,but instead discussed only his reasons for later moving to withdraw from the case.see response.
aranda response also did not address the risk of serious prejudice to his client posed by his default specifically,the substantial risk that the appeal could have been dismissed.see gordon,at despite the court forbearance in those situations,dismissal of the appeals based on gordon defaults was a distinct possibility particularly where there had been a pattern of defaults and,therefore,he exposed his clients to potentially serious prejudice.
united states gabriel,and 
aranda represented leonardo gabriel in two appeals from a criminal judgment sentencing gabriel to,inter alia,months imprisonment.both appeals were dismissed based on aranda defaults.although both were later reinstated,aranda defaulted on a number of other occasions and incorrectly informed the court that district court transcripts were not yet available.in his response to our order to show cause,aranda stated that he had never intended to neglect gabriel appeals and that his secretary had been told that the district court transcripts were not ready each time she inquired.see response.he did not otherwise discuss the many defaults noted in our order or the dismissal of the two appeals.
united states guerrero delgado,
aranda represented hector delgado in an appeal from a criminal judgment sentencing delgado to,inter alia,months imprisonment.we ordered aranda to explain his defaults in that appeal,although the defaults were not individually identified in our order to show cause.in his response,aranda stated simply that there is nothing in the record to show that his work in that matter was deficient or in violation of any courts sic rules and procedures.response.
to the contrary,the public docket for guerrero clearly reflects that aranda defaulted on several occasions.specifically,the docket includes three separate orders of this court stating that aranda had failed to file two required forms and his brief two of those orders threatened dismissal of the appeal if the defaults were not cured.see guerrero,docs.other orders noted that aranda had filed defective documents,see,docs,and that he had failed to cure one of the defective documents despite having been given notice,see,doc.each of the court orders identified the rules that had been violated.thus,contrary to aranda conclusory assertion,the record does reflect that his performance in guerrero was deficient and that he violated a number of the court rules.
united states batista,
aranda represented marco batista in his appeal from a criminal judgment sentencing him to,inter alia,months imprisonment.the docket for that appeal reflects the following aranda defaulted on several occasions,including by failing to file a brief the court informed him that the appeal would be dismissed if the brief was not timely filed he filed a defective motion to be relieved he failed to cure that defective motion despite repeated requests from the court and he was sua sponte relieved when it became apparent that he would not comply with the court instructions.batista,proceeding pro se,later informed the court that he was having difficulty preparing his brief due to,inter alia,aranda failure to provide requested documents.see batista,doc.at doc.at.the appeal ultimately was dismissed,based on batista failure to file his brief,docs.
in his response to our order to show cause,aranda described the factual basis for batista conviction and various district court proceedings that are irrelevant to the present matter,stated that he had been fired by batista family,and summarily asserted that batista was not prejudiced.response.aranda did not address any of the conduct described in the preceding paragraph,or explain why batista was not prejudiced by that conduct.
united states espinal,
aranda represented guidri espinal in his appeal from a criminal judgment sentencing him to,inter alia,months imprisonment.aranda failed to file a required form,despite being reminded to do so by the court,and failed to file a brief,resulting in the dismissal of the appeal.in his response to our order to show cause,aranda stated only that the appeal was not pursued because espinal had been sentenced to the lowest sentence he could have received within the stipulated sentencing guidelines range in his plea agreement,and that espinal was not prejudiced since he received a guidelines sentence.response.
aranda did not state whether espinal had consented to the abandonment of the appeal.however,even if espinal did consent,an appellant counsel of record who determines that the appeal will not proceed for any reason is required to inform the court of the situation and seek to either withdraw the appeal or withdraw as counsel.in re yan,app x,cir.c ounsel may not end the representation of a client without taking affirmative action,or permit the termination of an appeal by allowing its dismissal for lack of prosecution.in re payne,cir see also second circuit local rule a d setting forth procedures for attorney withdrawal from a criminal appeal 
ii.misconduct in district court 
our order to show cause also directed aranda to explain his conduct in two district court cases,in which the presiding judges found his performance deficient in various respects.
as a preliminary matter,we observe that attorney misconduct in a district court is subject to the disciplinary authority of the judges of that court.this court does not police the behavior of attorneys in the district courts.
nonetheless,an attorney conduct in district court may be the subject of proceedings in this court in limited circumstances for example a in an appeal from a district court disciplinary order,see second circuit local rule b in a reciprocal disciplinary proceeding,in which this court determines whether to impose reciprocal discipline based on a district court suspension or disbarment order,see second circuit local rule c or c in a disciplinary proceeding concerning misconduct in this court,where district court conduct is relevant to whether there is a pattern of misconduct or,more generally,to whether the attorney will be unable to conform his future conduct in this court to expected professional norms,in re jaffe,cir in the present disciplinary proceeding,aranda district court conduct is relevant because,when viewed in the context of the conduct described in our order to show cause,it supports the conclusions that his misconduct in this court is part of a wider pattern of misconduct,and that he may be unable to conform to expected professional norms in future appeals in this court.
united states sanchez,cr 
aranda represented patricio sanchez in his criminal prosecution,which concluded with sanchez pleading guilty and being sentenced to,inter alia,months imprisonment.in proceedings,the district court determined that aranda had deprived sanchez of effective assistance of counsel by failing to pursue a direct appeal,contrary to sanchez instructions.see sanchez united states,cr,cv,wl,at.
the district court also denied aranda motion to withdraw from the appeal explaining that the motion was not properly addressed to that court and stated that aranda was required to proceed with the appeal until relieved by this court.see id.the district court specified that,until this court relieved aranda of his duties,those duties include filing an appeal on sanchez behalf and submitting an anders brief if aranda believes the appeal is frivolous.id.despite these directives,there is no indication aranda has attempted to proceed with the appeal.
in his response to our order to show cause,aranda asserted,inter alia,that sanchez did not pay him for an appeal aranda could not proceed with an appeal due to a conflict of interest he had requested that this court relieve him from representing sanchez on appeal,but has not yet received a ruling sanchez was not prejudiced,because he was sentenced within the range set forth in his plea agreement and this court has ruled on his appeal.response.aranda assertions are both factually and legally flawed.
first,an attorney representing a criminal defendant who is instructed by his client to file a notice of appeal must do so,even if the client waived the right to appeal in a plea agreement.see campusano united states,cir.aranda has never claimed that sanchez did not instruct him to file an appeal in fact,as discussed below,aranda did attempt to file a notice of appeal 
second,after the defendant notice of appeal is filed,the defendant attorney is required to proceed with the appeal until explicitly relieved of the representation by this court.see second circuit local rule a when a defendant in a criminal case seeks to appeal,defendant counsel,whether retained or appointed,is responsible for representing the defendant unless relieved by this court.see also payne,at c ounsel may not end the representation of a client without taking affirmative action.thus,an attorney who has not been paid for the appeal,or who believes that the appeal would be frivolous,or who has a conflict of interest with his client,must nonetheless continue with the appeal until a proper motion to withdraw has been granted by this court 
third,there is no record of aranda moving in this court to withdraw as counsel in fact,there is no record of any appeal having been commenced on behalf of sanchez.the reason is simple aranda filed a notice of appeal that was found defective by the district court clerk office.see sanchez,cr,docket entries notice of appeal,with docket notations that the filing was defective.there is no indication that aranda attempted to cure that defect and,as a result,the matter was never transferred to this court 
the february,motion to withdraw that aranda claims he filed in this court appears to have actually been filed in district court.a motion matching that description was filed in district court on february,see,docket entry ecf,and,as noted above,was denied by the district court as having been filed in the wrong court,see sanchez,wl,at.although the district court made clear that the motion needed to be filed in this court,there is no indication that aranda ever investigated the status of the appeal.see in re demarco,cir although counsel of record need not constantly monitor the court docket,counsel can not allow lengthy periods of time to pass without periodic review.
aranda conclusory assertion that this court has ruled on sanchez appeal is baffling the exhibit he cited in support of this assertion is merely a copy of sanchez plea agreement.see response,exh.
finally,we reject aranda contention that,because sanchez received a sentence consistent with his plea agreement,he was not prejudiced by aranda misconduct.although the full extent of prejudice suffered by sanchez can not be determined without examining the issues he would have presented on appeal,the loss of the appeal itself constituted significant prejudice.
in the context of an attorney who had failed to pursue an appeal from a deportation order,we stated that 
the dismissal of a case on default without the client consent,even if the case appears to lack merit,causes prejudice by depriving the client of review by a panel of article iii judges.litigants who face deportation,incarceration,or simply a financial loss if they lose on appeal are likely to derive at least some satisfaction,consolation,or sense of finality from knowing that the loss on appeal resulted from the reasoned decision of three judges rather than from their attorneys default.
in re fengling liu,cir.
however,the concept of prejudice in the context of a criminal appeal is more fully developed in decisions discussing the sixth amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.those decisions make clear that prejudice is presumed when a criminal defendant instructs his attorney to pursue a direct appeal from the judgment of conviction and the attorney fails to do so.see campusano,at.while that understanding of prejudice does not bear directly on an attorney disciplinary proceeding,the rationale for the presumption of prejudice is relevant.the supreme court has described the prejudice that results from an attorney failure to appeal as follows 
according to respondent,counsel deficient performance deprived him of a notice of appeal and,hence,an appeal altogether.assuming those allegations are true,counsel deficient performance has deprived respondent of more than a fair judicial proceeding that deficiency deprived respondent of the appellate proceeding altogether.in cronic,penson,and robbins,we held that the complete denial of counsel during a critical stage of a judicial proceeding mandates a presumption of prejudice because the adversary process itself has been rendered presumptively unreliable.cronic,at.the even more serious denial of the entire judicial proceeding itself,which a defendant wanted at the time and to which he had a right,similarly demands a presumption of prejudice.put simply,we can not accord any presumption of reliability,robbins,at,to judicial proceedings that never took place.
roe flores ortega.
the prejudice calculus is not significantly altered by the fact that the defendant signed a plea agreement containing an appeal waiver.in that scenario,this court has observed the following 
t he presumption of prejudice in cases is not a matter of formalistic compliance with a technical rule merely postponing the inevitable denial of relief on the merits.rather,it serves to safeguard important interests with concrete and potentially dispositive consequences which can be guaranteed only by the process and the concomitant right to counsel.united states garrett,cir internal citation,alteration and quotation marks omitted.an anders brief at least makes available to the defendant the best possible arguments supporting his appeal or the reasons why counsel believes no such arguments exist.see anders california.thus,if the defendant chooses to proceed pro se,he or she will do so with as much advice and assistance as his or her attorney can ethically provide.when an anders brief is filed and a court reviews the appeal to determine whether it raises issues,the defendant is afforded first an opportunity to appeal with the benefit of counsel and then an opportunity to demonstrate to the court the existence of issues after counsel has withdrawn.these are not trivial opportunities.
campusano,at.
for the reasons discussed in flores ortega,campusano,and fengling liu,we conclude that sanchez suffered substantial prejudice from the loss of his appeal even if he received a sentence consistent with his plea agreement.
morillo city of new york,cv 
aranda represented ramon morillo in a civil action against the city of new york and several of its police officers.the district court dismissed the action in a decision that criticized aranda performance in several respects.see morillo city of new york,cv,wl.although our order to show cause directed aranda to explain his conduct in morillo,he responded that he does not feel competent to comment on that case because his former partner has possession of the relevant files he also suggested that the former partner may have been responsible for the case since it was their firm practice to have that partner do all paper work and make most appearances in federal court.response i.
the docket for morillo lists aranda as the sole counsel of record for the plaintiff,and the october district court decision discussed him by name.
aranda did not state whether he had made any attempt to access the files for morillo for purposes of responding to our order,and he did not request this court aid in obtaining them.an attorney responding to disciplinary charges must make reasonable efforts to review all relevant records and other evidence if relevant evidence is not accessible,the attorney must detail his or her efforts to obtain it and,if appropriate,request a subpoena or other help from this court.see,second circuit local rule b f i permitting attorney in proceeding before this court committee on admissions and grievances to request a subpoena from the court for,inter alia,the production of relevant documents or other evidence in the possession of third parties.
for present purposes,however,we will not require aranda to supplement his response concerning morillo,because we do not foresee any supplementation altering the disposition of this matter.we reach no conclusions concerning aranda conduct in that case.
iii.prior disciplinary history 
our order to show cause also required aranda to provide a complete description of his disciplinary history,copies of all prior orders to show cause why he should not be disciplined,copies of all of his responses to those orders,and copies of all prior decisions imposing disciplinary measures.in his response,aranda discussed two instances when district court judges considered the possibility of sanctioning him,and one new york state disciplinary proceeding that resulted in a suspension.however,he neglected to mention three admonitions imposed by new york state disciplinary authorities,and he failed to provide any of the required documents aside from the decision imposing the suspension.
for present purposes,we rely on the suspension decision for a description of the three admonitions.see in re aranda,dep t.in,aranda was admonished for making misrepresentations to a court about his engagement in another matter and to the departmental disciplinary committee in,he was admonished for neglecting a criminal matter and,in,he was admonished for failing to appear in court.see id.at.
the suspension order was based on aranda neglect of several civil cases,which resulted in the loss of his clients claims,and his failure to file retainer statements.see id.at.the suspension was imposed despite the mitigating evidence presented by aranda,which included his testimony that he had reorganized his office by obtaining a new computer system and had reduced his caseload by percent.id.at.
iv.failure to properly respond to our order to show cause 
as discussed above,aranda has failed to explain,or even mention,much of the questionable conduct described in our order to show cause,contrary to the explicit instructions in that order.we treat that failure as aranda admission that he did,in fact,engage in that conduct and that he lacked any legitimate excuse for it.see american bar association aba,model rules for lawyer disciplinary enforcement,rule,amended failure to answer charges filed shall constitute an admission of the factual allegations.in re christensen,dep t h aving failed to answer the charges of the petition,the respondent is in default and the charges contained in the verified petition must be deemed established.in re anello,dep t inasmuch as the respondent has chosen not to appear or answer these proceedings,the charges must be deemed established.
aranda failure to properly respond also constitutes both an independent basis for disciplinary action and an aggravating factor.see in re warburgh,cir holding that attorney failure to respond to an order to show cause why he should not be disciplined,issued by this court committee on admissions and grievances,may be treated as both an independent basis for disciplinary action and an aggravating factor see also aba,standards for imposing lawyer sanctions e,amended in re padilla,finding that attorney obstructionism in disciplinary proceeding frustrated the diligent pursuit of serious charges against him,placed into question his fitness to represent others,and itself constituted conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.
in recent disciplinary decisions,we have held that an attorney obstruction of a disciplinary proceeding,by failing to respond to an order to show cause or by providing false testimony,was a significant aggravating factor.see warburgh,at gordon,at.the observations we made concerning those forms of obstruction apply as well to aranda failure to fully respond to the order to show cause in the present case.in warburgh,where the order to show cause was issued by this court committee on admissions and grievances,we stated the following 
an attorney default in disciplinary proceedings is a serious breach of the attorney professional obligations to the court and the public.in such a case,the attorney has not only failed to respond to a order,but has done so after the court already has found good cause to question the attorney very competence to continue practicing in this court.furthermore,such defaults often seriously handicap the committee and court in their efforts to reach a fair determination based on a complete record,and usually result in waste of committee and court resources.
warburgh,at.furthermore,as with the false testimony discussed in gordon,an attorney failure to address important aspects of an order to show cause in a disciplinary pr
