background 
kroll alleged misconduct 
michael kroll was and is a member of the bar of the state of new york and is also registered to practice as a patent attorney before the united states patent and trademark office pto.as described below,the grievance committee initiated disciplinary action against kroll in response to grievances filed by the following three clients regarding kroll patent prosecution practice on their behalf.
elly ildiko elias 
in approximately,elly ildiko elias conceived of the idea of making a love bed for dogs and puppies.as described in a letter she later wrote to her congressman,she contacted kroll through the yellow pages,and after putting faith and trust in his advertisement,paid him to obtain a patent claiming her invention.on august,kroll filed a patent application on her behalf,which,according to elias,disclosed that the love bed could be made of wood,with mattress,bed sheets,narrow pillow,with pillow cases,and that the love bed could come in different sizes,and would be a great gift idea.
approximately one year later,elias was looking through an bean catalogue,and saw a dog bed for sale,allegedly very similar to the one described in her patent application.when elias called kroll to report this possible act of infringement,he was not very nice,and he allegedly rebuffed her subsequent calls inquiring about the progress of her patent application,stating only that it will take a very long time.it was not until the summer of,when elias contacted another attorney to investigate the matter,that kroll disclosed to her that the pto actually had rejected her application in july.
upset over kroll failure to inform her promptly of the rejection,elias wrote a letter to her congressman,who forwarded the complaint to the grievance committee.the grievance committee informed kroll of the matter and dismissed the complaint,subject to kroll future compliance with his professional responsibilities.
charles strieber 
in january,charles strieber hired kroll to file a patent application on his behalf.for approximately,kroll prepared several dozen drawings,but never finalized the application.in april,strieber terminated kroll representation,and requested by phone an accounting of his payments and the return of his files.on august,strieber wrote kroll a letter signed,zombies for ever,charles strieber,repeating his request.on september,his request still unfulfilled,strieber filed a complaint with the grievance committee.
vincent davi 
on march,vincent davi gave kroll his credit card number and authorized a charge of to initiate a patent application.kroll charged to the card on march,an additional on march,and a further on march.after repeatedly calling kroll,insisting that he credit his account for the overcharges,davi closed his credit card account,initiated a fraud investigation,and filed a complaint with the grievance committee.
b.the district court litigation 
on june,kroll filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of new york,seeking a declaratory judgment that federal patent law preempts the grievance committee subject matter jurisdiction to consider the elias,strieber,and davi grievances.kroll asserts that b d and,which grant the pto the authority to regulate the practice of patent law before the pto,preempt the authority of the grievance committee to discipline him for conduct arising out of his patent prosecution practice kroll argues that his suit constitutes a civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents,and thus that the federal district court had jurisdiction,pursuant to a.
the grievance committee moved to dismiss pursuant to.b and b,and moved for summary judgment pursuant to.according to the district court,on may,the grievance committee dismissed davi and strieber allegations without qualification.as to kroll challenge to the elias grievance,the district court ruled that the conditional nature of the grievance committee dismissal of that complaint gave rise to a sufficient case or controversy to permit kroll to seek a declaratory judgment.the court stated,moreover,that resolution of the dispute would require judicial interpretation of a,b d,and,and thus that kroll had asserted a colorable federal claim arising under federal law sufficient to establish federal jurisdiction.the district court,reasoning that allowing the state to discipline a member of its own bar would not frustrate the objectives of the patent system,granted the grievance committee motion for summary judgment that federal patent law does not preempt the authority of the grievance committee to discipline kroll.
ii.discussion 
legal standard for dismissal of meritless claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction 
a court must dismiss a complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the alleged basis for exercising federal jurisdiction is so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit.hagans lavine,d.although the supreme court has cautioned against dismissing complaints for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when unstated questions of federal law may underlie a complainant cause of action,see id.at,in this case the sole basis for alleging federal preemption,and hence federal jurisdiction,is plainly evident from the complaint.
kroll asserts that the district court had jurisdiction to hear his declaratory judgment complaint pursuant to a,which grants federal district courts jurisdiction to adjudicate any civil action arising under any act of congress relating to patents.the supreme court has interpreted this provision to confer jurisdiction upon district courts when a complaint establishes either that federal patent law creates the cause of action or that the plaintiff right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal patent law,in that patent law is a necessary element of one of the claims.christianson colt indus.operating,d see also hunter douglas,harmonic design,overruled on other grounds by midwest,karavan trailers.
kroll preemption claim rests on b d and u,which authorize the pto to regulate the conduct of patent practitioners appearing before it,and to discipline them for related misconduct.the first of these statutes provides that the pto may establish regulations governing patent practitioners 
b the united states patent and trademark office 
may establish regulations,not inconsistent with law,which 
d may govern the recognition and conduct of agents,attorneys,or other persons representing applicants or other parties before the office,and may require them,before being recognized as representatives of applicants or other persons,to show that they are of good moral character and reputation and are possessed of the necessary qualifications to render to applicants or other persons valuable service,advice,and assistance in the presentation or prosecution of their applications or other business before the office.
