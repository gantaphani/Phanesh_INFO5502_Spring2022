this case has a lengthy,almost litigation history beginning when sued the city of fargo,north dakota and several police officers asserting that they were arrested in violation of their constitutional rights for alleged violation of fargo residential picketing ordinance.after extensive litigation before a magistrate judge in the district court and before panels of this court,obtained a judgment for damages against only the city of fargo in the sum of,plus attorney fees in excess of.the city appealed from the judgment,and this matter is now before the court en banc.we reverse and remand for entry of judgment of dismissal in favor of the city.
background 
the background and history of this litigation may be found in the panel opinion reversing the judgment after a rehearing by the panel.veneklase city of fargo,cir veneklase ii,vacated by order granting reh g en banc.as relevant,the opinion stated 
this case has an extensive,almost history.in fargo,north dakota,on october,at approximately,activists picketed the home of an abortion clinic administrator and one or two houses on either side of her home.the fargo police department received a complaint about the residential picketing.fargo police officers advised the picketers that their conduct violated fargo then applicable residential picketing ordinance.
fargo ordinance,enacted in,reads as follows 
purposes of this article,certain words and phrases used herein are defined as follows 
dwelling means any structure or building,or dwelling unit within a building,which is used as a place of residence.
picketing means the practice of standing,marching,or patrolling by one or more persons inside of,in front,or about any premises for the purpose of persuading an occupant of such premises or to protest some action,attitude or belief.
picketing of dwellings person shall engage in picketing the dwelling of any individual in the city of fargo.
after the picketers refused to leave the scene,the fargo police arrested the picketers and charged them with violating the ordinance.the fargo police transported the plaintiffs to the cass county jail and held them overnight.the fargo police detained plaintiff uchtman,a minor at the time of her arrest,for only a few hours and released her to the custody of her parents.fargo filed charges against plaintiffs veneklase,mehl,larson and emmel for violating the residential picketing ordinance.on february,cass county judge frank racek dismissed the charges against plaintiffs,deciding that the ordinance was constitutional on its face but unconstitutional as applied to the plaintiffs on october.
plaintiffs subsequently filed this action,pursuant to,against fargo,officer david todd,officer jim schalesky,lieutenant jon holman,and sergeant wayne jorgenson seeking redress for their arrest and incarceration.on february,a magistrate judge denied the individual police officers claim of qualified immunity.the district court concluded that the officers conduct was not objectively reasonable in light of clearly established law.the district court also concluded that fargo failed to train its officers properly and,as a result,was deliberately indifferent to the rights of the picketers and liable for damages as a matter of law.veneklase city of fargo.in addition,the district court concluded that the ordinance did not violate the constitution on its face because the ordinance constituted a valid regulation.id.at.fargo and the police officers appealed to this court from the interlocutory order.we reversed the denial of qualified immunity and held that the interlocutory appeal on the issue of municipal liability was not properly before the court.veneklase city of fargo,cir veneklase i.we then remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings against fargo.id.
on april,the district court determined that fargo was liable as a matter of law and again granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs.the district court concluded that the ordinance was unconstitutional as a restriction on free speech.the district court then referred the issue of damages to a jury for a trial.that trial,held in august,resulted in damages against fargo in favor of the five plaintiffs 
id.at footnotes omitted.
the panel considered the case twice.initially,it reversed in an opinion filed august.on the plaintiffs petition for rehearing,the panel vacated its initial opinion and granted a rehearing.it did so to give the plaintiffs an opportunity to address further the panel determination that the fargo ordinance passed the test of content neutrality.see veneklase ii,at,n.
as noted,the award of damages by the district court rested on its determination that the enforcement of the fargo ordinance in question violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights as a restriction of free speech.
the panel opinion rejected that ruling,determining that the fargo ordinance in question passed the test of content neutrality and was not facially unconstitutional,relying for its ruling on the united states supreme court case of frisby schultz,d.the panel also rejected other constitutional challenges to the arrests.
petitioned for a rehearing en banc,asserting error in the panel determination of content neutrality and disregard by the panel of an earlier eighth circuit decision relating to fargo amended residential picketing ordinance which maintained that similar,crucial language defining residential picketing was not content neutral.that earlier case cited by plaintiffs is kirkeby furness,cir kirkeby ii.
the petition for rehearing did not raise as a basis for en banc consideration the issue of the liability of the city of fargo for the unconstitutional enforcement of the ordinance.however,that ground exists in plaintiffs initial briefs as an alternate ground for affirmance by the court.
we granted a rehearing en banc on february,and heard oral argument on april.on september,the court vacated the submission in order to permit judge kermit bye to participate.judge bye joined the court on april,after the initial en banc submission.pursuant to the eighth circuit established procedures,an active judge joining the court after an en banc submission may participate in pending en banc cases.by an order dated september,the court vacated the prior en banc submission of april,directed resubmission to the en banc court without further oral argument and on the basis of the original and supplemental briefs.the order also requested additional simultaneous briefs by the parties on the following questions 
does the decision in hill colorado,d,have any bearing on the question of the invalidity,facial or,of the fargo ordinance at issue in this case.
whether the holding of frisby schultz,d,limits the ordinance scope of picketing in front of only one house,or w hether protestors may,consistent with the frisby holding,include houses adjacent to the targeted dwelling on the picketing route.see veneklase city of fargo,cir.
after careful review,we determine the plaintiffs claim of facial unconstitutionality of the ordinance must be rejected.the ordinance in question is content neutral,and not void for vagueness or overbreadth.further,based on the record of this case,applicable supreme court case law,the opinion of this court in the prior appeal veneklase i,at,and other eighth circuit precedents foreclose any affirmance on the alternative grounds argued by.
we essentially adopt the panel opinion in veneklase ii,and expand its reasoning in light of the recently decided case of hill colorado,d,by the united states supreme court.the judgment of the district court,granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment against the city and entering an order allowing damages and attorney fees and costs against the city,will therefore be reversed.
ii.discussion 
the essential facts were stated in veneklase i which we quote 
on the evening of october,plaintiffs engaged in a demonstration outside the administrator residence.they walked back and forth,in single file,on the sidewalk in front of the administrator home,but their route included approximately two to three houses on either side of the administrator residence.in addition,one protester remained in front of the administrator home at all times.plaintiffs remained silent and carried no signs.in response to a complaint,the defendant officers arrived and informed the demonstrators that their actions violated the ordinance.the officers thereafter arrested those persons who refused to leave plaintiffs in this action,with the exception of one protester,a minor.although plaintiffs were charged with violating the ordinance,these charges were later dismissed by the county court judge.
veneklase i,at footnote omitted,reh g en banc denied,cert.denied,d.
as a preliminary observation,we note that courts have traditionally subjected restrictions on public issue picketing to careful scrutiny.see,boos barry,d united states grace,d carey brown,d.picketing can include a wide variety of activities,including prayer.douglas brownell,cir.
ordinances represent a legislative choice regarding the promotion of particular societal interests.madsen women health,d.the ordinance before us restricts a manner of speech in residential streets,a traditional public forum.consequently,the ordinance is subject to the time,place,and manner test the restriction must be content and viewpoint neutral,leave open ample alternative channels of communication,and be narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.perry educ.ass perry local educators ass n,d.see also ward rock against racism,d the principal inquiry in determining content neutrality,in speech cases generally and in time,place,or manner cases in particular,is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.upholding noise regulations.
content neutrality 
with that background,we address the first issue,content neutrality.the plaintiffs and the city agree that the constitutionality of the ordinance is determined by the supreme court decisions in hill colorado,d and frisby schultz,d.
whatever justification initially existed for granting an en banc consideration and for affirming the district court on the ground that the ordinance is unconstitutionally no longer exists in light of hill colorado and this court recent decision in thorburn austin,cir.
in hill,a colorado statute made it unlawful in regulated areas of a health care facility to knowingly approach within eight feet of another person for the purpose of passing a leaflet or handbill to,displaying a sign to,or engaging in oral protest,education,or counseling with such other person hill.at.
the supreme court reaffirmed that government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral if it is justified without reference to the content of regulated speech.id.at.the statute in hill passed the test spelled out in ward,d 
the colorado statute passes that test for three independent reasons.first,it is not a regulation of speech.rather,it is a regulation of the places where some speech may occur.second,it was not adopted because of disagreement with the message it conveys.this conclusion is supported not just by the colorado courts interpretation of legislative history,but more importantly by the state supreme court unequivocal holding that the statute restrictions apply equally to all demonstrators,regardless of viewpoint,and the statutory language makes no reference to the content of the speech.third,the state interests in protecting access and privacy,and providing the police with clear guidelines,are unrelated to the content of the demonstrators speech.as we have repeatedly explained,government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral if it is justified without reference to the content of regulated speech.
hill.at footnote omitted.
like colorado statute in hill,fargo ordinance passes the test articulated in ward.first,the ordinance language,no person shall engage in picketing the dwelling of any individual emphasis added,regulates nothing other than the particular location of where one may picket.at.
second,the ordinance does not speak to which types of picketing are prohibited.rather,it bans all picketing.it therefore can not be said that the ordinance was adopted because of any disagreement with the message conveyed by the picketers.the preamble to the ordinance,evincing its purpose,references concerns about the protection and preservation of the home.at.it states that the public health and welfare require that citizens enjoy a feeling of and tranquillity while in their homes the practice of picketing before dwellings causes emotional disturbance and distress to the occupants.id.there is no indication anywhere in the record that the ordinance was adopted because of any disagreement with certain messages.
third,there is every indication that the city attempted to protect its citizens from unwanted speech,whatever the message,into their homes.the supreme court repeatedly has held that the government may protect an individual right to be free from unwanted speech in the home.see,frisby,at.carey brown,at.fcc pacifica,d rowan post office dep t,d kovacs cooper.in this case,the city interest of protecting the privacy of the home is unrelated to the content of the plaintiffs speech.thus,the ordinance here clearly passes the test of ward and hill.
turning again to the colorado statute,in addition to finding that it passed the ward test,the court specifically rejected a similar argument that the plaintiffs made here,one that the panel majority espoused in kirkeby ii,cir.in kirkeby ii,the panel held the definition of picketing contained in fargo residential picketing ordinance to be.the ordinance defined picketing as activity engaged in for the purpose of persuading the public or an occupant of such premises or to protest some action,attitude or belief.kirkeby ii,at.because it was impossible to tell whether a person was engaged in picketing without analyzing the message,the court reasoned that the limitation was not justified without reference to content.hill rejected that analysis.
according to the court opinion in hill,the necessity of looking at the content of a speaker message to determine whether it was protest,education,or counseling is no different from determining whether particular conduct constitutes picketing.see hill.at.picketing,by definition,excludes social,random,or other everyday communications,but the court has never suggested that the kind of cursory examination that might be required to exclude casual conversation from the coverage of a regulation of picketing would be problematic.id.
even justice kennedy,in his dissent,appears to agree that n o examination of the content of a speaker message is required to determine whether an individual is picketing,even though the provision relating to protest,education,or counseling is different,and,in justice kennedy view,runs afoul of content neutrality,even if picketing does not.id.at kennedy,dissenting.
we reject the argument that because an inquiry might be necessary to determine whether a person is picketing,the ordinance therefore is.as hill reasons,the cursory examination to determine if one is picketing does not make the law.id.at.further,a panel of this court in thorburn austin,cir,ruled that kirkeby ii,cir,could not be relied upon to establish that the language in the fargo ordinance for the purpose of persuading was content based,rather than content neutral.thorburn construed a somewhat similar ordinance prohibiting focused residential picketing in lincoln,nebraska 
the appellants rely on kirkeby furness,cir,where we held the definition of picketing contained in a residential picketing ordinance to be.the ordinance defined picketing as activity engaged in for the purpose of persuading the public or an occupant of such premises or to protest some action,attitude or belief.id.at.because it was impossible to tell whether a person is engaged in picketing without analyzing his message,we held that the limitation was not justified without reference to content.see id.hill rejected this sort of analysis.
according to the court opinion in hill,the necessity of looking at the content of a speaker message to determine whether it was protest,education,or counseling is no different from determining whether particular conduct constitutes picketing.see at.at.picketing,by definition,excludes social,random,or other everyday communications,but the court has never suggested that the kind of cursory examination that might be required to exclude casual conversation from the coverage of a regulation of picketing would be problematic.id.engaging in demonstrations and attempting to influence opinions are inherent in picketing.hill requires that we reject the appellants argument that casady definition of picketing makes the lincoln ordinance.
thorburn,at.
hill also relies on frisby as establishing the content neutrality of the colorado statute,emphasizing the contention that a statute is viewpoint based simply because its enactment was motivated by the conduct of the partisans on one side of a debate is without support.hill.at.
in sum,hill and frisby foreclose a conclusion that fargo ordinance is unconstitutional on its face for lack of content neutrality.the laws upheld in frisby and hill,and recently by this court in thorburn,while respecting free speech rights,recognize that in limited circumstances the specific target of that speech is entitled to some protection from being forced to listen.this ordinance clearly falls into that category.this issue of content neutrality was the only issue decided in favor of the plaintiffs.
having concluded the ordinance is,we must determine whether it is narrowly tailored to serve a significant government interest and whether it preserves ample alternative channels of communication.because the picketing prohibited by the ordinance is speech directed not to the general public but primarily at those who are presumptively unwilling to receive it,the city has a substantial and justifiable interest in banning it.the nature and scope of this interest make the ban narrowly tailored.the ordinance also leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.thus,we reverse the determination of the district court.
vagueness and overbreadth 
the prior panel opinion in this case also addressed and rejected other assertions of the ordinance facial unconstitutionality,specifically vagueness and overbreadth.in doing so,the panel relied on frisby and stated that the fargo ordinance adding the definitions of dwelling and picketing to the ordinance at issue in frisby did not make the ordinance overbroad or vague.veneklase ii,at hill.at noting that picket is defined to mean persuade or otherwise influence thorburn stating that p erhaps the ordinance could have been more exact,but the fact that questions may arise regarding its applicability to certain conduct does not automatically lead to the conclusion that it is void for vagueness,at.
the ordinance provides fair warning of the conduct that is prohibited.a person of ordinary intelligence can conclude that if he or she stands,marches,or patrols inside of,in front of,or about any dwelling of the person he or she intends to target,directing the picketing at that person,the picketer is subject to prosecution under the fargo ordinance.
furthermore,the fargo ordinance does not leave those who are enforcing it with unfettered discretion to determine whether a violation has occurred.as thorburn stated relative to a similar ordinance,p olice officers will have to use discretion to determine whether an activity is picketing and whether it is focused,but enforcement of all laws involves some discretion.thorburn,at.because there is no real risk of discriminatory enforcement and because the ordinance makes clear what conduct it prohibits,we hold that it is not unconstitutionally vague.
for us to find a statute unconstitutionally overbroad,its overbreadth must not only be real,but substantial as well,judged in relation to the statute plainly legitimate sweep.broadrick oklahoma,d.this court held recently that p rohibiting focused residential picketing is plainly legitimate.thorburn,at.here,an individual engaged in an activity that is directed at a specific occupant of a dwelling falls within the legitimate sweep of the ordinance.
hill also strongly supports the rejection of plaintiffs alternative theories of constitutional imperfection in the fargo ordinance.the court in hill determined that the colorado statute,significantly restrictive of speech,nevertheless was narrowly tailored,see hill.at,and that the statute was neither overbroad nor unconstitutionally vague.see id.at.
accordingly,no basis exists for affirmance on plaintiffs alternative constitutional theories.
c.other grounds for affirmance 
while the petition for rehearing did not raise the issue of an unconstitutional application of the ordinance,it was briefed in the plaintiffs initial brief and argued briefly to the en banc court.contend that the city should be responsible for any arrests made by police officers who,plaintiffs say,arrested them outside the parameters set out in frisby.in short,plaintiffs claim that they did not violate the ordinance and they maintain that the arrests occurred pursuant to city policy,and,thus,the ordinance was unconstitutionally applied to them.
in our view,the issues were previously decided against plaintiffs by the district court after remand from veneklase i and the contentions advanced on these issues do not justify an affirmance here on these alternative grounds.the argument fails because this court held in the first appeal,veneklase i,that the arrest of plaintiffs by the defendant officers was objectively reasonable in light of the legal rules in existence at the time the action occurred.veneklase i,at this ruling became the law of the case.
further,assuming,arguendo,that the arrests were unconstitutionally made,it would be necessary to show that the city had a a policy or custom directly authorizing conduct contravening federal and state constitutions and law or b deficient police training.see city of canton harris,d determining that municipality may be held liable only for constitutional violations which result from municipal policy or custom.however,the district court rejected any liability against the city on this ground.
regarding policy or custom,no evidence exists in the record that the city followed a custom of having its police officers arrest picketers who were not in violation of the law.the magistrate judge determined that the city did not have a policy or custom of unconstitutionally applying the ordinance.see veneklase.at.the magistrate judge did observe that the city police chief had admitted during discovery that the arresting police officers acted pursuant to existing policies and training,none of which specifically addressed the enforcement of the antipicketing ordinance or the implications of frisby.id.at.however,since admissions are not the equivalent of an affirmative decision,cast in the form of a policy statement,the district court concluded that municipal liability premised on a ratification theory does not flow from the city admissions.id.
regarding deficient police training,no liability can flow from the alleged failure to train the fargo police officers.this issue has been adequately laid to rest in the district court opinion in this case 
in light of the eighth circuit ruling veneklase i that the law regarding the parameters of the first amendment right to protest against abortion in a residential area was not clearly established at the time of plaintiffs arrest,the city failure to its train sic police officers could not serve as the moving force behind the violation of plaintiffs first amendment rights.since the parameters of plaintiffs first amendment rights were still in question,any training of the city police officers would necessarily leave those parameters in doubt.consequently,the lack of training by the city can not be the moving force behind the violation of plaintiffs constitutional rights.
at,dist.mem.and order,april.
moreover,where arresting police officers are absolved of liability to arrestees,the city ordinarily is not liable.we have addressed this issue in two cases.in abbott city of crocker,cir,we held that a judgment as a matter of law could not be sustained against a municipality where the judgment against the arresting officer had been reversed on a fact basis.the c
