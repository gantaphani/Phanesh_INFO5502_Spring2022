contacts between lawyers and represented parties raise some of the thornier issues in the area of legal ethics.this case turns on one variant of the problem whether a provision of the federal employers liability act fela,overrides an ethical rule adopted by the federal district court that prohibits attorneys from contacting parties represented by other counsel under the circumstances presented here.the district court concluded that the lawyer in question had violated the ethical rule,that the fela provided no excuse,and that the situation was so egregious as to call for outright dismissal of the client case.we agree with everything but the last point,and thus we remand for further proceedings on the remedy.
kenneth weibrecht was a deckhand for southern illinois transfer.on the morning of february,kenneth and another southern illinois transfer employee,mike bader,were in the process of attaching a barge to a tug.bader was the pilot of the tug and was in charge of the operation kenneth job was to disconnect the barge from another vessel so that it could be attached to the tug.during the operation,kenneth somehow slipped into the water and drowned.no other southern illinois transfer employees were present during the operation.after his father death,shane weibrecht brought this suit under the jones act,which incorporates the fela for the purposes relevant to this case.in it he alleged that southern illinois transfer was negligent in not having more deckhands involved in the operation,in not requiring kenneth to wear a life preserver,and in not maintaining the safety and seaworthiness of the barge kenneth was working on.
from the start,the case was plagued by more than its share of missteps.initially,the plaintiff in the suit was marilyn weibrecht,kenneth wife,who had opened a probate estate proceeding in illinois with herself as representative.problems arose when it turned out that shane had already done the same thing in missouri naming himself as representative before marilyn had acted.the district court concluded not only that marilyn was not authorized to sue as a representative of her husband,but also that certain statements in marilyn illinois probate application were misstatement s,approaching fraud.despite its misgivings,and perhaps giving shane and marilyn innocent mistake explanation the benefit of the doubt,the court dismissed the case without prejudice and permitted the weibrechts to refile substituting shane as the plaintiff.they did so,and the case proceeded to discovery,where additional problems arose.at one point,the defendants sought and were awarded a sanction for the plaintiff failure to respond to requests for information and interrogatories.
against this backdrop,the parties scheduled bader deposition for december.on december,shane personally contacted bader and discussed with him the weibrechts theory that there should have been at least two deckhands on the barge at the time of the accident.shane also told bader that the lawsuit was his mother doing and that the purpose of the lawsuit was not to recover money but to make southern illinois transfer a safer place to work.shane then suggested that bader should contact the weibrechts attorney,michael mcglynn.the district court found over mcglynn protestations to the contrary that shane made this call to bader at mcglynn suggestion.in any event,it is undisputed that on the next day,mcglynn called the bader residence,asked to speak to bader,and left a message asking bader to call him.mcglynn insists the only purpose of his call was to make sure bader was aware that the time of the deposition had been changed.
on december,southern illinois transfer filed a motion for sanctions based on the two calls to bader,claiming that they violated rule of the district court rules of professional conduct based on the illinois rule of the same number,which governs contacts between attorneys and parties represented by another lawyer and in general prohibits such contacts without the consent of the other lawyer.inexplicably,mcglynn did not see the motion until the court mentioned it at a pretrial conference on january.mcglynn admitted that he was caught off guard at the pretrial conference and was unable to provide the district court with any case citations to back up his arguments that his conduct was permissible.nevertheless,mcglynn argued that in jones act cases,the fela specifically permits a plaintiff lawyer to contact the defendant employees and that this provision overrides any ethical prohibition on such contact.in the alternative,mcglynn argued that,as he understood the relevant ethical rules,bader was not a sufficiently manager at southern illinois transfer to be considered represented by southern illinois transfer lawyer.mcglynn requested additional time to flesh out these arguments,but the district court,noting that mcglynn office apparently had received the motion over a month before the hearing,declined his request for additional time,found that he had violated the rule,and dismissed the case with prejudice.mcglynn subsequently filed rule e and rule motions in which he fleshed out his argument for why his conduct did not amount to an ethical breach,but the district court declined to amend the judgment or reopen the case.
interaction between ethical rules and the fela 
the southern district of illinois has adopted illinois ethical rules as its own rules of professional conduct,see southern district of illinois local rule d,relying on both its power to enact local rules under.and its inherent power and responsibility to supervise the conduct of attorneys admitted to practice before it.local rule,para.the text of the rule mcglynn allegedly violated was therefore identical to its illinois counterpart,illinois rule of professional conduct,which provides 
during the course of representing a client a lawyer shall not communicate or cause another to communicate on the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in that matter unless the first lawyer has obtained the prior consent of the lawyer representing such other party or as may otherwise be authorized by law.
we refer to this as.rule where the federal character of the rule is important otherwise,where we are referring to all state or federal rules with the same text,we refer to it simply as rule.despite the identity of language between the illinois rule and the federal local rule,there is still a distinction between the two,even if it is a fine one.see,united states kimbell foods,d wilson garcia,d.this is not an instance where a federal court must decide whether federal preemption principles implicitly require a federal rule,but a rule whose content mirrors state law we have the easier case where the federal authority has explicitly adopted the state law.the consequences for comity of a decision pertaining to one or the other are quite different,for example.once the federal court adopts the text of the state rules,it has its own professional responsibility standards,and any interpretation it may wish to give the rules is not binding in any sense on the illinois courts.more importantly for this case,because we are dealing with a potential conflict between a federal local rule and a federal statute,rather than a state rule and a federal statute,the parties focus on whether the local rule is preempted by the fela is misplaced.rather,the appropriate question is whether the federal statute supercedes the local rule.although the concepts of preemption and supercession are closely related,they are distinct doctrines.see united states klubock,cir.whether the federal statute supercedes the local rule is a question of federal statutory interpretation which we review de novo.dell board of education,township high school district,cir.
with this correction to the governing analysis in place,we turn to the question whether mcglynn attempt to contact bader violated.rule.mcglynn concedes that at first blush the rule appears to prohibit what he did,but he argues that rule for this purpose is superseded by of the fela,which,by virtue of the jones act,governs suits by maritime workers for injuries.see great lakes dredge dock.provides 
any contract,rule,regulation,or device whatsoever,the purpose,intent,or effect of which shall be to prevent employees of any common carrier from furnishing voluntarily information to a person in interest as to the facts incident to the injury or death of any employee,shall be void 
according to mcglynn.rule is exactly the kind of rule,regulation,or device that is talking about,because it might have the effect of preventing maritime employees from voluntarily furnishing relevant information to a jones act plaintiff attorney.because the plaintiff attorney is a person in interest under,see,sheet metal workers int l burlington northern,cir,mcglynn argues that.rule necessarily conflicts with and must yield to the latter statute.
if we agreed with mcglynn that there is a square conflict between and.rule,then we would also agree that would take precedence.federal district courts are authorized to promulgate local rules under both.and a federal statute.both of these sources state that local rules must be consistent with acts of congress.to the extent a local rule conflicts with a federal statute,this requirement is violated,and so the local rule must be held invalid.see frazier heebe,d stern united states district court for the district of massachusetts,cir.
we acknowledge that the federal and state courts that have considered the issue are split on the question whether takes precedence over district court rules such as.rule as well as on the closely related question whether preempts similar state ethical rules.implicitly,these courts are also split on the question whether there is a conflict between and rule,as there would be no need to consider which takes precedence if they could be reconciled.see merrill lynch,pierce,fenner,smith,ware,d.compare,mayfield soo line,wl,unpublished,united transportation union local unions and metro north commuter,civ.rws,wl,unpublished,blasena consolidated rail,and harper missouri pacific,d,holding overrides rule,with white illinois central,branham norfolk and western ry,and state ex rel.atchison,topeka sante fe,holding no conflict.courts on both sides of the debate have cited the legislative history of those that find overrides rule argue that was intended broadly to afford plaintiffs the same access to information that their employers have,see,blasena.at,while those that find no conflict have held that the legislative history shows that congress was concerned only with the behavior of the railroads themselves,and did not intend to affect external limitations on contact with the employees,such as attorney ethical rules,see,branham,at.
with respect,we can not agree with those who think that an irreconcilable conflict exists between and rule.forbids rules or devices that prevent employees from furnishing information to a plaintiff or the plaintiff lawyer,but nothing in necessarily requires that the plaintiff lawyer be allowed to gather information outside the presence of the employee attorney.as we discuss further in a moment,not all employees are considered to be represented by a company lawyers under rule.if the employee is not represented,then the plaintiff attorney would be free to contact that employee.if the employee is represented,however,under rule the plaintiff attorney would be required to go through the employee lawyer who is most likely the company lawyer to schedule a deposition or otherwise gain information from the employee.although this requirement might raise the cost of gathering information from the employee,we can not say that such a requirement amounts to a rule or device that prevents the employee from furnishing information to the plaintiff attorney.
moreover,if we read the word prevent in to include the marginal deterrence imposed by rule,we would effectively be finding that the fela and the jones act were intended to displace generally applicable ethical rules.we see no evidence of such a radical move in either the text or the background of the statutes.at the time was enacted in,the attorney ethical rule against contacting represented parties was an ingrained part of the legal system.see,aba canons of professional ethics,canon.had congress wanted to override such a rule of legal ethics,it easily could have said explicitly that it was doing so.that it did not suggests that in enacting congress was concerned specifically with rules,regulations,or devices concocted by the railroads to stifle employees contacts with potential fela claimants,and not with altering norms of litigation.we will not take silence in this instance as the equivalent of an intent to give such a broad scope that it would preempt the state equivalents to rule and it would supersede federal rules like the one in the southern district of illinois.
mcglynn is not willing to concede that his case stands or falls on the broad supersession argument.if.rule governs his fate,he argues in the alternative that he is excused because of an exception in the rule itself that allows communications between attorneys and represented parties if those communications are otherwise authorized by law.creates just such an exception,in his view.whether he is right,and authorizes ex parte communications between a fela plaintiff lawyer and the defendant employees,is another question of federal statutory interpretation,which once again receives plenary review.dell,at.
although mcglynn argument that creates an exception to rule has a certain appeal,in the end it too stretches the statute too far.quite simply,the exception in rule is for communications authorized by law,and,by its terms,does not authorize anything.rather,is a prohibition on certain conduct by railroads and maritime employers these employers are forbidden from enacting rules or regulations that prevent employees from disclosing information to fela or jones act plaintiffs.the phrase rule,regulation,or device in,read in context,appears to refer only to internal rules or regulations promulgated by employers.even if it could have a broader application to other prohibitory rules perhaps because of the word whatsoever that appears in the text,there is still nothing to suggest that it was designed to authorize conduct that would otherwise violate general ethical rules.we therefore reject mcglynn alternate argument based on.
definition of represented party under rule 
taking a different tack,mcglynn next argues that no matter what does or does not mean.rule was not violated in this case because bader was not a party represented by another lawyer as contemplated by the rule.some version of the ethical rule prohibiting contact with represented parties is in force in every jurisdiction,see generally restatement third of the law governing lawyers,cmt.b,and the question of how the rule should apply to employees of a corporate party has been a subject of vigorous debate,with different authorities advocating interpretations ranging from a complete ban on any contact with the opponent employees,to a restrictive interpretation allowing contact with all but the most senior managers,to a variety of functional tests that focus on the employee role in the events giving rise to the lawsuit.see generally restatement third of the law governing lawyers reporter note ernest lidge iii,the ethics of communicating with an organization employees.analyzing various approaches.prior to this case,the southern district of illinois had not determined which of the competing interpretations of the rule it would adopt.we afford district courts considerable discretion in interpreting and applying their own local rules,and we will disturb an interpretation only if we are convinced that the district court has misconstrued the rule or has perverted the meaning of the words of the rule.see congregation of the passion,holy cross province touche,ross,cir.
in analyzing the scope of rule,the district court adopted the test that the aba set out in its official commentary to the model rules.see aba model rules of professional conduct rule,cmt.the district court also relied heavily on a recent decision from the northern district of illinois,in which that court adopted and explained the aba test.
