this case is an appeal from an order of the district court for the district of kansas,finding that appellant,attorney tim butler,violated the kansas code of professional conduct and the kansas rules of professional conduct.biocore med,khosrowshahi.butler asks this court to vacate these findings.for the reasons detailed below,we decline to do so.
the challenged district court order arose in the context of a dispute between biocore medical technologies and biocore,collectively,biocore on one side and hamid khosrowshahi khosrowshahi and margaret callaci on the other.khosrowshahi sued his former employer,biocore,alleging that he was owed stock and deferred compensation.biocore sued khosrowshahi for alleged misappropriations of trade secrets.biocore filed suit in the district of kansas,while khosrowshahi filed in the southern district of new york.the two actions were consolidated in the district of kansas.
on april,the district court entered an order allowing butler,a member of the new york and connecticut bars,to appear pro hac vice,representing khosrowshahi,with ruth benien as local counsel.biocore moved to disqualify butler and to revoke his pro hac vice admission,alleging that butler violated the federal rules of civil procedure,the kansas canons of professional responsibility cpr,the kansas model rules of professional conduct mrpc,and the district of kansas local rules specifically biocore claimed that butler violated.b requiring notice to all parties of subpoenas and d requiring the filing of papers that have been served on a party be given to the court clerk.rules pro hac vice requirements for involvement of local counsel and requiring the filing of notice of service of discovery disclosures,requests,or responses mrpc b prohibiting attorneys from offering improper inducements to witnesses,prohibiting communications of the subject matter of representation with a represented party,and g providing that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in any conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer fitness to practice law and canon of the cpr requiring attorneys to avoid the appearance of impropriety.the district court made specific findings of fact regarding butler conduct and concluded that he had violated all these rules except mrpc b and.biocore,at.
nonetheless,the district court denied the motion to disqualify butler and instead ordered him to remedy all outstanding violations of.d and local rules and.the district court also ordered the clerk to mail a copy of the order containing the district court findings that butler had violated rules of professional conduct to every court where butler had been admitted to practice.approximately two months later,in november of,the district court issued an order disqualifying butler for violation of a protective order and reprimanding him for continued ethical violations.biocore med,khosrowshahi,nos,wl.
butler filed an interlocutory appeal that was dismissed on april.the district court then issued a final order on may.biocore khosrowshahi,d.butler now appeals only the first one mailed to every court to which butler had been admitted.
butler explicitly appeals only the district court finding that he violated canon and mrpc g.appellant brief at.as butler later explains,he is appealing only the findings of ethical violations,claiming that they impact heavily on butler stature as an attorney.id.at.implicitly,however,butler also disputes all the district court findings since they form the basis of the mrpc g violation.
jurisdiction 
before reaching the merits of this appeal,we must first ascertain whether we have jurisdiction.steel citizens for a better env t,d.this question the court is bound to ask and answer for itself,even when not otherwise suggested,and without respect to the relation of the parties to it.id.at.this threshold requirement is inflexible and without exception.id.at.pursuant to as limited by article iii,we have jurisdiction to hear appeals from the final orders of district courts,including appeals by attorneys of orders that directly aggrieve them.weeks indep.sch,cir.we,therefore,have jurisdiction to hear this appeal only if the order butler challenges has directly aggrieve d him.id.in other words,we have jurisdiction only if butler has been injured in the legal sense,by the order being appealed.united states gonzales,cir.for the reasons detailed below,we hold that he has.
here,butler appeals,portions of a district court order that found him to have committed ethical violations.other than making the finding of attorney misconduct,this order neither expressly identified itself as a reprimand nor imposed any sanction,monetary or otherwise.the order was,however,mailed to every court in which butler had been admitted to practice.thus,the injury butler may claim is the damage widely done to his professional reputation.the question of whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal,therefore,distills to the question of when,if ever,an order thus affecting an attorney professional reputation imposes a legally sufficient injury to support appellate jurisdiction.for the reasons detailed below,we hold that it does.
heretofore we have not directly addressed this question.see id.at recognizing that we have not decided whether an attorney is directly aggrieved by an order simply finding misconduct and declining to decide the question.instead,we have held that damage to an attorney professional reputation is legally sufficient in connection with a disqualification order,weeks,at,and that such damage is sufficient to sustain an appeal of a disqualification order even though the underlying case was settled,johnson board of county comm rs,cir.other circuits,however,have directly addressed whether an order damaging only an attorney professional reputation and not accompanied by any other form of sanction can be appealed and have come to one of three results never appealable,always appealable,and appealable only if the order is expressly identified as a reprimand.
the seventh circuit is the only circuit falling into the first category and considers an order only damaging an attorney professional reputation as never appealable.clark equip.lift parts,cir a n attorney may not appeal from an order that finds misconduct but does not result in monetary liability,despite the potential reputational effects.in reaching its conclusion,the seventh circuit balanced the severity of the harm of damage to an attorney professional it as a speculative contingency rather then a concrete injury,the practical considerations of congested appellate dockets and the difficulty of assuring an adversary contest in most such appeals.id.the result of this balancing test,the seventh circuit concluded,is that an order damaging only an attorney professional reputation,while potentially a significant enough injury to satisfy the case or controversy requirements of article iii,is not a final decision for the purposes of and,therefore,not appealable.bolte home ins,cir.the seventh circuit did,however,leave open the possibility that an attorney damaged by an order finding misconduct alone could seek relief by a writ of mandamus.clark,at.
the fifth and district of columbia circuits fall into the second category and both allow attorneys to appeal orders that find misconduct alone.walker city of mesquite,cir holding that the importance of an attorney professional reputation,and the imperative to defend it when necessary,obviates the need for a finding of monetary liability or other punishment as a requisite for the appeal of a court order finding professional misconduct sullivan committee on admissions and grievances,holding that a finding of professional misconduct not accompanied by other sanctions is analogous to a defendant found guilty but given a suspended sentence and is appealable.the ninth circuit also falls into this category,though through a slightly different approach.it allows attorneys to appeal orders that are inordinately injurious to a lawyer reputation but does not allow appeals from orders that are properly considered routine judicial commentary.united states talao,cir.the ninth circuit,however,considers an order finding a knowing and wilful violation of an ethical rule as,per se,inordinately injurious and,therefore,appealable.id.at.these circuits base their decisions primarily on how severe they consider an injury to an attorney reputation.the fifth circuit,for example,held beyond peradventure that one professional reputation is a lawyer most important and valuable asset.walker,at citing cooter gell hartmarx,d stevens,concurring.similarly,the ninth circuit noted that a finding of misconduct is likely to stigmatize the attorney among her colleagues and potentially could have a serious detrimental effect on her career.talao,at.
the first circuit is the only circuit falling into the third category and is alone in adopting a formalistic approach that allows attorneys to appeal orders damaging their professional reputations only where the challenged order is expressly identified as a reprimand.in re williams,cir.in reaching this conclusion,the first circuit acknowledged that a lawyer professional reputation is his stock in trade,and blemishes may prove harmful in a myriad of ways.id.at.nonetheless,the first circuit limited the appealability of orders finding misconduct because of the difficulty in securing a balanced adversarial presentation that is so helpful to the proper functioning of the appellate process in such appeals,id.at,and the need for district courts to retain the power to comment,sternly when necessary,on a lawyer performance without wondering whether those comments will provoke an appeal.id.at.the first circuit made clear,however,that words alone could be sufficient if labeled as a reprimand.id.finally,like the seventh circuit,the first circuit left open the possibility of relief through a writ of mandamus.id.at.
of these three approaches,we believe that the position taken by the majority of the circuits,that an order finding attorney misconduct but not imposing other sanctions is appealable under even if not labeled as a reprimand,is the proper position.we therefore join the majority of circuits in holding that an order finding ethical violations is appealable,under.we also wish to make clear that only orders finding misconduct are appealable and not every negative comment or observation from a judge pen about an attorney conduct or performance gonzales,at baldock,dissenting.
we reach this conclusion for three reasons.first,we believe,as our precedent dictates,that damage to an attorney professional reputation is a cognizable and legally sufficient injury.see weeks,at johnson,at.such damage is to the attorney,most important and valuable asset,walker,at,and may prove harmful in a myriad of ways,williams,at.as such,neither the imposition of a monetary sanction nor an explicit label as a reprimand are prerequisites to appealability.a rule requiring monetary sanctions,as the fifth circuit noted,would maintain that an attorney has more of a reason and interest in appealing the imposition of a fine than appealing a finding and declaration by the court that counsel is an unprofessional lawyer prone to engage in blatant misconduct.walker,at.this is contrary to our recognition of the importance of an attorney professional reputation,see weeks,at johnson,at,and fails to recognize that,like monetary sanctions,linguistic sanctions can in the long run strike the lawyer bank account williams,at rosenn,dissenting.similarly,a rule requiring an explicit label as a reprimand ignores the reality that a finding of misconduct damages an attorney reputation regardless of whether it is labeled as a reprimand and,instead,trumpets form over substance.
second,we believe that the concern over the lack of an adversarial appeal in such cases is assuaged by the fact that,on appeal,we review the district court the reasons for any finding of attorney addition to the appellant brief.thus,we will not hear only one side of the story.id.at.finally,we believe that the need for district courts to be free from excessive appellate supervision is adequately addressed by the deferential standard of review applied to such district court order finding misconduct would be overturned only if supported by no reasonable basis.weeks,at.thus,the district court has ample discretion to comment,sternly when necessary,on a lawyer performance in order to assure the proper conduct of proceedings in his or her court.williams,at.further,excessive appeals will be limited by the risk that this court,reaching the merits,will agree that the sanction is justified thus giving the sanction far more force then it would have had if it had come from the trial judge unendorsed by a reviewing court.williams united states,cir lynch,dissenting from a denial of reh g en banc.
in conclusion,we hold that an order finding that an attorney has committed an ethical violation but not imposing any other sanction,monetary or otherwise,can be appealed as a final order under.here,the order butler appeals found attorney misconduct on his part and was mailed to every court where he had been admitted to practice.we,therefore,have jurisdiction to hear butler appeal and now turn to the merits.
standard of review 
we review for abuse of discretion all aspects of a trial court imposition of sanctions for rules violations.masunaga stoltenberg in re rex montis silver,cir citing cooter gell hartmarx,d.the trial court factual findings regarding the conduct of attorneys will not be disturbed unless there is no reasonable basis to support those conclusions.we review de novo the trial court interpretation of the applicable rules of professional responsibility and the trial court interpretation of a statute.weeks,at citations omitted.
butler,in preparing for litigation,contacted a number of biocore former employees including marilyn johnson johnson.johnson,the district court found,possessed substantial confidential information about biocore that she agreed to keep confidential.biocore,at.specifically,the district court noted johnson duties as a biocore employee and her access to confidential materials 
johnson had worked as the executive administrative assistant for various officers of biocore the president,the chief executive officer,the chairman of the board,and the chief financial officer.khosrowshahi was her immediate supervisor.while employed for biocore,johnson maintained corporate files,customer lists,expense reports,grant submissions,and information about sales,accounts receivable,and pricing structures.while general faxes went to a fax machine in a general location,faxes for employees went to a fax machine in johnson office.johnson received confidential faxes,opened confidential mail,pulled confidential information from files in her office,typed confidential correspondence,and had confidential information on computer disks.johnson took to her home certain computer disks which contained information on sales,customer lists,medicare,and sales representatives agreement letters and logs.both parties originally listed johnson as a potential witness in this case.
biocore,at.based upon these facts,the district court found that johnson possessed a veritable of information about plaintiffs operations that while likely to be relevant,was protected by a confidentiality agreement.id.at.
butler hired johnson,who was then considering an employment discrimination claim with the eeoc against biocore,to help butler review the disorganized and unlabeled documents he received in discovery from biocore.butler paid johnson a total of approximately at a rate of an hour.both butler and johnson testified at trial and both insisted that johnson did not reveal any confidential information while working for butler.their testimony,however,was not completely consistent.while butler testified that he contacted johnson to obtain her help in reviewing documents he found disorganized and unlabeled,johnson testified she was contacted by butler before he received the documents.id.johnson also testified,and butler denies,that butler asked her about her knowledge,position,and duties at biocore.
canon provides that a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety.the district court,citing multiple authorities,held that the appearance of impropriety
