in this petition for writ of mandate petition we are presented with the question whether the trial court properly disqualified attorney dale larabee from representing petitioner david snider because of his contacts with two employees,one a sales manager and the other a director of production,of respondent quantum productions.the court found that larabee violated california state bar rules of professional conduct,rule which provides in part 
a while representing a client,a member shall not communicate directly or indirectly about the subject of the representation with a party the member knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the member has the consent of the other lawyer.
b for purposes of this rule,a party includes 
an officer,director,or managing agent of a corporation or association,and a partner or managing agent of a partnership or 
an association member or an employee of an association,corporation,or partnership,if the subject of the communication is any act or omission of such person in connection with the matter which may be binding upon or imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.italics added.
we conclude that there was no violation of rule as the contacted employees were not represented parties within the scope of that rule as they were not officer s,director s or managing agent s of the organization the subject matter of the communications was not an act or omission of the employees that could be binding or imputed to the organization and they were not employees whose statements might constitute admissions on behalf of the organization.we further conclude that if the employees were subject to rule,the court still erred in ordering the disqualification of larabee as the evidence did not show that he had actual knowledge the employees were represented parties.accordingly,we grant snider petition and order the superior court to vacate its order disqualifying larabee and his firm from representing snider in this action.
we emphasize,however,that counsel desiring to contact an employee of a represented organization should endeavor to ensure,prior to the contact,that the employee,either because of his or her status within the organization or the subject matter of the proposed communication,does not come within the scope of rule.further,once contact is made,counsel should at the outset pose questions designed to elicit information that would determine whether the employee comes within rule scope and should not ask questions that could violate the privilege.by the same token,if organizations do not want employees within the scope of rule to have contact with opposing counsel,it is incumbent upon them to take proactive measures to ensure that the employees and opposing counsel understand the organization position.ethical violations and unnecessary litigation over such ex parte contacts would largely be obviated by prudent actions taken by counsel and organizations in applying rule.
factual and procedural background 
factual background 
snider was employed by quantum,an event design and construction company,as a sales manager.in snider resigned and formed gardenia design group gardenia,which quantum alleged was in direct competition with quantum.quantum also alleged that snider misappropriated confidential and secret business information from quantum and used that information to compete with quantum.in july quantum filed a complaint against snider and gardenia,alleging misappropriation of trade secrets,breach of contract,intentional interference with contractual relations and prospective economic advantage,and unfair competition snider denies quantum allegations.
procedural background 
the motion to disqualify 
in the joint trial readiness report filed with the court prior to trial,quantum listed as a percipient witness,among others,its employee toni lewis.snider and gardenia listed as percipient witnesses,among others,lewis and laura janikas,also a quantum employee.
thereafter,between the joint trial readiness conference and trial,larabee contacted lewis and janikas to talk with them about the pending case.when counsel for quantum discovered the contacts,he brought a motion for a trial continuance and to disqualify larabee from representing snider motion to disqualify.
in support of the motion to disqualify,quantum submitted the declaration of its president,pam navarre,as well as declarations from janikas and lewis.in navarre declaration she stated that quantum employs approximately people.she stated that she and quantum,bill hardt,were the only personnel at the company.she further stated that below the executives in the company were two sales managers,a director of operations,and a director of production.janikas was a sales manager,and her duties included selling quantum goods and services and supervising two subordinate employees.she was also responsible for enforcing quantum rules,policies and procedures.janikas had the authority to direct all work by others in the company in relation to the goods and services she contracted to provide on behalf of quantum.according to navarre,the position of sales manager was a position of great confidence in the company and she relied on the counsel and input of janikas in making corporate policies and decisions.navarre did not describe lewis position at quantum.
in her declaration,janikas described her work for quantum as including management responsibilities.she stated that she had been aware of the litigation for months but had not discussed it at length with her superiors.she stated that in january larabee called her at home on two occasions and left messages for her.she returned one of his calls and left a message for larabee.larabee was able to reach her on her work cellular phone.according to janikas,she talked to larabee for about minutes.
janikas stated that larabee asked her many questions about this lawsuit,and made her feel like she was on the witness stand.he asked her if she knew the real reason why quantum had sued snider.she replied that she understood that he had been sued because he breached his contract with quantum.larabee asked if she had seen snider contract with quantum.she replied that she had not.larabee asked her if she had signed a contract.she replied that she had,as had all other employees.larabee asked her what she thought the contract meant,and janikas attempted to explain it to him.larabee asked janikas if quantum sold wedding services before snider quit.she responded that it did.larabee also asked her about a meeting of key employees in october.larabee also asked her if she took a pay cut after september,and whether that made her want to leave quantum.he asked her many more questions that she could not remember.at the end of the conversation larabee asked her if quantum counsel had ever called and talked to her.she responded that he had not.
in her declaration,lewis stated that she was the director of productions for quantum,and described her work there,which included supervising the production department and its employees.larabee first called her before christmas.he left a message on her work cellular phone number saying that he wanted to meet her.larabee left several additional messages for her and she eventually returned his calls in january.she agreed to meet with him at his offices,but she did not make the appointment.according to lewis,larabee never asked her if counsel represented her.
larabee filed a declaration in opposition to quantum motion.in that declaration he stated that he had no intention of calling janikas or lewis as witnesses in the case.he also confirmed that he never spoke with lewis concerning the case his only conversations with her were unsuccessful attempts to set up a meeting.he stated that he had asked both janikas and lewis if counsel for quantum had talked to them about trial testimony and they both stated that they had not.before contacting them,he asked snider what duties and responsibilities they had.snider told larabee that they were salespeople with no corporate responsibility.based upon this he concluded that they were not within the control group of quantum management and he did not believe that they could bind or make an admission on behalf of the organization.larabee only wanted to ask them about matters of which they had percipient knowledge,particularly about a meeting in the fall of when navarre told the employees that business was bad and that if they wanted to look for another job they could do so.larabee admitted asking janikas if she had any idea why snider had been sued.according to larabee,she stated that she did not.
larabee also stated that he told janikas and lewis that he was snider counsel and they did not have to talk to him if they did not want to.he stated that lewis had called him back as many times as he called her and that she wanted to talk to larabee.according to larabee,lewis also contacted snider on her own and told snider that she had to rewrite her declaration multiple times because quantum attorneys did not like it and that they told her what to say.
larabee also stated that he did not believe that there was an relationship between quantum attorney and lewis and janikas.he stated that he waited until after the trial readiness conference to contact them as he wanted to give counsel a chance to tell the employees not to talk to him.
larabee submitted an expert declaration from dennis schoville,an attorney,in which he opined that larabee did not violate rule.however,the court did not consider that document because it was filed late.
the court ruling 
in february the court granted quantum motion to disqualify larabee as snider counsel.in doing so,the court made the following findings in its tentative ruling 
this court concludes that the attorney client privilege has been compromised by larabee contacts and interviews with plaintiff sales manager,laura janikas,and director of production,toni lewis,and that rule of the rules of professional conduct appears to have been violated by such conduct.the appropriate sanction is that larabee be relieved as counsel for defendant snider and gardenia.
at the hearing on the motion,larabee requested that live testimony be heard from the witnesses before the court disqualified him.the court denied the request and confirmed the tentative ruling.in doing so the court found that janikas and lewis were employees that were part of quantum control group and they were employees whose statements could be deemed admissions on the part of the organization.
the court also indicated that it probably would not be appropriate for larabee partner,joshua gruenberg,to substitute in as new counsel for snider.when snider thereafter attempted to substitute gruenberg in as his new counsel,the court cancelled the file stamp on the substitution form and returned the form to counsel.in the sendback notice the court indicated that it had ordered the disqualification of not only larabee,but his firm as well.
discussion 
on this petition snider asserts that the court erred in ordering disqualification as larabee did not know the employees were represented by counsel the employees he contacted did not come within the terms of rule the court should not have disqualified another member of his firm and quantum was not prejudiced by the contacts.we grant snider petition.
standard of review 
we review the court decision to disqualify snider counsel under the abuse of discretion standard.nalian truck lines,nakano warehouse transportation th,d nalian.this discretion is subject to the limitations of the legal principles governing the subject of its action,and subject to reversal on appeal where no reasonable basis for the action is shown.citation.citation.ibid.

policies concerning rule against ex parte contact 
contact with represented parties is proscribed to preserve the relationship from an opposing attorney intrusion and interference.jackson th,d.moreover,with regard to the ethical boundaries of an attorney conduct,a bright line test is essential.as a practical matter,an attorney must be able to determine beforehand whether particular conduct is permissible otherwise,an attorney would be uncertain whether the rules had been violated until he or she is disqualified.unclear rules risk blunting an advocate zealous representation of a client.nalian,supra,th at,d.further,rule must be interpreted narrowly because a rule whose violation could result in disqualification and possible disciplinary action should be narrowly construed when it impinges upon a lawyer duty of zealous representation.continental ins.superior court th,d continental.
covered employees 
to determine whether larabee violated rule by contacting janikas and lewis,we must first determine whether they were covered employees,those with whom contact was proscribed under rule.in order to decide this issue we must look to the development of the rule preventing ex parte contact with employees of represented entities,reviewing california authority,american bar association aba model rule,and authority.
california authority 
former rule provided 
a member of the state bar shall not communicate directly or indirectly with a party whom he knows to be represented by counsel upon a subject of controversy,without the express consent of such counsel.this rule shall not apply to communications with a public officer,board,committee or body.
in a committee of the los angeles county bar association interpreted former rule in a formal opinion.in that opinion,the committee stated that there was nothing unethical in an attorney interviewing a nonmanagement employee of an adverse party who may be a witness without the consent of that party attorney cal.compendium on responsibility,county bar.formal opn.the committee found the test to be the extent to which the employees are closely identified with management of the company.ibid.thus,at that time,former rule was interpreted to allow ex parte contact with a represented organization employees unless they were members of the organization control group.continental,supra,th at,d.an organization control group has been stated as consisting of officers and agents responsible for directing the company actions in response to legal advice.bobele superior court d.
however,in the united states supreme court issued its decision in upjohn united states,d upjohn,wherein the high court held that the corporate privilege extends not only to communications between corporate counsel and members of the control group,but also to communications with middle and low level corporate employees.continental,supra,th at,d.in response to upjohn,the los angeles county bar association and the san diego county bar association issued new opinions concerning the propriety of ex parte contacts with employees of organizations represented by counsel.cal.compendium on responsibility,county bar.formal opn,formal opinion cal.compendium on responsibility,san diego county bar.ethics opn,ethics opinion.in formal opinion,a los angeles county bar association committee concluded,based upon the upjohn decision,that it was best to draw a clear and unequivocal counsel should not have ex parte contact concerning a subject of controversy with the employees of a corporate party to the controversy.formal opn,supra,at.in ethics opinion,a san diego county bar association committee also adopted a strict prohibition against ex parte contact with employees of a represented organization it would not be proper for an attorney to contact an employee of an organization regarding matters within the scope of the employee employment without first obtaining the consent of the organization counsel.ethics opn,supra,at.
relying on formal opinion and the upjohn case,the court in mills land water golden west refining d.mills upheld the disqualification of an attorney under former rule for making ex parte contact with the opposing organization former president,who had remained on its board of directors.in doing so,the court of appeal rejected the control group test to determine the propriety of ex parte contacts with employees of represented organizations.mills,supra,d at.as the court in mills stated the question is not simply whether the former president was in a position to bind the organization in some fashion.his position makes him potentially privy to privileged information about the litigation.id.at,italics fn.omitted.thus,the court in mills adopted the blanket rule regarding ex parte contacts stated in formal opinion and ethics opinion,prohibiting ex parte contact with any current employees of an organization.mills,at see also bobele superior court,supra,d at.plaintiffs may not contact ex parte any current employees of defendant organization.
two years later,in,rule was repealed and the current rule was adopted,providing in part 
a while representing a client,a member shall not communicate directly or indirectly about the subject of the representation with a party the member knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the member has the consent of the other lawyer.
b for purposes of this rule,a party includes 
an officer,director,or managing agent of a corporation or association,and a partner or managing agent of a partnership or 
an association member or employee of an association,corporation,or partnership,if the subject of the communication is any act or omission of such person in connection with the matter which may be binding upon or imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.italics added.
the drafters of rule stated that the new paragraph b was intended to clarify the troubling issue of which employees of an entity may be approached without consent of the attorney for the entity when the entity is the opponent.state bar of,off.of,request that supreme court approve amendments to the rules of professional conduct.the original draft of proposed rule provided for a blanket rule against ex parte contact with any current employees of a represented organization,stating 
while representing a client,a member shall not communicate directly or indirectly about the subject matter of the representation with a party the member knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,or with an employee of such party,unless the member has the consent of the other lawyer.discussion draft propose amends.to rules of conduct,italics added.
however,based upon numerous comments objecting to the inclusion of all employees within the scope of rule,the foregoing italicized phrase was eliminated.instead,the drafters proposed using the control group test.the drafters discussed the control group test and the impact of the upjohn decision the issue has sometimes been analogized to the issue of whether commun i cations between a party counsel and that party employees are protected by the attorney work product rule and the privilege.some courts have applied the control group test in this situation.the test restricts the availability of the privilege to a control employees who play a substantial role in deciding and directing the employee legal response.in upjohn,supra,at,the supreme court rejected that test,noting that it frustrates the very purpose of the privilege by discouraging the communication of relevant information by employees of the client to attorneys seeking to render legal advice to the client corporation,that such advice will frequently be more significant to noncontrol group members than those who officially sanction the advice,and that the test makes it more difficult to convey full and frank legal advice to the employees who will put into effect the client corporation policy.state bar of,off.of,request that supreme court approve amendments to the rules of professional conduct,supra,at.the drafters also discussed formal opinion and ethics opinion,and their conclusions that it was improper to contact ex parte any employee of a represented party if the information sought related to the subject of the controversy.state bar of,office of standards,supra,at.nonetheless,the drafters of rule proposed adopting the control group test for ex parte communications with employees of represented organizations t he large number of comments received on proposed rule,which proposed prohibiting members from communicating with the employee of a corporate opponent,stressed the hardship that such a prohibition would create on certain litigants.the employment discrimination bar,both public and private,pointed out that such a prohibition would make it virtually impossible to investigate claims prior to filing a suit,thus requiring more lawsuits to be filed and costly depositions taken.in addition,certain administrative proceedings have no mechanisms for formal discovery at all,thus making it possible that some potential witnesses would never be interviewed at all.as a result of these comments and others,it is proposed that paragraph b utilize the control group test.state bar of,off.of,supra,at,italics added.according to one later opinion,the drafters of rule,cognizant of upjohn holding,nonetheless decided to retain the control group test.nalian,supra,th at,fn,d.
at the time the california supreme court was requested to approve the amendments to the rules of professional conduct,rule b read an association member or an employee of an association,corporation,or partnership,if the subject matter of the communication is any act or omission of such person which may be binding on such entity or which may be a basis of a claim or defense involving that entity.state bar of,off.of,supra,enclosure.however,the high court expressed concerns concerning the clarity of this language,suggesting the definition would be clearer if it rested instead on the potential legal liability of the employee corporation,citing the decision in chadbourne,superior court cal d,and the comment to aba model rule.laurence gill,clerk of cal.supreme court,letter to terry anderlini,president of the state bar of cal.re bar misc,june.in chadbourne,supra,cal d,the california supreme court decided the issue of which communications by an organizational employee,who was not also a codefendant or one who could be charged with liability,could be deemed privileged.the high court created the following test h is communication should not be so privileged unless,under all of the circumstances of the case,he is the natural person to be speaking for the corporation that is to say,that the privilege will not attach in such case unless the communication constitutes information which emanates from the corporation as distinct from the nonlitigant employee,and the communicating employee is such a person who would ordinarily be utilized for communication to the corporation attorney.id.at.the comment to aba model rule will be discussed,post.
thereafter,the drafters responded to the supreme court concerns by revising paragraph b of rule to its current form.state bar of,off.of,supplemental mem.in their written response,the drafters stated,as to the court comment regarding the binding standard in rule b being ambiguous,the language of the proposed rule was not intended to be substantively different from the liability test in the comment to aba model rule.indeed,the liability test appears to be a clearer formulation of the concept underlying rule b.in order to clarify the rule,it is recommended that the liability test from aba model rule be added to rule b ibid.the california supreme court thereafter approved rule.
the parameters of rule b are stated succinctly in triple a machine shop,state of california d.triple a r ule permits opposing counsel to initiate ex parte contacts with present employees other than officers,directors or managing agents who are not separately represented,so long as the communication does not involve the employee act or failure to act in connection with the matter which may bind the corporation,be imputed to it,or constitute an admission of the corporation for purposes of establishing liability.in that case,the court of appeal,while not discussing in detail the reach of the new rule,rejected the previous blanket prohibition and held that the government attorney ex parte contact with the defendant assistant facilities manager was not improper.triple a machine shop,state of california,supra,at.
although the drafters of rule and the court in nalian characterize rule as prohibiting contact only with members of an organization control group,the actual text of paragraph b suggests that rule may be a bit broader than that.it is true that paragraph b states the control group test officers,directors and managing agents of the organization may not be contacted for any purpose.however,paragraph b focuses on the subject matter of the communication and arguably applies to employees outside of an organization control group if the subject matter of the conversation is the employee act or failure to act in connection with the matter at issue,and that act or failure to act could bind the organization,be imputed to it,or if the employee statement could constitute an admission against the organization.
with regard to statements that could constitute admissions on the part of the organization,evidence code section provides in part evidence of a statement offered against a party is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if a the statement was made by a person authorized by the party to make a statement or statements for him concerning the subject matter of the statement.this has been interpreted in california as only applying to organizational agents who have actual authority to speak on behalf of the organization.see mitsubishi electronics america,th,d statement on behalf of organization admissible because author held a particularly high place in the employer hierarchy and evidence showed authorization to speak on its behalf.
model rule 
aba model rules of professional conduct,rule aba model rule,provides for a proscription against certain ex parte contacts with employees of represented organizations,similar to california former rule 
in representing a client,a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter,unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized to do so by law or a court order.
although aba model rule is stated in general terms,the comment to that rule provides further guidance as to its scope and application to employees.at the time rule was adopted,the comment to aba model rule read substantially the same as california rule b and,providing in part that 
i n the case of an organization,this rule prohibits communications by a lawyer for one party concerning the matter in representation with persons having a managerial responsibility on behalf of the organization,and with any other person whose act or omission in connection with that matter may be imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.
however,the comments to aba model rule were substantially revised when the aba model rules were revised in as amended,the relevant portion of the comment reads 
in the case of a represented organization,this rule prohibits communications with a constituent of the organization who supervises,directs or regularly consults with the organization lawyer concerning the matter or has authority to obligate the organization with respect to the matter or whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be imputed to the organization for the purposes of civil or criminal liability.
the revisions to the comment were meant to clarif y application of the rule to organizational clients.palmer pioneer inn associates,palmer.the phrase whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization was omitted from the comment because it had been misapplied to situations when an employee statement could be admissible against the organizational employer,when the clause was only ever intended to encompass those few jurisdictions with a law of evidence providing that statements by certain employees of an organization were not only admissible against the organization but could not thereafter be controverted by the organization,fn.omitted.
in interpreting aba model rule and their own rules governing attorney ethics,state and federal courts have come up with various tests to determine which employees of represented organizations may be contacted by opposing counsel.palmer,supra,at.on one end is the blanket test,which prohibits contact with any current or former employees of an organization.ibid.at the other end is the control group test,which covers only management employees.several tests fall in the middle,including a admission test,a balancing test,and a agent test.ibid.given the comments of the drafters of california rule and its text,california did not intend to adopt a blanket prohibition on communications with an organization employees.however,cases adopting the restrictive control group test,and those adopting a more approach,provide authority helpful to our analysis of whether janikas and lewis were employees covered by the terms of rule.
one case has defined the control group that is subject to the proscription against ex parte contact as the litigation control group,which consists of agents and employees responsible for,or significantly involved in,the determination of the organization legal position in the matter michaels woodland.the court in that case also noted that fact witnesses are not a part of the control group.ibid.another case has defined the control group as being limited to those managerial employees with authority to commit the organization to a position regarding the subject matter of representation.johnson cadillac plastic group.examples of the types of employees capable of committing an organization are those whose duties include making litigation decisions or answering the type of inquiries posed.citation.ibid.these definitions of control group are consistent with california,those high level employees responsible for directing the company actions in response to legal advice.bobele,supra,d at.
courts adopting the control group test conclude that it serves the policies of preserving the availability of witnesses,reducing discovery costs by permitting informal interviews of a broad range of employees,and affording the best opportunity for fact investigation.the test has become disfavored following the upjohn decision,because the control group test is narrower than the privilege rule approved in that case.also,it lacks predictability because it is not always clear which employees fall within the control group.palmer,supra,at.fns.omitted.
cases that have taken a more approach attempt to reconcile the competing interests of attorneys seeking discovery and the legitimate concerns of an organization to protect privileged matter.closest to the blanket rule is the admission test.under this test,contact is proscribed with any employee whose statement might be admissible as a admission.palmer,supra,at.courts adopting the admission test relied upon the language of the former comment to aba model rule and concluded that the former comment reference to admissions was clearly meant to incorporate the rules of evidence governing admissions.palmer,supra,at.supporters of this test reason that it gives a sound practical cast to the rule those who can hurt or bind the organization with respect to the matter at hand are off limits except for formal discovery or except with the consent of the entity lawyer.brown joseph county.in jurisdictions that would interpret the evidentiary rule broadly,it essentially covers all or almost all employees,since any employee could make statements concerning a matter within the scope of his or her employment,and thus could potentially be included within the rule.palmer,supra,at,fn.omitted.
however,this interpretation of the former comment reference to employees whose statements can be considered evidentiary admissions is of doubtful validity today given the deletion of that portion of the comment to aba model rule and the explanation given for that deletion.moreover,in jurisdictions that follow the traditional common law rule,such as california,an employee admission would be imputed to the employer only if the employee had authority to speak on the employer behalf.comment,ethical limitations on investigating employment discrimination claims the prohibition on ex parte contact with a defendant employees davis,fn,italics added.these jurisdictions interpret the common law rule restrictively,typically imputing to the employer only the statements of executives and spokespersons.comment,supra,davis.at.as discussed,ante,california follows this restrictive interpretation of what employee statements constitute admissions on the part of their organizational employer.
the agent test evolved in response to the upjohn decision.jurisdictions following this test reasoned that the protection afforded an organization under the rule should be commensurate with that afforded by the privilege.palmer,supra,at wright by wright group health hosp.wright.wright,the leading case adopting this test,held that the agent test restricts the rule to those employees having managing authority sufficient to give them the right to speak for,and bind,the corporation.wright,supra,at.this test would not bar contact with managers whose responsibilities are unrelated to the representation at issue.id.at comment,supra,davis.at,fn.courts adopting this test have concluded that it best balances the competing policies of protecting the organizational client from overreaching by opposing counsel through direct contact with its employees and agents,and the adverse attorney need for information in the organization exclusive possession that may be too expensive or impractical to obtain through formal discovery.palmer,supra,at wright,supra,at.followers of this rule also note that the purpose of the rule is not to protect an organization from the revelation of prejudicial facts,thus disapproving of the admission test.palmer,supra,at.this test has been adopted by several jurisdictions.comment,supra,davis.at,fn.
some courts have adopted a balancing test.palmer,supra,at.under this test,the particular facts of the case must be examined to determine what informal contacts may be appropriate in light of the parties specific needs.factors to be considered are the claims asserted,the employee position and duties,the employer interests in protecting itself,and the alternatives available to the party seeking an informal interview.baisley missisquoi cemetery ass.however,this test offers little guidance in advance as to whether it is proper to conduct an ex parte interview and has only been applied when an attorney seeks guidance from a court in advance of the contact.palmer,supra,at.
finally,there is what has been called the alter ego or new york test.palmer,supra,at.under this test,a new york court held the rule applied to corporate employees whose acts or omissions in the matter under inquiry are binding on the corporation in effect,the corporation alter egos or imputed to the corporation for purposes of its liability,or employees implementing the advice of counsel.niesig team i.this test would clearly permit direct access to employees who were merely witnesses to an event for which the corporate employer is sued.id.at.
analysis of janikas and lewis status at quantum 
paragraph b 
to determine whether lewis and janikas were within the ambit of rule,we must first determine whether they were officers,directors or managing agents of quantum.the parties agree that neither were officers or directors.the dispute lies in whether they were managing agents of quantum.
quantum concedes that paragraph b refers to quantum control group,officers and agents responsible for directing the company actions in response to legal advice.upjohn,supra,at.nalian,supra,th at,fn,d,quoting citing upjohn.quantum nevertheless goes on to argue that a broad interpretation must be given to the term managing agent,one that would include lewis and janikas even if they were mid or employees,in order to protect the privilege.this argument is unavailing.
in support of its proposition that the term managing agent refers to mid or employees,quantum relies on authority that predates rule,including mills,upjohn,and formal opinion,and ignores the fact that the drafters of rule expressly rejected such a broad rule rather,we must look to the meaning of the term managing agent and the intent of the drafters of rule to determine whether it applied to janikas and lewis.
snider contends that the definition of managing agent in rule is the same as that in civil code section,subdivision b,which requires wrongdoing by an officer,director,or managing agent before punitive damages will be awarded against an organization for an employee act in white ultramar cal th,d,white,a wrongful termination action,the california supreme court defined managing agent for the purposes of organizational liability for punitive damages as including only an employee that exercises substantial discretionary authority over decisions that ultimately determine corporate policy.the high court later restated the test in different terms,holding that a managing agent is an employee that exercise s substantial discretionary authority over significant aspects of a corporation business.id.at,d.in reaching this conclusion,the high court stated that the legislature placed the term managing agent next to the terms officer and director,intending that a managing agent be more than a mere supervisory employee.id.at,d.the court also rejected a broader definition of managing agent,stating that,i f we equate mere supervisory status with managing agent status,we will create a rule where corporate employers are liable for punitive damages in most employment cases.id.at,d.
we conclude that the definition of managing agent in white applies equally well to rule b.first,like civil code section,the term managing agent immediately follows the terms officer and director,indicating an intention to limit the term to management,not mere supervisory employees.this is so because in interpreting statutes and rules we seek to ascertain common characteristics among things of the same kind,class,or nature when they are cataloged in legislative enactments.citation.white,supra,cal th at,d.
further,the history behind rule adoption supports a narrow reading to the term.the drafters specifically stated that they intended that rule would adopt the control group test.while the language of paragraph b may be broader than that test as we discuss,post,paragraph b adopts that test,given the terms employed.a managing agent that exercises substantial discretionary authority over organizational policy making is consistent with the definition of control group members,those officers and agents responsible for directing the company actions in response to legal advice.bobele,supra,d at.
quantum asserts that it would be improper to use the definition of managing agent adopted in the white case because that case sought to limit the award of punitive damages against organizations,whereas rule is designed to protect the privilege,which requires a broader definition.we reject this contention.first,it ignores the white court discussion of the grouping of the words officer,director or managing agent.rule and civil code section use the exact same grouping.further,to support this proposition quantum again relies upon mills and upjohn,authority that the drafters of rule rejected in adopting the final language for paragraph b.in fact,the drafters of rule expressly intended that the number of covered employees be limited in scope.thus,the policy reasons behind the definition of managing agent enunciated in white are consistent with the policies behind rule.in sum,we conclude that the term managing agent in rule refers to those employees that exercise substantial discretionary authority over decisions that determine organizational policy.
applying this definition to janikas and lewis,there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that they fit within the definition of managing agents.quantum president navarre described janikas as a supervisory employee who could enforce quantum policies,and stated that she relied upon janikas when she navarre was setting corporate policy.however,navarre did not state that janikas had the discretion and authority to set corporate policy as to any issues,much less the matter involved in this litigation.indeed,she stated that she and the company were the only persons at quantum.navarre stated nothing in her declaration concerning lewis status at quantum.therefore,janikas and lewis did not fall within the terms of paragraph b of rule.
paragraph b 
quantum argues that janikas and lewis were improperly contacted because they fell within the terms of paragraph b of rule,as each was an employee whose act or omission in connection with the matter may be binding upon or imputed to the organization for purposes of civil or criminal liability or whose statement may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.this argument is unavailing.
preliminarily,this argument fails because there is no evidence that the subject matter of the contacts with the employees was concerning any act or omission of such person in connection with the matter.the interview with janikas did not concern her own actions or omissions concerning the dispute,but her percipient knowledge and understanding of events surrounding the dispute.in fact,quantum does not,and the trial court did not,address this issue.
quantum focuses on the second category in paragraph b of rule,those employees whose statements may constitute an admission on the part of the organization.however,as discussed,ante,this category only applies to executives and spokespersons with the authority to speak on behalf of the organization.comment,supra,davis.at.mitsubishi electronics america,supra,th at,d.this interpretation is again consistent with the drafters of rule rejection of the broader interpretation of the rule under former rule,and their desire to limit prohibited contact to only the organization control group.
it is also consistent with the california supreme court and the drafters intent to follow the comment to model rule and the language of chadbourne,supra,cal d,in their final revisions to this portion of rule b.the comment to model rule was revised,omitting that portion discussing admissions by employees.in doing so,it was made clear that the original comment,upon which paragraph b was based,was to be given a narrow interpretation,limited to those few jurisdictions with a law of evidence providing that statements by certain employees of an organization were not only admissible against the organization but could not thereafter be controverted by the organization.palmer,supra,at,fn.omitted.chadbourne used language that,applied to rule b,would limit its application to management who speak for the organization.
it does appear that rule b could apply to persons outside the control group if in fact the employee was given actual authority to speak on behalf of the organization or could bind it with regard to the subject matter of the litigation.despite the comments of the drafters of rule,this portion of the rule appears to follow the agent test those employees hav ing managing authority sufficient to give them the right to speak for,and bind,the corporation.wright,supra,at.this interpretation best reconciles the language of the statute and the drafters intent to narrowly circumscribe the type of employees who would be covered by the rule.
the fact remains,however,that even under this test there was no evidence presented that janikas or lewis had authority from quantum to speak concerning this dispute or any other matter,or that their actions could bind or be imputed to quantum concerning the subject matter of this litigation.in sum,the evidence presented by quantum does not demonstrate that janikas and lewis were employees subject to the terms of rule b.
protection for employees privy to information 
quantum argues that larabee violated rule and disqualification was proper because he violated quantum relationship and received confidential information concerning the litigation.quantum also asserts that to protect the relationship between employees and their employer counsel,attorneys should be prohibited from contacting any employees of a represented organization.these arguments are unpersuasive.
in arguing for such a broad interpretation of rule quantum again relies upon cases and bar association opinions that predate the promulgation of rule.quantum ignores the legislative history for rule that expressly rejected the broad rule prohibiting any employee contact that upjohn and the bar association opinions suggested.instead,as we discussed above,the drafters opted for a combination of the control group and agent tests as the best balance between the competing policies of protecting confidential communications and allowing discovery of factual matters concerning the litigation.
further,there was no evidence presented that larabee actually violated the privilege existing between quantum and its counsel.there was no evidence presented that quantum counsel had any communications with janikas or lewis prior to larabee contacts and attempted contacts with them.indeed,janikas admitted both in her conversation with larabee and in her declaration that she had never spoken with counsel for quantum at the time of larabee contact.lewis declaration is silent on this issue.
quantum argues that larabee admitted lewis told him that corporate counsel coached her testimony.however,this misstates the record.larabee stated in his declaration that lewis,on her own,contacted snider and told him that counsel for quantum made her rewrite her declaration several times and told her what to say.this does not establish violation of the privilege by larabee.it further is not a violation of rule as the rule is not intended to prevent the parties themselves from communicating with respect to the subject matter of the representation.discussion com,pt,west ann.rules of conduct ed.foll.rule.
quantum also points to larabee questioning of janikas as to why quantum sued snider.we agree that this question was ill advised if larabee did not know if the employee was privy to confidential communications with counsel.however,if janikas had been privy to protected information and it was disclosed to larabee,quantum would still have a remedy,regardless of whether janikas came within the terms of rule.if an attorney violates the privilege the court may disqualify him or her from further participation in the case citation and,under certain circumstances,may exclude improperly obtained evidence or take other appropriate measures to achieve justice and ameliorate the effect of improper conduct.triple a,supra,d at.however,janikas has not asserted in her declaration that she was privy to such information or that she divulged it to larabee.
quantum points to larabee questions concerning a key company meeting janikas attended.however,again there is no indication that counsel was present at that meeting and that confidential information was discussed.indeed,it appears that the meeting that was discussed occurred before snider left quantum,and larabee questions were only concerning factual matters of which janikas was a percipient witness.there were no questions concerning anything janikas did that could be binding on the organization.moreover,as we have already concluded,quantum did not establish that janikas was an employee with authority to speak on behalf of the organization such that anything she told larabee would constitute an admission on the part of the organization.
quantum argues that because janikas states in her declaration that larabee asked her many more questions i can not remember right now,there might have been confidential information disclosed.however,this is mere speculation that can not support a finding of a violation of rule,or disqualification of counsel.
with regard to quantum concerns that there could be a breach of the privilege if attorneys were allowed to contact employees of a represented organization without advance permission,two points.first,organizations such as quantum can instruct their employees to contact them before speaking to opposing counsel or they can send the other party a letter warning that their employees are represented by counsel in the matter,and may not be interviewed under rule without the consent of counsel.jorgensen taco bell th,d jorgensen.
