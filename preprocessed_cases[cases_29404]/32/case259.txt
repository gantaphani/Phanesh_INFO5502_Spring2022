background 
the florida bar filed a complaint against abramson in april,alleging that abramson violated several of the rules regulating the florida bar.following a hearing,the referee filed his report with the court in april.the facts,as found by the referee,established the following conduct by abramson.
abramson represented the defendant in a criminal jury trial in the fifteenth judicial circuit court in and for palm beach county,the honorable richard wennet presiding as the judge.abramson client was charged with the felony of driving with a revoked license and in an unregistered motor vehicle.abramson filed a demand for speedy trial the case was set for trial on december.judge wennet arrived approximately sixteen minutes late on the date set for trial.
abramson believed the case could be disposed of quickly by a motion for discharge or a change of plea,and he wanted judge wennet to entertain his motions before the proceedings began.however,the prospective jurors were already seated for jury selection to begin,and judge wennet immediately began jury selection.he did not want to interrupt the process by having a sidebar or a conversation with the attorneys outside the presence of the prospective jurors.judge wennet was not at fault for exercising his discretion to address abramson motions after selecting the jury and for not wanting to interrupt that process.
almost immediately after judge wennet introduced himself and began speaking to the prospective jurors,abramson interrupted him and asked to approach the bench.judge wennet asked abramson to be seated,but abramson continued to ask to approach.judge wennet refused to allow abramson to approach and informed abramson that he would hear his motions after the voir dire was completed.abramson continued to interrupt the proceedings.he was discourteous and disrespectful to judge wennet in the presence of the prospective jurors.his conduct interrupted the proceedings by focusing their attention on him instead of the court.the assistant state attorney in the case,dan funk,testified that abramson was visibly upset and insistent and disregarded judge wennet instructions.funk described abramson conduct as beyond belief and unlike anything he had seen before.
abramson misconduct continued when it was his turn to question the prospective jurors.he was disrespectful of judge wennet,disparaging the trial judge qualifications to the prospective jurors.abramson the prospective jurors or in their judge wennet had been completely disrespectful and unprofessional and had violated the rules and procedures.abramson asked the prospective jurors whether they felt that judge wennet conduct was appropriate.the prospective jurors said that they thought abramson had been disrespectful to judge wennet.
abramson made the following statements during his voir dire of the prospective jurors.
okay,so for all you know,the judge was the one that was completely disrespectful,lacking in respect,lacking in professionalism,and it was not me you do know that because you were not here earlier,correct 
okay.so,if,in fact,i doing what i think is legally right and the judge is preventing me from doing my job,it is actually the judge that is unprofessional,not me,right 
this judge said no.he violated the procedures he violated the rules he was disrespectful and he was unprofessional,not me.and that the answer to your question,lewis.
outside the presence of the prospective jurors,abramson told judge wennet that judge wennet had been disrespectful,not abramson.
no matter what i did wrong,judge,no matter what i did,it is one hundred percent disrespectful of the the jury thinks it me,but,actually,judge,it was a hundred percent you,and it completely your fault that this case denigrated itself to the point that it got.
ultimately,the client discharged abramson as her attorney,the trial did not go forward that day,and the prospective jurors were dismissed.judge wennet initiated contempt proceedings against abramson but decided to refer the matter to the florida bar instead.
the referee found that abramson failed to realize that judge wennet exercise of his discretion was not an issue in the bar disciplinary proceedings against own conduct and actions were.the referee further found that abramson conduct was deliberate and knowing,and as a result,the tribunal had been disrupted.abramson impugned the qualifications and integrity of the judge and sought to impermissibly influence the prospective jurors.his actions were prejudicial to the administration of justice.
the referee recommended that abramson be found guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar a prohibiting a lawyer from seeking to influence a judge,juror,prospective juror,or other decision maker except as permitted by law or the rules of court c prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal a prohibiting a lawyer from making a statement that the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity concerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge and d prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,including knowingly,or through callous indifference,disparaging,humiliating,or discriminating against court personnel on any basis,including,but not limited to,on account of race,ethnicity,gender,religion,national origin,disability,marital status,sexual orientation,age,socioeconomic status,employment,or physical characteristic.
the referee recommended that abramson be publicly reprimanded by the board of governors of the florida bar serve one year of supervised probation to begin immediately attend the professionalism workshop presented by the florida bar within six months or if not offered within that time,the first available one,at his own cost,and submit proof of completion to the bar within thirty days attend the ethics school presented by the florida bar within six months or if not offered within that time,the first available one,at his own cost,and submit proof of completion to the bar within thirty days and pay the bar costs of and any additional costs incurred.
in arriving at his sanction recommendations,the referee stated that he considered the florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions and caselaw.despite this statement,the referee did not cite any particular standards or cases in support of his sanction recommendations other than the standards relating to mitigating and aggravating factors.
the referee found the following aggravating factors applicable abramson had two prior disciplinary offenses he had multiple offenses and he had substantial experience in the practice of law.he found the following mitigating factors applicable the facts and circumstances of the case were extreme and highly unusual abramson had participated in many pro bono matters he lacked a dishonest or selfish motive abramson was of good character and reputation and he exhibited remorse.

as a preliminary matter,neither party challenges the referee findings of fact and recommendations of guilt.accordingly,we approve those findings and recomme
