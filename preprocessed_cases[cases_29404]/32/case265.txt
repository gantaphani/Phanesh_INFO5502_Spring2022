we review a referee report recommending that respondent mark germain be found guilty of unethical conduct and suspended from the practice of law for days.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.for the reasons explained below,we approve the referee findings of misconduct but disapprove the referee recommendation of a day suspension and instead suspend the respondent from the practice of law for one year.
procedural background 
the florida bar filed two separate complaints against germain,which were consolidated and tried together before a referee.before the hearing,the bar and germain entered into a stipulation about the facts.the stipulation established many of the facts alleged in the complaints,as well as other facts not alleged.
the referee filed two separate reports.the first report made factual findings and conclusions of guilt in both cases.the second and final report,issued after a separate hearing on the issue of discipline,contained the findings and conclusions contained in the first report,factual findings not made in the first report,findings concerning aggravating and mitigating factors,and recommendations of discipline.the facts,as found by the referee or as established by the stipulation,are summarized below.
factual background 
this case arose from a dispute between germain and michael norvell concerning ownership of a building called the lake law center the building and the employment of james cardona,who was a paralegal first for germain and then for norvell.in november,germain executed a promissory note for for norvell in exchange for a ownership of the building,where germain and norvell operated separate law firms.in april,norvell offered to purchase germain interest for.germain rejected the offer.
in march,germain fired cardona,his paralegal.the following month,norvell increased his offer for germain interest in the building to.he also offered,in writing,to sell his share to germain for.germain tentatively accepted the offer to purchase norvell interest,but was unable to obtain financing.
that same month,on april,germain filed a police report alleging that norvell had physically attacked him.the officer reported seeing a large contusion on germain arm along with several slight abrasions.on april,norvell entered one of the offices in the building,removed germain files,and sat behind the desk and in front of the computer.germain and norvell disputed ownership of that office.that same day,cardona reported to work at the building,as norvell had hired him.cardona and germain argued.germain physically escorted cardona off the premises.
the next day,april,germain delivered a no trespass warning to cardona mother.germain placed a lock on the door to the disputed office and placed a warning on the door.the following day,norvell removed the door from its hinges and entered the office.germain called the police,who responded.germain accused cardona of trespassing even though he knew cardona had norvell permission to be there and that norvell owned of the building.germain then filed against norvell a petition for injunction for protection against repeat violence norvell petition.in it,germain swore that norvell had a hand gun with ammunition in our office.the court entered a temporary injunction against norvell.
germain also filed against cardona a petition for injunction for protection against repeat violence cardona petition.in it,germain alleged that cardona is stalking me and is trying to sabotage my law practice.the petition did not allege any acts of violence or repeat violence by cardona,as those terms are defined in section a b,florida statutes,rendering the petition meritless.cardona responded by filing against germain a petition for injunction for protection against repeat violence germain petition.
a week later norvell filed a suit for partition of the building and other relief partition action.germain filed an emergency motion in which he swore that norvell is also a convicted felon and germain has personally observed norvell handle a loaded pistol in the office.
on june,germain and norvell entered into a settlement agreement in the partition action.germain agreed to withdraw the norvell petition and to execute an affidavit about the firearm allegation june affidavit.the june affidavit stated after some thought,i recall that the pistol was actually in possession of the office paralegal,rebecca skipper and not michael norvell.it also stated at no time,was the gun ever in norvell office or in norvell possession and t hat sometime in rebecca skipper removed the gun from the office.germain signed it under oath.
a few days later,cardona filed a motion to dismiss the cardona petition.the motion also asked the court to award him in attorney fees as a sanction against germain for filing a frivolous petition.the court held a hearing on the motion.germain subpoenaed the police officer who took germain trespassing complaint,but the court would not allow the officer or germain to testify.the court did allow germain to proffer the testimony.the court dismissed the petition,finding that it does not allege facts supporting an injunction for protection against repeat violence,and the facts proffered by petitioner failed to establish a basis for such an injunction.there was no evidence of violence or imminent fear of violence by respondent toward petitioner.
on july,norvell paid germain for his share of the building.two weeks later,the court entered an amended order dismissing the cardona petition,denying germain motion for reconsideration,and granting cardona motion for sanctions.the court found germain claims were so clearly devoid of merit both on the facts and the law as to be completely untenable.
a week later germain filed a motion to disqualify the judge in the cardona petition case.the motion made sworn allegations that the judge should be disqualified,in part,because of a conflict of interest presented by his relationship with lennon bowen,an attorney,and bowen relationship with cardona.two days later he filed a motion for reconsideration of the cardona petition dismissal,arguing the dismissal was improper without an evidentiary hearing.germain swore the cardona petition was not frivolous because convicted felon michael norvell possession of a gun gun sic in the office is not frivolous.
seven months later,in march,germain again moved the trial court to set aside the order dismissing the cardona petition.the motion alleged that the judge who dismissed the petition,who was no longer presiding over the case,had been chief assistant state attorney when germain sued the state attorney years before and that the judge,as an assistant state attorney,prosecuted germain in a contempt proceeding a few years later.according to germain,bowen,who had represented cardona in prior proceedings,was the judge campaign manager when the judge dismissed the petition.germain also alleged the judge had solicited a campaign contribution from him while the petition was pending and that the solicitation was inappropriate,if not illegal.in fact,bowen was not the judge campaign manager and never represented cardona.the solicitation was a invitation to a event mailed by a host committee,not the judge.
in several pleadings,in hearings before the trial court and the referee,and in his brief filed in this court,germain referred to norvell as a convicted felon,cunning,devious,and diabolical.he accused norvell of killing an elderly client and threatening to kill him.germain referred to cardona as a fugitive and accused him of trespassing,stalking,and stealing he described them as two convicted criminals vouching for each other.
the referee found that no reasonable person would have feared that norvell would kill,and that no reasonable person would have had a fear that would justify giving a false statement under oath.he also found the violence between norvell and germain had declined over time and that germain had willingly remained in the arrangement with norvell.
the second bar complaint arose from germain actions in state guerreo,jud.cir,order of contempt.germain represented the defendant in a proceeding in september.during that proceeding,the judge warned germain that he was going to cite germain for contempt if he continued to interrupt him.despite the warning,germain interrupted twice more.the judge cited him for two counts of direct criminal contempt.after a hearing,the judge found germain guilty of two counts of contempt and fined him.germain paid the,but filed a motion for reconsideration.the trial judge dismissed the order of contempt,but refused to order the refund of germain fine.
rule violations 
the referee concluded that germain conduct violated rule failing to assert only meritorious claims and contentions,rule a making a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal,rule c knowingly disobeying an obligation under the rules of a tribunal,c engaging in conduct intended to disrupt tribunal,and rule d engaging in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice three counts of the rules regulating the florida bar.
the referee found four aggravating factors previous discipline,including a public reprimand in for making disparaging remarks in several instances about opposing counsel and a judge and failing to follow the rulings of a trial judge a pattern of misconduct as established by the earlier misconduct of a similar nature multiple offenses and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct.the referee found three mitigating factors absence of a dishonest or selfish motive personal or emotional problems and physical or mental disability or impairment.
recommendation of discipline 
the referee recommended a suspension,followed by one year of probation after reinstatement an evaluation by a mental health professional and abiding by any recommended treatment or counseling,continuing through the probationary period and reimbursement of the bar costs.the referee relied on florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions,and,as well as florida bar adams,so d.
germain petitioned for review of the report.he contends the referee erred in excluding evidence of norvell alleged exploitation of an elderly client,challenges several of the findings,questions the application of two of the aggravating factors,and argues that the referee erred in failing to find several additional mitigating factors.he also takes issue with the recommendations of a mental health evaluation and suspension.
we first address the exclusion of evidence issue.a referee admission of evidence is reviewed for abuse of discretion.bar rotstein,so d.in this case,the referee excluded testimony about norvell alleged actions involving an elderly client.germain argues that this evidence was relevant to whether his fear of norvell was reasonable and,to support his claim that he signed the june affidavit under duress.
assuming that germain allegations are true,the facts that norvell unethically made himself a beneficiary under his client will and then decided to remove her from life support does not tend to prove that he coerced germain to execute the june affidavit.the referee did not abuse his discretion in excluding it.see a.stat.providing that similar fact evidence of other crimes,wrongs,or acts is inadmissible when relevant solely to prove bad character or propensity.moreover,any error would have been harmless.there is competent,substantial evidence in the record that germain did not sign the june affidavit under duress.germain never advised the court that he had been coerced into signing it.he never sought to have the settlement overturned or set aside.he never filed a police report to the effect that norvell unlawfully possessed a gun.germain accused norvell of having a gun in the office only in civil pleadings and civil hearings.these were not the actions of someone who believed he was in danger.accordingly,we approve the referee decision to exclude this evidence.
we next consider the factual findings germain challenges.the party contending that the referee findings of fact and conclusions as to guilt are erroneous carries the burden of demonstrating that there is no evidence in the record to support those findings or that the record evidence clearly contradicts the conclusions.bar carlon,so d.specifically,germain challenges the following findings the cardona petition was frivolous germain comments concerning the trial judge,norvell,and cardona were inappropriate germain misled the police officer by not telling him that cardona had norvell permission to be on the premises of the building germain made false statements under oath germain was not under duress when he executed the june affidavit and norvell violence toward germain had declined over time.
germain points to contradictory evidence in the record or,presumably,in his proffers,to support his claims of error.he nevertheless fails to meet his burden to demonstrate that there is no evidence in the record to support the referee findings.the findings are supported in large part by the facts to which germain stipulated.
in the june affidavit,germain stated under oath that norvell never possessed the gun,the gun was in the possession of a paralegal,and the paralegal had removed the gun from the office in.yet,both before and after june,germain filed pleadings alleging that norvell had a gun in the office.he tries to defend the fact that he lied under oath,either in the june affidavit or in the pleadings filed before and after it,by claiming that norvell coerced him to sign the affidavit.the referee found that no reasonable person would have been in fear of his life and that no reasonable person would have felt compelled to lie under oath.
germain failure to advise the court that he signed the affidavit under duress is compelling evidence that he was not coerced into signing it.the assertion of duress has other flaws,however.accusing norvell of having possession of a gun in subsequent civil pleadings was inconsistent with his purported fear of norvell.further,if the building was worth,as germain claimed in his brief,norvell would not have offered to sell germain his interest for.for that matter,germain would have been able to obtain financing for if the collateral had been worth over twice that amount.
germain points concerning the other disputed factual findings are equally flawed and boil down to credibility assessments.as the referee is in a unique position to assess witness credibility,this court will not overturn his judgment absent clear and convincing evidence.see.bar carricarte,so d.there is no evidence that the referee judgment is incorrect in this case.accordingly,we approve these factual findings.
germain also argues the referee erred in finding the aggravating factor of previous discipline based upon a finding that he had been publicly reprimanded for disparaging remarks about a judge.he also challenges the aggravating factor of refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct.finally,he faults the referee for failing to find the following mitigating factors imposition of other penalties or sanctions remorse and remoteness of prior offenses.
like other factual findings,a referee findings of mitigation and aggravation carry a presumption of correctness and will be upheld unless clearly erroneous or without support in the record.bar arcia,so d.a referee failure to find that an aggravating factor or mitigating factor applies is due the same deference.see.bar morse,so d.bar bustamante,so d.bar hecker,so d.germain fails to meet his burden.
competent,substantial evidence supports the referee findings.as to the mitigating factor that other penalties already have been imposed,germain paid cardona to settle an attorney fee award greater than.thus,his payment was less than half the amount awarded.moreover,the cardona petition is only a small part of the conduct resulting in discipline.the fine germain paid in the criminal case is also just a small part of this case.in light of all of germain misconduct,we can not say the referee erred in failing to find that the imposition of these penalties or sanctions constituted mitigation.
similarly,germain presented little or no evidence of remorse upon which the referee could have based a finding of this mitigating factor.while germain claims he apologize
