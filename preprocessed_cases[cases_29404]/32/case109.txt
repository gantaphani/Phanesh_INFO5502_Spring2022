appellant jim price appeals the bankruptcy appellate panel bap decision affirming the bankruptcy court order suspending him.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
in october or november,debtor patricia lehtinen debtor retained jim price to represent her in a chapter proceeding.debtor was primarily concerned with selling her house to repay certain debts.
debtor petition was filed before the bankruptcy court,northern district of california.on february,debtor attended the meeting of the creditors.price did not attend this meeting and sent a contract attorney instead.debtor alleges that price failed to inform her that he would not attend.
price also referred debtor to rene boisvert of boulevard equity group so that debtor could obtain a loan to fix up her house.boisvert told debtor that boulevard would lend her the funds and pay off the first deed of trust on her house,and that boulevard would be repaid from the proceeds of the sale,but only if debtor retained price as a broker for the sale.debtor never completed the loan documents,and sold her house through another realtor without informing price.
the trustee served notice of a june,confirmation hearing on price and debtor.debtor called the trustee office in april,and was advised that she had until the confirmation hearing to either sell her home,refinance her home,or amend her plan.she was also advised that she was required to attend the hearing.according to debtor,this was the first time she had heard of the confirmation hearing because price had failed to notify her.
price did not appear at the june,confirmation hearing.at the request of another client,he had agreed to appear in another court even though he knew it conflicted with the confirmation hearing.he did not request a continuance of either hearing.debtor attended the confirmation hearing alone,and informed the court that her house was pending sale.the court confirmed the plan with a payout to unsecured creditors.
without checking the outcome of the confirmation hearing,price sent a letter to debtor on june,stating that her case had been dismissed,that he could refile another case for her or help her to sell the house,and that the bank could proceed with the foreclosure on her house.price admits that sending the letter was a mistake.he assumed the case had been dismissed because he missed the hearing and because debtor was behind on her payments to the trustee.price testified that he sent the letter to urge debtor to do something.
on june,the bankruptcy court issued an order to show cause why price should not disgorge all or part of his fee for failure to appear at the meeting of the creditors and the confirmation hearing hereinafter first osc.on july,the bankruptcy court held a hearing on these issues.on july,it entered an order resolving both absences by ordering price to disgorge of the fee.
after the hearing,but before the issuance of the order,debtor sent a letter to the bankruptcy court stating that price never informed her of the confirmation hearing date that she learned of the hearing date from the trustee that price was a real estate broker and pressured debtor to list her house with his brokerage firm and that price referred debtor to his friend for a home improvement loan,who had conditioned the loan on her engaging price as her broker.debtor also attached the june,letter from price.
based on debtor letter,the bankruptcy court issued a second order to show cause why price should not be sanctioned pursuant to this court inherent sanction power for bad faith conduct,and why he should not be suspended or disbarred from practice in this court hereinafter second osc.the second osc identified four instances of alleged misconduct price failure to attend and to inform debtor of her confirmation hearing the pressuring of debtor to list her house for sale with his brokerage firm the lender condition of retaining price as the broker for the loan transaction and his letter to debtor falsely informing her that her bankruptcy case had been dismissed and that a foreclosure sale was imminent.the second osc also stated that the facts point to a clear conflict of interest between price acting as the debtor lawyer,soliciting the debtor to use his services as a real estate broker,and serving as a loan broker.moreover,it described the evidence required regarding the sanctionable conduct.the second osc,however,did not identify applicable rules or sections.
the bankruptcy court held the second osc hearing on july.on october,it ordered price to disgorge the balance of the fee and suspended him from practicing before the bankruptcy court of the northern district of california for three months.it concluded that price violated several parts of the california rules of professional conduct and the california business professions code.
on october,price filed an appeal and obtained a stay of the suspension with the bap.on october,the bap concluded that the bankruptcy court was within its authority in sanctioning price,and afforded him due process,but vacated the suspension and remanded to the bankruptcy court for consideration of the american bar association standards in disciplining price.price lehtinen in re lehtinen,cir.bap.
on november,price appealed to this court.no answering brief was filed.
jurisdiction 
we have jurisdiction over final decisions of the bap under d.although there is some question as to the finality of the bap decision because the bap vacated the portion of the bankruptcy court order suspending price and remanded for further proceedings,see foothill capital clare food,in re coupon clearing,cir,we have jurisdiction over a order in a bankruptcy case where the appeal concerns primarily a question of law,demarah united states in re demarah,cir accord bonner mall bancorp mortgage in re bonner mall,cir,cert.granted,d,dismissed as moot,d.this case concerns the bankruptcy court power to sanction.because this is a purely legal question,we have jurisdiction.see knupfer lindblade in re dyer,cir.
although price argues that the proceeding is,the acts and events upon which his suspension was predicated occurred in the course of his representation of debtor in matters central to the administration of her case.as such,the disciplinary hearing fits well within the ambit of a core proceeding.b a 
standard of review 
this court independently reviews the bankruptcy court rulings on appeal from the bap.miller cardinale in re deville,cir.this court reviews an award of sanctions for an abuse of discretion.id.due process challenges are reviewed de novo.willamette waterfront,victoria station in re victoria station,cir.a court interpretation and application of a local rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion.united states heller,cir.
discussion 
price argues the bap decision should be reversed because the bankruptcy court lacked the power to suspend him he was not accorded due process and the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by failing to follow cal.civ.we address each argument in turn.
i.the bankruptcy court inherent power to suspend attorneys 
bankruptcy courts generally have the power to sanction attorneys pursuant to their civil contempt authority under a and their inherent sanction authority.dyer,at.the bankruptcy court sanctioned price under its inherent sanction powers.
in chambers nasco,the supreme court held that the inherent power of a federal court permits it,inter alia,to control admission to its bar and to discipline attorneys who appear before it,d.in caldwell unified capital in re rainbow magazine,this court held that bankruptcy courts also have the inherent power to sanction that chambers recognized exists within article iii courts,cir.although a simple reading of both chambers and caldwell suggests that the bankruptcy court has the power to suspend attorneys,this court subsequent cases have limited the scope of the bankruptcy court inherent power,see,dyer,at,warranting further analysis.
a bankruptcy court inherent power allows it to sanction bad faith or willful misconduct,even in the absence of express statutory authority to do so.id.at.it also allows a bankruptcy court to deter and provide compensation for a broad range
