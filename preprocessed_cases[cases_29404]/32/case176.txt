section of the business and professions code permits the revocation of a license on the ground that the licensee has been convicted of a crime,if the crime is substantially related to the qualifications,functions,or duties of the business or profession for which the license was issued the real estate commissioner issued a decision revoking lance robbins license as a real estate broker,based on three criminal convictions for misdemeanor violations of the fire protection and prevention provisions of the los angeles municipal code,all strict liability offenses to which robbins had entered pleas of nolo contendere.robbins sought a writ of mandate requiring the commissioner to set aside the decision revoking his license.the trial court denied robbins petition.
robbins contends the trial court judgment must be reversed because there is no substantial relationship,as a matter of law,between his crimes and the qualifications,functions or duties of a real estate licensee.we disagree and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
robbins was licensed as a real estate broker,and is also an attorney.on january,he pled nolo contendere and was convicted of three misdemeanor violations of the fire protection and prevention provisions of the los angeles municipal obstruction of buildings,failing to test a fire signal system,and failing to inspect fire extinguishers.robbins was fined,placed on summary probation for months and required to pay investigative costs incurred by the fire department.
in march,the department of real estate filed an accusation alleging robbins convictions constituted cause for the suspension or revocation of his license as a broker,as they were crimes involving moral turpitude which were substantially related to the qualifications,functions and duties of a real estate licensee.in a first amended accusation filed in february,the department alleged,in aggravation,that in the period between and,robbins had been convicted of some municipal building code violations,and was twice disciplined in and by the state bar of california with private reprovals the record of conviction of a crime is conclusive evidence only that the conviction occurred,but the department may inquire into the circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime in order to fix the degree of discipline or to determine if the conviction is substantially related to the qualifications,functions,and duties of the licensee in question.
a hearing was held during four days in and,and in september the administrative law judge alj issued a proposed decision revoking robbins license,concluding that 
a substantial relationship existed between robbins convictions and the qualifications,functions or duties of a licensee.the code violations arose out of robbins ownership management of apartments robbins indicated this was a very profitable business and his convictions resulted from his failure to take care of health and safety requirements for the tenants of the apartments.this met the requirements described in the department regulations,which state that a substantial relationship is established by the d oing of any unlawful act with the intent of conferring a financial or economic benefit upon the perpetrator or with the intent or threat of doing substantial injury to the person or property of another,tit,subd.a.
cause existed for suspension or revocation of robbins real estate license because he was convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude involving the health and safety of the community and inhabitants of the apartments in question and which were substantially related to the qualifications,functions or duties of a licensee 
given the number of years in which robbins was charged with building code health and safety violations,and the fact that he continued to be in a business affecting the management and operation of a large number of apartments in los angeles,it was too early to determine that he was sufficiently rehabilitated to retain his license 
the commissioner adopted the proposed decision and denied robbins subsequent motion for reconsideration.
on december,robbins filed a verified petition for writ of administrative mandamus,seeking to compel the commissioner to set aside the decision revoking his license.robbins also applied ex parte for a stay of the administrative decision.the stay was denied by judge david yaffe on the ground granting a stay would not be in the public interest 
after a hearing in december,the trial court judge dzintra janavs denied robbins petition.the court concluded that the weight of the evidence in the record supported the alj findings that robbins convictions involved moral turpitude and were substantially related to the qualifications,functions and duties of robbins as a real estate licensee there was no abuse of discretion and the alj properly considered robbins extensive prior history and conduct as evidenced by a multitude of prior convictions.
robbins motion for reconsideration was denied,objections to the proposed judgment were overruled,and judgment was entered denying robbins petition.robbins filed a timely appeal.
discussion 
robbins contends that,in order to revoke his license,the department had to establish that the crimes of which he was convicted were crimes of moral turpitude and were substantially related to the qualifications,functions or duties of a real estate licensee,and that,as a matter of law,neither requirement was established.as we explain in the margin,legislative changes have clarified that the question of moral turpitude is irrelevant,and consequently the only question in this case is whether robbins crimes were substantially related to the qualifications,functions or duties of a real estate licensee because we conclude they were,we affirm the judgment.
the standard of review.
when a trial court rules on a petition for writ of mandate following a license revocation,it must examine the record for errors of law,and exercise its independent judgment to determine whether the weight of the evidence supported the administrative decision.bixby pierno cal d,fn,yakov board of medical examiners cal d,yakov.after the trial court has exercised its independent judgment upon the weight of the evidence,an appellate court function is solely to decide whether credible,competent evidence supports the trial court judgment.yakov,supra,cal d at.the trial court legal conclusions,however,are open to appellate review for errors of law.green board of dental examiners th,d.whether a licensee convictions are substantially related to his or her professional qualifications is a question of law.donaldson department of real estate th,d donaldson.
robbins convictions for municipal code violations were substantially related to the qualifications of a real estate licensee.
a determination that a licensee conviction justifies discipline requires a reasoned determination that the conduct was in fact substantially related to the licensee fitness to engage in the profession.donaldson,supra,th at,d,fn.omitted.as donaldson explains,licensing authorities do not have unfettered discretion to determine whether a given conviction is substantially related to the relevant professional qualifications.id.at,d.licensing authorities are required to develop criteria to aid them in making that determination.the department criteria appear in section of title of the california code of regulations.as applicable here,those criteria state 
when considering whether a license should be denied,suspended or revoked on the basis of the conviction of a crime,the crime shall be deemed to be substantially related to the qualifications,functions or duties of a licensee of the department if it involves doing of any unlawful act with the intent of conferring a financial or economic benefit upon the perpetrator or with the intent or threat of doing substantial injury to the person or property of another.regs,tit,subd.a.
