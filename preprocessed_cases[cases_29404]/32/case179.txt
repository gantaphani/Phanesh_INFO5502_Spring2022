gary vincent ventimiglia appeals from an order denying his petition for an administrative writ of mandate to overturn a decision by the california board of behavioral sciences the board revoking his license as a marriage and family therapist because he engaged in sexual contact with a client.he contends the board was required by the administrative procedure act,et,apa to allow written or oral argument after this court affirmed a superior court order granting his earlier petition for writ of mandate on the ground that the board did not recognize it had discretion to stay the penalty of revocation 
we conclude that government code section,subdivision c e ii of the apa applies on remand and that the board failed to allow argument as required by that statute.the board therefore abused its discretion because it failed to proceed in the manner required by law,a ground for relief under code of civil procedure section section.the trial court erred in denying the petition for writ of administrative mandate on this ground.in light of this conclusion,we do not reach ventimiglia alternative arguments that he was deprived of due process under the federal and state constitutions and that the board failed to comply with the original writ of administrative mandate.
factual and procedural summary 
ventimiglia had practiced as a licensed marriage and family therapist since.in,he began a sexual relationship with a patient,which lasted until august.during this time he continued to treat his attempt to end the relationship in led to an altercation in which ventimiglia attempted to physically remove from his office,and police were called.reported their relationship to the board.
in april,the board filed an accusation against ventimiglia based on his sexual relationship with.at a hearing before an administrative law judge,ventimiglia stipulated that the following portion of the accusation was true and that no proof would be required from on or about august,until on or about august,ventimiglia rendered therapy to.initially,the sessions were three times a week,later the sessions increased to five or six times a week.ventimiglia failed to establish reasonable boundaries with in that the sessions became more personal,including physical contact.ventimiglia improperly engaged in a dual relationship with,which included a sexual relationship.ventimiglia knew or should have known that his patient was in an emotional and vulnerable position.ventimiglia failed to maintain professional goals,boundaries and appropriate behavior in a counseling relationship.
the administrative law judge issued a proposed decision recommending revocation of ventimiglia license.he found ventimiglia presented a substantial amount of evidence regarding the background of his therapeutic and sexual relationship with,his realization of the consequences of his conduct,psychological factors which drove him to violate the boundaries between himself and his patient,and his rehabilitation therefrom.the evidence was impressive,credible,and of such significance that,but for the law which mandates revocation of his license,might otherwise have led to a disciplinary order less stringent than that set forth below.in a footnote,the administrative law judge noted that it was not necessary to detail evidence of ventimiglia efforts at rehabilitation since revocation of his license was mandatory.
ventimiglia was found to have violated business and professions code section which bars therapists and other medical providers from engaging in sexual contact with a patient or client.the administrative law judge cited business and professions code section in concluding that revocation of ventimiglia license was mandatory.
the board deleted the administrative law judge footnote stating that ventimiglia rehabilitation need not be discussed because revocation was mandatory.as so amended,the board adopted the proposed decision as its decision.ventimiglia brought a petition for writ of administrative mandate pursuant to section.ventimiglia board of behavioral sciences,no.he argued the board had the discretion to issue a lesser penalty and that the board had failed to recognize and exercise that discretion.
the trial court ruled in favor of ventimiglia,concluding that the board had abused its discretion by not proceeding in the manner required by law based on the relevant legislative history,the trial court concluded that former business and professions code section gave the board discretion to stay the revocation.the trial court concluded here,the board decision to revoke ventimiglia license was based on the erroneous interpretation of that it had no discretion other than to revoke the license.as such,the decision was an abuse of discretion in that the board,in effect,exercised no discretion in setting the penalty.the trial court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the board to set aside its decision revoking ventimiglia license and remanding the matter to redetermine the penalty to be imposed upon ventimiglia in light of the trial court statement of decision,and to take any further action specially enjoined on you by law.
on remand after we affirmed the trial court in ventimiglia i,the board issued a new decision with extensive new findings of fact.in new paragraphs,the board detailed the progression of the sexual relationship between ventimiglia and ventimiglia failure to maintain professional boundaries his failure to insist that she consult with other therapists and his failure to insist that she have a evaluation in light of suicide threats.the board found that ventimiglia waited nearly six months to seek professional help after the relationship with ended in.although was being treated by other professionals,ventimiglia returned her telephone calls,even after the board accusation was filed against him,conduct severely criticized by the board.
the board found that ventimiglia failed to demonstrate remorse,and that he was focused on the consequences of his behavior rather than an internal,moral and ethical sense it was wrong.ventimiglia was found to have frequently blamed other people and circumstances rather than focusing on his own conduct.the board found that his claim that he was not trained or educated in the nature of condition borderline personality disorder was contradicted by the evidence.in detailed findings,the board found ventimiglia expert witnesses were neither independent,unbiased nor credible.
in its conclusion of law,the board found that ventimiglia engaged in repeated acts of sexual contact with a patient,within the meaning of business and professions code section,which provides for revocation of the license of a therapist who has engaged in sexual contact.the board determined that mitigation of the penalty of revocation was not warranted under the criteria found in california code of regulations,title,section.the board concluded the nature and severity of ventimiglia acts speaks for itself.having sexual relations with a patient is one of the most severe offenses a marriage and family therapist can commit.in addition,ventimiglia did so under circumstances that aggravated rather than mitigated the nature of this offense.he engaged in sexual relations with a patient he knew to be a borderline unstable individual.he did not just do so one or two times as a result of a moment of weakness,but continually and systematically over a month period.even at the end,he was operating under the assumption he could still cure the patient with continued therapy.
the board concluded that ventimiglia efforts at rehabilitation had been minimal and clearly do not justify his being permitted to practice as a marriage and family therapist even under limited or restricted conditions.ventimiglia license was revoked.he obtained a temporary stay of the revocation order from the superior court,conditioned on notice to his existing clients of the pending disciplinary action.
ventimiglia then brought a second petition for peremptory writ of mandamus under ccp section.ventimiglia board of behavioral sciences,no.he argued that on remand,the board in effect rejected the administrative law judge proposed decision and issued its own,materially different decision.ventimiglia contended that in such circumstances,the apa,government code section,subdivision c e ii,requires that the affected party be given an opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency itself.he was not given that opportunity.he contended that the board therefore failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
the board opposed the petition for writ,arguing that the procedure invoked by ventimiglia does not apply in cases remanded by the court of appeal.it also argued that the revocation was reasonable and consistent with its policy to protect the public as mandated by business and professions code section in light of the severity of ventimiglia misconduct 
the trial court adopted its tentative decision as its statement of decision and denied the writ.it held that the procedure under section,subdivision c e is inapplicable here because t he board decision herein was not a nonadoption or rejection of a proposed decision of an alj administrative law judge,but a decision made in response to a writ of mandate issued by this court.the trial court concluded that the board did just what the court commanded it to do.it evaluated all the evidence in the record and issued a new decision,this time in the exercise of its discretion,imposing the penalty of revocation.the court found no abuse of the board discretion on remand.ventimiglia filed a timely appeal from this order.
discussion 
appellate review is de novo when the trial court decision is based on interpretation of a statute.poliak board of psychology th,d.the statutory question presented here is whether section,subdivision c e ii applies to require that a licensee be given an opportunity to present oral or written argument to the board when a court has granted an administrative writ of mandate and remanded the matter to the board for reconsideration of penalty under the circumstances presented here.ventimiglia argues that the board failed to act in the manner required by law because he was not afforded this opportunity.the board takes the position that following remand,it must comply only with the administrative writ of mandate and that the administrative procedures act no longer applies.

ventimiglia i 
in ventimiglia i,we determined that the original version of business and professions code section,enacted in,applies to ventimiglia case.it authorized the board to revoke the license of a therapist who had engaged in sexual contact with a patient.the issue in ventimiglia i was whether the board had the discretion under former business and professions code section to stay revocation of ventimiglia license.
we concluded that the board had discretion to stay revocation and that it had not exercised that discretion in ventimiglia case.our rationale was based on the legislative history of the version of the statute as originally introduced,the enacting bill did not definitively prohibit issuance of a stay by either the administrative law judge or the board.assembly amendments to the legislation attempted to clarify the law by expressly withholding that power from both the administrative law judge and the board but the third and final version of the bill deleted the language making the decision of the administrative law judge immediately final and not subject to vote by the board.bill reg.sess,as amended august.the analysis prepared for the assembly committee on health explained that this version of business and professions code section prohibited the administrative law judge from staying the license revocation,but was silent as to the powers of the board to issue a stay.assem.com.on health,on bill reg.sess,as amended august.the analysis prepared by the senate rules committee echoed this interpretation.rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.as amended august.
in ventimiglia i,we found an indication of the reason that the legislation was amended to bar only the administrative law judges from issuing a stay.we quoted a lengthy analysis of the second version of the bill prepared by the department of consumer affairs.that analysis noted that the second version of the bill would have deprived the board of the discretion to consider each case of sexual misconduct on its individual merits.of consumer affairs,analysis of bill reg.sess.may,as amended april.since the legislature chose to delete the language prohibiting the board from exercising its discretion to grant a stay of a license revocation for sexual misconduct,we concluded t here was no language in the final draft to suggest the legislature intended to curtail the discretion normally afforded the board to reduce the proposed penalty,stay the proposed penalty,or grant probation to an offender in the presence of mitigating circumstances see,subd.c b,subd.b,tit.the final version precluded only administrative law judge s from issuing stays.ventimiglia i,supra.
we concluded in ventimiglia i in sum,the legislature had an opportunity in to pass a version of section that specifically forbade the board from intervening in license revocation proceedings where the licensee engaged in sexual contact with a patient or former patient.instead,it deleted the language that would have accomplished that objective and enacted legislation that placed curbs on administrative law judges only.until passage of the version of section,the board retained discretion to stay the revocation order contained in an administrative law judge decision.the trial court correctly ruled that the board abused its discretion by failing to consider the mitigating factors introduced by respondent.ventimiglia i,supra.
applicability of section,subdivision c e ii 
an established rule of statutory construction requires us to construe statutes to avoid constitutional infirmit ies.citations.myers philip morris companies,cal th,d.as a prudential matter,we routinely decline to address constitutional questions when it is unnecessary to reach them.department of alcoholic beverage control alcoholic beverage control appeals bd.cal th,fn,d.ventimiglia argues that the board did not proceed in the manner required by section of the apa.in conformity with the applicable appellate principles,we begin our analysis with the statutory argument.
this case arises in an unusual procedural posture.in its original decision,the board acted under section,subdivision c c and made only technical or minor changes in the administrative law judge proposed decision,and adopted it as modified.at that point,ventimiglia was not entitled to any further right to be heard under section.but on remand,the board took a different course.section,subdivision c c expressly declares action by the agency under this paragraph is limited to a clarifying change or a change of a similar nature that does not affect the factual or legal basis of the proposed decision.as we explain,we agree with ventimiglia that on remand,the board went beyond the clarifying changes allowed under this subparagraph,rejected the decision of the administrative law judge,and decided the case itself.this procedure is permissible only under subdivision c e of section once the board determined that it would reject the proposed decision of the administrative law judge,subdivision c e ii of section mandated further procedural safeguards.only one of these is pertinent here ii the agency itself shall not decide any case provided for in this subdivision without affording the parties the opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency itself,subd.c e.
after the remittitur was issued in ventimiglia i,the board issued a decision with extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law which were at odds with the original proposed decision of the administrative law judge.as we have discussed,the administrative law judge found ventimiglia had presented substantial evidence of the circumstances surrounding the sexual relationship with and his rehabilitation.the proposed decision stated the evidence was impressive,credible,and of such significance that,but for the law which mandates revocation of his license,might otherwise have led to a disciplinary order less stringent than that set forth below.the administrative law judge noted that it was not necessary to detail evidence of ventimiglia efforts at rehabilitation since as he understood the law revocation of his license was mandatory.
contrary to this finding by the administrative law judge,on remand,the board issued a decision with detailed new factual findings and conclusions of law.in contrast,the proposed decision by the administrative law judge was just four pages long.the board concluded the nature and severity of ventimiglia acts speaks for itself.having sexual relations with a patient is one of the most severe offenses a marriage and family therapist can commit.in addition,ventimiglia did so under circumstances that aggravated rather than mitigated the nature of this offense.he engaged in sexual relations with a patient he knew to be a borderline unstable individual.he did not just do so one or two times as a result of a moment of weakness,but continually and systematically over a month period.even at the end,he was operating under the assumption he could still cure the patient with continued therapy.in detailed findings,the board found ventimiglia expert witnesses were neither independent,unbiased nor credible.the board concluded that ventimiglia efforts at rehabilitation had been minimal and clearly do not justify his being permitted to practice as a marriage and family therapist even under limited or restricted conditions.
the board new findings and conclusions went far beyond the clarifying modifications allowed under section,subdivision c c.the new language in the board decision affected the factual and legal basis of the proposed decision,particularly because ventimiglia efforts at rehabilitation were addressed at length,a subject not reached by the administrative law judge in the proposed decision because of his belief that revocation was mandatory.

ventimiglia never had an opportunity to provide either oral or written argument to the board addressing these new findings and conclusions of law.this was inconsistent with the safeguards of the apa as the legislative history demonstrates.in,the legislature directed the judicial council to investigate administrative procedure and judicial review of administrative determinations.see hohreiter garrison d,hohreiter for extensive discussion of the judicial council report.the result of the judicial council work was the legislature adoption of the apa in.stats,chs.to.subdivision c of section set the procedure to be followed if an agency chose not to adopt the proposed decision of the hearing officer who conducted the hearing.the essential language at issue in our case was included in the original statute the agency itself shall decide no case provided for in this subdivision without affording the parties the opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency itself.hohreiter,supra,d at.
the hohreiter court examined the intent of the judicial council and the legislature in enacting this procedure t here can be no reasonable doubt that the council intended and the legislature provided that,where the hearing officer alone hears the case,the agency has the power of adjudicating,but,if not satisfied with the proposed decision of the hearing officer,before a contrary decision may be rendered,it must give the parties a chance to argue and must read the record.hohreiter,supra,d at,italics added.the court of appeal reiterated if the agency does not so adopt the proposed decision,it must furnish the parties with copies of the proposed decision and must allow them to argue either orally or by brief.it may then decide the case itself on the basis of the record before the hearing officer and the arguments.id.at.the court cited the report of the judicial council which stated the result of the council proposal is that,in fact,the decision is made in every case by someone familiar with the proceedings and before whom an opportunity to argue the case is afforded the hearing officer if his decision is adopted the agency itself if it does not adopt the proposed decision.id.at,quoting tenth report of the judicial council of california,italics added.
the court concluded that under section,where the hearing officer acts alone,the agency may adopt his or her decision without reading or otherwise familiarizing itself with the record.hohreiter,supra,d at.it rejected the appellant argument that this procedure was unconstitutional under morgan united states.which involved review of an order by the united states secretary of agriculture fixing maximum rates for buying and selling livestock.it was alleged in morgan that the secretary had assigned the hearing to two acting secretaries,and then made his order fixing rates without having heard or read any of the evidence.the supreme court held that this procedure did not allow the plaintiffs the hearing required by the applicable statute if the one who determines the facts which underlie the order has not considered evidence or argument,it is manifest that the hearing has not been given.morgan,supra,at,italics added.the supreme court stated its famous aphorism the one who decides must hear.hohreiter,supra,at,see also morgan.
the hohreiter court distinguished the two morgan cases t hey can not be interpreted to mean that,where a fair trial is required by the statute before a fair and impartial hearing officer who is required by the statute to weigh and appraise the evidence and to prepare a proposed decision,the legislature can not provide that the administrative agency may adopt his proposed decision without reading the record.what the supreme court was interested in in those cases was in seeing to it that the administrative agency gave those adversely affected the right to a full and fair hearing.due process requires a fair trial before an impartial tribunal,and that requires that the person or body who decides the case must know the evidence,but due process is not interested in mere technical formalism.it is the substance that is determinative of whether due process has been afforded.hohreiter,supra,d at,italics added.
in hohreiter,the court of appeal observed that the california supreme court had recently upheld the identical procedure for adopting the proposed decision of a hearing officer for the industrial accident commission and concluded that there was nothing inconsistent with the doctrine that he who decides must hear,announced in morgan united states.hohreiter,supra,d at,quoting cal.shipbuilding.acc.com.cal d.

the board relies heavily upon alford department of motor vehicles th,d alford in arguing that section,subdivision c e ii applies only where the board rejects a proposed decision and does not apply on remand following an order on a petition for writ of administrative mandate.the department of motor vehicles revoked alford license because of a criminal conviction,although the administrative law judge who initially heard the matter recommended the lesser penalty of suspension.the department decided the matter itself under section,subdivision c,adopting the administrative law judge proposed opinion except for the penalty.alford brought a petition for administrative mandamus,which was denied.
alford argued that if the case is heard by an administrative law judge alone,the department may not increase the penalty under section.alford,supra,th at,d.the court of appeal found that section unambiguously set out the options available to an agency upon receipt of a proposed decision by an administrative law judge who heard the matter alone.in that case,the agency chose to reject the proposed decision and to decide the case on its own under former section,subdivision c.id.at,d.significantly,unlike ventimiglia,alford was afforded the right to present oral argument to the agency,which he did.the agency issued its decision after hearing argument.ibid.the alford court reasoned former subdivision c merely requires that the agency follow certain procedures if the agency rejects the administrative law judge proposed decision and decides the case itself.one of these is affording the parties the opportunity to present either oral or written argument before the agency itself,former subd.c.once these procedures are complied with,the agency may render its decision.id.at,d,italics added.
