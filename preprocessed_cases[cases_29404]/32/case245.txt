we have for review a referee report recommending that william sumner scott be found guilty of professional misconduct and suspended from the practice of law for eighteen months.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.we approve the referee findings of fact and recommendations regarding guilt.but we disapprove the sanction recommendation and instead impose a suspension.
the referee found that the florida bar proved the following facts by clear and convincing evidence.
in,scott represented richard maseri company,private research,in a suit for an injunction filed by the commodity futures trading commission cftc in the united states district court for the southern district of futures trading commission maseri,complaint filed.the cftc complaint alleged that maseri and private research defrauded customers,converted customer funds,and violated the registration provisions of the commodity exchange act the act,and cftc regulations.the court issued preliminary injunctive orders and,in,made them permanent.the orders prohibited maseri and private research from contracting for the sale of any commodity acting directly or indirectly as a commodities trading advisor cta or commodities pooling operator cpo without being registered as such and engaging in any fraudulent activities while acting as a cta or cpo.
in the summer of,maseri advertised for investors for a commodities brokerage venture.steven frankel,who was unaware of maseri previous history,responded to the advertisement.in july,maseri hired scott to represent him in negotiations with frankel aimed at establishing a forex brokerage company in august,maseri and frankel created international currency exchange corporation,a nevada corporation,later renamed intercontinental currency exchange corporation icec.they each owned a share of the company.they met,along with scott,on august,to sign the stockholders agreement.before maseri arrived for the meeting,frankel questioned scott about maseri.scott failed to tell frankel about cftc suit against maseri,the court order prohibiting maseri from entering into certain business transactions,or maseri criminal history,even though this information was public and nonconfidential.during the course of their conversation,scott made statements to the effect that maseri was an honest man.
during the august meeting,scott agreed to represent icec.at a minimum,scott agreed to prepare new account form documents for icec.frankel put up in equity for the venture and loaned icec.
in november,the federal court entered a final order of judgment against maseri in the maseri case.prudential securities,prudential,as a holder of icec assets,filed an interpleader action against cftc in the united states district court for the southern district of florida and notified icec that its assets would be frozen until released by the court.prudential securities,commodity futures trading commission.maseri,as icec president and chief operating officer,hired scott to attempt to unfreeze icec assets.
frankel was unaware of these events until december.on that date,because he was unable to contact maseri by telephone,he drove to the office and discovered that law enforcement officers had raided icec.at that point,maseri told frankel about his problems with the cftc and referred him to scott.
frankel contacted scott,who told him that he had been retained to represent icec and,since frankel had loaned icec money,he would be representing frankel in getting his funds released to him.on december,frankel entered into a retainer agreement with scott in which scott agreed to attempt to have the accounts which hold your funds at prudential released.three days later,frankel signed an addendum to his retainer agreement with scott in which frankel,not as a director,but as a lender to icec,ratified,adopted,and approved his earlier hiring of scott.
icec also maintained accounts at donaldson,luftkin jenrette dlj.these accounts were controlled by dreyfus service corporation dreyfus.in,dreyfus,like prudential,filed an interpleader action in the united states district court for the southern district of florida.dreyfus service intercont l currency exch.scott,on behalf of icec investor moresea,filed a counterclaim against dreyfus and a complaint against dlj,alleging that icec had conducted business in an illegal manner.
on january,scott filed a petition for emergency relief on behalf of icec in the prudential interpleader action.the petition included a against prudential on behalf of icec investors.
on january,the federal district court supplemented the final judgment in the commodity futures trading commission maseri case to make icec subject to receivership.as a result,icec assets went into receivership.the receiver notified prudential that icec assets were to be turned over to satisfy the judgment.
on february,on behalf of icec investor investcan,scott filed an answer and a counterclaim against prudential,alleging that maseri and icec had operated in violation of florida law.prudential wrote to scott on february and,to object to his dual representation of icec and its investors on the basis of conflicts of interest.despite prudential objection,scott filed a counterclaim on february,on behalf of icec investors roger lennon and the lennon trust.
the court in prudential dismissed the icec investors on march,the investcan on april,and the lennon counterclaim on april.scott filed a first amended counterclaim against prudential on behalf of icec investors on april that counterclaim also asserted unlawful conduct by icec.
the court dismissed the dreyfus case on june,and the prudential case on january.prudential released the icec funds to the receiver.scott tried to reopen the prudential case over a year later,on january,and to file a against his former client frankel on behalf of icec and its for breach of contract,legal malpractice,and fraud.the court denied his motion on february.that same day,scott filed a motion on behalf of investcan,seeking joinder to the against frankel.on february,scott filed a motion to reconsider reopening the prudential case on behalf of icec and all persons who opened an account with icec.
meanwhile,on january,the federal district court in commodity futures trading commission maseri issued an order discharging the receiver and granting the receiver final report of distribution.on february,scott filed a motion for reconsideration in that case on behalf of icec to contest the order of distribution.on february,scott wrote to frankel and maseri,urging them to appeal the court order of discharge and demanding a retainer for legal fees to represent icec in an appeal.
on february,frankel demanded that scott cease representing icec.five days later,on february,scott wrote to frankel and maseri,claiming that no impasse of icec nev ada management exists in regard to this case because both of you agreed for our firm to obtain recovery of the icec nev ada deposits without regard to where they were located.we will keep you advised of developments.
on february,frankel filed a motion to disqualify scott on the basis of a conflict of interest.scott wrote to frankel on march,through frankel attorney,stating,icec nev ada depositors have a superior right to the proceeds taken from icec nev ada to pay the fees and costs of the receiver than does frankel either as shareholder or lender to icec nev ada,and affording frankel the opportunity to respond to the proposed appeal by icec nev ada of the order that discharged the receiver.
on april,scott filed suit against frankel and maseri,on behalf of icec investor investcan,in the united states district court for the southern district of florida,asserting investcan right to a return of its funds.investcan int l,frankel,complaint filed.
the court denied scott motion for reconsideration in prudential on may,noting 
a serious question as to icec putative counsel ability to represent icec in this matter this raises conflict issues the fact appears to be that at this date,scott has represented frankel in his individual capacity,in an attempt to get back monies scott apparently now seeks on behalf of another client.
scott appealed the order.the eleventh circuit court of appeals affirmed.moresea,prudential,cir.
on july,scott amended the investcan complaint to allege that frankel and maseri failed to ensure that icec operated legally and thus defrauded plaintiffs of their money.the court disqualified scott on october,on the basis of a conflict of interest in violation of rule regulating the florida bar.that decision was affirmed by the eleventh circuit court of appeals on march.investcan int l,frankel,cir.
based on the factual findings,the referee recommends that scott be found guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar a prohibiting lawyer from making false statement of material fact or law to third party in course of representing client one count a prohibiting lawyer from representing client if representation will be directly adverse to interests of another client unless lawyer reasonably believes representation will not adversely affect lawyer responsibilities to and relationship with other client and each client consents after consultation five counts a prohibiting lawyer who formerly represented client from representing another person in same or substantially related matter in which that person interests are materially adverse to interests of former client unless former client consents after consultation six counts a prohibiting lawyer from representing client or requiring lawyer to withdraw where representation will result in violation of rules of professional conduct or law seven counts and c prohibiting lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation one count.
the referee recommends that scott be suspended for eighteen months and taxed with the bar costs.in recommending the suspension,the referee considered two mitigating absence of a prior disciplinary record and scott age seventy.the referee found no aggravating factors.in recommending an suspension,the referee did not identify the particular florida standards for imposing lawyer sanctions on which he relied.neither did he cite to any previous cases involving similar fact patterns in which this court imposed suspensions.
scott petitioned for review of the referee report.he argues that the bar complaint should have been dismissed as barred by the statute of limitations for bar disciplinary proceedings scott was not obligated to tell frankel about maseri criminal history or legal problems with the cftc the referee finding that he misled frankel was unsupported the referee finding that he represented frankel was unsupported and frankel had waived any real or potential conflict of interest and scott duty to protect the public took precedence over his duty to maintain client confidentiality or to decline the representation of a client where a conflict of interest exists or is likely to arise.the bar filed a,seeking review of the sanction recommendation.the bar argues that a suspension is the appropriate sanction for the proven misconduct.
scott previously raised the issue in a motion to dismiss filed in this court.the court rejected scott argument and denied the motion to dismiss.we will not now revisit this issue,which we have previously determined adversely to scott.
scott takes issue with the referee finding that scott misled frankel by representing that maseri was an honest man.scott argues that he had no duty to advise frankel of public,nonconfidential information about maseri.the referee finding in this regard is supported by competent,substantial evidence.critically,if a referee findings of fact are supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record,the court will not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the referee.bar frederick,so d,see also.bar jordan,so d.
in this instance,the referee found that scott action in telling frankel that maseri was an honest man triggered a duty on his part to also reveal to frankel the negative information he had concerning maseri that could have impacted frankel decision to go into business with maseri.this finding is also supported by the record.frankel,testifying about his conversation with scott at the august,meeting,stated i asked him what he knew of him,and he indicated to me that maseri had never lied to him,that he was an honest man,that he had never lost any money with him,and generally he left me feeling very good about him.he further testified that scott did not tell him anything negative about maseri during their conversation and that if scott had told him anything negative,specifically about the public nonconfidential information scott had about maseri,frankel would have gotten up and left.
more importantly,scott admitted that his intent was to convince frankel that maseri was an honest man so as to ensure that frankel proceeded with the proposed business deal.concerning his motivation in telling frankel that maseri had never lied to him,scott testified 
q is it true that in response to frankel questions,you told him that maseri had never lied or cheated you because you wanted frankel to infer that maseri was an honest man 
a i gave a deposition and acknowledged that.when he started asking his questions,my goal was to preserve the deal.i already knew that in the agreement there was no representation of past litigation or regulation history.i already knew and had discussions with maseri about what had he disclosed to frankel and what he had not.
i felt that at a closing that had been going on and negotiations back and forth for seven or eight days,for those questions to come up,i felt blindsided and as though the guy was trying to make me personally responsible for his problems instead of serving as his own lawyer,which i told him at the outset he had to do,and i told thought i gave him plenty of notice that there was something there for him to worry about when i told him he ought to go get his own lawyer.you know,you can only take a cripple so far.
q do i understand you correctly to have just said that yes,you wanted him to infer that maseri was an honest man because you did want the deal to get blown 
a that is true.
scott also admitted that if the deal had been blown,he would not have been able to look forward to earning any fees from the icec venture.
the referee finding that scott represented frankel is also supported by competent,substantial evidence in the record.the bar introduced two retainer agreements,dated december and,into evidence.the december agreement states after my explanation to you of the existence of potential conflicts of interests among the depositors,you have requested that our firm represent you in the limited capacity to attempt to have the accounts which hold your funds at prudential released.emphasis added.in the december addendum to retainer agreement,frankel consents,ratifies,and approves the employment of the scott law firm,the firm upon the terms outlined above.
in addition,both scott and frankel testified concerning scott representation.when discussing the december and retainer agreements,scott stated i also believed that i needed to get a retainer from him,which i now prefer to characterize as a waiver.emphasis added.the clear implication of this statement is that scott himself viewed the documents as retainers at the time he sent them to frankel.
we reject scott argument that it was permissible for him to represent the icec investors despite the conflicts presented by his representation under some kind of exception.no such exception exists.to the extent that icec investors wanted to pursue claims against scott past or present clients with interests adverse to theirs,scott should have referred them to other counsel,someone without a disqualifying conflict.
we next address the referee guilt recommendations.the court has repeatedly stated that the referee factual findings must be sufficient under the applicable rules to support the recommendations as to guilt.see.bar shoureas,so d.scott argues that the referee guilt recommendations on the issue are unsupported by the factual findings.his argument fails.
an attorney engages in unethical conduct when he undertakes a representation when he either knows or should know of a conflict of interest prohibiting the representation.bar cosnow,so d.the
