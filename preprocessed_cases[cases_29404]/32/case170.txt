the county of riverside and the riverside county sheriff department collectively department demoted deputy jose quintanar as a result of an incident in which quintanar allegedly used excessive force.pursuant to the applicable memorandum of understanding mou,quintanar filed an administrative appeal.this triggered an evidentiary hearing before an impartial hearing officer.the hearing officer agreed that quintanar had used excessive force and upheld the demotion.
quintanar then filed a petition for writ of mandate.the trial court,sua sponte,questioned whether the hearing officer was required to exercise independent judgment with respect to the nature of the discipline to be imposed,and if so,whether he had,in fact,done so.it remanded the matter to the hearing officer with directions to clarify whether he had exercised independent judgment.on receiving his reply,it determined that he had not exercised independent judgment and it issued a writ commanding him to do so.
the department appealed.we agree with the trial court that,under the mou,the hearing officer was required to exercise independent judgment not only with respect to whether there were grounds for discipline,but also with respect to the nature of the discipline.we disagree with the trial court conclusion,however,that the hearing officer failure to use independent judgment was prejudicial.the hearing officer did indicate that,while he did not believe that he was required to exercise his independent judgment,the exercise of his independent judgment would not have changed the outcome.
hence,we will reverse.

quintanar demotion.
quintanar worked for the sheriff department of the county of riverside as a correctional deputy.on september,he was involved in an incident in which he allegedly used excessive force against an arrestee.
the department conducted an investigation.the investigation included interviews with eyewitnesses,including quintanar,and the review of a video of the incident.the investigation concluded that quintanar had,in fact,used excessive force.
on january,the department sent quintanar a notice of intent to demote him based on inefficiency or negligence,willful violation of an employee regulation,and conduct adversely affecting department operations.quintanar requested a skelly hearing one was held on february.on february,the department demoted quintanar,effective march.
proceedings before the hearing officer.
pursuant to the mou,quintanar filed an administrative appeal.the key issue in the administrative appeal,as stipulated by the parties,was,was there just cause to demote quintanar 
the hearing officer held a evidentiary hearing.during the hearing,chief deputy steve thetford testified that he was the one who made the decision to demote quintanar.he had considered the department disciplinary matrix,which provides generic guidelines for the appropriate level of discipline.for example,for use of force with injury,as in this case,it provides for an hour suspension nevertheless,he decided to demote quintanar instead,because,in his view,the egregious nature of quintanar use of force made it not an act that an officer of quintanar rank should be conducting.
on september,the hearing officer denied the administrative appeal.he agreed that quintanar had used excessive force.
regarding the appropriate discipline,the hearing officer stated i t is not appropriate to substitute my judgment for that of the decision maker.rather,my function is to consider whether the imposed discipline is arbitrary is within the range of discipline that would be reasonable for the proven misconduct.
he continued the disciplinary matrix should be given great consideration and deference since it is the department notice to employees concerning the discipline that might be imposed for certain types of misconduct.he noted that discipline outside the disciplinary matrix,standing alone,might be deemed arbitrary.he also noted,however,that chief deputy thetford had explained why he had decided to demote quintanar.he concluded that quintanar own inconsistent testimony mitigated against any inclination that may have otherwise existed to reduce the severity of the discipline because it demonstrated his lack of understanding of the inappropriateness of his misconduct and his failure to take responsibility for his actions.
proceedings in the trial court.
quintanar filed a petition for writ of mandate,alleging,among other things,that the discipline imposed was excessive.
at the argument on the petition,the trial court raised the issue sua sponte of whether the hearing officer erred by concluding that he should not exercise independent judgment regarding the appropriate discipline.
counsel for quintanar,adopting the trial court suggestion,argued that the hearing officer had indeed erred by failing to exercise his independent judgment.counsel for the department argued,i do believe his function is to make his own findings.i think his function is to determine whether the department action was arbitrary,capricious,or unreasonable.however,he also suggested remand ing the matter back to the hearing officer specifically for the questions that the court has inquired upon.i think the first threshold issue is whether he did exercise his independent judgment if he did do that,i think that pretty much ends the inquiry.if he did not do that,then he can expand further and tell us,okay,i did do it before,but i done it now,and give us a more definitive answer.
the trial court therefore entered a judgment granting a writ of mandate.it directed the hearing officer to clarify whether he believed he was allowed to use his independent judgment and whether he had,in fact,used his independent judgment.it further directed him,if he had not used his independent judgment,to do so now and render a new decision.
the hearing officer responded,my process of deciding the issue of whether the department had just cause to demote quintanar involved two steps.the first was to hear the case de novo and make the determination on the merits as to whether quintanar engaged in the alleged misconduct 
the next step was to determine whether there was just cause for the demotion a s an arbitrator,i do not impose discipline but rather,review the discipline imposed by the decision maker and apply the concept of just cause 
there are often several possible disciplines that a decision maker can impose for misconduct and in collective bargaining cases,it is relatively well accepted that the arbitrator should not substitute view for that of the decision maker unless the discipline that is imposed is outside the range of what would be reasonable 
in my analysis,i noted that the disciplinary matrix should be given great deference i gave my independent analysis concerning why i did not think there was sufficient reason to reduce the demotion to an hour suspension.in that regard,i noted that there were inconsistencies in quintanar testimony,that he demonstrated a lack of understanding of the inappropriateness of his misconduct and that he failed to take responsibility for his misconduct 
for the reasons discussed above,it is my opinion that i independently analyzed an
