in these appeals,we consider the impact of an attorney entry into a business transaction with a client,and the client subsequent decision to withdraw from the transaction.the evidence in this case demonstrates that the attorney conduct was in violation of the california rules of professional conduct,rule,and also amounted to undue influence within the meaning of probate code section.for that reason,the alleged agreement was voidable,and once the client acted to void it,the trial court properly refused to enforce the agreement or to grant any other requested relief arising from the voided agreement.
factual and procedural summary 
maynard brittan brittan and his wife linda brittan are the owners of property near the intersection of wilshire and santa monica boulevards,where they operate roxbury managers,a property management company.for many years,they used four parking places on a strip of land directly behind this property.the land was part of a vacant railroad right of way owned by union pacific railroad railroad the railroad property consisted of two parcels.parcel,on which the parking spaces were located,is west of the intersection of santa monica and wilshire parcel is east of the intersection,adjacent to a budget facility owned by,a limited liability company.
brittan had unsuccessfully tried to purchase the portion of parcel that included the four parking spaces.in october,he retained attorney jerome janger to file a lawsuit to declare that he had acquired a prescriptive easement on this property.in july,during brittan deposition in the easement lawsuit,counsel for the railroad spoke with an associate in janger law office about the possibility of settling the case.the railroad offered to sell brittan the land behind his building on the condition that parcels and be sold together and the easement lawsuit be dismissed.after the deposition,brittan told janger he wished to pursue the settlement.
the railroad previously had discussed sale of the right of way with other parties,including and jeff wilson,who owns property next to parcel.janger friend and former client,robert goldman,also had attempted to buy the property from the railroad.goldman had been unsuccessful because the railroad could not provide clear title,but he remained interested in the property.
janger told brittan about goldman interest in purchasing the property,and at brittan request,introduced brittan to goldman.brittan and goldman discussed the property,and invited janger to join them in a possible purchase.according to janger,the three formed an oral joint venture in july,by which they each would acquire a interest in the railroad property and each would contribute of the capital.the potential purchase expressly required brittan to dismiss the easement lawsuit.the joint venture was given the name bgj,based on the first letter of each of the participants names.janger corresponded with the railroad,indicating that his client,brittan,was interested in the purchase of parcels and.
by november,the railroad made it known that it was discussing the sale of the two parcels with other parties,including and jeff wilson.soon after,wilson withdrew from the discussions.bgj and discussed the possibility of making a joint offer to the railroad for the purchase.they agreed to pursue the purchase under an arrangement by which bgj would own parcel,and would own parcel.
janger continued to represent brittan in the easement lawsuit.he advised brittan to put that action on hold while pursuing the purchase of the railroad property through the joint venture.janger obtained a continuance of that litigation.
in september,janger prepared,signed,and filed articles of organization for bgj associates,llc.the articles called for the parties to enter into a written operating agreement for the management and operation of bgj.on november,janger faxed brittan a draft operating agreement.brittan told janger he believed the terms of the draft agreement were unfair to him,particularly the capital call and default provisions,since they would allow janger and goldman to gang up on him by a simple majority vote.the draft agreement included an acknowledgment that janger was not representing goldman or brittan,and that janger had advised the others to have the agreement reviewed by independent counsel.this was the first such advice since the parties began discussing the purchase of the railroad property in july.
at a dinner party on november a friday,brittan talked with attorney rubin turner,who agreed to look over the draft operating agreement.over the weekend,turner reviewed the draft and other documents relating to the purchase of the property.in turner view,the capital call and default provisions were unfair to brittan.turner agreed to attend a meeting with janger and goldman on the following monday,november.
on november,brittan tendered his initial capital contribution to janger,but in an accompanying letter,stated his disagreement with the terms of the draft operating agreement.at janger request,brittan and janger met alone that morning to discuss the matter.
on the afternoon of november,goldman,janger,brittan and turner met to discuss the proposed transaction and the draft operating agreement.at that meeting,goldman signed a purchase and sale agreement,purportedly on behalf of bgj.this agreement was between the railroad and wells fargo,as seller,and bgj and as buyer.brittan signed a tenancy in common agreement between bgj and on behalf of bgj,but he did not sign the draft operating agreement or any other agreement with janger and goldman.
there followed over the next several weeks a series of letters between brittan attorney,turner,and janger,attempting to resolve the parties differences as to the operating agreement.on november,janger suggested some alternatives for resolving the disputed terms.then,on november,janger informed brittan attorney by letter that he and goldman did not believe they should have a partnership agreement with brittan,based on the number of issues on which they did not see eye to eye.janger continued although we should have perhaps discovered these differences at some earlier stage,the fact remains that they exist,and have come to light while we are still at the alter and before marriage vows have been spoken.janger later sent a draft option agreement to turner proposing that janger and goldman purchase parcel together,and give brittan an option to purchase the strip of land behind his business.neither goldman nor brittan agreed to this proposal.
by december,goldman had serious reservations about the purchase,based on negotiations he had with brittan,wilson,and the city of beverly hills.on that date,janger called principal,alan liker,and told him he and goldman did not intend to go forward with the deal.he confirmed this statement in a letter,stating that unless something changes between now and december,we do not intend to proceed with you in purchasing the subject property.in this letter,janger indicated he had no objection to discussing the possibility of proceeding with wilson or brittan if janger and goldman opted not to proceed.a confirming letter from liker indicated that would be contacting wilson and brittan to determine whether they were interested in going forward with the transaction.
on december,brittan confirmed by letter that janger and goldman had passed on the deal,and that he was making arrangements to return their funds to them.then,on december,janger wrote to alan liker of to confirm a conversation to the effect that bgj associates,llc with bob goldman and myself as principals intends to proceed with the purchase,meaning that on december,it is our present intention subject to continuing due diligence to approve the contingencies in paragraph of the purchase and sale agreement.
responded the following day with a letter recounting that in early december,janger had unequivocally stated by telephone and in writing that he and goldman did not intend to proceed with the transaction,and had sanctioned negotiations with brittan and wilson for the same transaction.then a week later,janger had sent a letter stating he and goldman intended to proceed with the transaction.called these tactics lawyerly equivocations through which janger and goldman sought to fabricate a pretext for claiming a share of the benefits of the transaction if it was beneficial,but provide an equally fabricated pretext for backing out of it if that course appeared more advantageous.stated its intent to proceed without goldman and janger unless they appeared at the closing with their share of the money and the dismissal of the brittan lawsuit.
additional correspondence failed to resolve the dispute.janger finally substituted out as counsel for brittan in the easement lawsuit on december.ultimately,brittan,and wilson completed the purchase together,under terms which were more favorable to brittan.executed a quitclaim deed giving brittan free and clear title to the portion of parcel he sought in his easement lawsuit.
bgj associates,llc,jerome janger,and robert goldman brought this action against maynard brittan,linda brittan,roxbury managers,jeff wilson,and wilco,llc.they asserted causes of action for breach of oral contract based on an alleged oral agreement on november,breach of fiduciary duty unjust enrichment negligent and intentional interference with contractual relations inducing breach of contract and constructive trust.defendants asserted as an affirmative defense that the contract was void or voidable because janger entered into a business transaction with his client,brittan,without full disclosure and advice and without an informed waiver and consent.maynard brittan filed a cross complaint against janger,goldman,and bgj in which he sought a declaration that bgj was not an existing entity and that it lacked legal capacity to enter into any agreements and sought to rescind any alleged transactions or agreements among brittan,goldman,janger,and bgj.he also alleged that janger and goldman conspired against him in breach of janger fiduciary duty to brittan.
wilson and his company,wilco,were granted summary judgment on all claims against them.the court granted plaintiffs motion for new trial on the claim for constructive trust against wilson.in case no,wilson and wilco appeal from the order granting a new trial 
the case went to trial as to the remaining defendants.defendants requested a bench trial on the equitable claims.plaintiffs objected.after lengthy colloquy and additional briefing about the scope of the equitable claims,the court conducted an bench trial at which the parties presented evidence regarding janger violation of rule of of the california rules of professional conduct rule and its statutory counterpart,probate code section.the court found janger entry into a business transaction with a client violated both the rule and the statute,and that the resulting presumption of undue influence was not overcome since the transaction was not fair and reasonable.the court held that the alleged contract was void as against public policy and therefore did not confer upon bgj or any of its alleged partners any rights or powers,including the capacity to sue,recover damages or obtain any remedy on bgj behalf.judgment was entered in favor of all remaining defendants except maynard brittan,whose for damages remains pending in case no,plaintiffs appeal from this judgment.the two appeals have been consolidated for purposes of oral argument and decision.
discussion 
rule addresses an attorney obligations when engaging in a business transaction with a client.it provides a member shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership,possessory,security,or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client,unless each of the following requirements has been satisfied a the transaction or acquisition and its terms are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which should reasonably have been understood by the client and b the client is advised in writing that the client may seek the advice of an independent lawyer of the client choice and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek that advice and c the client thereafter consents in writing to the terms of the transaction or the terms of the acquisition.
the transaction at issue is an oral joint venture agreement allegedly formed on november,among janger,goldman,and brittan.strong evidence supports the trial court conclusion that janger failed to meet the professional obligations set out in rule as to this alleged transaction.it is not disputed that brittan was janger client as of that date.the subject of that representation,the easement lawsuit against the railroad,was inextricably intertwined with the subject of the alleged joint venture,the purchase of land from the railroad,since the purchase expressly required dismissal of brittan easement lawsuit.
in entering into this business transaction with his client,janger was required to satisfy all three requirements of rule.first,the transaction and its terms had to be fair and reasonable to brittan,and had to be fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to brittan in a manner which should reasonably be understood.putting aside for the moment whether the transaction and terms were fair and reasonable,janger failed to satisfy this disclosure requirement.the agreement he seeks to enforce is an oral agreement he expressly disavows any attempt to rely on the written proposed operating agreement for bgj.having failed to transmit the transaction and its terms to brittan in writing,he did not comply with rule.
janger also was required to advise brittan in writing that brittan could seek the advice of an independent lawyer,and give brittan a reasonable opportunity to do so.arguably this requirement was met by the statement in the proposed operating agreement advising the parties of their right to independent counsel.brittan received the proposed operating agreement,and hence this advisement,on november,and promptly sought advice from an attorney prior to the november,meeting at which the alleged oral agreement was formed.
the final requirement is that the client consent in writing to the terms of the transaction.brittan gave no written consent to the terms of the transaction.janger did not satisfy the requirements of rule.
janger argues that the rule does not apply once a client obtains the advice of independent counsel.this argument is refuted by the language of the rule.paragraph b of rule requires that the client be advised of the right to independent counsel and be given a reasonable opportunity to seek that advice.paragraph c of rule then requires that t he client thereafter consents in writing to the terms of the transaction italics added.the consent must follow the opportunity to consult with independent counsel it is not an alternative to such consultation.the rule clearly contemplates a situation in which a client does consult with counsel,then consents in writing to the terms of the agreement.brittan consultation with another attorney did not relieve janger of his obligations under rule.
this conclusion does not determine the enforceability of the alleged oral contract.a violation of the rules of professional conduct subjects an attorney to disciplinary proceedings,but does not in itself provide a basis for civil liability.noble sears,roebuck d.but the rules,together with statutes and general principles relating to other fiduciary relationships,all help define the duty component of the fiduciary duty which the attorney owes to his or her client.david welch erskine tulley d.
probate code section is a statutory complement to rule.it provides in subdivision c a transaction between the trustee and a beneficiary which occurs during the existence of the trust or while the trustee influence with the beneficiary remains and by which the trustee obtains an advantage from the beneficiary is presumed to be a violation of the trustee fiduciary duties.this presumption is a presumption affecting the burden of proof.this subdivision does not apply to the provisions of an agreement between a trustee and a beneficiary relating to the hiring or compensation of the trustee.
probate code section applies to the fiduciary relationship between attorney and
