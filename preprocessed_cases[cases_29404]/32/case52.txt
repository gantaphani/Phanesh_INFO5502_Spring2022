opinion of the court 
introduction 
this matter comes on before this court on the appeal of the united states from an order entered in the district court on june,disqualifying the united states attorney office for the eastern district of pennsylvania from representing the united states in this criminal prosecution for mail fraud in violation of.the order also directed the attorney general forthwith to appoint an attorney to represent the government in the case and required the special attorney to advise the court by august,whether he or she intends to continue this prosecution.the district court effectively has stayed the june,order pending this appeal,and thus the attorney general has not made the appointment.
the background of this case is as follows.for some years,the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania has been investigating chop shops in the philadelphia area.a chop shop dismantles motor vehicles that usually,though not always,are stolen so that the parts can be sold.assistant united states attorney robert reed has conducted the investigation,which obviously has been a major undertaking as the losses arising from the dismantling of thousands of motor vehicles have been about.
in about of the cases investigated,however,the vehicles actually were not stolen.rather,their owners cooperated in their purported theft to avoid lease or loan payments.inasmuch as insurance companies pay for the lost vehicles,these consensual thefts are called insurance.
in and the government investigated whittaker for possibly engaging in an insurance of his vehicle.in november,a grand jury subpoenaed whittaker,seeking samples of his handwriting and his fingerprints.subsequently,he retained samuel stretton,a pennsylvania attorney,to represent him.on november,pursuant to a grand jury subpoena,whittaker was fingerprinted and photographed.
at the same time the investigation apparently was culminating.on january,pursuant to and,reed signed a letter addressed to approximately people who owned cars that were dismantled in the chop shops to advise them of the progress of the investigation and to invite them to file victim impact statements or to make inquiry with respect to the case with certain specified government personnel.
reed prepared the letter,but he did not send it personally.rather,he provided a paralegal in his office with a list of persons whose vehicles had been dismantled.this list included persons the government suspected had participated in insurance.reed,however,instructed the paralegal not to send the letter to these suspects.unfortunately,the paralegal erroneously sent the letter to everyone on the list,including whittaker.
as might be expected,whittaker contacted stretton about the letter.on february,stretton wrote the assistant united states attorney particularly assigned to whittaker case,mark miller,about the matter.stretton letter referred to reed january letter and ended by saying w ould you please call me.miller,as requested,promptly called stretton and told him that the january letter was a mistake and that stretton should disregard it.then,on february,a grand jury indicted whittaker for mail fraud,the victim being the colonial penn insurance company,which insured his vehicle and paid to world omni financial on its lease balance.
thereafter,whittaker,through stretton,moved to dismiss the indictment.after explaining the background of the case,his motion recited that 
the aforementioned january,letter provides information for whittaker as a victim.
the united states attorney office has therefore exculpatory evidence that would demonstrate whittaker is a victim and is not and should not be a defendant.
despite reed investigation and conclusions,whittaker is being charged and has a case pending out of the same matter where he is charged as a defendant by a separate united states attorney in the same office.
it is unfair for the united states attorney office to take the position that the defendant is a victim and not someone who is criminally culpable,and yet have the same office take an entirely different position on the same investigation.
the defendant contends that the government is acting in bad faith as a result,and is acting in violation of his right to due process pursuant to the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the united states constitution and respectfully requests that the charges be dismissed.
app.at.significantly,the motion did not suggest that the january letter caused whittaker to take any action adverse to his defense such as discarding evidence prior to miller notification to stretton of the mistake.nor did the motion suggest that the government used the letter for any improper purpose,such as to gain an interview with whittaker to obtain incriminating evidence.of course,as stretton knew or should have known,the premise of the motion that the government had evidence exculpating whittaker was at best doubtful as miller had told him before whittaker indictment that the letter should be disregarded.moreover,stretton never has produced any evidence to counter the government explanation that reed paralegal sent the letter erroneously.
the motion came on before the district court on may.at that time reed was the only witness who testified on the motion.he described the large scope of the investigation which already had led to about convictions with many cases still pending.he stated that about of the chopped cars were insurance.he explained the procedure that led to sending the victim notification letters,indicating that i did not intend to mean certainly it would have undermined what we were trying to do with respect to people that were potential targets or targets of our investigation.app.at.he testified that the fact that the letter went to someone like whittaker,it went to other people as well,as i indicated,inadvertently and totally by mistake is just what it was.app.at.he also said that he delegated the task of sending the letters to a paralegal.id.
on further examination by the court and by stretton,reed acknowledged that the mistake in sending the letter could have been avoided.he also acknowledged that he was not aware of any letter the government sent to stretton correcting the january letter.
after reed completed his testimony,miller and stretton stipulated that miller orally advised stretton that the letter was sent in error and that miller never made a written response to stretton february,letter.however,the stipulation did not include any suggestion that stretton asked for such a letter to supplement miller oral statement.
the court then ruled on the motion to dismiss,holding that it would not dismiss the indictment because i do think it outrageous conduct.app.at.the court,however,treated the motion to dismiss the indictment as a motion to disqualify the united states attorney because it thought that there was a very serious issue of professional conduct under,at a minimum,rules of professional conduct,referring to pennsylvania rules governing the conduct of attorneys.app.at.thus,the court ordered that unless the attorney general appointed a special prosecutor,the parties should file memoranda on the disqualification issue.stretton then suggested that perhaps pennsylvania rule also was implicated but that he wanted to emphasize to the court that,despite the tone of my questions to reed,i not alleging that he did act in bad faith.app.at.the court then agreed,saying i certainly do believe that he did act in bad faith.id.stretton and the court then agreed that there was no basis for disciplinary action to be taken against reed and that he is a fine person.id.
the district court disposed of the matter in its opinion entered june.see united states whittaker.the opinion incorrectly started by indicating that b ecause the same united states attorney office regarded him a perpetrator and a victim of the same alleged insurance fraud,defendant wayne whittaker has filed a motion to disqualify that office for its ethical breaches.id.at.this sentence was wrong for two reasons.first,of course,the united states did not regard whittaker as a crime victim,but merely inadvertently sent him a letter identifying him as a victim and then,when whittaker attorney,stretton,inquired about the letter,corrected the mistake.the district court certainly was well aware of these facts.second,stretton did not file a motion seeking reed or the united states attorney disqualification.rather,the court,after raising the disqualification issue in colloquy with counsel at the may hearing,on its own initiative converted whittaker motion to dismiss the indictment into a motion to disqualify the united states attorney office,and whittaker effectively joined in the court motion.the court then continued its opinion stating that it had found no other case presenting such extraordinary conduct.id.
the court subsequently indicated that whittaker in his supplemental submission following the may hearing,identified no less than eight rules of professional conduct which he believes the government breached when its left hand called him a criminal and its right hand called him a victim of the same scheme,id.at,including violation of 
rule,which generally bars conflicts of interest whittaker contends that as the january letter purported to be helping him at the same time the government was seeking to prosecute him,this constituted such a conflict 
rule,which bars a lawyer from taking a position adverse to a former client in the same or a related matter 
rule,which outlines the professional responsibilities of a prosecutor,and in particular rule a,which bars a prosecutor from bringing a claim that he knows is not supported by probable cause 
rule a,which bars attorneys from making false statements of fact to third persons whittaker maintains that the january letter statement that he was a victim constitutes a false statement pursuant to this rule 
rule,which precludes contact with someone the office knew was represented by another lawyer 
rule,which bars the collection of evidence by methods that could compromise the rights of a third party whittaker asserts that the letter constituted an effort to obtain a statement in violation of this rule 
rule c,which bars conduct involving misrepresentation and 
rule d,which bars conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.
id.at.the court also pointed out that whittaker cited rule a,which provides that a lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness,id.at,explaining that,apparently because of the january letter,reed might be a witness at the trial.id.the court then set forth that reed testified that the sending of the letter was inadvertent.id.
in its analysis,the court indicated that the pennsylvania rules of professional conduct were applicable by reason of a,which provides that a government attorney shall be subject to state laws and rules governing attorneys in each state where such attorney engages in that attorney duties,to the same extent and in the same manner as other attorneys in that state.id.the court found,however,that there had not been violations of rules and.see id.at.but the court went on to say that the january,letter was a palpable falsehood as the government itself demonstrated by a may,letter,filed after the may,hearing,explaining its definitive position that whittaker is a criminal.id.indeed,the district court said that it was not until it sent the may letter that the government stat ed this conclusion.id.of course,the court characterization of the january letter as being unretracted until that time was inaccurate as,in conformity with stretton request,miller had called stretton before whittaker indictment and explained that the letter was erroneous and should be disregarded.
the court then found that the january letter was a false statement of material fact sent in violation of rule.see id.at.the court,however,relying on united states balter,cir,held that rule had not been violated.see id.at.
the court also held that rule was not violated because there is no evidence,for example,of the government using the january victim letter to inveigle information or admissions from whittaker,or of other malign purpose that might have approached outrageousness.id.at.the court,however,found that there had been a violation of rule d,apparently partly because the united states attorney conduct in this matter had been cavalier and reed had been amused when he testified at the may,hearing.see id.at.in this regard,the court indicated that whittaker had been on a roller coaster.the court said that 
we also know from ausa reed concession,that whittaker was not alone in riding this roller coaster.while these other are not before us,their existence confirms the seriousness of the fiasco we consider here.in its repeated unprofessional conduct,the office has here prejudiced the administration of justice and undermined public confidence in a most sensitive part of our legal institutions.the united states attorney office thus transgressed rpc d.
id.at as far as we can ascertain,the court reference to repeated unprofessional conduct simply meant that the united states attorney erroneously sent the letter to other persons the government thought were implicated in the offenses.
the court next dealt with the remedy,indicating that it found breaches of three rules of professional conduct,meaning rules,c and d.id.the court then cited in re corn derivatives antitrust,cir,for its need to apply a balancing test in determining whether it should disqualify the united states attorney.after discussing the parties interests,the court said that there can be no doubt that our interest in protecting the integrity of the proceedings and maintaining public confidence in the judicial system favors disqualification.whittaker,at.the court nevertheless went on to indicate that the government acted without bad faith or malintent sic and that its conduct is towards the lower end of the egregiousness spectrum for prosecutorial errors.id.it held that the government behavior may bring our system into disrepute with the citizenry if the judiciary condones it.id.it thus directed the attorney general to appoint an attorney from outside the eastern district of pennsylvania to assume responsibility to prosecute this case pursuant to.see id.at.
the government then moved for reconsideration,but the court denied the motion in a memorandum dated july.see united states whittaker.we will not discuss the memorandum at length,but we do point out that in it the court clarified its reasons for finding that the government conduct violated rule c,concerning situations in which attorneys are dealing with unrepresented persons.in particular,the court held that the government did not make a reasonable effort to correct the misunderstanding it created with the january letter merely by correcting it with the oral representation to counsel.whittaker,at.the government then appealed.
ii.jurisdiction 
as always,we first must consider jurisdiction.plainly,the district court had jurisdiction under.the matter of our jurisdiction is not so simple.the united states takes the position that we have appellate jurisdiction under pursuant to the collateral order doctrine stemming from cohen beneficial indus.loan.on the other hand,whittaker contends that we do not have appellate jurisdiction as this appeal is of a pretrial,rather than a final order.see gerardi pelullo,cir.
ordinarily,a court of appeals does not have jurisdiction over an appeal from a pretrial order during the pendency of the proceedings in a district court.see comuso national passenger,cir.under the collateral order doctrine,however,a court of appeals has jurisdiction if 
the order from which the appellant appeals conclusively determines the disputed question the order resolves an important issue that is completely separate from the merits of the dispute and the order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
collinsgru palmyra bd.of,cir,quoting in re ford motor,cir.plainly the order meets the foregoing criteria.to start with,the order conclusively determines that the united states attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania is disqualified in this case and can not participate in its prosecution.thus,the order was not tentative or subject to later
