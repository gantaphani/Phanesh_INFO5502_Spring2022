roger bruce feinman appeals from a march,order the march order of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york charles sifton,chief judge and chairman of the committee on grievances of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york the committee disbarring him from practice before that court.the march order was a reciprocal discipline order based entirely on an order of disbarment previously entered by the united states district court for the southern district of new york the southern district order the southern district order was affirmed by this court on july.see in re feinman,wl cir.july.for the reasons stated below,the march order is affirmed.
on appeal,feinman advances two colorable arguments.first,he contends that issuance of the march order violated the united states constitution because it was based on the southern district order,which in turn was based in part on factual findings made by officers.however,feinman raised this argument on his prior appeal to this court,and we reached and rejected it.see in re feinman,wl,at.accordingly,he is barred from pressing it again here.see,metromedia fugazy,cir noting that collateral estoppel bars a party from relitigating in a second proceeding an issue of fact or law that was litigated and actually decided in a prior proceeding.
second,feinman argues that his disbarment in the eastern district of new york violated the due process clause of the fifth amendment to the united states constitution because he was not provided with actual notice that amended disciplinary charges had been lodged against him.this argument is sheer casuistry.feinman sent a letter to the committee stating that he would accept no further correspondence from it.true to his word,feinman then refused to take delivery of a federal express envelope conveying an amended complaint that listed the charges against him.in light of these facts,the district court observed that feinman actual notice claim borders on the frivolous.district court memorandum and order at attached as appendix.we agree,and hold that a party constitutional right to receive actual notice of certain claims against him is not violated when he has himself intentionally and successfully thwarted service of the very notice that he claims not to have received.see,reliance ins.mast constr,cir i t is that the effect of a written notice can not be avoided by refusing service of that notice.collecting cases franklin aycock,cir.see also patmon young prof l comm r,cir holding that actual notice requirement for tax deficiency assessment is satisfied by a party refusal of certified mail on the ground that a taxpayer should not be allowed to defeat actual notice by deliberately refusing delivery of the irs deficiency notice erhard comm r,cir same.see generally cherry heffernan,so,stating that if a party chooses to flout the notice and refuse to accept it,he will not be permitted to say in the next breath that he has not been served.
we have considered feinman remaining arguments,and conclude that they are without merit.
accordingly,the march order is affirmed.
united states district courteastern district of new cps in the matter of roger bruce feinman,an attorney and,and order 
this matter is before the committee on grievances for the eastern district of new york the committee on grievances to consider the imposition of reciprocal discipline against respondent pro se roger feinman following his disbarment by the united states district court for the southern district of new york.for the reasons stated below,no evidentiary hearing is required.respondent is disbarred,and his name shall be stricken from the roll of attorneys of this court.
background 
the following statement of facts is taken from the record of the underlying disciplinary action and from the submissions of respondent and the investigative attorney.disputes are noted.
by order dated june,issued pursuant to rule d of the local rules of the united states district for the eastern district of new york,the committee on grievances designated anthony edward davis,to review the allegations that led to respondent roger feinman disbarment by the southern district of new york,to advise the committee whether prosecution of a reciprocal disciplinary action was appropriate,and if so,to draft a statement of charges for service upon the respondent.having reviewed the southern district proceedings,davis filed a recommendation that this court impose reciprocal discipline upon feinman together with a proposed statement of charges.by order dated december,the committee on grievances adopted the report and recommendation and statement of charges.feinman was provided with a copy of the recommendation and statement of charges,to which he responded by a memorandum of law dated january.
southern district proceedings 
by order dated september,the committee on grievances of the southern district of new york the grievance committee received a complaint against feinman in writing and concluded that the complaint against feinman warranted prosecution.by order dated october,the grievance committee directed feinman to show cause why discipline should not be imposed in connection with the allegations set forth in an accompanying statement of charges accusing feinman of knowingly making several false accusations against a judge and taking action which served merely to harass or maliciously injure another in violation of dr b and a,respectively.on november and,feinman submitted letters addressing the subject matter of the charges.
by letter dated january,the panel advised feinman and committee counsel that it would not be restricted to consideration of the provisions of the code of professional responsibility cited in the statement of charges and notified them that the panel intended also to consider whether feinman conduct violated other provisions of the code,particularly dr c and.the letter gave committee counsel until february,to file an amended statement of charges and feinman until february,to respond to the amended statement of charges.
on january,an amended statement of charges was submitted,which added no new substantive allegations,differing only from the initial statement of charges in that it cited additional provisions of the new york code of professional responsibility,dr c and.feinman submitted an answer to the amended statement of charges on february.
on february,a second amended statement of charges was presented to the panel.the second amended statement of charges differed from the amended statement in that it added citations to dr a and to charges and included two new charges covering statements made by feinman not mentioned in the amended statement.by letter dated february,feinman was afforded until march,to respond to the second amended statement of charges.also in this letter,feinman and committee counsel were asked to provide by march a letter that a identifies the witnesses they intend to call at the hearing,b lists the exhibits they intend to offer at the hearing and c sets forth their best estimate of the amount of time required for presentation of their respective cases.
in a letter dated february,feinman stated that he will neither participate in,nor respond to,nor appear at any of the panel further proceedings in this matter.in this letter,feinman also stated that he will not accept any future correspondence from the panel.as a result,when the panel letter of february,was delivered to feinman on february,it was returned with the notation,delivery refused.on that same day,feinman refused delivery of a federal express package which contained the second amended statement of charges.
the panel responded to feinman declarations that he refused to participate any further in the proceedings in a letter dated march.in that letter,the panel restated the time by which feinman was to respond to the second amended statement of charges.in relevant part,the letter additionally stated 
should you refuse to participate further in these proceedings,as stated in your february letter,notwithstanding being provided with notice and an opportunity to be heard,we will proceed in your absence and will render our report and recommendation to the court with respect to the charges against you.
in this regard,we note that a respondent failure to cooperate in disciplinary proceedings,in whole or in part,may be considered in aggravation of any sanction that may be recommended by the panel and imposed by the court.
feinman thereafter continued to refuse to accept any communications from either the panel or committee counsel.
feinman and committee counsel were notified by letter of march,that an evidentiary hearing had been scheduled for april,at.feinman refused delivery of this letter,and it was returned unopened.feinman failed to appear at the scheduled hearing.by letter dated may,committee counsel advised the panel of his recommendation that feinman name be stricken from the roll of the united states district court for the southern district of new york based on a statement of charges on september,the panel submitted its report of findings and recommendations,finding that counts one,four,five,a portion of six,and seven of the statement of charges should be sustained,and recommending that respondent be stricken from the roll of attorneys of the united states district court for the southern district of new york on february,the southern district accepted the panel findings and recommendations,and judge patterson,chairman of the grievance committee,ordered respondent stricken from the roll of the members of the bar of that court on march,feinman appealed the southern district decision to the second circuit.on july,the second circuit affirmed judge patterson decision disbarring feinman.
on december,this court ordered feinman to show cause why he should not be disciplined by this court in light of the discipline by the southern district.that order to show cause incorrectly stated that the court was proceeding pursuant to rule g based on discipline having been imposed by the supreme court of the state of new york,appellate division.in a letter dated january,responding to this order to show cause,feinman notified this court of that error and informed the court that the southern district order had been vacated by order of judge patterson on december.on february,feinman was again disbarred by the southern district,and respondent submitted papers opposing reciprocal discipline by this court in which he stated seven affirmative defenses he was denied due process in the southern district proceeding in that he was not given notice or an opportunity to be heard there was an infirmity of proof establishing the alleged misconduct the imposition of discipline would be unjust the southern district lacked jurisdiction under article iii of the constitution to create a hearing panel composed of members of the bar in private practice there is no judicial opinion or decision by the southern district on which this court could base an order of reciprocal discipline the southern district order was procured by fraud and collusion and respondent was disabled by extreme poverty from mounting an effective defense in the southern district proceeding.the matter was referred to this court committee on grievances,which thereafter designated davis to investigate the allegations that led to respondent discipline by the southern district of new york.davis thereafter recommended that this court impose reciprocal discipline on feinman.
nature of substantive charges 
all four charges for which the southern district panel disbarred feinman arise out of the conduct of feinman in the course of his representation of robert groden in a defamation action brought in february against random house,the new york times,and gerald posner.groden is a writer who has written extensively on the subject of the assassination of president kennedy,arguing that there existed a broad conspiracy against president kennedy.groden argued that he was defamed by an advertisement placed in the new york times for gerald posner book,case closed which stated that groden,as well as certain other individuals who have contended that the assassination was the product of a conspiracy,were guilty of misleading the american public.
on august,judge martin granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants in the groden case.on september,feinman filed a notice of motion on behalf of his client to reconsider,reargue,alter,amend,modify,vacate,and voluntarily recuse in which he made the following statement 
the learned trial judge either is or was related by blood to,and is or was the brother of terrence terry martin,with whom counsel for plaintiff worked in close association during the at cbs news.it is unknown to plaintiff counsel whether martin is still living,however it is believed by counsel that martin did not view counsel in a favorable light and that,were he still alive,he would be aware of unfavorable and conceivably pejorative facts relating to counsel for plaintiff that would tend to denigrate the credibility of counsel in the eyes of the court.
on september,prior to the determination of this motion,feinman wrote a letter to district judge royce lamberth of the district of columbia.feinman letter,in relevant part,follows 
the simple purpose of this letter is to create a record that i did not learn until late in the afternoon of wednesday,september,that mark lane had instituted suit in your court.it is my understanding that lane counsel was likewise unaware of the groden litigation,until the firm of baker hostetler submitted a copy of judge martin crooked and corrupt decision in our case,to support their motion for summary judgment davidson has already been supplied with a copy of my notice of motion directed at judge martin serious judicial misconduct.
copies of the letter were sent to the attorneys involved in the suit filed before judge lamberth,opposing counsel in the groden case,and judge martin.
after denying feinman motion for reconsideration and recusal on september,judge martin issued an order to show cause why feinman should not be sanctioned pursuant to rule for his unfounded accusations against the judge.on october,feinman submitted an affirmation in response to judge martin order which stated in relevant part that t he pervasive errors,unfounded and wholly unwarranted statements,and judicial ad hominems against plaintiff and now his counsel in this court memorandum compel me to regretfully conclude that these opinions were more the products of ill motive than of honest intellectual inquiry.at the hearing for this order on october,judge martin did not rule with respect to the issue of rule sanctions,but instead referred the matter to the grievance committee of the southern district.
on november,feinman wrote to judge martin in connection with the service of papers in opposition to plaintiff motion requesting the involuntary recusal of judge martin from the groden case,stating in relevant part 
i am rejecting service that was attempted by hand this afternoon of certain papers from the defendants attorneys,and i am returning the envelope to kovner herewith.
i have elected to treat the defendants application to brief the issue,and their submission,as ex parte.you two fellas can play with each other all you want.i gone upstairs to speak with the men.
on november,the second circuit denied plaintiff petition for a writ of mandamus ordering the recusal of judge martin in the groden case on november.judge martin denied the motion to recuse himself pursuant to by order dated december.on january,feinman a letter to judge martin,with a copy to opposing counsel.in this letter,feinman complained of a dispute that had developed with respect to the contents of the joint appendix and record of his appeal of judge martin grant of summary judgment.feinman stated 
i am very impressed with kovner brazenness.he either accompanies president clinton to the mideast as his token new york jewboy,or takes vacation trips as he pleases,and then thinks that he can just waltz into his law school classmate courtroom and have his every wish fulfilled.it must be nice to have friends grant your every whim.
upon recommending that this court impose reciprocal discipline on feinman,davis statement of charges states that the said discipline by the united states district court for the southern district of new york constitutes proper and sufficient ground for reciprocal discipline of roger bruce feinman pursuant to rule b of the local civil rules of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.
discussion 
respondent has already been disciplined by the southern district of new york accordingly,the issue before the court is whether it is appropriate to impose reciprocal discipline.reciprocal discipline is a means of sanctioning attorneys for their misconduct in another forum.an attorney seeking to avoid reciprocal discipline carries a heavy burden.under local civil rule d,reciprocal discipline will be imposed 
unless the attorney concerned establishes by clear and convincing evidence i that there was such an infirmity of proof of misconduct by the attorney as to give rise to the clear conviction that this court could not consistent with its duty accept as final the conclusion of the other court,or ii that the procedure resulting in the investigation or discipline of the attorney by the other court was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of due process,or iii that the imposition of discipline by this court would result in grave injustice.
respondent submission in response to this court order to show cause dated december,stated seven affirmative defenses he was denied due process in the southern district proceeding in that he was not given notice or an opportunity to be heard there was an infirmity of proof establishing the alleged misconduct the imposition of discipline would be unjust the southern district lacked jurisdiction under article iii of the constitution to create a hearing panel composed of members of the bar in private practice there is no judicial opinion or decision by the southern district on which this court could base an order of reciprocal discipline the southern district order was procured by fraud and collusion and respondent was disabled by extreme poverty from mounting an effective defense in the southern district proceeding.in response to anthony davis report and statement of charges,feinman later submitted a more detailed argument asserting that the southern district proceeding was conducted in such a manner as to violate due process and,in conjunction with that violation,was infected with fraud and collusion,and the disbarment of respondent is an excessively harsh punishment.
due process in the southern district proceedings 
procedural due process is a flexible concept,and the procedures to be afforded in a proceeding depend on the type of proceeding,the interests of both the state and the attorney subject to discipline,and the risk of erroneous deprivation of the attorney interest.see in re jacobs,cir citing mathews eldridge,d.in a disciplinary case,due process requires only that respondent be given notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to be heard.see jacobs,at.
feinman first argues that he was not given notice of or an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the southern district second amended statement of charges.in his submissions,feinman admits that he sent a letter dated february,in which he stated that he will neither participate in,nor respond to,nor appear at any of the panel further proceedings in this matter.feinman also stated that he would not accept any future correspondence from the panel.thereafter,feinman returned the panel letter of february,with the notation delivery refused and telephoned federal express to refuse delivery of a package they were holding for him.the federal express package contained a copy of the second amended statement of charges and the letter contained a time frame within which feinman was required to submit his papers in opposition to the second amended statement of charges.further,feinman refused delivery of these two communications despite the fact that he knew that they related to the disciplinary proceedings against him.
given that feinman specifically refused delivery of the communications,the absence of service of which he now cites as a violation of due process,his complaints are unavailing.it borders on the frivolous for a party to raise a due process claim when he has earlier attempted to thwart the very notice he complains about not receiving.united states bolton,cir see also patmon and young professional commissioner of internal revenue,cir stating that a taxpayer should not be allowed to defeat actual notice by deliberately refusing delivery of notice erhard commissioner of internal revenue,cir refusing to countenance the party refusal of a notice which she held in her hands and simply refused to open or read.i t is that the effect of a written notice can not be avoided by refusing service of that notice.reliance insurance mast construction,cir.
feinman also argues,without citation of authority,that the southern district lacked the power to create a hearing panel composed of members of the bar in private practice to perform adjudicative functions in original disciplinary actions instituted within that court.for that reason,feinman argues that his disbarment in the southern district is not entitled to faith and credit or comity by this court.this argument must fail because it proceeds from the fundamentally flawed premise that the panel that authored the findings and recommendations for submission to the southern district grievance committee was the ultimate arbiter.the panel did not perform any adjudicative functions.instead,it was the role of the panel to advise the committee whether prosecution of a federal disciplinary action is required and to issue a report and recommendation to the grievance committee.in the matter of friedman,no,wl,at.it is the ultimate responsibility of the grievance committee,after conducting a hearing,if necessary,to arrive at a final determination.
feinman further argues that,because there is no judicial opinion by the southern district setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law,there is no intelligible basis upon which this court may determine whether reciprocal discipline ought to be imposed.feinman argument,however,even to the extent that it could be construed as a due process violation,is contradicted by the plain language of the february,order in which feinman was disbarred.that order specifically accepted the findings of the panel of attorneys.those findings included a detailed explication of the facts of feinman case.
feinman also contends that the southern district disbarment order was obtained through fraud,deceit,and multiple false misrepresentations.feinman argument is based on his statement that he was never served with a copy of the second amended statement of charges,a fact that feinman insists was known by the investigative panel to the southern district grievance committee.feinman states that despite this knowledge there are several statements in the findings and recommendations which state that he was served with the second amended statement of charges,thereby given notice and an opportunity to respond to the charges,and refused to avail himself of that opportunity.
feinman further argues that the purpose of this fraud on the court was to convince the grievance committee,and later the second circuit on appeal,that he purposefully refused to respond to the second amended statement of charges despite notice and an opportunity to be heard.feinman states that in making these false statements the panel sought to convince these courts of his contempt of the disciplinary proceedings as a circumstance in addition to,or in aggravation of,his alleged professional misconduct.in reality,feinman explains,he never received the second amended statement of charges or the letter granting him time to respond because in each case he had refused delivery.
this court prior discussion of the adequacy of service in this case notwithstanding,feinman argument that the panel findings and recommendation contained false misrepresentations concerning service of process is belied by the statement of facts within that document.the panel report states in a clear manner feinman p
