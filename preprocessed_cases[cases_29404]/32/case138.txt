plaintiff johnson,brought this adversary proceeding seeking to prevent the discharge of a debt owed to him by his attorney,harold frederick riebesell the debtor.johnson claimed the debt was not dischargeable because it was the product of riebesell false representations,specifically riebesell failure to meet disclosure obligations imposed upon him by the colorado rules of professional responsibility.after a trial,the bankruptcy court decided most of riebesell debt was not subject to discharge.it entered judgment in favor of johnson on the portion of the debt.it further awarded johnson interest at the rate of percent,as provided for in the promissory note securing the debt.riebesell appealed from the bankruptcy court order to the tenth circuit bankruptcy appellate panel bap,which affirmed.he now appeals from the bap decision 
background 
riebesell is an attorney licensed in colorado since.johnson is a retired computer information consultant who worked primarily in the health care field.the two men have known each other since the early,when they went to high school together.later they lived in the same neighborhood where they socialized on occasion and their children sometimes played together.
in july,johnson hired riebesell as his attorney to prepare a consulting agreement and stock subscription agreement between johnson and a small management consulting company.riebesell prepared and delivered the requested agreements.they were executed in october.johnson did not formally engage riebesell to perform any further legal services at that time,but neither did the parties formally terminate the relationship.
less than two months after the documents were executed,riebesell asked johnson for a personal loan of for a period of one year.riebesell told johnson his move from one law firm to another had left him temporarily short of cash,but he was confident in the prospects for his future financial success at the new firm.he needed the loan to serve as a bridge between the two practices.
johnson agreed to make the loan.on december,he issued a personal check to riebesell in the requested amount.in return,riebesell prepared and delivered an unsecured promissory note with a term,bearing interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum the note.
at the time johnson made the loan,the colorado rules of professional conduct provided as follows 
a a lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client or knowingly acquire an ownership,possessory,security or other pecuniary interest adverse to a client unless 
the transaction and terms on which the lawyer acquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and transmitted in writing to the client in a manner which can be reasonably understood by the client 
the client is informed that use of independent counsel may be advisable and is given a reasonable opportunity to seek the advice of such independent counsel in the transaction and 
the client consents in writing thereto.
proff l conduct a 
riebesell made none of the disclosures required by rule a in connection with the loan transaction.and johnson did not investigate riebesell financial condition or consult with outside counsel in connection with the loan transaction.according to his later testimony,johnson agreed to make the loan because riebesell was a friend,he was my attorney,i relied on him.at.
in april,before the note was due,johnson again hired riebesell to perform legal work in the form of a comprehensive estate plan.the plan included a family limited partnership agreement involving a limited liability company llc.in august,while working on the operating agreement for the llc,riebesell informed johnson that his financial affairs had not gone as planned and he would be unable to pay the note when it fell due in december.johnson agreed to a extension of the due date.riebesell later delivered the operating agreement,which was executed on november.
riebesell prepared a new unsecured promissory note,dated august,it incorporated the principal and accrued interest on the december note the note.the new principal balance was.the note bore interest at the rate of twelve percent per annum and the entire amount was due no later than january.according to the terms of the new note,in the event of default johnson could opt to accelerate the loan,in which case it would become immediately due and payable and bear interest at the rate of percent.again,no disclosures under rule a were made in connection with this loan,and riebesell made no payments on it.
following execution of the note,the parties relationship continued.in late,johnson asked riebesell for legal advice concerning real estate investments in,he asked him to draft a revised will and in,he directed riebesell to prepare an irrevocable insurance trust.
by,the note was in default and riebesell told johnson he had no funds with which to pay it.in an attempt to generate funds to pay the note,johnson agreed to help riebesell form a consulting business called perigee group llc perigee.perigee would share office space with riebesell new law firm,the riebesell law firm,and johnson would provide consulting services to perigee.
johnson agreed to loan riebesell an additional as seed money for the new endeavor.he advanced in december,in february,and in april.in exchange for these advances on april,riebesell executed a new unsecured note in favor of johnson in the amount of the note.the note represented the sum of three items the principal of the note the accrued interest on the note and the amounts lent for the perigee business.the entire sum was due and payable on or before january.the note bore interest at twelve percent per annum and contained a default interest rate of percent per annum.
by march or april,the parties personal and business relationship had soured.johnson left the office space,refused to provide consulting services to perigee,and terminated riebesell legal representation.
riebesell defaulted on the note when it came due.in may,johnson filed a collection action against riebesell in state court.that same month,on may,riebesell filed for chapter relief.
riebesell schedule of creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims identified creditors.about a third of these,including johnson,were individuals,many of them current or former clients of his law practice.riebesell had borrowed nearly million from these individuals.
johnson filed this adversary proceeding in november,seeking judgment in the principal amount of the note,interest at the default rate of percent,and to except the debt from discharge.on september,riebesell signed a conditional admission of misconduct with the colorado state bar involving one of his debts to another former client.he admitted to violating colorado rule of professional conduct a by borrowing money from a client on terms that were not fair and reasonable to the client under the circumstances and by failing to inform the client that the use of independent counsel might be advisable.
johnson claims were tried to the bankruptcy court.it granted judgment in favor of johnson for the full amount of the note and accrued interest to the date the adversary proceeding was filed,less the he had loaned riebesell as part of the perigee business and any interest attributable to the perigee debt,declared the portion of the debt for which it had granted judgment,and provided the judgment would bear interest at the rate of percent.johnson submitted a proposed order calculating the amount of the judgment at,which the district court signed over riebesell objection.
riebesell appealed to the bap,which affirmed the bankruptcy court order.johnson did not from the bankruptcy court decision determining that the was dischargeable.
standard of review 
this is an appeal from a bap decision.see d.but,we review only the bankruptcy court decision.alderete educ.credit mgmt.in re alderete,cir johnson smith in re johnson,cir.by this we do not mean that we ignore the procedural posture of the case before appeal from a bap decision.rather,we mean that we treat the bap as a subordinate appellate tribunal whose rulings are entitled to no deference although they certainly may be persuasive.mathai warren in re warren,cir.we review matters of law de novo,and factual findings which are made only by the bankruptcy court,not the bap,we review for clear error.see gullickson brown in re brown,cir.
false representation 
the bankruptcy court concluded the debt was pursuant to a a because riebesell had made a false representation to johnson in connection with the loan.the pertinent statute reads as follows 
a a discharge under section of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt 
for money,property,services,or an extension,renewal,or refinancing of credit,to the extent obtained by 
a false pretenses,a false representation,or actual fraud,other than a statement respecting the debtor or an insider financial condition.
in order to establish a claim under this subsection,a creditor must prove the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence the debtor made a false representation the debtor made the representation with the intent to deceive the creditor the creditor relied on the representation the creditor reliance was reasonable and the debtor representation caused the creditor to sustain a loss.fowler young in re young,cir riebesell contends the a a requirements for are not satisfied for several reasons 
he had no relationship with johnson when the loan was negotiated or completed and,hence,he had no duty to make the rule a disclosures 
the transaction falls into an exception contained in the official commentary to rule a exempting standard commercial transactions between a lawyer and a client 
he did not make a false representation in connection with the loans with the intent of deceiving johnson and 
there was no showing that johnson justifiably relied on the relationship in making the loans.
we consider each of these arguments in turn.
relationship 
under colorado law,
an relationship is established when it is shown that the client seeks and receives the advice of the lawyer on the legal consequences of the client past or contemplated actions.the relationship may be inferred from the conduct of the parties.the proper test is a subjective one,and an important factor is whether the client believes that the relationship existed.
further,the relationship is an ongoing relationship giving rise to a continuing duty to the client unless and until the client clearly understands,or reasonably should understand,that the relationship is no longer to be depended on.
people bennett,en banc per curiam quotations and citations omitted.
riebesell says an relationship did not exist at the time of the first loan because his legal services relating to the consulting agreement and stock subscription agreement were complete by the time johnson made the loan.but we agree with the bankruptcy court,which held relationship did exist because the relationship did not formally terminate until march or april,when johnson terminated it in his conditional admission of misconduct,riebesell recognized an relationship with a different client on facts less compelling than those involving johnson and in bennett,the colorado supreme court recognized an relationship on facts similar to those in this case.see bennett,at.
riebesell also says no relationship should be recognized at the time of the note because,although he was representing johnson on other matters at that time,the new note merely capitalized the accrued interest and thus did not amount to a new loan.but a a reaches a renewal,or refinancing of credit,to the extent obtained by a false representation,as well as an original extension of credit he further argues that johnson did not depend on the relationship in connection with the execution and delivery of the note.but at this stage of inquiry the existence of an relationship is the issue,not johnson dependence on that relationship.the requisite relationship existed when the note was negotiated,executed and delivered 
standard commercial transaction exception 
riebesell contends he was not obligated to make the disclosures required by rule a because the loans from johnson were standard commercial transactions.he relies on official commentary to the rule indicating it 
does not apply to standard commercial transactions between the lawyer and the client for products or services that the client generally markets to others,for example,banking or brokerage services,medical services,products manufactured or distributed by the client,and utilities services.in such transactions,the lawyer has no advantage in dealing with the client,and the restrictions in paragraph a are unnecessary and impracticable.
prof l conduct,cmt.
we find the bap reasoning on this point compelling 
riebesell attempts to characterize several transactions throughout which he represented johnson as making loans,the purchase of stock in the small management consulting company in,and the real estate investment in.these transactions hardly elevate johnson to the position of being in the banking or brokerage business.further,johnson testified that he had never loaned money to anyone personally prior to making the loan to riebesell.riebesell argument regarding the standard commercial transaction exception is without merit,and little more than wishful thinking.
the loans to riebesell were not standard commercial transactions exempt from the requirements of rule a 
intent to deceive 
riebesell next argues his intent to deceive johnson was not proved by a preponderance of the evidence.riebesell failure to make the disclosures required by rule constitutes a false representation within the meaning of a a.see young,at stating attorney failure to disclose the information required under a similar new mexico rule of professional conduct constitutes a false representation or false pretenses under a a.on appeal to the bap,riebesell did not appear to contest that failure to comply with crpc rule constitutes a false representation or false pretenses.at.however,in order to satisfy the criteria for nondischargeability,the false representation must also have been made with the intent to deceive johnson.young,at.riebesell claims such an intent was lacking because he did not attempt to hide his deteriorating financial condition from johnson,who voluntarily agreed to loan the money.
his argument is too simplistic.the intent to deceive may be inferred from the totality of the circumstances.id.quotation omitted.and that is precisely the inference drawn by the bankruptcy court.it concluded that johnson trust in riebesell,his attorney,caused him,like so many others,to fall for riebesell scheme of borrowing money from clients.riebesell ensnared several other clients and he continued to do so until just three months before he filed his bankruptcy petition.see johnson riebesell in re riebesell,it also found riebesell transfer of title to his residence to his wife was accomplished to shield the asset from creditors,further grounds to infer an intent to deceive.although riebesell attributes his failure to repay the loans to unintended circumstances beyond his control,the bankruptcy court did not,as a whole,find riebesell testimony credible.based on our review of the record,the bankruptcy court finding that riebesell had the requisite intent to deceive johnson was not clearly erroneous 
justifiable reliance 
the fourth element of the a a test requires the creditor reliance to be reasonable.the appropriate standard is not reasonableness in the sense of whether an objectively reasonable person would have relied upon the debtor false representations.rather,the inquiry is whether the actual creditor reliance was justifiable from a subjective standpoint.field mans,d.in determining whether a creditor reliance was justifiable,a court should therefore examine the qualities and characteristics of the particular plaintiff,and the circumstances of the particular case,rather than applying a community standard of conduct to all cases.id.at.quotation omitted.even under the justifiable test,however,the plaintiff must use his senses and at least make a cursory examination or investigation of the facts of the transaction before entering into it.id.quotation omitted.moreover,this test does not
