in april,the district court entered an order reinstating martin to practice in the northern district of oklahoma,on probationary status for one year,tab at.at that time,martin had already served his suspension in this court,and he had been reinstated to practice in this court with a one year probationary period,tab at.

after martin resigned from the bar of this court,the district court entered an order disbarring him from practicing before it,tab.the disbarment order was entered pursuant to lr h,which provides that an attorney of the district court bar who is under investigation for misconduct in any court of competent jurisdiction,who resigns from the bar of the investigating jurisdiction,shall forthwith be disbarred from practicing in the district court.on january,in response to a motion to reconsider that was filed by martin,the district court entered an order rescinding the disbarment order,and the court instead ordered that martin is suspended,rather than disbarred,from practice before the northern district of oklahoma,tab at.the court further ordered that martin may apply for reinstatement no sooner than two years from december.id.
on april,martin filed an application to be reinstated to the bar of the northern district of oklahoma,tab.on july,the district court entered an order denying martin application for reinstatement.the court denied the application because it found that martin had violated the january,suspension order by continuing to represent clients in cases pending in the northern district of oklahoma,tab at.martin did not file an appeal in this court regarding the july,order.
on december,martin filed a pleading in the district court entitled resubmission of supplemented application for reinstatement supplemented application,tab.as summarized by the district court,in his supplemented application,martin argued that the activities which he has undertaken during his suspension do not require admission to the bar of the northern district of oklahoma,he has neither personally appeared in court nor signed pleadings rather,he has only performed tasks which a legal assistant could have performed,tab at.
the district court subsequently set martin supplemented application for a hearing before a panel.in response to the hearing setting,martin filed a pleading in the district court entitled request for clarification and,as appropriate,notice request for clarification,requesting that 
he be afforded due process,consisting of written notification,in advance of the hearing,apprizing him of any and all allegations which might be brought against him,and which will be litigated at such hearing,in order to afford him a fair opportunity to prepare to meet said allegations,and to garner witnesses exhibits to present in opposition to any such allegations.
tab at.although the district court did not formally rule on martin request for clarification,the court implicitly denied the request because it did not provide martin with any further notice regarding the hearing on the supplemented application.
the hearing on martin supplemented application took place on august,before the honorable terence kern the chief judge of the northern district of oklahoma at the time,the honorable clair eagan,and the honorable james payne the panel.see supplemental,vol.ii.during the hearing,the panel questioned martin regarding the work that he had performed in cases pending in the northern district of oklahoma since his suspension in january.as summarized by the panel during the hearing,martin global response to the panel questioning was that he believed that he was allowed to do anything that a legal assistant could do which basically allowed him to participate in fees and help with the work as long as he did make an actual appearance in federal court or sign a pleading.id.at.but martin also testified that while he referred all northern district of oklahoma cases to supervising attorneys who were admitted to practice in that court,he nonetheless shared or split the attorney fees that were paid to those attorneys,id.at,and he participated in client interviews,id.at.
on november,the panel entered an order denying martin supplemented application,concluding that he had violated the january,suspension order by continu ing to perform tasks that constituted the practice of law in matters that he knew would,or currently did,fall within the jurisdiction of the northern district,tab at.the panel also found that,i n a number of cases,martin took monies in exchange for his work in the form of an attorney fee.the fees that he received were not allocated on an hourly basis but on a percentage or proportionate basis wherein he received a share of the fee from the attorney to whom he referred the matter.id.citations omitted.consequently,according to the panel,martin,in the capacity of attorney,continued to profit from cases in the northern district.id.at.
martin is now appealing the november,order,arguing that the district court deprived him of procedural due process that the constraints imposed by his suspension can not exceed the scope of the privileges conferred by his initial admission to the bar of the northern district of oklahoma and that the district court erred by failing to consider his good faith.for the reasons set forth below,we reject each of martin arguments,and we affirm the district court denial of his supplemented application.
subject matter jurisdiction and standard of review.
in mattox disciplinary panel of the united states dist.court for the dist.of colorado,cir,this court reversed an order of a district court that denied a suspended attorney application for readmission to the bar of the district court,concluding that the district court had violated the attorney right to procedural due process by failing to give notice and the reasons for its view before its decision was final,and by failing to give the attorney an opportunity to respond.id.at.based on mattox,it would appear that this court has subject matter jurisdiction over this appeal.we note,however,that mattox did not specifically address the issue of whether this court has subject matter jurisdiction to review district court readmission orders in cases involving suspended attorneys.as a result,before proceeding to the merits of martin appeal,we need to address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.
the ninth circuit has recently stated that o rdinarily,appellate jurisdiction to review an order by the district court denying admission to practice generally before it is lacking because the denial of a petition for admission to a district court bar is neither a final order appealable under nor an interlocutory order appealable under.in re north,cir quotation omitted.in this cas
