we have for review a referee report recommending that patricia del pino be found guilty of professional misconduct and disbarred.we have jurisdiction.see art.v.const.for the reasons set forth below,we approve the referee findings of fact and conclusions of guilt,but disapprove the recommendation of disbarment and suspend del pino for three years.
factual background 
these proceedings commenced on may,when the bar filed a complaint against del pino charging her with misconduct after she was convicted of two federal evasion and mail the united states district court for the southern district of florida.del pino pled guilty to both felonies and was sentenced to three years of probation,with conditions.she was suspended under the felony suspension rule on march,effective april.see.bar del pino,so d table regulating.bar.
the bar complaint mirrored the criminal charges and alleged del pino pled guilty to signing a false and fraudulent form,application for automatic extension of time to file individual income tax return,in violation of the complaint also alleged del pino was charged with and pled guilty to one count of mail fraud in violation of after she used the mail to deliver false and fraudulent financial information to a mortgage lender for the purchase of a condominium.further,the complaint alleged del pino actions violated rules regulating the florida bar b committing a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer honesty,trustworthiness,or fitness as a lawyer and c engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation.
following a hearing,the referee filed a report which concludes that the facts are essentially undisputed.del pino pled guilty to one count of tax evasion for preparing and signing a false and fraudulent form application for automatic extension of time representing that she owed no taxes for when she owed substantially more,having earned over in wages for that year.the federal court sentenced her to three years of probation,including days of home detention,repayment of all taxes owed,with interest,in accordance with her ability to pay,mental health or substance abuse treatment or both as recommended by the probation department,hours of community service,and a assessment.the referee further found that del pino pled guilty to one count of mail fraud after participating in a fraudulent real estate closing involving the sale of a condominium on october.del pino signed a warranty deed,not as a grantor,but for the waiver of homestead purposes,in favor of the purported purchaser,liana alvarez.she knew when she signed the deed that alvarez did not have the financial resources to buy the property,that the property was to remain under the control of del pino and michael arias her estranged husband,and that the property would be used by the respondent and her husband as their personal residence.del pino was sentenced to three years of probation on the mail fraud charge,the sentence to run concurrently with her sentence on the tax evasion charge,with the same conditions.
the referee found del pino admitted that she failed to file timely tax returns from through.she ultimately filed returns for these years in december,after she found out,in september,that she was being investigated by the internal revenue service.she still owes penalties and interest for each of these years,but the exact amount she owes had not been determined at the time of the formal hearing.
the referee found del pino guilty of violating rules regulating the florida bar commission by a lawyer of any act that is unlawful or contrary to honesty and justice may constitute a cause for discipline,felony conviction is cause for automatic suspension and further disciplinary proceedings,b commission of a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer honesty,trustworthiness,or fitness as a lawyer is cause for discipline,and c an attorney engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation is cause for discipline.
in considering the appropriate discipline,the referee found three aggravating factors and six mitigating factors.the aggravating factors were dishonest or selfish motive multiple offenses and experience in the practice of law.the mitigating factors were no prior disciplinary record personal or emotional problems full and free disclosure to disciplinary board and cooperative attitude toward proceedings good character or reputation interim rehabilitation and remorse.the referee discussed del pino argument concerning the existence or nonexistence of a selfish or dishonest motive,but expressly rejected her arguments that she did not have a selfish or dishonest motive for her actions.he stated her actions do not support this mitigating factor,particularly for the tax fraud offense,despite any psychological or emotional problems she may have been going through.the referee recommended that del pino be disbarred effective,nunc pro tunc,march,with leave to apply for readmission after five years the referee expressly stated that he was recommending nunc pro tunc disbarment given the mitigating factors.as support for the recommendation,the referee cited to florida bar mckeever,so d florida bar forbes,so d and florida bar prior,so d.
del pino petitioned this court for review of the referee findings,asserting error in the referee conclusions that the aggravating factor of a dishonest or selfish motive applied and that the mitigating factor of lack of a dishonest or selfish motive did not apply.she also seeks review of the recommendation of disbarment,asserting primarily that the substantial evidence of mitigation makes a suspension,rather than disbarment,the appropriate sanction for her misconduct.she does not challenge the findings of misconduct.
initially,we note that with the exceptions of the factor of dishonest or selfish motive or lack thereof,neither party challenges the referee findings of fact or recommendations as to guilt.we therefore approve these without comment.
discipline 
we next consider the recommendation of discipline.our scope of review is broader in reviewing a referee recommendation of discipline than it is in reviewing the referee findings of fact because,ultimately,it is the court responsibility to order the appropriate discipline.see.bar smith,so d,see also art.v.const.
del pino argues that the extensive mitigation evidence she presented,and which the referee found,met her burden of proving that something less than disbarment is warranted in this case.after reviewing the cases and evaluating the aggravation and the mitigation evidence,we agree.
we first examine del pino contention that the referee erred in finding the aggravating factor of a selfish or dishonest motive.to succeed in challenging a referee findings of fact,an attorney must establish there is a lack of evidence in the record to support such findings or that the record clearly contradicts the referee conclusions.bar karten,so d.a referee findings of mitigation and aggravation are also presumptively correct and are upheld unless clearly erroneous or without support in the record.bar arcia,so d.
we conclude the referee finding that del pino had a selfish motive for participating in the fraudulent transfer of the condominium is supported by the record evidence in this case,which includes del pino guilty plea to the crime of mail fraud for her participation in the fraudulent transfer.the proffer attached to her plea agreement supports the referee findings.although del pino may have never intended to live or acquire a financial interest in the condominium,she admitted that her husband wanted the condominium so that he would not lose the benefit of the bargain to purchase a condominium worth approximately for,pursuant to an contract.the husband sought the acquisition to offset anticipated financial penalties impending in his own criminal difficulties.
however,because of the unique circumstances of this case,most particularly the compelling evidence of the emotionally and physically abusive relationship between del pino and her husband,we are convinced this aggravating factor is not entitled to the substantial weight it might command under oth
