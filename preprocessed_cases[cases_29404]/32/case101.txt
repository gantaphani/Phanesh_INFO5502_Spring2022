background 
the lease was signed in july by bnsf as lessee and by company cbc as lessor acting as broker for a disclosed principal,first security bank of utah.first security assigned its interests under the lease,including the exclusive right to receive rental payments,to the baker group in.the lease expired in.two lease provisions are primarily at issue in this lawsuit and in related litigation in a kansas state court.article set forth bnsf duty to maintain the cars in good condition and repair,required lessor approval of physical alterations to the cars,provided that bnsf was responsible for lost or destroyed cars,and prescribed a procedure for resolving issues arising when a car was lost or destroyed.article set forth bnsf duties to return the cars in good condition at the end of the lease and to pay the daily rent fee until a car was returned.
the baker group and cbc sued bnsf in kansas state court before the lease expired,alleging violations of article.with that litigation,the lease expired and the baker group filed this action asserting violations of article during the lease plus additional violations of article at the end of the lease,namely,the return of railcars in poor condition and the failure to return other cars.after the kansas trial court dismissed all claims,the district court dismissed all claims in this action as barred by the doctrine of claim preclusion res judicata.in baker i,we reversed the dismissal of the article claims because they arose at the end of the lease,after the kansas lawsuit commenced,and because the kansas court refused to permit article claims to be litigated.at.
the claim preclusion landscape was altered when the kansas court of appeals reversed the trial court decision on which baker i relied.burlington,on remand in that case,the kansas trial court refused to permit an expansion of the issues to be tried to include the primary issue in this missouri claims involving the condition of cars returned by bnsf at the end of the lease.instead,the court pretrial journal entry recited that the causes of actions remaining for trial in kansas were plaintiffs claim that defendant violated article and article of the lease in question by destroying wrecked cars and not returning them to plaintiffs,plus a contract claim for attorneys fees.the kansas case was tried,and the jury awarded plaintiffs because bnsf failed to give timely notice that certain rail cars had been damaged and would be destroyed.
the article claims that were tried 
in a laudable effort to narrow the issues for trial,the district court on remand ordered the parties to respond to a series of questions and then used those responses as a basis for determining that the only issue to be tried was the baker group article claim that bnsf failed to return certain railcars at the end of the lease.the parties agreed that either or cars were initially leased,that cars were lost or destroyed during the term of the lease and paid for by bnsf pursuant to article,and that cars were returned by bnsf or were being repaired by the baker group at the end of the lease.that left eleven cars to be accounted for at trial.the task of tracing a particular railcar was complicated by the fact that bnsf had renumbered some cars during the term of the lease.just before trial,the court issued an order that identified eleven cars at issue,limited the trial to those eleven cars,and provided that the baker group will be required to establish that the above referenced cars were not returned at the end of the lease in accordance with article.
carle baker was the only witness for the baker group at trial.while insisting that eleven cars were never returned,baker admitted that the baker group had been notified by bnsf during the term of the lease that at least six of the eleven had been damaged and would be destroyed pursuant to article.however,baker explained,the baker group was never paid for those six cars and the other five have not been accounted for.roger sperry,retired director of equipment,testified for bnsf that he was responsible for finding all leased railcars at the end of the lease and that every active car was returned.sperry explained that,just before the lease expired,bnsf was paying rent on cars,eleven more than the that were returned,because i n some cases baker refused to acknowledge that the cars had been destroyed so it was determined that it would be at that time appropriate to continue to pay rent until resolution could be made between baker and bn sf.
reviewing the issue de novo,we conclude that the district court correctly granted bnsf judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence.see arabian agric.servs.chief,cir standard of review.recall that the kansas court defined the issue to be tried in that case as plaintiffs claim that defendant violated article and article of the lease in question by destroying wrecked cars and not returning them to plaintiffs.the doctrine of claim preclusion barred the baker group from relitigating claims that were litigated or could have been litigated in that prior suit.baker i,at.all claims for cars that were not returned because they were lost or destroyed during the term of the lease could have been litigated in the kansas action.this included claims for a larger settlement payment under article because bnsf did not provide timely notice.it also included claims for rental payments not made prior to the settlement payments,which could be viewed as either article or article claims.on the other hand,the kansas court did not include in the issue to be tried article claims for cars that were not wrecked,were still in existence,and were not returned at the end of the lease.any cars in that category were never involved in the article process that was the core of the kansas lawsuit.thus,to prevail at this trial,the baker group had to prove that one or more railcars fell into this narrow category.it failed to do so.indeed,on direct examination,carle baker testified 
q by linus baker baker,for every car that was destroyed,did you find a payment record 
q how many payments records are you missing,for the cars under the lease 
this testimony,plus the baker group failure to discredit sperry testimony that all railcars in existence at the end of the lease were returned,establish that all claims for cars are precluded because they could have been litigated in the kansas case.a n entire claim arising from a single wrong can not be divided and made subject of several suits no matter how numerous the items of damage.klassen central.creamery ass n.
it may be that the baker group has lost an opportunity to litigate whether there are up to five leased railcars that were never returned to the baker group and are still functioning somewhere in the bnsf system or elsewhere.but this is the result of filing multiple lawsuits with overlapping claims in different courts.those who abuse the judicial system in this fashion must suffer the consequences.the judgment dismissing all claims for cars is affirm
