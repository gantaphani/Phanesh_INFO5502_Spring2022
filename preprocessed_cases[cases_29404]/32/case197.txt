plaintiff marvin lieblein president and sole shareholder of marvin lieblein,doing business as family pharmacy,submitted an application to defendant california department of health services the department for continued enrollment as a pharmacy provider.the application,which lieblein signed under penalty of perjury,stated that he had not incurred any discipline against his license.in fact,the state board of pharmacy had recently revoked his license,stayed the revocation,and imposed three years probation.
when the department discovered the facts,it denied lieblein application for failure to disclose required information.the department also notified lieblein that his provider numbers were to be deactivated and that he would be barred from reapplying to the program for three years.
lieblein appealed to the department office of administrative hearings and appeals oaha,which denied the appeal.he then filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court the court denied the petition.
lieblein now appeals,contending the legislature did not intend to require the department to debar existing providers for disclosure errors,absent fraud or abuse.the department administrative appeal procedure violated due process because it did not allow live testimony.the department failed to provide timely notice of its denial of lieblein application.
we shall affirm.

procedural history 
the discipline 
in an administrative proceeding against lieblein,the state board of pharmacy the board notified him by letter dated january,that it was revoking his pharmacy permit,but staying the revocation and placing his license on probation for three years.the record and the parties briefs do not reveal the grounds for the board action.
lieblein application 
by letter dated april,the department notified lieblein that he was required to enroll for continued participation in after receiving his response,the department notified him by letter dated october,that he must submit his completed application package consisting of an application,a provider agreement,and a disclosure statement within days.
on january,lieblein submitted an application package,which the department acknowledged by a letter dated january.however,the department noted the package was incomplete in respects not material to this case,and returned it for completion or correction.
on july,lieblein resubmitted his application package,which included the required disclosure statement.
question of the disclosure statement reads has any licensing authority disciplined the license,certificate,or other approval to provide health care of the applicant or provider if the applicant checks the box marked,yes,he must state what action was taken and where,and give its effective dates.on lieblein application,the box marked,no is checked.
the following language appears at the end of the disclosure statement i declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of california that the foregoing information in this document and the attachments is true,accurate,and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.i declare that i have the authority to legally bind the applicant or provider.lieblein signed the disclosure statement in the space provided immediately below this declaration.
by letter dated august,the department notified lieblein his application was denied for failure to disclose the required information,specifically that the pharmacy permit issued to family pharmacy is currently on probation,tit,subd.b.the letter stated that his provider numbers would be deactivated effective days from the date of this notification and that he would not be allowed to reapply for three years from the date the application was denied,subd.b,tit,subd.h.it also informed him of his appeal rights.
lieblein administrative appeal 
lieblein filed an appeal with oaha on october.he contended his alleged nondisclosure was an inadvertent mistake in checking boxes on his pharmacy provider application.an employee lieblein store manager filled out most of the application,including question of the disclosure statement lieblein merely signed the application without catching the error.as lieblein discipline was a matter of public record,it would have been ludicrous for lieblein not to disclose it.lieblein family business should not be shut down for an inadvertent mistake.f ailure to disclose the required information must mean the intentional failure to do so.
in an appeal finding signed on january,an oaha hearing officer stated counsel for the provider has noted that the application was erroneously completed by a subordinate of lieblein.while this office understands that mistakes do happen,denying on a submitted application that specifically asks about professional sic and licensure that such an action has occurred is negligent.there is an expectation by the medical sic assistance program that applications will be free of material error.peb provider enrollment branch has shown that marvin lieblein and family pharmacy did not acknowledge a sanction by a professional or governmental agency as required,and this degree of error is unacceptable.the application is denied.
by letter dated january,the department notified lieblein it had adopted the hearing officer finding as its decision.
lieblein petition for writ of mandate 
on february,lieblein filed a petition for peremptory writ of mandate in sacramento county superior court.he averred that he had owned family pharmacy,located in long beach,california,for around years,and that most of its medical customers are patients.as relevant on appeal,he argued the department decision must be set aside because 
under section,subdivision d,the department lost the authority to deny the application after the statutory deadline of days to process it had passed.
under section,subdivision a,in response to lieblein alleged nondisclosure the department was authorized either to deny the application or to suspend lieblein temporarily from,including the temporary deactivation of his provider numbers.instead,it had unlawfully done both.
the department administrative appeal procedure violates due process under the controlling federal medicaid regulation and the state and federal constitutions.debarment of a provider constitutes a deprivation of liberty furthermore,lieblein and family pharmacy will have to disclose the debarment to other payors,to their patients,and to referring physicians.therefore,due process required that they receive a meaningful opportunity to be heard as to the denial of the application,including live testimony from which the hearing officer could make the appropriate and necessary credibility determinations with respect to the reason why the wrong box was checked on the application.but section bars live testimony thus the hearing officer could not make an accurate and complete finding.
the department decision was arbitrary and capricious because the false information in the application was the result of an inadvertent mistake and not the result of any intent to mislead the department.neither the plain language of the statutory scheme nor its legislative intent can justify debarring a participant in on this basis.the intent of the reenrollment application process was to eliminate fraud and abuse in the program,not to punish providers who have made inadvertent mistakes which are not relevant to the honesty or veracity of the applicant.
the department responsive points and authorities asserted 
there was no failure to act on lieblein petition within days.well within that time limit,the department notified lieblein his application was incomplete and needed to be resubmitted,subd.d.after he resubmitted the application,the department denied it the next month,also well within the statutory time limit.
decertification of provider numbers necessarily follows from the denial of continued enrollment.thus,lieblein claim the department could do only one or the other was an absurd reading of section,subdivision a.it also ignored section,subdivision b,which expressly requires both actions.
the department administrative appeal procedure does not violate due process.due process does not necessarily require an evidentiary hearing at which live testimony could be presented.if lieblein failed to disclose required information,this failure mandated denial of his application without regard to intent or credibility.furthermore,the government interest in preventing provider fraud and ensuring the fiscal integrity of militates against requiring a evidentiary hearing in every appeal.
in reply,lieblein raised a new untimeliness claim.according to him,the department missed the deadline set by section,subdivision e,for notifying him of its decision after he resubmitted his application on july.the statute required notice to be given no later than days after the department received the resubmitted application,a period that ended on august.the department written notice of its decision bore that date.however,the department failed to show it mailed the letter on that date,and there is no presumption that a letter is mailed on the day it is dated.because the department did not meet the deadline,lieblein was entitled to provisional provider status by operation of law,subds.d,g.
the trial court tentative ruling and judgment 
on april,the trial court issued a tentative ruling denying lieblein petition.the court found in part 
the department complied with all statutory deadlines for processing the application.lieblein had the burden to show the department did not send notice of its denial of his application within days after receiving the resubmitted application.he had not done so.the department is presumed to have complied with its duties,and lieblein failed to rebut the presumption.
lieblein argument that the department could not both deny his application and suspend him from the program lacked merit.the denial of his application required his suspension from the program.
the administrative appeal proceeding satisfied due process.lieblein was allowed to offer written evidence to explain how the application was filled out and signed he failed to do so other than to say his employee filled it out.since he did not provide any fuller explanation,the lack of an oral hearing did not deprive him of any due process rights.in any event,the hearing officer apparently accepted lieblein claim of negligence but found the application was properly denied.
the court thereafter entered judgment adopting its tentative ruling.
discussion 
in enacting section et,the legislature chose to make the department decisions appealable under code of civil procedure section ordinary mandamus rather than code of civil procedure section administrative mandamus,subd.a.under code of civil procedure section,a writ can be granted only where the administrative agency has a clear,present,and usually ministerial duty to perform,and the petitioner has a clear,present,and beneficial right to the performance of that duty.people ex rel.younger county of el dorado cal d,california correctional supervisors organization,department of corrections th,d ccso.
where a statute leaves room for discretion,a challenger must show the official acted arbitrarily,beyond the bounds of reason or in derogation of the applicable legal standards.citation.where only one choice can be a reasonable exercise of discretion,a court may compel an official to make that choice.citation.ccso,supra,th at,d.
the trial court review of the respondent action is limited to determining whether the actions were arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support or contrary to required legal procedures.citations.valnes santa monica rent control bd.d.on appeal,we ordinarily inquire only whether the trial court findings and judgment are supported by substantial evidence.however,we decide pure questions of statutory law independently.apple computer,assessment appeals bd.th,d ccso,supra,th at,d.
lieblein contends the legislature did not intend for existing providers to be debarred for unintentional d isclosure e rrors.on the contrary,the statutory scheme plain best evidence of legislative for debarment of both new applicants and existing providers who provide materially false information,no matter why.so far as lieblein claims the statutory scheme on its face raises constitutional problems,we disagree.
the statutory scheme 
our primary task in construing a statute is to determine the legislature intent.we turn first to the words themselves.if they are clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction the statute plain language establishes what the legislature intended.people statum cal th,d.
in focusing on the words of a statute,we give them their ordinary meaning.california school employees governing board cal th,d.we may not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose not apparent on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.burden snowden cal th,d.
here,the key statutes clearly establish that the legislature meant the false disclosure provisions of section et to act as strict liability rules.in other words,an applicant materially false statement,or the failure to disclose material information,regardless of intent or existing provider status,requires the department to exclude the violator from for at least three years unless he prevails on appeal.
to recapitulate 
section,subdivision a,states i n order to be enrolled as a provider,or for enrollment as a provider to continue,an applicant or provider may be required to sign a provider agreement and shall disclose all information as required in federal medicaid sic regulations and any other information required by the department failure to disclose the required information,or the disclosure of false information,shall result in denial of the application for enrollment or shall make the provider subject to temporary suspension from the program,which shall include temporary deactivation of all provider numbers used by the provider to obtain reimbursement from the program.
section,subdivision a,says the department may require new applicants or existing providers to submit an application package for enrollment or continued enrollment.
section,subdivision d a,requires the department to notify an applicant or provider within days after receiving the application package if the application package is denied pursuant to section.
section,subdivision b,provides if an application package is denied under subparagraph a of paragraph of subdivision d of section,all existing provider numbers assigned to the applicant or provider shall be deactivated and the applicant or provider shall be removed from enrollment in the program by operation of law.
section,subdivision a,states that if an application package is denied under section,which includes denial for failure to disclose information under section,subd.d a,the applicant or provider may not reapply for three years.see also,subd.f c same result where department discovers failure to disclose through background check.
finally,section authorizes applicants and providers to pursue an administrative appeal.
not one of these provisions requires the department to establish that the provision of false information was intentional,willful,or fraudulent before it can impose sanctions.rather,those sanctions,including deactivation of provider numbers and debarment from reapplying for three years,follow inexorably from violation of the disclosure provisions per se.furthermore,they follow equally whether or not the applicant has been enrolled in the program before.
if the legislature had meant to require proof of intent or mens rea,it could easily have said so.we may not rewrite the statutory scheme to insert that requirement.burden snowden,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,it would be understandable for the legislature not to impose upon the department the onerous burden of proving an applicant mental state.
lieblein arguments 
arguing to the contrary,lieblein asserts existing providers,as opposed to new applicants,have a constitutionally protected liberty interest that is violated by debarment from.to respect this liberty interest,it is necessary to maintain the distinctions made in the statutory scheme between existing providers and new applicants.this requires construing the statutes to avoid the constitutional difficulties and absurd or unjust results that would follow from a literal construction.the statutes distinguish between existing providers and new applicants in that a under section,applicants who violate the disclosure rules are denied enrollment in,but providers who do the same are only temporarily suspended,and b under section,only applicants whose applications are denied,not providers,are barred from reapplying to the program for three years.to respect these distinctions and properly protect existing providers liberty interests,the statutory scheme should be construed so as a to impose only temporary suspension on existing providers who violate the disclosure requirements,and b to lift that suspension if the violation is not shown to stem from fraud or abuse.
as stated above,lieblein makes a statutory argument based on sections,subdivision a failure to disclose information,and,subdivision b we shall conclude the argument lacks merit.
section authorizes administrative appeals by applicants and providers.
section,subdivision b,states in its first sentence,which lieblein quotes no applicant whose application for enrollment as a provider has been denied pursuant to section,or may reapply for a period of three years from the date the application is denied.italics added.this sentence was quoted in the department letter notifying lieblein of deactivation of his provider number.from the statute use of the word applicant alone,rather than applicant or provider,lieblein concludes the legislature meant the sanction to apply only to new applicants 
however,the second sentence of subdivision b states if the provider has appealed the denial,the period shall commence upon the date of final action by the director or the director designee.italics added.
the statutory language is arguably unclear,because it refers to a waiting period for providers without actually imposing such a waiting period on providers in comparison to the first sentence,which imposes a waiting period on applicants.nevertheless,w e must not view isolated language out of context,but instead interpret the statute as a whole,so as to make sense of the entire statutory scheme.citation.carrisales department of corrections cal th,d.as we shall explain,a waiting period for providers is expressly set forth in other statutes applicable to this case,and nothing in section relieves providers from the waiting period imposed elsewhere.
thus,the department asked lieblein to fill out the forms in accordance with regulation regs,tit,which was based on section which authorizes the department not only to take new applications from new applicants,but also to require existing providers to apply for continued enrollment.section uses the term application package for both new applicants and existing providers,subd.a,quoted in fn,ante see also,subd.c if the applicant package submitted pursuant to subdivision a is from an applicant or provider who meets the criteria listed.
section authorizes the department to deny application packages for failure to disclose information under section,subd.d a see also,subd.f denial of application where department discovers failure to disclose information during background check.
where an existing provider section application package is denied for providing false information or failure to disclose,following a background check,section says the provider may not reapply for three years,subd.f c if the discrepancies or failure to meet program requirements were related to grounds for denial under section,the applicant or provider may not reapply for three years.
additionally,section independently imposes a waiting period before the applicant or provider can reapply for enrollment or continued enrollment.thus,section provides in part a if an application package which,as indicated,includes existing providers seeking continued enrollment is denied under section or provisional provider status or preferred provisional provider status is terminated under section,the applicant or provider may not reapply for enrollment or continued enrollment in the program or for participation in any health care program administered by the department or its agents or contractors for a period of three years from the date the application package is denied or the provisional provider status is terminated,or from the date of the final decision following an appeal from that denial or termination,except as provided otherwise in specified statutory provisions 
we thus conclude a waiting period applies to existing providers,such as lieblein,whose section applications were denied under section for disclosing false information and for failing to disclose required information.although a question may arise as to whether the period starts on the date of denial of the application or the date of denial of the administrative appeal,lieblein makes no argument on this point,and we need not address the matter in this appeal 
lieblein remaining point is based on the following sentence from section,subdivision a failure to disclose the required information,or the disclosure of false information,shall result in denial of the application for enrollment or shall make the provider subject to temporary suspension from the program,which shall include temporary deactivation of all provider numbers used by the provider to obtain reimbursement from the program.italics added.lieblein appears to believe the department may suspend a provider but it can not also deny the application,and the waiting period applies only to denials of applications.lieblein points out that only an existing provider is subject to temporary suspension from the program,and therefore the department should have suspended him only until he demonstrated lack of fraud.
however,as we have pointed out,both section,subdivision f c,and section,expressly contemplate that a provider application package can be denied.moreover,since the temporary suspension sanction shall include temporary deactivation of all provider numbers used by the provider to obtain reimbursement from the program,subd.a,it has the same practical effect as denying an application.if provider numbers are deactivated,the provider can not obtain reimbursement from thus,for all practical purposes he is debarred from the program unless and until his provider numbers are reactivated.thus the distinction between temporary suspension and the denial of an application is a distinction without a difference.
finally,lieblein cites an opinion of the state attorney general.for the proposition that existing licensees of the department have substantially greater rights than new applicants.however,that opinion does not construe the statutory scheme at issue here.it addresses licensing and discipline under the health facilities act health,et and the california community care facilities act health,et.lieblein does not attempt to show that these provisions are significantly similar to those that govern providers and applicants.thus the point does not require further discussion.
lieblein argues we must interpret the statutory scheme to preserve its constitutionality.however,assuming that lieblein has a constitutional liberty interest in continuing to provide services for,we see no reason why our construction of the statutory scheme,which relies upon the plain language of the statutes,violates any constitutional right of lieblein.
conclusion 
lieblein has failed to show grounds for reversal.once the department discovered lieblein had provided materially false information and had failed to disclose the discipline of his license,it properly denied his application for continued enrollment and debarred him from participation in.
lieblein contends the department administrative appeal procedure,subd.a violates due process because it does not permit live testimony,and his inability to put on such evidence undermined his case we disagree with both points.
the liberty interest of a applicant debarred from the program for violating the disclosure provisions implicates constitutional due process.see golden day schools,state of education th,d golden day.however,it does not follow that any particular procedure is constitutionally required in an administrative hearing of the applicant appeal.
due process is the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.mathews eldridge,d.unlike some legal rules,due process is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstance.citation.id.at.at,d at.rather,it is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.citation.ibid.determining whether a particular administrative procedure is constitutionally sufficient requires analysis of the governmental and private interests involved the private interest that will be affected by the official action the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used and any probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.id.at.at,d at.southern cal.underground contractors city of san diego th,d southern cal.underground.
in mathews eldridge,supra,d,applying the above test,the united states supreme court considered what process is due to persons whose receipt of social security disability benefits,a constitutionally protected property interest,has been terminated.the court held that a full evidentiary hearing including live testimony is not required prior to the adverse administrative action,because recipients normally can obtain other temporary sources of income the pretermination decision usually turns on objective,standardized reports by physician specialists,not raising credibility issues this evidence by its nature is more amenable to written than to oral presentation the recipient representative has full access to all information relied on by the state agency before benefits are terminated,the recipient is informed of the agency tentative decision with reasons and supporting evidence the recipient then has the opportunity to submit additional evidence or argument and requiring full pretermination evidentiary hearings in all cases would impose a significant administrative and financial burden on the state agencies.id.at.at,d at.in light of these facts,although the private interest at stake is significant,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through existing procedures and the probable value of adding further procedures is low on the other hand,given the government interest in conserving scarce fiscal and administrative resources,adding procedures that increase the government fiscal and administrative burden can not be justified.ibid.
here,although the applicant liberty interest is significant,so too is the department interest the state continuing receipt of federal assistance for depends on providers ability and willingness to perform according to law.thus,the issue turns on whether the department appeal procedure incurs a significant risk of erroneously upholding a decision to debar a deserving applicant,whether allowing live testimony would be likely to lessen any such risk,and whether the increased fiscal and administrative burden on the department from allowing live testimony would be justified.we conclude that the answer to these questions is no.
in the context of debarment from the program,almost all of the reasons given by mathews eldridge,supra,d,for not requiring an evidentiary hearing with live testimony apply with equal force.the evidence the department must consider when denying an application for nondisclosure or false disclosure is objective,consisting of the applicant disclosure statement and any matter tending to show a violation of the requirements.such evidence,by its nature,is more amenable to written than to oral presentation.the applicant receives notice of that evidence,along with the department reasoning,when the department informs him of its decision.in challenging the decision,the applicant is entitled to retain counsel and to present all written evidence and argument that support his position.it would significantly burden the department fiscally and administratively to hold a evidentiary hearing with live testimony every time it denies a provider application based on nondisclosure or false disclosure.finally,since the applicant intent is not material,no benefit would come from allowing live testimony on that issue,and lieblein has not suggested any other purpose for such testimony.on the contrary,an applicant can prevail against a charge of disclosure violation only by showing it to be factually mistaken,and no reason appears why such a showing could not and should not be in writing.therefore,the department procedure,which restricts the appellant to written evidence,does not impair his right to due process because it permits him to present all evidence that is material to the appeal.
lieblein does not cite any california decisions that have found a due process violation under mathews eldridge,supra,d,from the lack of provision for live testimony in an administrative hearing,and we have found none.in fact,the decisions most closely on point have held,as we do,that live testimony was not required in the administrative proceedings at issue.
in rodriguez department of real estate th,d rodriguez,the court held that the defendant commissioner did not violate the plaintiff broker due process rights by suspending his license as an automatic consequence of granting a defrauded client claim for payment from the department client recovery account without providing a full evidentiary hearing,including live testimony,prior to the suspension.id.at,d.the applicable statutory scheme did not require such a hearing,but did require that the broker receive notice of the client claim and the opportunity to submit written argument contesting the claim.id.at,d.
to decide the issue,the rodriguez court used a test derived from case law construing the california constitution,which weighs the factors identified in mathews eldridge,supra,d,plus the dignitary interest of informing individuals of the nature,grounds and consequences of the action and of enabling them to present their side of the story before a responsible government official.rodriguez,supra,th at,d,and cases cited.under this test,the court found that,although the broker had an interest affected by the government action,there was little risk of erroneously depriving him of that interest the statutory scheme set out specific criteria the judgment creditor had to meet in submitting his claim,the broker had the opportunity to submit written argument challenging any or all of the criteria,and the decisionmaker exercised no discretion but only determined whether the judgment qualified for payment under the statute.id.at,d.these factors,plus the requirement that the judgment creditor obtain a final judgment to be eligible for payment from the department account and the broker right to challenge an adverse decision by writ of ordinary mandamus,provided sufficient procedural protection for the broker.id.at,d.the broker dignitary interest in notice and opportunity to be heard was sufficiently satisfied by giving him notice of the claim and its consequences if granted,plus the right to oppose it by written argument before the commissioner.id.at,d.finally,the administrative and fiscal burden of requiring a full evidentiary hearing with live testimony in every such case would be great.id.at,d.for all these reasons,even though the procedure at issue might ultimately lead to the mandatory suspension of the broker license,due process did not require such an evidentiary hearing.id.at,d.
similarly,in holmes hallinan th,d holmes,the appellate court found no due process violation where a senior investigator with the san francisco district attorney office was fired for falsifying worker compensation forms and dishonesty.id.at,d.the investigator an employee was not permitted to call live witnesses at his pretermination hearing,but was allowed to present evidence and argue his case in writing.id.at,d.in a petition for writ of administrative mandamus,he alleged a due process violation from the denial of live testimony,among other things.id.at,d.the trial court granted the writ,but the appellate court reversed.id.at,d.
the appellate court found that,although the stigma associated with the charges against the plaintiff gave him a protected liberty interest entitling him to due process despite his status,the government interest in expeditiously terminating law enforcement officers for poor moral character was also great.holmes,supra,th at,d.the written evidence the plaintiff was allowed to submit,along with that disclosed to him before the hearing,was sufficient for the district attorney to resolve any factual issues,and the plaintiff had failed to show how live testimony could have thrown any further light on those issues.id.at,d.under the circumstances,t he judicial model of an evidentiary hearing was not required.id.at,d,quoting mathews eldridge,supra,at.at,d at.
in both rodriguez,supra,th,d,and holmes,supra,th,d,the potential cost to the plaintiffs was,if anything,greater than the cost to lieblein here where lieblein stood to lose only the opportunity to continue participating in a government program,the plaintiffs in rodriguez and holmes stood to lose their jobs or livelihoods furthermore,in holmes,if not in rodriguez,credibility issues were clearly in play.nevertheless,the appellate courts in both cases rejected the claim that due process required an evidentiary hearing with live testimony.we conclude,as did those courts,that the notice and opportunity to be heard provided under the administrative appeal procedure satisfied due process.
lieblein relies on golden day,supra,th,d,and southern cal.underground,supra,th,d.his reliance is misplaced because neither decision finds a due process violation from the deprivation of live testimony.in golden day,the court found a due process violation because the auditor who determined that the appellant audits were improperly done also sat as a judge in the appeal from that finding.golden day,supra,th at,d.in southern cal.underground,where live testimony and were allowed,the issues were factually complex,involving charges that the appellant had engaged in a pattern of corrupt practices while working on different projects for a municipality.southern cal.underground,supra,th at,d.here,unlike in golden day,the administrative appeal was entirely conducted by an independent hearing officer.and unlike in southern cal.underground,it did not present factually complex issues posing credibility problems.therefore,neither decision supports lieblein claim that due process was denied him because he could not put on live testimony.
lieblein contends the department lost jurisdiction over his application by missing the statutory deadline for notifying him of its decision on the application,and therefore he was entitled to provisional provider status by operation of law.lieblein is mistaken.
section,subdivision e,provides italics added 
if the application package that was noticed as incomplete under subdivision d is resubmitted with all requested information and documentation,and received by the department within days of the date on the notice,the department shall,within days of the resubmission,send a notice that any of the following applies 
a the applicant or provider is being granted provisional provider status for a period of months,effective from the date on the notice.
b the application package is denied for any other reasons provided for in paragraph of subdivision d.
c the department is exercising its authority under section,or to conduct background checks,preenrollment inspections,or unannounced visits.
as mentioned above,the department noticed as incomplete the application package lieblein originally submitted.lieblein resubmitted the application package on july.the department notified him the resubmitted package was denied for failure to disclose required information,a reason provided for in paragraph of subdivision d,by letter dated august.lieblein does not dispute that the letter was dated within days of his resubmission of his application package.however,as below,he asserts the department had the burden to prove it sent or mailed the letter on august,and failed to meet that burden.
the trial court rejected lieblein attempt to shift the burden to the department because he was the petitioner in the writ proceeding,and it is presumed an official agency regularly performs its duties.the trial court also noted that lieblein had not presented any evidence tending to rebut this presumption.we conclude the trial court was correct on all these points.
first,lieblein does not cite authority to support his claim that the departme
