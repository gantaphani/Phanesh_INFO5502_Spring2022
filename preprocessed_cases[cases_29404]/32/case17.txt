this case comes to us on appeal for the second time,after we vacated the committee first order suspending peters for a term of seven years,and remanded with instructions to,inter alia,conduct an independent evidentiary hearing on the charges.on review of the new record,we find no error in the committee conclusion that peters violated the professional code.we hold further that the committee acted well within its informed discretion in ordering a suspension,notwithstanding the lack of directly analogous precedent,based on its conclusion that peters conduct was sui generis.
accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the committee suspending peters from practice in the southern district of new york for a period of seven years.
background 
charges against peters 
the facts underlying the challenged suspension have been repeated in several opinions,over hundreds of pages,and need not be here briefly,the charges against peters arose out of her conduct as a partner at the law firm of dorsey whitney,in the course of litigation in sdny before judge harold baer,the wolters kluwer litigation.
peters was charged principally with instructing a associate,jordan brackett,to mark up deposition transcripts on the theory that the markings would bring the transcripts under the protection of the attorney privilege,thereby exempting them from judge baer order that all discovery be returned to the district court,and attempting to mislead the court as to those events the brackett allegation,or charge one and cop ying transcripts and order ing additional transcripts in intentional disregard of court orders,and us ing the transcripts in a related action in massachusetts,in knowing violation of a confidentiality order the confidentiality order entered by judge baer the confidentiality order allegation,or charge three see january,order to show cause,special appendix spa.
procedural history 
we outline the extensive procedural history of this case only insofar as it is relevant to peters claims on appeal.
in,after conducting a sanctions hearing regarding peters conduct during the wolters kluwer litigation,judge baer imposed sanctions on peters for violating the professional code,and referred the case to the committee for further disciplinary proceedings.
in,the committee issued a final that peters had violated at least three disciplinary rules in connection with the charges outlined above against her disciplinary rule dr a,prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice dr a,prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty,fraud,deceit,or misrepresentation and dr a,prohibiting a lawyer from disregard ing or advis ing a client to disregard a ruling made in the course of a proceeding.as a penalty,the committee initially ordered disbarment,but,on reconsideration,imposed a suspension.
on appeal from the committee decision suspending peters for seven years,we applied a more exacting standard than the ordinary standard,in light of the fact that the committee had based its conclusions on the findings of judge baer,who had,in the nature of things,acted as accuser,fact finder and sentencing judge all in one.in re peters,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
applying that standard,we vacated the findings regarding the brackett allegation on the basis that peters was entitled to,and had not received,an independent evidentiary hearing.id.at.we also vacated the charge based on the confidentiality order allegation,holding that although peters violated the confidentiality order,the committee had made insufficient findings as to whether peters had the requisite culpable state of mind.in vacating that charge,we emphasized that the committee was free on remand to make a new determination,based on detailed factual findings,of whether peters acted with a culpable state of mind and,if so,to discipline her accordingly.id.at.
on remand,judge colleen mcmahon,acting as chairman pro tempore of the committee,ultimately referred the matter to magistrate judge lisa smith,who took submissions and heard eleven full days of testimony judge smith then issued a page report and recommendation r r concluding that peters conduct during the wolters kluwer litigation violated the professional code,and recommending a suspension 
in an april,order,the committee adopted the finding that peters had violated the professional code,but concluded that this case is sui generis and deserving of a suspension.spa.peters moved for reconsideration,and relief from judgment,both of which the committee denied.
it is against this backdrop that we review peters appeal.
discussion 
on appeal,peters claims principally that she was denied a full and fair disciplinary hearing in the proceedings before judge smith and the committee,resulting in the erroneous conclusion that she violated the relevant disciplinary rules and the committee abused its discretion in imposing a suspension,which was outside the range of discipline imposed in comparable cases,and improperly considered aggravating factors of which peters lacked notice.we address the liability claim and the sentencing claim in turn.

in general,we review t he decision whether to impose disciplinary sanctions on an attorney under an standard.grievance comm.for dist.of simels,cir peters,at.a court abuse s its discretion when it base s its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence,or render s a decision that can not be located within the range of permissible decisions.sims blot,cir citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the brackett allegation charge one 
the challenges peters raises with regard to the finding of guilt on the brackett allegation relate almost exclusively to judge smith credibility determinations and the assessment of conflicting evidence.as set forth above,judge smith conducted an extensive evidentiary hearing,approximately days of which were devoted to peters testimony.judge smith also considered testimony from brackett,and numerous other lawyers and staff members from dorsey whitney,in reaching her conclusions.
the committee then reviewed the r r extensive,findings,along with peters specific objections.spa.during the review process,transcripts of the hearing and the parties exhibits were also available to the committee.in adopting the r r,the committee properly accorded substantial deference to judge smith credibility determinations,anderson city of bessemer city,and found them to be supported by substantial evidence.spa.the committee also independently concluded that peters lacked credibility.see spa noting that peters effort to minimize her role in the lawsuit and the unfolding events seriously wounded her credibility in the eyes of judge smith and of the committee.
our review of the record reveals no error,much less clear error,in judge smith findings,which the committee adopted after its own review of the record.accordingly,we conclude that peters arguments with respect to the brackett allegation are without merit.
the confidentiality order allegation charge three 
the only open question regarding the confidentiality order allegation is whether peters acted with the requisite culpable state of mind,defined as venal intent.peters,at.that portentous term,at least in the context of the professional code,merely means scienter,deceit,intent to mislead,or knowing failure to correct misrepresentations.matter of altomerianos,dep t internal quotation marks omitted see also id
