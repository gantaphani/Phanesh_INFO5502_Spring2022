in lucas hamm cal d,lucas,our supreme court rejected the traditional rule that an attorney owed no duty to nonclients.the court held that beneficiaries could sue the attorney whose negligent preparation of a will caused them to lose their testamentary rights,where the attorney engagement was intended to benefit the nonclient,and the imposition of liability would not place an undue burden upon the legal profession.id.at.
our case is one of first impression involving a potential extension of lucas.simona osornio,a nonclient,was the named executor and sole beneficiary under a will.because she was care custodian to the testator,a dependent adult,osornio was a presumptively disqualified donee under probate code section,subdivision a accurately anticipating that a probate court would decide that she could not overcome that presumption by clear and convincing proof,osornio claimed that the bequest to her failed because of the negligence of saul weingarten,the attorney who drafted the will on behalf of the testator.
though osornio allegations are less than clear,her theory of negligence is apparently that weingarten owed her a duty of care as the testator intended beneficiary,and that,at the time the will was drawn,weingarten failed to advise the testator that her intended beneficiary,osornio,would be presumptively disqualified unless the testator obtained a certificate of independent review from another attorney,under section,subdivision b hereafter section b and failed to take appropriate measures to ensure that the testator wishes were carried out by referring her to counsel to obtain such a certificate.the trial court sustained weingarten demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend,and osornio appeals.
we conclude that the complaint,as drafted,did not state a cause of action.we find further,however,that nonclient osornio could have readily amended the complaint to state a cause of action for professional negligence against attorney weingarten under lucas and its progeny.accordingly,the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend,and we reverse the judgment.
the facts recited below are from the allegations made in the complaint.in reviewing the propriety of the trial court sustaining of the demurrer,we,of course,accept as true the factual allegations properly pleaded in the complaint.see construction protective services,tig specialty ins.cal th,d,cryolife,superior court th,d.
weingarten was a licensed california attorney practicing law in the county of monterey in the early the testator,dora ellis,retained weingarten to draft a will.on or about september,ellis requested that weingarten prepare a new will that would a revoke her prior wills and codicils,and b name osornio as the executor and sole beneficiary under ellis new will.
the september,will will prepared by weingarten on behalf of ellis failed to include a certificate of independent review as required by california probate code section et therefore the complaint alleges,weingarten failed to exercise reasonable care in performing legal services for ellis.
osornio was the intended sole beneficiary of ellis,and she would have received the entire value of ellis estate had weingarten exercised reasonable care,skill,and diligence in preparing the will.osornio alleges that,as a direct and proximate result of weingarten negligence,she was precluded from receiving the value of the estate under the will and was thereby damaged.
ii.other relevant facts 
there are facts other than those alleged in the complaint that both appear undisputed and are material to our consideration of this appeal.these undisputed facts are disclosed in a written decision after trial in the probate court involving the ellis estate that decision was attached to a request for judicial notice filed by weingarten in support of his demurrer and was properly considered in connection with the demurrer.see,subd.d frommhagen board of supervisors d.in ruling on demurrer,court may take judicial notice of the official acts or records of any court in this state.
peggy williams was the beneficiary under ellis prior will,dated october,will the prior will contained two codicils dated june,and july,respectively.ellis died in may.williams filed a petition to probate the will.osornio objected to the williams petition and filed a separate petition to probate the will.williams objected to the osornio petition on the grounds of lack of capacity and undue influence.the dispute proceeded to trial in the probate court in june.
the parties to the probate proceeding stipulated that osornio was a care custodian of a dependent adult,dora ellis,in september and that the provisions of probate code section,subdivision a applied.similarly,osornio admitted in her opposition to the demurrer that she was ellis care custodian,thus triggering the provisions of probate code section,subdivision a.it is further apparent that,at the time ellis consulted weingarten in september,he was aware that osornio was ellis care custodian the probate court concluded after its tentative decision dated august,that osornio had failed to satisfy her burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the transfer of property to osornio in the will was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence,as provided in section,subdivision d hereafter section d 
procedural history 
osornio filed her complaint on may.weingarten filed a general and special demurrer to the complaint.weingarten contended,inter alia,that the complaint a failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action,b was uncertain,and c contained allegations that were heard and decided previously by the court.osornio opposed the demurrer.after hearing,on december,the trial court sustained the general demurrer without leave to amend.the court entered a judgment of dismissal nunc pro tunc as of march.
osornio filed a notice of appeal from the judgment on march.the appeal from the judgment was filed timely cal.rules of court,rule a and is a proper subject for appellate review.code civ,subd.a castro state of california d.
discussion 
standard of review 
a general demurrer is appropriate where the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.code civ,subd.e.there are rules that appellate courts follow in addressing the merits of a challenge to a complaint by demurrer we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded,but not contentions,deductions or conclusions of fact or law.citation.we also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.citation.further,we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation,reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.citation.when a demurrer is sustained,we determine whether the complaint states facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.citation.and when it is sustained without leave to amend,we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment if it can be,the trial court abused its discretion and we reverse if not,there is no abuse of discretion and we affirm.citations.the burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff.citation.blank kirwan cal d.
a demurrer tests the sufficiency of the complaint as a matter of law as such,it raises only a question of law.see code civ,schmidt foundation health th,d.on a question of law,we apply a de novo standard of review on appeal.vallejo development beck development th,d.while negligence is ordinarily a question of fact,the existence of duty is generally one of law.meighan shore th,d meighan banerian d.banerian.thus,a demurrer to a negligence claim will properly lie only where the allegations of the complaint fail to disclose the existence of any legal duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.banerian,supra,at.
ii.issues on appeal 
the single issue raised on appeal is whether the court erred in sustaining weingarten general demurrer without leave to amend.this order was apparently founded upon the conclusion that weingarten as a matter of law owed no duty to osornio,a nonclient the issue on appeal contains two subquestions a whether the court properly sustained the demurrer because the complaint,as drafted,failed to state a cause of action for professional negligence and b whether the court abused its discretion by refusing osornio leave to,that the court correctly concluded that there was no reasonable possibility that osornio could amend the complaint to state a viable cause of action.
we first review sections and,concerning the presumptive disqualification of certain donees including care custodians of dependent adults the elements of a legal malpractice claim the supreme court decisions in biakanja irving cal d,biakanja,and lucas,supra,cal d,the latter case having extended negligence claims to persons not in privity with attorneys in limited instances and other california authorities addressing an attorney duty of care to nonclients.following this review,we address whether the trial court erred in sustaining weingarten demurrer,and whether it abused its discretion by denying osornio leave to amend her complaint.
iii.probate code sections and 
section,subdivision a hereafter,section a,reads in relevant part except as provided in section governing exceptions,no provision,or provisions,of any instrument shall be valid to make any donative transfer to any of the following a care custodian of a dependent adult who is the transferor.a disqualified person under the statute means a person specified in subdivision a of section,but only in cases where section does not apply.other presumptively disqualified donees under section a,include the drafter of the instrument the drafter relative,domestic partner,cohabitant,or employee the drafter law partner or shareholder an employee of the law partnership or corporation in which the drafter has an interest one having a fiduciary relationship with the donor including a conservator or trustee,who transcribes or causes the instrument to be transcribed such fiduciary relative,employee,domestic partner,or cohabitant and a relative of,domestic partner of,employee of,or a cohabitant with,a care custodian of the donor who is a dependent adult.a.
the presumption of invalidity of donative transfers to specified individuals under section a including transfers to care custodians of dependent not apply,inter alia,where t he instrument is reviewed by an independent attorney who counsels the client transferor about the nature and consequences of the intended transfer,attempts to determine if the intended consequence is the result of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence,and signs and delivers to the transferor an original certificate with a copy delivered to the drafter.b.this certificate of independent review must state that the attorney reviewed the instrument counseled the concerning the nature and consequences of the subject transfer of property to the presumptively disqualified person under section was disassociated from any interest in the transferee and concluded that the transfer to the presumptively disqualified person was valid because it was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence.b.
presumptively disqualified donees under section a even without the transferor having obtained a certificate of independent review under section b may rebut this presumption under very limited circumstances,where t he court determines,upon clear and convincing evidence,but not based solely upon the testimony of any person described in subdivision a of section,that the transfer was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence.d,italics added.this elevated proof burden rice clark,supra,cal th at,d,requires the proposed donee to persuade the trier of fact that it is highly probable that the fact is true.caci ed.see also former baji ed.in re asia th,d evidence must be so clear as to leave no substantial doubt.furthermore,in such proceeding,if the proposed donee fails to meet this heightened burden of proving that the transfer was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence,he or she shall bear all costs of the proceeding,including reasonable attorney fees.d.these costs in many instances will be substantial.see estate of shinkle th,fn,d care,after being determined a disqualified donee under section a,ordered to pay over in costs and attorney fees.
the intent of section was to prevent unscrupulous persons in fiduciary relationships from obtaining gifts from elderly persons through undue influence or other overbearing behavior.citation.bank of america angel view crippled children foundation th,d.the statute arose in response to reports of significant abuse of the relationship by an attorney in southern california who,inter alia,reportedly drafted wills and trusts for thousands of elderly clients,naming himself as beneficiary.citations.estate of swetmann th,fn,d see also rice clark,supra,cal th at,d.
as originally enacted in,section a did not include care custodians of dependent adults among the class of presumptively disqualified donees.see former,added by stats,ch.in,the legislature amended section a to include care custodians of dependent adults as presumptively disqualified donees.see stats,ch,see also conservatorship of davidson th,d amendment to section was intended to apply to gifts made to practical nurses or other caregivers hired to provide care.citation.
iv.required elements of a professional negligence claim 
in evaluating the sufficiency of osornio complaint,we note preliminarily that there are four essential elements of a professional negligence claim the duty of the professional to use such skill,prudence,and diligence as other members of his profession commonly possess and exercise a breach of that duty a proximate causal connection between the negligent conduct and the resulting injury and actual loss or damage resulting from the professional negligence.citations.budd nixen cal d,see also ishmael millington d.
a legal malpractice action is thus composed of the same elements as any other negligence claim,duty,breach of duty,proximate cause,and damage.citation.chavez carter d,disapproved on another ground in neel magana,olney,levy,cathcart gelfand cal d,fn.while other elements of a legal malpractice claim are generally factual and thus can not be challenged on demurrer,the existence of the attorney duty of care owing to the plaintiff is generally a question of law that may be addressed by demurrer.goodman kennedy cal d,goodman banerian,supra,d.
v.the biakanja and lucas decisions 
we start with the undisputed proposition that,in california,a n attorney liability for professional negligence does not ordinarily extend beyond the client except in limited circumstances.paul title meier d.see also vapnek et,cal.practice guide professional responsibility the rutter group,attorney generally has no professional obligation to nonclient.the supreme court very recently reiterated that the general rule is that an attorney owes a duty of care,and is thus answerable in malpractice,only to the client with whom the attorney stands in privity of contract.citation.borissoff taylor faust cal th,d.indeed,until,california followed the traditional view that a nonclient could not maintain an action against an attorney for malpractice thus,under former california law,a named beneficiary who was damaged as a result of the negligence of the attorney who drafted the will could not recover,due to the absence of any duty owed by the attorney to the beneficiary.see buckley gray cal,buckley.
in biakanja,supra,cal d,the supreme court disapproved of buckley strict privity requirement.a will failed in biakanja because,although notarized,its execution was not properly witnessed.biakanja,supra,cal d at.the beneficiary under the failed will sued the notary public,in the unauthorized practice of drafted and supervised the will execution.ibid.the court held that a defendant liability to a third person not in privity in a particular case is a matter of policy and involves the balancing of various factors,among which are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury suffered,the moral blame attached to the defendant conduct,and the policy of preventing future harm.citations.id.at.applying these factors,the supreme court concluded that the notary owed a duty of care to the beneficiary,even in the absence of privity.id.at.
in lucas,supra,cal d,the supreme court faced a similar question of duty to intended beneficiaries,but in the context of an attorney negligence.the beneficiaries sued the attorney who drafted the will and codicils in a manner that caused the instruments to fail because they ran afoul of statutory restraints on alienation and the rule against perpetuities.id.at.after noting that it had previously rejected buckley stringent privity test in biakanja lucas,supra,at,the court held that intended beneficiaries of a will who lose their testamentary rights because of failure of the attorney who drew the will to properly fulfill his obligations under his contract with the testator may recover as beneficiaries.id.at.
in so concluding,the court utilized the balancing test it enunciated previously in biakanja to determine whether the attorney defendant owed a duty to the beneficiaries with whom defendant was not in privity.lucas,supra,cal d at.the court added a factor not present in its discussion in biakanja,namely,whether the recognition of liability to beneficiaries of wills negligently drawn by attorneys would impose an undue burden on the profession.lucas,supra,cal d at.
the court determined that the first factor strongly favored the plaintiffs,since one of the main purposes which the transaction between defendant and the testator intended to accomplish was to provide for the transfer of property to plaintiffs.lucas,supra,cal d at.it likewise concluded that it was foreseeable that plaintiffs would be harmed if the bequest was determined to be invalid,that the harm would not occur but for defendant negligence,and that the harm would become certain upon the testator death.ibid.the court also held that denying recovery to beneficiaries under these circumstances would impair the policy of preventing future harm i f persons such as plaintiffs are not permitted to recover for the loss resulting from negligence of the draftsman,no one would be able to do so and the policy of preventing future harm would be impaired.ibid.finally,it concluded that the imposition of liability under these circumstances does not place an undue burden on the profession,particularly when we take into consideration that a contrary conclusion would cause the innocent beneficiary to bear the loss.ibid.
vi.decisions subsequent to lucas 
in the near since the supreme court decided lucas,california courts have considered numerous variations of the attorney potential liability to nonclients.some instances have involved an attorney duty of care in the estate planning context,while others have addressed negligence claims by nonclients in other business settings.in order to address fully the parties respective contentions herein,we first review these california decisions.
estate planning cases 
in heyer,supra,cal d,the supreme court addressed a legal malpractice claim brought by intended beneficiaries of a will.the two daughters of the were the sole that the attorney negligently failed to advise the mother that omitting a provision in the will concerning her intended marriage could result in the spouse asserting a claim to a portion of her estate in the event she predeceased him,under former section.heyer,supra,cal d at.
before addressing the central question before it,commencement of the statute of limitations,the heyer court reiterated its holdings in biakanja and lucas that permitted,as a matter of policy,intended beneficiaries to recover in the absence of privity with the defendant when an attorney undertakes to fulfill the testamentary instructions of his client,he realistically and in fact assumes a relationship not only with the client but also with the client intended beneficiaries.the attorney actions and omissions will affect the success of the client testamentary scheme and thus the possibility of thwarting the testator wishes immediately becomes foreseeable.equally foreseeable is the possibility of injury to an intended beneficiary.in some ways,the beneficiary interests loom greater than those of the client.after the latter death,a failure in his testamentary scheme works no practical effect except to deprive his intended beneficiaries of the intended bequests only the beneficiaries suffer the real loss.we recognized in lucas that unless the beneficiary could recover against the attorney in such a case,no one could do so and the social policy of preventing future harm would be frustrated.heyer,supra,cal d at.applying lucas,the court concluded that a reasonably prudent attorney should appreciate the consequences of a marriage,advise the testator of such consequences,and use good judgment to avoid them if the testator so desires.heyer,supra,cal d at.
similarly,an attorney was held to owe a duty of care to intended beneficiaries to properly advise the testator of the law governing the property he intended to dispose of through his will.see garcia,supra,d.the testator told his attorney that certain property in which he had a community property interest,as a matter of convenience,was held by his wife and him in joint tenancy.id.at.after the testator death,his widow terminated all joint tenancies in her favor,thus depriving the estate,and ultimately plaintiffs,of testator community interest in this property.id.at.the plaintiffs alleged that the attorney was negligent,inter alia,in failing to advise the testator of legal presumptions governing title to his property and in failing to advise him of potential estate planning measures to ensure that his property would receive proper recognition upon his death.id.at.while the appellate court focused mainly on a collateral estoppel issue it concluded that the plaintiffs alleged a viable theory of recovery against the testator attorney.id.at.
an estate planning attorney duty of care to nonclients,under lucas and heyer,was extended to trust beneficiaries in bucquet livingston d.bucquet.in that case,the beneficiaries under an inter vivos trust claimed that the attorney for the trustors husband and wife negligently drafted the trust he allegedly failed to advise the trustors of potential tax consequences resulting from including a general power of appointment in the trust.id.at.the beneficiaries claimed that this negligence resulted in the wife estate incurring unnecessary tax liability,which,in turn,reduced the share of the trust ultimately received by the beneficiaries.id.at.the court held that the principles of lucas and heyer are equally applicable to inter vivos trusts,like the instrument here in issue,as there is no rational basis for any distinction.bucquet,supra,at.it concluded that the complaint stated a cause of action,because the creation of the trust was directly intended to affect the beneficiaries and the avoidance of federal estate tax and state inheritance tax was directly related to the amounts that husband intended the beneficiaries to receive after wife death.bucquet at.
several cases have rejected unwarranted extensions of in other estate planning contexts.in ventura county humane society holloway d.ventura,the court rejected a malpractice claim by a class of potential beneficiaries charities.they alleged that,as a result of the attorney negligence,they were unable to take under the testator will because the containing the name selected by the not have a properly named beneficiary.id.at.the court refused to extend lucas,holding that no good reason exists why the attorney should be held accountable for using certain words suggested or selected by the testator which later prove to be ambiguous the duty thus created would amount to a requirement to draft legal documents.this unlimited liability would result in a speculative and almost intolerable burden on the legal profession indeed.ventura,supra,at.
likewise,we rejected the malpractice claim of a potential beneficiary identified in an unsigned will.see radovich th,d radovich.there,the attorney prepared a draft made specific bequests to plaintiff and named him as an income beneficiary under a charitable remainder delivered it to the testator.id.at,d.approximately two months after the attorney delivered the draft will,the testator died without having executed it.ibid.plaintiff asserted,inter alia,that the executor counsel was negligent in failing to obtain the testator signature on the will.id.at,d.
we refused to expand the attorney duty to nonclients under lucas heyer to a potential beneficiary under an unsigned draft will.radovich,supra,th at,d.in so concluding,we noted that most of the biakanja factors did not suggest the imposition of duty radovich,supra,th at,d,and that imposition of liability in a case such as this could improperly compromise an attorney primary duty of undivided loyalty to his or her client,the decedent.id.at,d see also goldberg frye d.rejecting legatees negligence claim against attorney for administrator,holding that principal purpose of attorney engagement was to counsel fiduciary and not to benefit legatees,and attorney owed duty to administrator only.
in a recent case,the first appellate district,division two,similarly refused to extend an attorney duty to a nonclient in the estate planning context.see moore,supra,th,d.in moore,the testator children alleged that the attorney who had drafted amendments to their father estate plan,which reduced the children share,was negligent in failing to ascertain his client testamentary capacity.id.at,d.the children alleged that as a result of the attorney failure to determine their father testamentary capacity and to document that evaluation,they received less through their settlement of ensuing estate litigation than they would have received under their father estate plan prior to execution of the questioned amendments.ibid.
after extensive review of the relevant authorities and discussion of the factors,the court held that the testator attorney owed no such duty to the beneficiaries.moore,supra,th at,d.the court concluded it may be that prudent counsel should refrain from drafting a will for a client the attorney reasonably believes lacks testamentary capacity or should take steps to preserve evidence regarding the client capacity in a borderline case.however,that is a far cry from imposing malpractice liability to nonclient potential beneficiaries for the attorney alleged inadequate investigation of evaluation of capacity or the failure to sufficiently document that investigation.ibid.
weingarten relies heavily on radovich and moore in support of his assertion that he owed no duty to osornio as a matter of law.as we discuss in detail,see pt.viii c,post,neither case supports weingarten position.in radovich,plaintiff was merely a potential beneficiary under an unsigned draft will.we rejected his claim against the attorney who drafted the unsigned will,based in large part upon our concern that imposing liability would undermine the attorney duty of loyalty to the client,radovich,supra,th at,d,a circumstance not presented here.likewise,the appellate court in moore concluded that requiring an attorney to ascertain and document his or her client testamentary capacity would place an intolerable burden on attorneys because n ot only would the attorney be subject to potentially conflicting duties to the client and to potential beneficiaries,but counsel also could be subject to conflicting duties to different sets of beneficiaries.moore,supra,th at,d.as we discuss,post,no such problem of conflicting loyalties arises here imposing a duty upon weingarten under the circumstances presented promotes the objectives of the client to transfer the client estate to the.
malpractice cases by nonclients in other settings 
several california decisions have followed lucas in finding a duty of care owed by the attorney to a nonclient outside of the estate planning context.one appellate court extended lucas to a nonclient who made a loan to the attorney client.see roberts ball,hunt,hart,brown baerwitz d.in roberts,the alleged that he relied upon the attorney letter opining that the client was a duly organized general partnership.id.at.the appellate court held that the attorney owed a duty to plaintiff,and thus concluded that plaintiff stated a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation t he issuance of a legal opinion intended to secure benefit for the client must be issued with due care,or the attorneys who do not act carefully will have breached a duty owed to those they attempted or expected to influence on behalf of their clients.id.at.see also courtney waring d.franchisor attorneys who prepared misleading prospectus held liable to franchisees.
in meighan,supra,th,d,the attorney failed to advise the client wife of the existence of a loss of consortium claim arising out of the client injuries,and the couple did not learn of the existence of such claim until after the statute of limitations had run.id.at,d.the court,applying the analysis under biakanja and lucas,concluded that the attorney owed the and nonclient duty to inform them of the existence of their rights under the consortium tort.meighan,supra,th at,d see also donald garry d.attorney for collection agent who brought suit on obligation owed duty to of claim to prosecute action diligently.
other cases,however,have rejected attorney negligence claims brought by nonclients.for instance,in goodman,supra,cal d,the plaintiffs alleged that they were damaged as a result of negligent advice given by the attorney to his clients concerning the issuance of stock.plaintiffs ultimately purchased the stock from the clients the sale was alleged to have violated certain securities laws,the result of which was that the stock purchased by plaintiffs was ultimately rendered valueless.id.at.
the supreme court rejected the negligence claim,concluding that the attorney had no relationship with the plaintiffs from which a duty of care arose.goodman,supra,cal d at.it noted that the advice was neither communicated to plaintiffs,nor was it given to enable the clients to satisfy any obligations to the plaintiffs.id.at.the complaint did not allege that plaintiffs had any relationship to defendant clients or to the corporation as stockholders or otherwise when the advice was given.id.at.the court also reasoned that plaintiffs were not parties upon whom the clients intended to confer a benefit when defendant provided the advice they were only parties with whom defendant clients might negotiate a bargain at arm length.ibid.moreover,the court concluded that a finding of duty under the circumstances presented would impose an undue burden on the profession citation and a diminution in the quality of legal services received by the client.citation,fn.omitted.
it is against the foregoing backdrop of california decisions concerning questions of the attorney duty to nonclients that we now address the question on appeal.we first consider whether the complaint,on its face,stated a cause of action for professional negligence.we then discuss whether the court properly denied osornio leave to amend her complaint.
vii.sufficiency of the osornio complaint 
as discussed above,the four elements of a legal malpractice claim are duty,breach of duty,proximate cause,and damage.chavez carter,supra,d.it is not disputed that osornio properly pleaded the latter three elements of negligence.the sole only the four corners of the whether the complaint alleged that weingarten owed a legal duty to osornio.
the complaint alleged that the will failed to include a certificate of independent review as required by california probate code section et osornio claimed in the next sentence of the complaint that,a s such,defendants failed to exercise reasonable care and skill in representing ellis.the complaint alleged that osornio was the intended sole beneficiary of the estate of dora ellis,and that osornio would have inherited the entirety of the ellis estate,but for weingarten negligence in preparing the will.
we may consider in connection with weingarten demurrer any matter that is judicially noticeable under evidence code section or.citation.cryolife,superior court,supra,th,d,citing code civ,subd.a.california statutes are,of course,matters of which judicial notice shall be taken,subd.a.thus,a complaint,while facially adequate,may fail to state a cause of action by referring to matters upon which judicial notice may be taken.childs state of california d.
we readily conclude that the complaint failed to allege that weingarten owed a duty of care to nonclient osornio.even assuming,arguendo,that the bare bones allegations of duty are facially sufficient,any claim of duty is directly refuted by sections and,of which we take judicial notice.see,subd.a.as we have seen,a certificate of independent review is a document that is signed by independent counsel representing the transferor,who then delivers to the transferor the original certificate with a copy delivered to the drafter.b.contrary to the allegations of osornio complaint,the certificate is not included in the testamentary instrument.similarly,contrary to the implication in osornio pleading,the drafter of the instrument is not the person who supplies the certificate as part of his or her duties to the transferor.we therefore conclude that the trial court properly held that osornio complaint was subject to demurrer because of the failure to allege a legal duty on the part of weingarten.
viii.whether osornio should have been granted leave to amend 
allegations of proposed amended complaint 
in determining whether the court should have granted leave to amend,we disregard osornio inartful pleading and examine whether there was a reasonable possibility that she could have amended her complaint to state a claim for legal malpractice.see blank kirwan,supra,cal d,okun superior court cal d.this requires us to first it appears from the opposition to demurrer and appellate unpleaded theory of negligence.
irrespective of the wording of the complaint,it is readily apparent that osornio could have alleged that weingarten breached a duty of care owed to her weingarten negligently failed to advise ellis that the intended beneficiary under her will,osornio,would be presumptively disqualified because of her relationship as ellis care custodian under this theory,weingarten was negligent not only by failing to advise ellis of the consequences of section a he was also negligent in failing to address osornio presumptive disqualification by making arrangements to refer ellis to independent counsel to advise her and to provide a certificate of independent review required by section b 
osornio could have alleged that,as a proximate result of this negligence,third party beneficiary to ellis engagement of weingarten to draft the damaged.the damage was osornio failure to inherit under the will.osornio could have alleged further that this failure to inherit occurred because a there was no certificate of independent review concerning the proposed donative transfer to osornio under the will b said certificate would have been obtained but for weingarten negligence in failing to advise ellis and in failing to refer her to independent counsel c absent this certificate,osornio was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence disregarding her own testimony that the transfer of the estate to her under the will was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence d,italics added and d she was unable to meet this high burden of overcoming the presumption that she was a disqualified person under section a.
having framed the potential amended complaint in this fashion,we must now address whether this proposed pleading sufficiently alleges a legal duty owed by weingarten to the nonclient,osornio.if we answer this question in the negative,we must affirm the trial court.if,however,we answer the question in the affirmative,we must necessarily find that the court abused its discretion by sustaining weingarten demurrer without granting osornio leave to amend.
balancing of six factors 
evaluating the existence of an attorney duty to a nonclient as a matter of policy lucas,supra,cal d,we must balance the six factors.to reiterate,these factors are the extent to which the transaction was intended to affect the plaintiff,the foreseeability of harm to him,the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered injury,the closeness of the connection between the defendant conduct and the injury the policy of preventing future harm ibid,and whether the recognition of liability to beneficiaries of wills negligently drawn by attorneys would impose an undue burden on the profession.id.at.
transaction intended to affect plaintiff 
as we have seen from our discussion,ante,i n the cases finding duties owed to nonclients,the nonclients were the intended beneficiaries of the attorney work or were relying on that work or were to be influenced by it and the attorney knew or should have known this.citation.assurance of america haven th,d.in balancing the factors to resolve the question of duty,t he predominant inquiry is whether the principal purpose of the attorney retention was to provide legal services for the benefit of the plaintiff.goldberg frye,supra,d.see also meighan,supra,th,d presence or absence of a client intent that the plaintiff benefit from or rely upon the attorney services is particularly significant in the determination of duty mallen smith,legal malpractice,supra,predominant inquiry is whether principal purpose of client retention of attorney was to benefit third party.
unquestionably,this factor supports osornio.here,there is no doubt that the end and aim of the transaction,the drafting of the will was to provide for the passing of ellis estate to osornio.biakanja,supra,cal d at.the engagement of weingarten by ellis was clearly intended to benefit osornio.in this respect,the supreme court analyses in biakanja,lucas,and heyer directly apply.
foreseeability of harm to plaintiff 
we have no trouble concluding that this factor similarly supports osornio.it was clearly foreseeable at the time weingarten drafted the will that,if he failed to exercise due care to effectuate the testamentary transfer that ellis intended upon her death,osornio would be damaged.again,the circumstances the supreme court addressed in biakanja,lucas,and heyer are indistinguishable from this case.
in addition,the will was a revocation of ellis prior will,under which another person,williams,was beneficiary.this relevant fact increased the foreseeability of harm to osornio in the event that there was no certificate of independent review of the will.it concomitantly decreased the likelihood that osornio would be able to meet her heavy burden under d of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the bequest was not the product of fraud,menace,duress,or undue influence.
degree of certainty of plaintiff injury 
it is clear that osornio sustained injury.although ellis intended under the will that osornio receive the entire estate,she will receive nothing if she is unable to rebut her presumptive disability under section a.osornio efforts to rebut the presumption have been unsuccessful.see tentative decision in re the estate of dora ellis,monterey county super.case nos.mp.assuming these efforts are ultimately unsuccessful,osornio will sustain the definite injury of being deprived of the estate she would have received,but for her disqualification.
closeness between defendant conduct and plaintiff injury 
we acknowledge that weingarten conduct as might be alleged in a proposed amended complaint does not have the same degree of closeness to osornio injury found in many of the authorities,ante,finding a duty owed by the attorney to a nonclient.this is admittedly not a as lucas,supra,cal d,or heyer,supra,cal d,there are no possible intervening factors that might break the causal connection between the attorney conduct and the nonclient damage.here,the facts may ultimately disclose that it would have been unlikely for a variety of reasons that ellis would have obtained a certificate of independent review,even had weingarten advised her of the importance of seeking counsel to obtain it under at least one scenario,however,osornio may be able to establish that,but for weingarten failure to advise ellis and refer her to independent counsel to address osornio presumptive disqualification under section a,osornio would not have been damaged.
as is evident,the closeness of weingarten conduct to the injury here is one resolvable only after the presentation of significant evidence.it suffices to say that we conclude here that the absence of an extreme closeness between conduct and injury,by itself,should not trump a finding of an attorney duty to a nonclient in a case that the remaining five it.
policy of preventing future harm 
the case before us is similar to other cases in which courts have imposed a duty of care upon attorneys where beneficiaries are deprived of intended transfers of property as a result of failed wills or trusts.see heyer,supra,cal d,lucas,supra,cal d,bucquet,supra,d.here,unlike the circumstances in ventura,supra,d.the bequest failed due to the testator inaccurate description of the transfer of the estate failed through no fault of ellis.if testamentary beneficiaries who are presumptively disqualified under section a such as deprived of the right to bring suit against the attorney responsible for the failure of the intended bequest,no one would be able to bring such action.the policy of preventing harm would thus be impaired.see lucas,supra,cal d at.
we conclude that this fifth factor supports osornio claim.the imposition of duty under the circumstances before us would thus promote public policy it would encourage the competent practice of law by counsel representing testators,trustors,and other clients making donative transfers to persons presumptively disqualified under section a.
extent of burden on profession 
consistent with lucas,an important factor we must consider in evaluating weingarten potential duty to osornio under the facts before us is whether the extension of liability here would impose an undue burden on the profession.lucas,supra,cal d at.we conclude that the extension of liability here will not impose such an undue burden.in making this determination,we are mindful that it is the general rule that attorneys will not be held liable to nonclients for their negligence,and that e xceptions have been recognized only rarely,and then only when the specific facts of the case showed that the beneficiaries who sought standing to sue the fiduciary attorney were intended,third party beneficiaries of the contract to provide legal services.citations.borissoff taylor faust,supra,cal th,d.
an attorney is expected to possess knowledge of those plain and elementary principles of law which are commonly known by well informed attorneys,and to discover those additional rules of law which,although not commonly known,may readily be found by standard research techniques.citations.e ven with respect to an unsettled area of the law,we believe an attorney assumes an obligation to his client to undertake reasonable research in an effort to ascertain relevant legal principles and to make an informed decision as to a course of conduct based upon an intelligent assessment of the problem.smith lewis cal d,disapproved on another ground in in re marriage of brown cal d,fn.thus,the estate planning attorney owes a duty to act with due care as to the interests of the intended beneficiary heyer,supra,cal d,which duty arises out of the agreement to provide legal services to the testator.
as one practice guide has explained an attorney who undertakes to assist a client in transferring property is necessarily assuming a duty to assist the client in making the transfer in a manner that does not unduly expose the transfer to attack.cal.estate planning property transfer obstacles.for instance,the supreme court in heyer held that a reasonably prudent attorney should appreciate the consequences of marriage,advise the testator of such consequences,and use good judgment to avoid them if the testator so desires.heyer,supra,cal d at.similarly,in bucquet,the court held that the attorney responsible for drafting inter vivos trusts owed a duty to the trust beneficiaries to take appropriate steps known to competent attorneys to avoid federal estate tax and state inheritance tax,where such tax avoidance would directly impact the amounts the beneficiaries would receive after the trustors deaths.bucquet,supra,d at.see also garcia,supra,d.attorney owed duty to intended beneficiaries to explain to testator statutory presumptions governing title to property and measures that might be taken to assure that property true character was recognized upon testator death.
the existence of statutory limitations on donative transfers to certain classes of people is a matter known to competent estate planning practitioners.one practice guide devotes an entire chapter to a discussion of donees who are presumptively disqualified under section a.see cal.trust and probate litigation statutorily disqualified donees and trustees.other guides for california estate planning practitioners discuss donees who are presumptively disqualified under section a.see,cal.will drafting professional responsibility,cal.estate planning,supra,property transfer obstacles,ross,cal.practice guide probate the rutter group to,to.indeed,the legislature deemed the subject of such importance that,at the time it enacted section in,the assembly bill included a separate statute under the business and professions code,making an attorney violation of section grounds for discipline,if the attorney knew or should have known of the facts leading to the violation.bus.
an attorney drafting instruments on behalf of the dispositive provisions of which include a proposed transfer to a presumptively disqualified person under section a must assist the client in making the transfer in a manner that does not unduly expose the transfer to attack.cal.estate planning,supra.we therefore hold that the attorney owes a duty of care to advise the client that,absent steps taken under section b,the subject transfer to the proposed transferee,if challenged,will have a significant likelihood of failing because of the proposed transferee presumptive disqualification under section a and to recommend that the client seek independent counsel in an effort to obtain a certificate of independent review provided under section b.consistent with the authorities discussed,lucas,heyer,garcia,and bucquet,duty of care is owed to both the and to the prospective transferee.in so holding,we conclude that this area of the law is not as the lucas court found to be the case with restraints on alienation and the rule against is a question of law on which reasonable doubt may be entertained by lawyers.citations.lucas,supra,cal d.
a matter related to the question of undue burden upon the find that the imposition of liability here would not result in the attorney becoming unduly preoccupied with the possibility of negligence claims from third parties who might have dealings with his or her clients.see goodman,supra,cal d.under the facts presented here,at the time ellis engaged weingarten,he clearly knew of his client desire that her care custodian,osornio,be her sole beneficiary under the will.this case does not present a situation where the attorney would be faced with conflicting loyalties in representing the client.see,paul title meier,supra,d.attorney for purchaser owed no duty to incidental third party,escrow agent,because,inter alia,attorney duty of loyalty to client should not be divided.thus,imposing liability here does not burden the attorney with concerns that would prevent him from devoting his entire energies to his client interests.citation.goodman,supra,at.to the contrary,imposing a duty upon attorneys preparing instruments containing donative transfers to presumptively disqualified persons under section a would promote public policy it would encourage attorneys to devote their best professional efforts on behalf of their clients to ensure that transfers of property to particular donees are free from avoidable challenge.
moreover,our holding does not suggest that an attorney must draft legal documents.ventura,supra,d.we do not imply from our ruling here that that a transferor attorney guarantees the success of the client intended transfer.see lucas,supra,cal d,absent express agreement,attorney is not insurer of the soundness of his opinions or of the validity of an instrument that he is engaged to draft.thus,there may be cases including,possibly,the one before us in which the attorney is ultimately held not liable for the failed transfer,despite the attorney failure to advise the client concerning the potential impact of section a.for instance,the attorney might avoid liability if the intended beneficiary is unable to establish that the attorney negligence was the cause of the failed transfer,because it was unlikely that the client could have obtained a certificate of independent review.
we thus conclude that imposition of duty upon an attorney toward third parties here does not place an undue burden on the profession,particularly when taking into consideration that a contrary conclusion would cause an innocent beneficiary to bear the loss.lucas,supra,cal d at.
c.the radovich and moore decisions 
in arguing against a finding of duty under the narrow circumstances presented here,weingarten relies primarily upon our decision in radovich,supra,th,d,and on moore,supra,th,d.neither case supports weingarten position in support of affirmance of the judgment.
in case factually refused to extend an attorney duty to a nonclient who was a mere potential beneficiary under an unsigned draft will.radovich,supra,th at,d.in that instance,there was no plain expression of the testator intention to benefit the plaintiff although a potential testator may also change his or her mind after a will is signed,we perceive significantly stronger support for an inference of commitment in a signature on testamentary documents than in a preliminary direction to prepare such documents for signature.id.at,d.in contrast,here we have a clear expression of ellis intention that osornio be her sole beneficiary under the signed will.
likewise,in radovich,we expressed concern that the imposition of liability by an estate planning attorney to potential beneficiaries under unsigned estate planning documents could improperly compromise an attorney primary duty of undivided loyalty to his or her client.radovich,supra,th at,d.here,there is none of the ambiguity concerning the testator donative intent as was presented in radovich.imposing liability in this instance would not compromise the attorney duty of undivided loyalty to the testator.the attorney duty here was to take appropriate action to carry out the testator were expressed and formalized in her signed her intended beneficiary,osornio,inherit her entire estate.
moore,supra,also involved circumstances entirely distinct from those presented here.as noted,ante,the question in moore was whether an attorney owed a duty to beneficiaries under a will to evaluate and ascertain the testamentary capacity of a client seeking to amend the will or to make a new will and to preserve evidence of that evaluation.moore,supra,th at,d.moore,in essence,involved a challenge by beneficiaries to the last formalized expression of the client testamentary intentions,and a claim of malpractice against the attorney for failing to investigate and document his own client testamentary capacity.ibid.here,however,osornio makes no such claim.instead,she asserts that the will did contain an accurate expression of ellis testamentary intentions,but the proposed transfer failed due to weingarten negligence in his representation of ellis.
the moore court rejected the beneficiaries contention that the attorney owed them a duty to evaluate and document his client testamentary intent,concluding that f irst and foremost,we believe the duty of loyalty of the attorney to the client may be compromised by imposing a duty to beneficiaries in these circumstances.moore,supra,th at,d.it reasoned that,unlike cases such as biakanja,lucas,or there was no potential for a conflict between the attorney duty to the client and any duty owing to the would be a clear conflict in imposing a duty where the intent of the testator was later challenged by the beneficiaries.id.at,d.accordingly,the court held that imposing such liability would place an intolerable burden upon attorneys.ibid.
here,as we have discussed,ante,the imposition of liability upon attorneys to advise their concerning the potential disqualifying effects of transfers to persons identified in section a does not impose an undue burden on the legal profession.further,such a finding of the circumstances in either moore or not compromise the attorney duty of undivided loyalty to the.moreover,unlike the duty theory rejected in moore,our holding does not require the attorney to evaluate or document the capacity of his or her.instead,it imposes a duty upon the attorney to advise the client of section a effect of potentially disqualifying the proposed donee,and to assist the client in attempting to eliminate those consequences to effectuate the client donative intentions.
the moore court cited section of the restatement third of law governing lawyers as a basis for its rejection of attorney liability.moore,supra,th at,d.the restatement supports our conclusion in this case.it provides in part a lawyer owes a duty to use care to a nonclient when and to the extent that a the lawyer knows that a client intends as one of the primary objectives of the representation that the lawyer services benefit the nonclient b such a duty would not significantly impair the lawyer performance of obligations to the client and c the absence of such a duty would make enforcement of those obligations to the client unlikely.rest d law governing lawyers.plainly,each of these factors is satisfied here.
furthermore,the comment explaining subsection of section of the comment which was also quoted by the moore court moore,supra,th at,d similarly supports our holding when a lawyer knows that a client intends a lawyer services to benefit a third person who is not a client,allowing the nonclient to recover from the lawyer for negligence in performing those services may promote the lawyer loyal and effective pursuit of the client objectives.the nonclient,moreover,may be the only person likely to enforce the lawyer duty to the client,for example because the client has died.a nonclient claim under subsection is recognized only when doing so will both implement the client intent and serve to fulfill the lawyer obligations to the client without impairing performance of those obligations in the circumstances of the representation.rest d law governing lawyers,com.f.clearly,osornio was the third person that ellis intended to benefit through the services weingarten performed.it is equally clear that finding the existence of a duty owed by weingarten to nonclient osornio under the circumstances presented here will promote the attorney effective pursuit of the client objectives.ibid.moreover,were we to conclude otherwise here,no one would be left to enforce the testator right to be effectively represented.
we thus disagree with weingarten that moore is on all fours with the case before us.we conclude that neither moore nor our decision in radovich is controlling here.
conclusion 
we have balanced the factors that must be considered in evaluating the question of an attorney potential liability to third parties.as a matter of public policy,we must conclude that weingarten owed a duty of care to osornio under the facts as may be alleged in an amended complaint.because osornio could have amended her pleading to state a cause of action for professional negligence,the trial court abused its discretion by failing to grant osornio leave to amend when it sustained the demurrer.
disposition 
the judgment is reversed and,on remand,the trial court is directed to grant osornio leave to file an amended complaint.
