carole squire,an ohio judge,filed an action under against jonathan coughlan,disciplinary counsel for the supreme court of ohio.she contends that her right to the due process of law was violated when coughlan failed to provide her with the names of all persons contacted by the ohio disciplinary counsel in the course of an investigation into allegations of her judicial misconduct.judge squire received a draft complaint notifying her of the allegations and giving her the opportunity to respond before the complaint was filed with a panel of the board of commissioners on grievance and discipline the board.instead of responding to the draft complaint,judge squire filed suit in federal district court,asking among other things for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the state disciplinary proceedings.
the district court dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under the younger abstention doctrine.it also denied the motion for a temporary restraining order,concluding that even if younger abstention were inappropriate,judge squire had failed to make the showing necessary to obtain such an order.judge squire timely appealed.for the reasons set forth below,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
a.the ohio judicial grievance process 
disciplinary proceedings against members of the state judiciary in ohio are governed by rule v of the ohio supreme court rules for the government of the bar bar v and rule ii of the supreme court rules for the government of the judiciary of ohio.ii.under procedures established by these rules,a disciplinary proceeding against a judge is ordinarily commenced by the filing of a grievance with the ohio disciplinary counsel.upon the filing of a grievance or other information that comes to its attention relating to the alleged misconduct of a judge,the disciplinary counsel has a mandatory duty to commence an investigation.the investigation is confidential and involves interviewing witnesses and compiling other information regarding the alleged violation.bar v,i requires that the judge who is the subject of a grievance or investigation be given notice of each allegation and the opportunity to respond to each allegation before the investigation is completed.
the disciplinary counsel determines,once the investigation is completed,whether there is substantial evidence of a violation of the canons of judicial ethics.if the evidence is insufficient,the investigation is dismissed and remains confidential.but if there is substantial evidence of a violation,the disciplinary counsel prepares a draft complaint.the draft complaint is then sent to the judge under investigation so that he or she may respond before the complaint is formally filed with the board.any response by the investigated judge is attached to the draft complaint before it is filed.once the complaint is filed,a panel of the board determines whether there is probable cause to certify the complaint and commence a formal proceeding.the complaint becomes public information only after it is certified by the panel.
a certified complaint against a judge is then referred to a separate panel comprised of three judges for a formal disciplinary proceeding.the accused judge has the opportunity to answer the complaint and to engage in discovery under the ohio rules of civil procedure,including pretrial depositions,interrogatories,and document production.once discovery is complete,the judge may issue subpoenas to witnesses to appear at the disciplinary hearing.the judge also has the right to be represented by counsel and to elicit testimony from the witnesses on both direct and.
b.the disciplinary proceedings against judge squire 
judge squire sits on the franklin county court of common pleas in columbus,ohio.she was elected for a term that ends on december.jonathan coughlan,the disciplinary counsel for the supreme court of ohio,investigates and prosecutes judicial grievances filed under bar v and jud.ii.at some point prior to october,coughlan notified judge squire that she was the subject of an investigation by the ohio disciplinary counsel for alleged violations of the canons of judicial ethics.
coughlan testified at the district court evidentiary hearing that his office initially sent judge squire a letter of inquiry setting forth the grounds for the disciplinary counsel investigation.he further said that he sent her a draft complaint that alleged two counts of misconduct.because judge squire did not waive confidentiality,no further details of the alleged misconduct are set forth in the record.the draft complaint,according to coughlan,contained the names of all persons who had filed a grievance,as well as the names of all potential witnesses in a formal proceeding against judge squire.but coughlan conceded that the disciplinary counsel office did not provide the names of every single person spoken to in the course of conducting its investigation.a hearing was set for october.
judge squire requested that coughlan provide the names of all of the complainants.because no complainant had requested anonymity,coughlan asserted that judge squire had been provided with all of the complainants names.he also said that there was no particular person who had filed a grievance for one of the two counts charged.coughlan testified that this charge was a matter that came to his attention during the course of the overall investigation thus,there was no name of a particular complainant to provide.
two days before the state hearing set for october,judge squire filed her lawsuit against coughlan in the united states district court for the southern district of ohio.she alleged that coughlan had violated her due process rights under the fourteenth amendment by denying her a meaningful opportunity to respond to the draft complaint.according to the complaint,the due process violation was coughlan alleged refusal to provide judge squire with the names of all of the complainants and witnesses against her.she requested a temporary restraining order prohibiting coughlan from proceeding with the hearing,a preliminary and a permanent injunction requiring coughlan to provide her with the names of all of the complainants and witnesses against her,and attorney fees.the district court dismissed the complaint sua sponte for lack of jurisdiction,finding that judge squire ongoing state disciplinary proceedings required that the federal court abstain pursuant to the principles set forth in younger harris,d.
judge squire filed a second complaint on october,which was identical to the original complaint except that lori brown,the assistant disciplinary counsel,was named as an additional defendant.the second complaint was accompanied by a motion for a temporary restraining order.because the board hearing was set for october,the district court held an evidentiary hearing the evening of october.the court once again dismissed the complaint,finding that it lacked jurisdiction under younger.moreover,the court held that,even if younger abstention were inappropriate,judge squire claim for temporary injunctive relief would fail on the merits.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
a.the district court decision 
the district court held that abstention was appropriate in this case under younger harris.in younger,the supreme court held that absent bad faith,harassment or any other unusual circumstance,abstention is appropriate where a plaintiff invokes federal jurisdiction as a basis for obtaining injunctive relief against criminal proceedings.id.at.the supreme court later held that t he policies underlying younger are fully applicable to noncriminal judicial proceedings when important state interests are involved.middlesex county ethics comm garden state bar ass n,d.
