opinion of the court 
in this grand jury proceeding,the issue on appeal is whether,on the facts presented,the exception overrides the privilege.in the proceedings below,the district court declined to enforce a grand jury subpoena issued to an attorney.citing the exception,the government has appealed 
over four years ago in april,a federal grand jury commenced investigating the target business transactions and issued several subpoenas to the target affiliated businesses.the target attorney assumed responsibility in responding to the united states attorney office.the government first subpoena sought,
all records relating to work performed by the target these records should include but are not limited to all business checks,check registers,cash receipt and disbursement records.these records should also include contracts,invoices,billing documents,bid documents and correspondence specifically relating to the target activities for the relevant period.
the attorney produced several documents.but believing them inadequate,the government requested fuller document production.the attorney responded that certain categories of requested documents did not exist.
in may,the government again requested the documents under its initial subpoena and advised the attorney that the grand jury will also request that the target appear before it with regard to the production of the documents in question.the attorney provided some additional documents including check ledgers and canceled checks.the target was not summoned to appear before the grand jury.
in september,the government issued a second subpoena requesting additional documents including general ledgers,cash disbursement journals,cash receipts,sales and accounts payable journals,as well as calendars,diaries and appointment books for all of the target business officers and employees.the attorney again responded that most of the requested documents did not exist.on january,the government advised the attorney that it was subpoenaing the custodian of records of one of the target business es to produce all responsive original records before the grand jury next thursday january.the government also subpoenaed an officer of the target business to testify before the grand jury also on january about her knowledge of the existence of the subpoenaed documents.the government never enforced its subpoenas.
in april,november,and march the government subpoenaed more records from the target business.the attorney produced some of the requested documents but again represented that certain categories of documents did not exist.on march,the federal bureau of investigation executed search warrants on the target home and also on the target business offices.the fbi uncovered and seized many records and documents the attorney had represented did not exist.on april,the government subpoenaed the attorney to testify before the grand jury about the source s of information for his factual assertions and basis for failing to produces sic certain categories of records.
after the attorney invoked the privilege,the government filed a motion to compel his testimony.claiming the exception invalidated the privilege,the government argued the target used the attorney to obstruct justice in violation of holding it was fundamentally unfair to compel the attorney testimony,the district court declined to assess the applicability of the exception.in the matter of the grand jury empaneled on december,misc,slip op.at february.
the government appeals contending the district court erred in failing to decide whether the exception applied.it also contends the district court exceeded its authority in quashing the subpoena because of fundamental unfairness.
we review the decision to quash a grand jury subpoena for abuse of discretion.in re grand jury proceedings,cir.we exercise de novo review over the legal issues underlying the application of the exception to the privilege.united states inigo,cir.we review the district court factual determinations in applying the privilege for clear error.id.
the grand jury plays a unique role in our adversarial system.the supreme court has recognized the whole theory of its function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government,serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the government and the people.united states williams,d.it has stated,
although the grand jury normally operates,of course,in the courthouse and under judicial auspices,its institutional relationship with the judicial branch has traditionally been,so to speak,at arm length.judges direct involvement in the functioning of the grand jury has generally be confined to the constitutive one of calling the grand jurors together and administering their oaths of office.
several cases have recognized the judiciary limited authority over the grand jury subpoena and indictment power.see williams,at.court can not exercise it supervisory power to require prosecutors to present exculpatory evidence to the grand jury costello united states.court may not exercise its supervisory power to mandate a rule permitting defendants to challenge grand jury indictments because of inadequate or incompetent evidence.as we recently stated in in re grand jury subpoena,
because it is essential to the federal criminal justice system,the grand jury has great powers of investigation and inquisition.it may generally compel the production of evidence or the testimony of witnesses as it considers appropriate,and its operation generally is unrestrained by the technical procedural and evidentiary rules governing the conduct of criminal trials.
cir quoting united states calandra,d.
any holding that would saddle a grand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and frustrate the public interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.united states dionisio,d.
as the supreme court has made clear,the government can not be required to justify the issuance of a grand jury subpoena because the very purpose of requesting the information is to ascertain whether probable cause exists.united states enterprises,d citing hale henkel.requiring the government to explain in too much detail the particular reasons underlying a subpoena threatens to compromise the indispensable secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.id.at.quoting united states johnson.
despite these broad investigatory powers,there are some limitations on the grand jury authority to subpoena evidence.see calandra,at.the grand jury may not itself violate a valid privilege,whether established by the constitution,statutes,or the common law branzburg hayes,d the powers of the grand jury are not unlimited and are subject to the supervision of a judge kastigar united states,d holding grand jury may override a fifth amendment claim only if the witness is granted immunity with the privilege against.the supreme court has stated,grand juries are not licensed to engage in arbitrary fishing expeditions,nor may they select targets of investigation out of malice or an intent to harass,at.
as a safeguard against potential abuse of the grand jury broad investigative power,the federal rules of evidence and the federal rules of criminal procedure grant limited authority for courts to review grand jury subpoenas.in this case,the two principal mechanisms for judicial review are.recognizing the privilege which protects confidential communications between an attorney and his client from disclosure,and.c,providing that t he court on motion made promptly may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.
the district court did not refer to.c nor to the privilege when it declined to compel the attorney testimony.it stated,
the court will assume for purposes of its analysis that the attorney is innocent of any wrongdoing and has been used merely as a conduit for wrongdoing,the obstruction of justice.nevertheless it is fundamentally unfair for the attorney office to seek the attorney testimony in this case.
in the matter of the grand jury empaneled on december,at.
reasoning that to obtain the desired information,the government could have pursued avenues less harmful to the privilege,including enforcing its subpoenas on the target and the records custodian,the district court stated,
the award for neither appointing nor insisting upon a custodian of records can not be securing the testimony of the subject attorney.instead the attorney office should have acted upon the subpoenas it procured and not assume that it could fall back on the subject attorney.
compelling the lawyer testimony,the court said,goes against the core of the adversarial system and would unnecessarily drive a wedge between a client and his attorney,thereby chilling communications.id.at citing loatman summit bank.
because the district court relied on neither.nor an analysis of the exception,the government contends the court exceeded its authority in quashing the subpoena.
in,at,the supreme court discussed the court limited role in regulating grand jury subpoenas.a grand jury target sought to quash a government subpoena on the grounds of relevancy.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit held the government must establish the relevancy and admissibility of the evidence subpoenaed.the supreme court reversed holding the court of appeals improperly placed the burden on the government to prove relevancy.citing the grand jury historical independence from the judiciary,the court said a grand jury subpoena is presumed reasonable unless its recipient demonstrates otherwise.c permits judicial oversight only when compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.at.thus,the court held trial courts can not place an initial burden on the government to prove a grand jury subpoena is necessary and relevant.
similarly,in baylson disciplinary bd.of the supreme of pennsylvania,cir,cert.denied,d,we held a pennsylvania rule of professional conduct governing grand jury subpoena procedures was unenforceable because it interfered with the grand jury institutional independence.the supreme court of pennsylvania had adopted a rule of professional conduct which provided 
a public prosecutor or other governmental lawyer shall not,without prior judicial approval,subpoena an attorney to appear before a grand jury or other tribunal investigating criminal activity in circumstances where the prosecutor or other governmental lawyer seeks to compel the to provide evidence concerning a person who is or has been represented by the attorney witness.citation omitted.
it is intended that the required prior judicial approval will normally be withheld unless,after a hearing conducted with due regard for the appropriate need for secrecy,the court finds the information sought is not protected from disclosure by rule concerning confidentiality of information,the privilege or the work product doctrine the evidence sought is relevant to the proceeding compliance with the subpoena would not be unreasonable or oppressive the purpose of the subpoena is not primarily to harass the or his or her client and there is no other feasible alternative to obtain the information sought.
id.at quoting rule.of the pennsylvania rules of professional conduct.
the judicial review mandated by the pennsylvania rule,we held,exceeded the district court authority to intervene in grand jury proceedings.noting the supreme court reluctance to place judicial restraints on the grand jury,see id.at,and the grand jury historically recognized independence,we held the district court may not under the guise of its supervisory power or its local power,impose the sort of substantive restraint on the grand jury that is contemplated by rule.id.at.we also held the pennsylvania rule could not be justified under.reasoning that neither 
rule nor any other provision in the federal rules or statutes allows for judicial intervention before a subpoena is served.instead subdivision c provides that a party may move to quash a subpoena on the grounds that compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive only after it has been served.
it is well established that courts may not impose substantive limitations on the power of the grand jury to issue subpoenas nor place the initial burden on the government to prove the validity of its subpoenas.see baylson,at.in williams,the supreme court stated,
any power federal courts have to fashion,on their own initiative,rules of grand jury procedure is a very limited one,not remotely comparable to the power they maintain over their own proceedings.it certainly would not permit judicial reshaping of the grand jury institution,substantially altering the traditional relationships between the prosecution,the constituting court,and the grand jury itself.citation omitted.
similarly in costello,the court stated,it would run counter to the whole history of the grand jury institution,in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules to permit federal courts to establish independent rules governing the enforcement of grand jury subpoenas.at.
one form of restraint,however,may be found in.c.but as noted,the district court never applied.c.instead,it held that the government must demonstrate the evidence sought could not be obtained by other means.the district court prescribed course of action may be salutary and efficacious to safeguard the privilege.under appropriate circumstances,it may well constitute the better practice.but we see no authority for it in the rules or the case law.see,at.generally,the government does not bear the initial burden to justify its grand jury subpoena.see see also stern united states dist.for the dist.of massachusetts,cir holding local rule which permitted judicial approval of subpoena alter ed the grand jury historic role,place d it under overly intrusive court supervision,curb ed its broad investigative powers,reverse d the presumption of validity accorded to its subpoenas,undermine d the secrecy of its proceedings,and create d procedural detours and delays.
the institutional independence and secrecy of the grand jury has been a hallmark of criminal indictments for over three centuries.any deviation from the established practices governing court involvement should not be taken lightly.we recognize the district court was concerned with the effect of this subpoena on the relationship.but the proper course under.c was to rule on whether the lawyer testimony was protected under the privilege.by employing a different analysis based on fundamental fairness the district court deviated from the established procedures which ensure the institutional independence of the grand jury therefore,the district court abused its discretion.
we now turn to whether the district court erred in its application of the exception to the privilege.worthy of maximum protection,haines liggett group,cir,the privilege is one of the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known.upjohn united states,d.as noted by the supreme court,courts have long viewed the privilege central concern as one to encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients and thereby promote broader public interests in the observance of law and administration of justice.united states zolin,d quoting upjohn,at.
the grand jury may not itself violate a valid privilege,whether established by the constitution,statutes,or the common law.calandra,at.for this reason,courts may quash an otherwise valid grand jury subpoena for an attorney testimony under the privilege.when legal advice is sought in furtherance of a crime or fraud,however,the privilege is waived and a grand jury may compel a lawyer testimony.see,clark united states.a client who consults an attorney for advice that will serve him in the commission of a fraud will have no help from the law.he must let the truth be told.inigo,at when legal consultation is in furtherance of a crime or fraud,the statements will not be protected.we have described the exception in this manner 
the privilege is designed to encourage clients to make full disclosure of facts to counsel so that he may properly,competently,and ethically carry out his representation.the ultimate aim is to promote the proper administration of justice.that end,however,would be frustrated if the client used the lawyer services to further a continuing or future crime or tort.thus,when the lawyer is consulted,not with respect to past wrongdoing but to future illegal activities,the privilege is no longer defensible and the exception comes into play.

a party seeking to compel testimony under the exception bears the initial burden of proving a prima facie case of a crime or fraud before the privilege is waived haines,at t he party seeking discovery must present evidence which,if believed by the,would be sufficient to support a finding that the elements of the exception were met.in re feldberg,cir a prima facie case must be defined with regard to its function to require the adverse party,the one with superior access to the evidence and in the best position to explain things,to come forward with that explanation.here,the government asserts the target business obstructed justice by failing to disclose documents subpoenaed by the grand jury the government maintains it has submitted sufficient prima facie evidence of obstruction of justice to show the existence of a crime,in the form of documents found during the fbi search of the target business offices,as well as from ex parte,in camera affidavits.challenging this assessment,the attorney contends the government presented insufficient evidence that the target and the target business corruptly intended to obstruct justice.
the district court declined to decide whether the government submitted sufficient prima facie evidence of intent to obstruct justice.although it correctly outlined the law,the court stated,
typically,at this point in the opinion,the court would begin to analyze whether the government has articulated a prima facie showing of a fraud or a crime pursuant to a by first examining whether there is evidence of criminal intent.this court finds,however,that the unique circumstances surrounding this case warrant a different analysis than that articulated by the parties.
in the matter of the grand jury empaneled on december,at.
we believe this was error.see,clark,at.haines,at in re grand jury proceedings,at.the proper course would have been to determine the applicability of the exception to the privilege.if the government has submitted sufficient prima facie evidence of a crime or fraud and legal advice was sought from or given by the attorney in connection therewith the privilege has been waived,and the grand jury may compel the attorney to testify about his communications with the target.see,in re impounded case law firm,cir in re sealed case.absent this finding,the attorney may validly assert the privilege in response to the grand jury subpoena.see in re grand jury investigation,cir a party may invoke a historically recognized privilege to protect communications from disclosure to the grand jury.for these reasons,the district court must decide whether the government has submitted sufficient evidence of the intent to obstruct justice and determine whether this evidence supports a waiver of the privilege.once the court determines there is sufficient evidence of a crime or fraud to waive the privilege,we review its judgment for abuse of discretion.in re grand jury subpoena,at in re grand jury subpoenas,cir we find no abuse of discretion in either the district court refusal to conduct a separate rebuttal hearing or its refusal to reveal the contents of the government submission.
for the foregoing reasons,we will vacate and remand for findings under.c and the crime fraud exception to the privilege.
because i disagree with the majority conclusion that the district court never applied.c and instead held that the government must demonstrate the evidence sought could not be obtained by other means,i respectfully dissent.majority opinion at.i believe that the district court validly exercised its discretion under rule c and did not impose a broad test.therefore,i would affirm.
the government claims that the district court applied a test to determine whether the attorney subpoena was fair and therefore enforceable.appellant brief at.apparently,the majority agrees it holds that the court employed an analysis based on fundamental fairness that deviated from the established procedures which ensure the institutional independence of the grand jury.majority opinion at.i agree that such a blanket rule,if it were imposed,would improperly place a substantive limitation upon the grand jury,is outside the district court supervisory powers,and has been implicitly rejected by this court in baylson disciplinary,cir.see appellant brief at.
however,i disagree with the majority characterization of the district court holding.the district court did not impose a new substantive limitation upon the grand jury.rule c of the federal rules of criminal procedure states that t he court may quash or modify a subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.see also united states,d.the majority recognizes rule c as a valid form of restraint upon the grand jury,but nonetheless holds that the district court failed to apply it.majority opinion at.i concede that the district court never explicitly invoked.c,but such an omission is not fatal as long as what the court did is clear furthermore,we may affirm the district court on any grounds supported by the record.nicini morra,cir.
the district court in his case considered the specific facts and circumstances before it and found that it was fundamentally unfair for the attorney office to seek the attorney testimony.rule c empowers a court to quash a subpoena if it is unreasonable or oppressive.presumably,the majority believes that a finding of fundamental unfairness is insufficient to satisfy this standard.in contrast,i fail to see a difference.a subpoena described as fundamentally unfair could just as easily be described as unreasonable and oppressive.therefore,i believe that the district court sufficiently invoked the authority of rule c.unlike the majority,i would not reverse based entirely upon an unimportant semantic distinction 
assuming the district court did act under rule c,we review its decision to quash a grand jury subpoena solely for abuse of discretion.we must uphold the district court decision unless it is clearly arbitrary or without support in the record.united states dent,cir there is nothing in the record to suggest that the district court decision to quash the government subpoena under these specific facts constituted an abuse of discretion.the court was concerned that enforcing the government subpoena would put attorneys in a very precarious position,subjecting them to grand jury subpoena any time they made representations pertaining to the existence of subpoenaed records.see app.at i guess the lawyer ca say a word to the attorney office about those things because he be subject to coming in to testify as to what his course of knowledge is.
this threat would certainly chill communication between attorney and client.both the government and the majority seem to believe,however,that the privilege is the only means by which a district court can protect that relationship.see majority opinion at t he proper course under.c was to rule on whether the lawyer testimony was protected under the privilege.appellant brief at the only proper substantive limitation on the grand jury ability to compel the attorney testimony is the privilege.i do not read a district court discretion so narrowly.american jurisprudence has long recognized the central importance of the relationship.the privilege is the most common means of protecting the relationship,but it is not the only one.in appropriate factual situations,such as the present case,a district court can,within its discretion,conclude that a subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive because it harms the relationship,even if the privilege does not apply.
a constant threat of subpoena would also affect the ability of lawyers to cooperate with the government.the government contends that t he duty to safeguard the healthy relationship between the criminal defense bar and the attorney office lies squarely with the parties to that relationship itself,not the district court.appellant brief at.it appears that the government misunde
