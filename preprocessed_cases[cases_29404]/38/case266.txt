on february,smith filed a claim for long term disability benefits under the erisa plan the plan that continental casualty administered for his employer smith claim was based on his degenerative disc disease and joint disease of the lumbar spine.
the plan provides for benefits for all officers,managers,and administrators.continental casualty concedes that smith is a covered person.under the plan,a covered person is disabled or has a disability,and thus,is entitled to benefits,if he meets the occupation qualifier or the earnings qualifier.at.the earnings qualifier is not at issue in this case.the occupation qualifier provides

continental casualty issued its first denial of smith claim on april.smith filed an administrative appeal,and after smith submitted additional information,continental casualty appeals committee remanded smith file to the claims unit for further review and investigation.on november,the claims unit once again denied smith claim.smith again appealed.on may,continental casualty issued its final denial of smith claim.in this denial,continental casualty stated that 
the information presented does show degenerative disc disease,bilateral laminectomies at and,spinal stenosis and subsequent failed back syndrome.from to,smith had underwent sic a total of three back surgeries as follows march,bilateral lumbar laminectomy september,through lumbar laminectomy with fusion and may,hemilaminectomy and forminotomy.
at.continental casualty also acknowledged that the medical review performed by soriano,who was hired by continental casualty,indicated that smith would need to avoid sitting or standing for prolonged periods of time over hours.at.after listing all of the medical evidence,however,continental casualty concluded that 
the physical findings show full muscle strength,no atrophy and no neurological deficits 
we can appreciate that smith may have some back pain and difficulties associated with his longstanding back pain history and surgeries,but the information presented does not support a functional loss that would preclude him from performing the full duties of his regular occupation as of february,the primary limiting factor affecting smith is his pain complaints,which are disproportionate when compared to the diagnostic and physical findings presented.
on september,smith filed a complaint in the united states district court for the district of maryland for wrongful denial of his claim for disability benefits.smith sought back benefits,plus interest,future benefits,reinstatement of his term life insurance,waiver of premium coverage,and reasonable attorneys fees.
both parties moved for summary judgment.the district court granted summary judgment in part for smith,awarding back benefits with interest,and future benefits.the district court decision relied heavily on its adoption of a social security ruling regarding subjective evidence of pain.given its ruling on the benefits issue,the district court remanded the waiver of premium issue to continental casualty.the district court also granted smith attorneys fee petition in total.this appeal followed.
