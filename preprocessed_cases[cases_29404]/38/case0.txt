the reimbursement amount health care providers receive for inpatient services rendered to medicare beneficiaries is adjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of patients.the adjustment amount is determined in part by the percentage of a hospital patients who are eligible for supplemental security income ssi,called the ssi fraction.each year,the centers for medicare medicaid services cms calculates the ssi fraction for an eligible hospital and submits that number to the hospital fiscal intermediary,a department of health and human services hhs contractor.the intermediary computes the reimbursement amount due and then sends the hospital a notice of program reimbursement npr.a provider dissatisfied with the determination has a right to appeal to the provider reimbursement review board prrb or board within days of receiving the npr.a.by regulation,the secretary of hhs authorized the prrb to extend the limit,for good cause,up to three years.see cfr b.
the baystate medical center not a party here timely appealed its ssi fraction calculation for each year from through.the prrb found that errors in cms methodology resulted in a systematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment and corresponding underpayments to providers.in march,the board baystate decision was made public.within days,respondent hospitals filed a complaint with the board,challenging their adjustments for through.acknowledging that their challenges were more than a decade out of time,they urged that equitable tolling of the limitations period was in order due to cms failure to tell them about the computation error.the prrb held that it lacked jurisdiction,reasoning that it had no equitable powers save those legislation or regulation might confer.on judicial review,the district court dismissed the hospitals claims.the circuit reversed.the presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling,the court concluded,applied to the time limit because nothing in a indicated that congress intended to disallow such tolling.
the limitation in a is not jurisdictional.

b amicus urges that a should be classified as a jurisdictional requirement based on its proximity to a and a,both jurisdictional requirements,amicus asserts.but a requirement that would otherwise be nonjurisdictional does not become jurisdictional simply because it is in a section of a statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions.gonzalez thaler.amicus also urges that the medicare act express grant of authority for the secretary to extend the time for beneficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for a provider appeals.in support,amicus relies on the general rule that congress use of certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another can indicate that different meanings were intended,sosa.but that interpretive guide,like other canons of construction,is no more than a rul e of thumb that can tip the scales when a statute could be read in multiple ways.connecticut nat.bank germain.here,a limitation is most sensibly characterized as nonjurisdictional.
the secretary regulation is a permissible interpretation of a.
a congress vested in the secretary large rulemaking authority to administer medicare.a court lacks authority to undermine the secretary regime unless her regulation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron natural resources defense council.here,the regulation survives inspection under that deferential standard.the secretary brought to bear practical experience in superintending the huge program generally,and the prrb in particular,in maintaining a outer limit for intermediary determination challenges.a court must uphold her judgment as long as it is a permissible construction of the statute,even if the court would have interpreted the statute differently absent agency regulation.
b a presumption of equitable tolling generally applies to suits against the united states,irwin department of veterans affairs,but application of this presumption is not in order for a.this court has never applied irwin presumption to an agency internal appeal deadline.the presumption was adopted in part on the premise that s uch a principle is likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent.irwin,at.that premise is inapt in the context of providers administrative appeals under the medicare act.for nearly years the secretary has prohibited the board from extending the deadline,except as provided by regulation.in the six times has been amended since,congress has left untouched the provision and the secretary rulemaking authority.furthermore,the statutory scheme,which applies to sophisticated institutional providers,is not designed to be unusually protective of claimants.bowen city of new york.nor is the scheme one in which laymen,unassisted by trained lawyers,initiate the process.zipes,at.

on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
justice ginsburg delivered the opinion of the court.
this case concerns the time within which health care providers may file an administrative appeal from the initial determination of the reimbursement due them for inpatient services rendered to medicare beneficiaries.government contractors,called fiscal intermediaries,receive cost reports annually from care providers and notify them of the reimbursement amount for which they qualify.a provider dissatisfied with the fiscal intermediary determination may appeal to an administrative body named the provider reimbursement review board prrb or board.the governing statute,h l d,stat,a,sets a limit for filing appeals from the fiscal intermediary to the prrb.by a regulation promulgated in,the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs authorized the board to extend the limitation,for good cause,up to three years 
the providers in this case are hospitals who appealed to the prrb more than ten years after expiration of the statutory deadline.they assert that the secretary failure to disclose information that made the fiscal intermediary reimbursement calculation incorrect prevented them from earlier appealing to the board.three positions have been briefed and argued regarding the time for providers appeals to the prrb.first,a amicus curiae has urged that the limitation is jurisdictional,and therefore can not be enlarged at all by agency or court.second,the government maintains that the secretary has the prerogative to set an outer limit of three years for appeals to the board.and third,the hospitals argue that the doctrine of equitable tolling applies,stopping the clock during the time the secretary concealed the information that made the fiscal intermediary reimbursement determinations incorrect.
we hold that the statutory limitation is not jurisdictional,and that the secretary reasonably construed the statute to permit a regulation extending the time for a provider appeal to the prrb to three years.we further hold that the presumption in favor of equitable tolling does not apply to administrative appeals of the kind here at issue.
the medicare program covers certain inpatient services that hospitals provide to medicare beneficiaries.providers are reimbursed at a fixed amount per patient,regardless of the actual operating costs they incur in rendering these services.but the total reimbursement amount is adjusted upward for hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of patients.this adjustment is made because hospitals with an unusually high percentage of patients generally have higher costs such hospitals,congress therefore found,should receive higher reimbursement rates.see,pt.the amount of the disproportionate share adjustment is determined in part by the percentage of the patients served by the hospital who are eligible for supplemental security income ssi payments,a percentage commonly called the ssi fraction.d ed.and supp.v.
at the end of each year,providers participating in medicare submit cost reports to contractors acting on behalf of hhs known as fiscal intermediaries.also at year end,the centers for medicare medicaid services cms calculates the ssi fraction for each eligible hospital and submits that number to the intermediary for that hospital.using these numbers to determine the total payment due,the intermediary issues a notice of program reimbursement npr informing the provider how much it will be paid for the year.
if a provider is dissatisfied with the intermediary reimbursement determination,the statute gives it the right to file a request for a hearing before the prrb within days of receiving the npr.a ed.in,the secretary promulgated a regulation,after notice and comment rulemaking,permitting the board to extend the time limit upon a showing of good cause the regulation further provides that no such extension shall be granted by the board if such request is filed more than years after the date the notice of the intermediary determination is mailed to the provider.fed.reg.codified in cfr b 
for many years,cms released only the results of its ssi fraction calculations and not the underlying data the baystate medical center a hospital not party to this case timely appealed the calculation of its ssi fraction for each year from through.eventually,the prrb determined that cms had omitted several categories of ssi data from its calculations and was using a flawed process to determine the number of beneficiaries treated by hospitals.these errors caused a systematic undercalculation of the disproportionate share adjustment,resulting in underpayments to the providers.baystate medical center leavitt,supp,dc see,at concluding that cms failed to use the best available data 
the methodological errors revealed by the board baystate decision would have yielded similarly reduced payments to all providers for which cms had calculated an ssi fraction.in march,the board decision in the baystate case was made public.within days,the hospitals in this case filed a complaint with the board seeking to challenge their disproportionate share adjustments for the years through.the hospitals acknowledged that their challenges,unlike baystate timely contest,were more than a decade out of time.but equitable tolling of the limitations period was in order,they urged,due to cms failure to inform the hospitals that their ssi fractions had been based on faulty data.
the prrb held that it lacked jurisdiction over the hospitals complaint,reasoning that it had no equitable powers save those legislation or regulation might confer,and that the secretary regulation permitted it to excuse late appeals only for good cause,with three years as the outer limit.on judicial review,the district court dismissed the hospitals claims for relief,holding that nothing in the statute suggests that congress intended to authorize equitable tolling.supp,dc.
the court of appeals reversed.cadc.it relied on the presumption that statutory limitations periods are generally subject to equitable tolling and reasoned that the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the united states.at quoting irwin department of veterans affairs.the presumption applies to the time limit for provider appeals from reimbursement determinations,the court of appeals held,finding nothing in the statutory provision for prrb review indicating that congress intended to disallow equitable tolling,at.
we granted the secretary petition for certiorari,to resolve a conflict among the courts of appeals over whether the time limit in a constricts the board jurisdiction.compare case below western medical enterprises,heckler,limit is not jurisdictional and the secretary may extend it for good cause,with alacare home health,sullivan,statute of limitations is jurisdictional and the secretary lacked authority to promulgate exception joseph hospital of kansas city heckler,same.beyond the jurisdictional inquiry the secretary asked us to determine whether the court of appeals erred in concluding that equitable tolling applies to providers medicare reimbursement appeals to the prrb,notwithstanding the secretary regulation barring such appeals after three years.
characterizing a rule as jurisdictional renders it unique in our adversarial system.objections to a tribunal jurisdiction can be raised at any time,even by a party that once conceded the tribunal jurisdiction over the controversy.tardy jurisdictional objections can therefore result in a waste of adjudicatory resources and can disturbingly disarm litigants.see henderson shinseki,slip,at arbaugh y h.with these untoward consequences in mind,we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of the term jurisdiction.henderson,at slip,at see also steel citizens for better environment,jurisdiction has been a word of many,too many,meanings internal quotation marks omitted.
to ward off profligate use of the term jurisdiction,we have adopted a readily administrable bright line for determining whether to classify a statutory limitation as jurisdictional.arbaugh,at.we inquire whether congress has clearly state d that the rule is jurisdictional absent such a clear statement,we have cautioned,courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional in character.at see also gonzalez thaler,slip,at henderson,at slip,at.this is not to say that congress must incant magic words in order to speak clearly.we consider context,including this court interpretations of similar provisions in many years past,as probative of whether congress intended a particular provision to rank as jurisdictional.reed elsevier,muchnick,see also john sand gravel united states.
we reiterate what it would mean were we to type the governing statute,a,jurisdictional.under no circumstance could providers engage prrb review more than days after notice of the fiscal intermediary final determination.not only could there be no equitable tolling.the secretary regulation providing for a extension,see supra,at,would fall as well.
the language congress used hardly reveals a design to preclude any regulatory extension.section a instructs that a provider of services may obtain a hearing by the board regarding its reimbursement amount if such provider files a request for a hearing within days after notice of the intermediary final determination.this provision does not speak in jurisdictional terms.zipes trans world airlines.indeed,it is less jurisdictional in tone than the provision we held to be nonjurisdictional in henderson.there,the statute provided that a veteran seeking veterans court review of the department of veterans affairs determination of disability benefits shall file a notice of appeal within days.at slip,at quoting a emphasis added.section a,by contrast,contains neither the mandatory word shall nor the appellation notice of appeal,words with jurisdictional import in the context of limitations on the time for appeal from a district court to a court of appeals.see bowles russell.
key to our decision,we have repeatedly held that filing deadlines ordinarily are not jurisdictional indeed,we have described them as quintessential rules.henderson,at slip,at see also scarborough principi,filing deadline for fee applications under equal access to justice act kontrick ryan,filing deadlines for objecting to debtor discharge in bankruptcy honda clark,filing deadline for claims under the trading with the enemy act.this case is scarcely the exceptional one in which a century worth of precedent and practice in american courts rank a time limit as jurisdictional.bowles,at,kontrick,at a time limitation may be emphatic,yet not jurisdictional.
amicus urges that the three requirements in a are specifications that together define the limits of the prrb jurisdiction.subsection a specifies the claims providers may bring to the board,and subsection a sets forth an requirement.these are jurisdictional requirements,amicus asserts,so we should read the third specification,subsection a limitation,as also setting a jurisdictional requirement.
last term,we rejected a similar argument.a requirement we would otherwise classify as nonjurisdictional,we held,does not become jurisdictional simply because it is placed in a section of a statute that also contains jurisdictional provisions.gonzalez,at slip,at see weinberger salfi,statutory provision at issue contained three requirements for judicial review,only one of which was jurisdictional.
amicus also argues that the time limit for provider appeals to the prrb should be viewed as jurisdictional because congress could have expressly made the provision nonjurisdictional,and indeed did so for other time limits in the medicare act.amicus notes particularly that when medicare beneficiaries request the secretary to reconsider a benefits determination,the statute gives them a time limit of days or such additional time as the secretary may allow.b d i see also b d ii permitting medicare beneficiary to request a hearing by the secretary within time limits the secretary shall establish in regulations we have recognized,as a general rule,that congress use of certain language in one part of the statute and different language in another can indicate that different meanings were intended.sosa,internal quotation marks omitted.amicus notes this general rule in urging that an express grant of authority for the secretary to extend the time for beneficiary appeals implies the absence of such leeway for provider appeals.
but the interpretive guide just identified,like other canons of construction,is no more than a rul e of thumb that can tip the scales when a statute could be read in multiple ways.connecticut nat.bank germain.for the reasons earlier stated,see supra,at,we are persuaded that the time limitation in a is most sensibly characterized as a nonjurisdictional prescription.the limitation therefore does not bar the modest extension contained in the secretary regulation.
we turn now to the question whether a time limit for a provider to appeal to the prrb is subject to equitable tolling.
congress vested in the secretary large rulemaking authority to administer the medicare program.the prrb may adopt rules and procedures only if not inconsistent with the medicare act or regulations of the secretary.e.concerning the period for an appeal to the board from an intermediary reimbursement determination,the secretary regulation implementing,adopted after notice and comment,speaks in no uncertain terms 
a request for a board hearing filed after the time limit shall be dismissed by the board,except that for good cause shown,the time limit may be extended.however,no such extension shall be granted by the board if such request is filed more than years after the date the notice of the intermediary determination is mailed to the provider.cfr b.
the secretary allowed only a distinctly limited extension of time to appeal to the prrb,cognizant that the board is burdened by an immense caseload,and that procedural rules requiring timely filings are indispensable devices for keeping the machinery of the reimbursement appeals process running smoothly.high country home health,thompson.imposing equitable tolling to permit appeals barred by the secretary regulation would essentially gut the secretary requirement that an appeal to the board shall be dismissed if filed more than days after the npr,unless the provider shows good cause and requests an extension no later than three years after the npr.a court lacks authority to undermine the regime established by the secretary unless her regulation is arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute.chevron natural resources defense council.
the secretary regulation,we are satisfied,survives inspection under that deferential standard.as hhs has explained,i t is in the interest of providers and the program that,at some point,intermediary determinations and the resulting amount of program payment due the provider or the program become no longer open to correction.cms,medicare provider reimbursement manual,pt,ch,taylor freeland kronz,deadlines may lead to unwelcome results,but they prompt parties to act and produce finality.the secretary brought to bear practical experience in superintending the huge program generally,and the prrb in particular,in maintaining three years as the outer limit.a court must uphold the secretary judgment as long as it is a permissible construction of the statute,even if it differs from how the court would have interpreted the statute in the absence of an agency regulation.national cable telecommunications brand x internet services,see also chevron,at.
rejecting the secretary position,the court of appeals relied principally on this court decision in irwin,at.irwin concerned the then time period for filing suit against a federal agency under title vii of the civil rights act of,c ed.we held in irwin that the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling applicable to suits against private defendants should also apply to suits against the united states.at.irwin itself,and cases we have considered both pre and,have generally involved time limits for filing suit in federal court.see,holland florida,limitation for filing application for writ of habeas corpus rotella wood,period for filing civil rico suit united states beggerly,period to bring suit under quiet title act lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,one and periods for commencing civil action under b of the securities exchange act of honda clark,period for filing suit under trading with the enemy act kendall united states,period for filing suit in court of claims.courts in those cases rendered in the first instance the decision whether equity required tolling.
this case is of a different order.we have never applied the irwin presumption to an agency internal appeal deadline,here the time a provider has to appeal an intermediary reimbursement determination to the prrb.united states brockamp,assuming,arguendo,that irwin presumption applied to time limit for filing an administrative claim for a tax refund,but concluding based on statutory text,structure,and purpose that there was good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply 
the presumption of equitable tolling was adopted in part on the pre
