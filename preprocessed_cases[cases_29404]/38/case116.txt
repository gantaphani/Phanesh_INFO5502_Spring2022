background 
delnegro application for disability benefits under the social security act the act was denied on july.she thereafter retained binder to pursue her claim.on august,delnegro executed and submitted to the ssa i a social security retainer agreement and ii an appointment of representative.also on august,delnegro and binder executed an expedited fee agreement in accordance with the agreement.that agreement provided 
the claimant and the firm of binder and binder agree that if claimant receives a fully or partially favorable decision,the legal fee owed by the claimant is equal to the lesser of of the benefits or.under social security regulations,benefits is the total amount of retroactive money to which the claimant and all family members become entitled this fee agreement is only valid if a fully or partially favorable decision is rendered prior to oral testimony being taken at an administrative hearing before an administrative law judge.
by a request for reconsideration submitted by binder on september,binder requested that the ssa reconsider its july,denial of delnegro application for ssa disability benefits.the ssa responded by notice of reconsideration,dated september,and granted delnegro request for reconsideration but then adhered to its july,determination denying delnegro application.by letter dated november,delnegro discharged binder and advised that she had retained joseph puzzarella puzzarella to represent her in her continued efforts to obtain social security disability benefits.she also advised the ssa of the change in representation,and puzzarella provided the ssa with a copy of the retainer agreement that he and delnegro had executed.
by letter dated december,binder notified both the ssa and delnegro of its intent to petition the ssa for its legal fees in the event that delnegro application for benefits were granted.binder also requested that the ssa notify it in the event that the benefits were awarded.
puzzarella efforts on behalf of delnegro eventually proved successful.the ssa,by notice dated february,advised delnegro that it had awarded the social security disability benefits.the ssa also approved delnegro fee agreement with puzzarella as to form.by letter to the ssa dated march,puzzarella submitted a petition for attorneys fees in the amount of.he also enclosed a copy of an undated letter from delnegro,in which she objected to any payment of fees to binder because of her dissatisfaction with binder services.
the ssa notified binder,by letter dated april,that delnegro had been awarded ssa disability benefits.enclosed with the letter was a copy of the notice of award sent to puzzarella and delnegro.pursuant to a,if the ssa determines that the claimant is entitled to benefits,and the claimant is represented by an attorney,the ssa shall certify for payment out of such benefits as determined before any applicable reduction to such attorney an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as does not exceed percent of such benefits.accordingly,the notice sent to puzzarella and delnegro stated that because delnegro was represented by an attorney,the ssa had retained or of the benefits owed to delnegro to pay for legal fees in the event that her attorney s claimed legal fees up to the statutory maximum.
informed of delnegro award,binder submitted a petition dated july,to the ssa requesting that the ssa approve attorneys fees in the amount of for services provided to delnegro.binder petition was supported by a contemporaneous time account,which detailed hours of work expended on delnegro behalf to obtain benefits.
on september,both delnegro and her husband filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the bankruptcy laws in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey.delnegro listed binder fee of on schedule f of her bankruptcy petition as an unsecured,nonpriority claim that she disputed.on january,the bankruptcy court granted delnegro a discharge pursuant to.
after the bankruptcy court granted a discharge in bankruptcy to delnegro,the ssa provided notice to both binder and delnegro,by letter dated january,that it had approved binder petition for attorneys fees in the amount that binder had claimed.the ssa advised both binder and delnegro that they could contest the fee amount within thirty days.
by letter to the ssa,dated january,delnegro objected to the award of attorneys fees in any amount to binder and reiterated her dissatisfaction with binder services.she also advised the ssa that she had previously filed a petition seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code and had listed binder claim for fees as an unsecured,nonpriority claim that she disputed.delnegro further advised the ssa that on january,she had received a discharge from the bankruptcy court relieving her of her personal debts.
administrative law judge stephen wright the alj of the ssa office of hearings and appeals region ii then notified binder,by letter dated february,that delnegro had objected to binder fee of and that binder fees would be reviewed.the february letter from the alj included a copy of delnegro january,letter in which delnegro set forth her objections to binder petition for attorneys fees.after receiving notice of delnegro objection from the alj,binder responded to the alj,by letter dated february,stating that the in fees was reasonable based on hours of work and that the fee should be paid.
despite delnegro objection and the fee dispute,binder received its fee of from the ssa on march.then,on march,the ssa demanded that binder relinquish and return the to delnegro.in making this demand,the ssa explained that since delnegro had filed for bankruptcy protection,and had received a discharge,the had been paid to binder by the ssa in error.
on april,the ssa sent binder an order vacating authorization to charge and collect fee.the ssa based the decision giving rise to this order on a document designated program circular oco the program circular and entitled bankruptcy and attorneys fees,dated march.it provides that where a bankruptcy court discharges all of a claimant debts,including the representative fee,no fee may be authorized or paid by the ssa.the program circular is an internal document of the ssa that was prepared by a former reconsideration reviewer for use in the training material.the program circular includes the following language 
section of the social security act provides that the administration must approve the amount of the fee a representative may charge for services before the administration.if the representative is an attorney in good standing admitted to the state,federal,or supreme court bar,up to percent of benefits on a claim must be withheld for direct payment of the attorney fee.
however,if the claimant files for bankruptcy and lists the representative as an unsecured debtor sic,no action may be taken to authorize a fee until the bankruptcy is completed.if the bankruptcy court discharges all of the claimant debts,including any fee for the representative,we can not authorize or pay any fee to the representative.any withheld benefits must be released to a claimant.
if the representative attorney provides a copy of an order of the bankruptcy court excluding from the bankruptcy petition,we can proceed in the usual manner.
refusing to relinquish its fee,binder filed a complaint on may,in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york,seeking a declaratory judgment that it is entitled to retain the statutory fees that it had received from the ssa.in its complaint,binder presented five claims,asserting i that the ssa violated binder due process rights by unilaterally vacating the fee award without proper notice to binder and an opportunity to be heard ii that binder possessed an attorneys charging lien in accordance with new york judiciary law and that the charging lien survived the bankruptcy discharge order iii that the legal fees earned in this case derived from exempt assets in wit,the disability,thus,because the bankruptcy trustee never avoided binder interest in those assets or attempted to recover monies paid to binder by the ssa,the ssa impermissibly expunge d binder attorneys lien and require d the turnover of said duly paid attorneys fees iv that it did not receive notification of the commencement of delnegro bankruptcy case,nor did it have actual knowledge of the commencement of the bankruptcy action,and,therefore,that delnegro debt to binder was not discharged and v that even if delnegro liability for the attorneys fees was discharged in bankruptcy,the ssa remained liable for the distribution of those previously awarded fees notwithstanding the issuance of the discharge order.ssa filed its answer on august.
by notice dated august,binder moved for summary judgment in the district court.binder argued that the ssa was obligated to pay its attorneys fees because i the withheld fees were subject to binder attorneys charging lien,created under state law,and that the charging lien was and had survived delnegro bankruptcy discharge and ii the program circular violated binder due process rights because it notice or a the attorneys charging lien and the ssa statutory obligation,pursuant to a,to withhold up to of benefits for payment of legal fees.
by notice of dated october,and ssa rule statement of undisputed facts,with accompanying exhibits,the ssa for summary judgment,arguing that sovereign immunity and the provision of a each compelled a finding that delnegro social security benefits were unaffected by binder alleged charging lien.further,the ssa argued that the ssa is not obligated to pay attorneys fees where the underlying obligation has been discharged in bankruptcy.similarly,the ssa claimed that it had not deprived binder of any property rights that binder might have in delnegro benefits because any of delnegro debts to binder were discharged.moreover,notwithstanding the bankruptcy discharge,the ssa posited that binder never possessed a viable charging lien under state law that could properly attach to delnegro awarded benefits.on december,the district court denied binder motion,as well as the ssa,pending a determination by the bankruptcy court as to whether delnegro discharge extinguished binder claim for fees payable from delnegro benefits.
on december,binder filed a complaint in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey seeking a declaration that delnegro discharge did not extinguish binder claim for attorneys fees from delnegro benefits because it had received no notice of the original bankruptcy proceeding.both parties submitted motions for summary judgment.in three separate orders,the bankruptcy court lyons,i dismissed binder motion for the entry of a default judgment for delnegro failure to appear ii dismissed ssa for summary judgment and iii ordered the adversary proceeding closed.the bankruptcy court orders supported the position held by delnegro and the ssa that the bankruptcy discharge had extinguished all of delnegro personal debts,including the attorneys fees owed to binder.we interpreted the bankruptcy court orders to require binder to establish his charging lien in state court.we opined that,under the bankruptcy code,such a lien would survive the discharge.see binder binder,barnhart,cir citing c hereinafter binder i.
after the bankruptcy court issued its orders,the parties resubmitted their motions for summary judgment to the district court.by memorandum and order dated august,the district court denied binder motion for summary judgment,granted ssa motion for summary judgment,and dismissed binder complaint.see binder binder,barnhart,d.the district court determined that section of the act is broadly phrased and announces a legislative objective that the flow of social security funds is not subject to attachment by creditors and thus concluded that binder attorneys charging lien could not attach to delnegro disability benefits.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.by timely notice of appeal,dated september,binder appealed to this court from that judgment of the district court.
in an opinion of this court dated february,we vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the case to the district court for it to determine in the first instance whether it had subject matter jurisdiction with respect to binder claims.binder i,at.in binder i,we began our analysis of subject matter jurisdiction with a characterization of binder claims.we found that binder had raised essentially two claims one under the due process clause of the constitution,and the other under the social security act.id.at.as to due process,binder alleged that it was denied notice and an opportunity to be heard in the bankruptcy court prior to delnegro discharge.with respect to binder statutory claim under the social security act,binder claimed,notwithstanding questions about the validity of the discharge of the claim,that the social security act created a vested property right in the attorneys fees earned,in the form of an attorney charging lien,pursuant to a of the act.id.accordingly,binder asserted federal question jurisdiction as well as judicial review jurisdiction under the social security act for the claims that he raised.
we noted that there were serious questions about whether binder claims arose under the judicial review provisions of the social security act.id.at.in our review,however,we discussed three possible sources of jurisdiction over this case 
the most obvious source of jurisdiction over social security claims is section g of the act,which provides in pertinent part that a ny individual,after any final decision of the commissioner of social security made after a hearing to which he was a party may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action brought in federal district court.g.but section g is seemingly inapplicable to binder suit because that section limits judicial review to those decisions involving a party.
binder i,at omission in original.we then noted that a second possible source of jurisdiction rested with federal question jurisdiction pursuant to 
typically,all cases arising under the social security act are channeled through the appropriate administrative fora before they reach federal
