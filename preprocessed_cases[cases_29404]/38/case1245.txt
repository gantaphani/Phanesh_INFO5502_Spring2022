robert prinkey appeals from the final decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court affirming the decision of the board of veterans appeals bva sustaining the severance of service connection for diabetes mellitus type ii and related disabilities and denying entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability.prinkey shinseki,wl.for the reasons stated below,we hold that a central contention he makes is outside our statutory jurisdiction,and we otherwise affirm.
the law permits severance of service connection for previously awarded disability benefits,reversing an earlier finding that a particular disability was connected to military service and cutting off benefits that had been awarded based on that finding.in particular,d provides that service connection will be severed only where evidence establishes that it is clearly and unmistakably erroneous the burden of proof being upon the veterans administration.
the language of d is written in the present tense,asking not whether the original decision of service connection was correct at the time it was made,but whether the original decision is clearly erroneous.as the veterans court has observed,in meeting its burden of proof under d,the veterans administration va may consider medical evidence and diagnoses that postdate the original award of service connection.see stallworth nicholson.where the va demonstrates,based on all the relevant evidence,that an original award of service connection is clearly and unmistakably erroneous,service connection may be severed.the severance of service connection means that all previous benefits resulting from the original service connection decision are terminated.
in order for error to be clear and unmistakable,it must be outcome determinative,one whose avoidance would have manifestly changed the outcome of a prior decision.cook principi,en banc see also bustos west.
prinkey served in the united states army from to,including time in vietnam.he was diagnosed with diabetes in.certain diseases,including diabetes mellitus type ii,are presumed to be service connected if the veteran was exposed to agent orange during service.see a h.on april,the va received prinkey original disability claim for benefits on account of his diabetes and related conditions,asserting exposure to agent orange and presumptive service connection.in june of,the va provided prinkey with a medical evaluation to assist him in developing his claim.the medical examination concluded that prinkey has diabetes mellitus which can be related to the agent orange exposure.soon thereafter,on july,the va regional office ro in huntington,west virginia issued a rating decision granting service connection to prinkey for his diabetes mellitus claimed as secondary to agent orange exposure evaluated at,as well as lesser rated service connection for other disabilities secondary to the service connected diabetes.
prinkey sought to reopen his claim on august.a further medical examination was performed on january,at which time the medical examiner observed that there was no prinkey full claims file to review.following the january medical examination,the ro in cleveland,ohio issued another rating decision on february.that rating decision retained prinkey rating for diabetes but increased certain of his disabilities secondary to the diabetes.the ro adjudicator deferred prinkey claim to entitlement for individual unemployability pending a medical opinion on that subject.the ro ordered that prinkey full claims file be sent to the medical examiners a nurse practitioner and an endocrinologist who had performed the january examination.
with regard to the issue of prinkey employability,on march,the nurse practitioner concluded,apparently on the basis of her january,examination,that prinkey employability was severely impaired by his diabetes.thereafter the nurse practitioner reviewed prinkey full claims file and discovered information that had not previously been available to medical evaluators.the nurse practitioner subsequent evaluation on april,stated 
patient has a history of pancreatectomy which more likely than not resulted in the pancreancreatic sic insufficiency and inadequate insulin secretion which caused the patient diabetes.the cause for his pancreatectomy may have been a tumor,or per his,a note by he has had a multitude of medical problems especially since and had surgery to remove most of his pancreas,gall bladder and stomach because of what he was told was his history of drinking despite his reported having quit in.the date of the pancreatectomy was approximately and patient reports diabetes diagnosed in.has varying dates from,and.therefore,it is more likely than not that the diabetes mellitus type ii,on insulin resulted from the pancreatectomy.
the nurse practitioner concluded that prinkey diabetes more likely than not resulted from the surgery that removed most of his pancreas,not from his exposure to agent orange.her evaluation was further reviewed the same day by the endocrinologist,whose evaluation,as contained in an addendum to the nurse practitioner report,stated 
review of records indicate sic that the veteran does not have diabetes mellitus type ii.the veteran has diabetes secondary to pancreatectomy for chronic alcohol abuse.he has minimal beta cell function,as indicated by his c peptide level of,barely detectable.it is as likely as not that his remaining pancreatic function will continue to decrease with time,leaving him entirely insulin dependent.his pancreatic failure and pancreatic resection have nothing to do with agent orange exposure.
whereas the nurse practitioner evaluation was that prinkey diabetes was more likely than not caused by the removal of most of his pancreas,not his exposure to agent orange,the endocrinologist opinion left no room for doubt his diabetes resulted from his pancreatectomy for chronic alcohol abuse and had no association with his possible exposure to agent orange.
on the basis of the april,evaluations,the cleveland ro entered a further rating decision,dated july,and conveyed by letter dated july,to prinkey.the letter stated that w e have reviewed medical records concerning your condition s and noted new evidence reference sic the origins of your diabetes mellitus type dmii.we propose to sever your service connection.the rating decision explained that the adjudicator had reviewed prinkey medical records,which showed his pancreatectomy in and his diagnosis of diabetes in.the rating decision accepted the opinion of the endocrinologist that his pancreatectomy was secondary to his history of alcohol abuse,and had noted prinkey minimal beta cell function.the rating decision accepted the endocrinologist opinion that prinkey pancreatic failure and resection had nothing to do with his possible agent orange exposure.the rating decision thus removed service connection as the explanation for prinkey diabetes,his injuries and his claim to individual unemployability due to his diabetes and related injuries.
the july letter afforded prinkey sixty days in which to respond with new relevant evidence.when he did not respond in the stated time,the cleveland ro informed prinkey by letter on september,that it was acting on the rating decision of proposed severance of service connection for diabetes and related injuries because our records show that your diabetes mellitus was not caused by exposure to agent orange.consequently,all of prinkey ratings dependent on diabetes resulting from exposure to agent orange were severed effective december.prinkey timely filed a notice of disagreement nod with the rating decision severing his service connections,thus indicating his desire to appeal the adverse rating to the bva.
the cleveland ro prepared a statement of the case soc,a document that explains in detail the basis and rationale for the adverse rating decision.the soc explained that service connection 
can be severed only on the basis of clear and unmistakable error.in this case it was determined that there was clear and unmistakable evidence that the veteran diabetes was not due to the presumption of relationship to herbicides b
