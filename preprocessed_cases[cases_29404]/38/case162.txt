this case involves the interaction between state and federal law under the medicaid system,a cooperative program between the state and federal governments to provide medical assistance to those with limited financial resources.seeking to stamp out abusive manipulation of trusts to hide assets and thereby manufacture medicaid eligibility,congress created a comprehensive system of rules mandating that trusts be counted as assets.but congress also exempted from these rules certain trusts intended to provide disabled individuals with necessities and comforts not covered by medicaid.seeking to ensure that these trusts were not abused,pennsylvania enacted section of pennsylvania act of,codified at.stat.ann.section,to regulate these special needs trusts.
plaintiffs brought a putative class action in the eastern district of pennsylvania challenging section validity.plaintiffs allege section is preempted by the federal statute governing medicaid eligibility,d.they seek injunctive and declaratory relief barring its enforcement.the district court granted that relief,holding all but one of the challenged provisions of section preempted.in reaching that holding,the district court concluded that plaintiffs case was justiciable and that plaintiffs had a private right of action under both section and the supremacy clause.the district court also held that section was severable,certified a class of plaintiffs,and appointed class counsel.
this appeal followed.the parties do not challenge the district court decision to uphold the remaining provision of section or the district court decisions on severability,certification,and appointment of class counsel.we conclude that plaintiffs case is justiciable and that they have a private right of action under both section and the supremacy clause of the constitution.on the merits of plaintiffs challenge,we conclude that the district court was correct in its determination that section repayment provision,special needs provision,expenditure provision,and age restriction are all preempted by federal law.however,we conclude that the enforcement provision of section when used to enforce provisions not otherwise preempted by federal law is a reasonable exercise of the commonwealth retained authority to regulate trusts.we will affirm in part and reverse in part.
medicaid is a joint program providing medical assistance to the needy enacted under congress spending clause authority,medicaid is voluntary.no state is obligated to join medicaid,but if they do join,they are subject to federal regulations governing its administration.see roloff sullivan,cir.pennsylvania has elected to participate in medicaid.
generally,medicaid provides assistance for two types of individuals the categorically needy and the medically needy.the categorically needy are those who qualify for public assistance under the supplemental security income ssi program or other federal programs.see roach morse,cir sotomayor,roloff,at.the medically needy are those who would qualify as categorically needy because they are disabled,but whose income assets are substantial enough to disqualify them.roloff,at every state participating in medicaid must provide assistance to the categorically needy.states need not provide assistance to the medically needy.see id.if states choose to make medical assistance available to the medically needy,they are subject to various statutory restrictions in determining to whom medical assistance should be extended.
congress has created a comprehensive system of rules for determining who qualifies for medicaid.under medicaid original rules,individuals could put large sums of money in trust,thereby vesting legal title to those assets in the trust and reducing on paper the amount of assets owned by the individual.
a trust is a legal instrument in which assets are held in the name of the trust and managed by a trustee for the benefit of a beneficiary.black law dictionary ed.definition of trust.this structure means that the beneficiary does not actually own the assets of the trust,but instead has an equitable right to derive benefits from them.the benefits vary according to the terms of the trust.the trust has long been a tool for evading the rigid strictures of the law,which has generally been a positive development.for example,in feudal england the trust birthplace the trust allowed younger sons and daughters to inherit land despite strict rules at law against devising land by will.see joseph rosenberg,supplemental needs trusts for people with disabilities the development of a private trust in the public interest,pub.int,citing austin wakeman scott,abridgment of the law of trusts.and the trust unique structure makes it useful for countless salutary purposes in modern society.
but this same bifurcated ownership structure has been used to manufacture eligibility for government welfare programs like medicaid.as with many government programs,eligibility for medicaid is partially dependent on the claimant income and assets.wealthy individuals are expected to exhaust their own resources before turning to the public for assistance.but trusts can enable these same individuals to technically own nothing at all,even though they may have access to substantial wealth.such claimants may then qualify for medicaid.see johnson guhl,cir because medicaid is available to the needy,creative lawyers and financial planners have devised various ways to shield wealthier claimants assets in determining medicaid eligibility.individuals have gained access to healthcare while retaining the benefit of their wealth and the ability to pass that wealth to their heirs.
congress understandably viewed this as an abuse and began addressing the problem with statutory standards enacted in.see consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of,pub,a,stat.these standards were repealed and replaced in by the current rules.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,pub,title xiii d c,stat,obra.those rules are at issue in this case.
in the obra amendments,congress established a general rule that trusts would be counted as assets for the purpose of determining medicaid eligibility.but congress also excepted from that rule three types of trusts meeting certain specific requirements.taken together,these are generally called special needs trusts or supplemental needs trusts.a supplemental needs trust is a discretionary trust established for the benefit of a person with a severe and chronic or persistent disability and is intended to provide for expenses that assistance programs such as medicaid do not cover.sullivan cnty.of suffolk,cir internal quotation marks omitted.these expenses books,television,internet,travel,and even such necessities as clothing and toiletries would rarely be considered extravagant.
one type of special needs trust the one at issue in this case is the pooled special needs trust.a pooled trust is a special arrangement with a organization that serves as trustee to manage assets belonging to many disabled individuals,with investments being pooled,but with separate trust accounts being maintained for each disabled individual.jan myskowski,special needs trusts in the era of the uniform trust code,bar,spring,at.the pooled special needs trust was intended for individuals with a relatively small amount of money.by pooling these small accounts for investment and management purposes,overhead and expenses are reduced and more money is available to the beneficiary.
the medicaid statute says the following regarding pooled trusts 
this subsection the rules counting trusts as available assets for purposes of medicaid eligibility shall not apply to any of the following trusts 
c a trust containing the assets of an individual who is disabled as defined in section a of this title that meets the following conditions 
i the trust is established and managed by a association.
ii a separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust,but,for purposes of investment and management of funds,the trust pools these accounts.
iii accounts in the trust are established solely for the benefit of individuals who are disabled as defined in section a of this title by the parent,grandparent,or legal guardian of such individuals,by such individuals,or by a court.
iv to the extent that amounts remaining in the beneficiary account upon the death of the beneficiary are not retained by the trust,the trust pays to the state from such remaining amounts in the account an amount equal to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary under the state plan under this subchapter.
in,pennsylvania sought to regulate pooled trusts and special needs trusts more generally by passing section,which states 
section.special needs trusts.
a a special needs trust must be approved by a court of competent jurisdiction if required by rules of court.
b a special needs trust shall comply with all of the following 
the beneficiary shall be an individual under the age of who is disabled,as that term is defined in title xvi of the social security act stat,et.
the beneficiary shall have special needs that will not be met without the trust.
the trust shall provide 
i that all distributions from the trust must be for the sole benefit of the beneficiary.
ii that any expenditure from the trust must have a reasonable relationship to the needs of the beneficiary.
iii that,upon the death of the beneficiary or upon the earlier termination of the trust,the department and any other state that provided medical assistance to the beneficiary must be reimbursed from the funds remaining in the trust up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary before any other claimant is paid provided,however,that in the case of an account in a pooled trust,the trust shall provide that no more than fifty percent of the amount remaining in the beneficiary pooled trust account may be retained by the trust without any obligation to reimburse the department.
c if at any time it appears that any of the requirements of subsection b are not satisfied or the trustee refuses without good cause to make payments from the trust for the special needs of the beneficiary and,provided that the department or any other public agency in this commonwealth has a claim against trust property,the department or other public agency may petition the court for an order terminating the trust.
f as used in this section,the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings 
special needs means those items,products or services not covered by the medical assistance program,insurance or other liability source for which a beneficiary of a special needs trust or his parents are personally liable and that can be provided to the beneficiary to increase the beneficiary quality of life and to assist in and are related to the treatment of the beneficiary disability.the term may include medical expenses,dental expenses,nursing and custodial care,services,recreational therapy,occupational therapy,physical therapy,vocational therapy,durable medical needs,prosthetic devices,special rehabilitative services or equipment,training,education,transportation and travel expenses,dietary needs and supplements,related insurance and other goods and services specified by the department.
plaintiffs challenge section as preempted by the medicaid statute.stripped down to its essentials,their argument is that the requirements for a pooled special needs trust are set forth at d,that those are the only requirements,and that section attempt to graft additional requirements onto pooled special needs trusts is not permissible.the district court agreed.for the most part,we agree as well.we part company with the district court only insofar as we believe it gave insufficient weight to pennsylvania retained authority to regulate trusts.
there are two types of named plaintiffs in this proposed class action the individual plaintiffs and the trust plaintiffs the individual plaintiffs are zackery lewis,richard young,lynn hainer,susan coleman,kathy burger,tracy palmer,kenny atkinson,bernice tate,mary wagner,michael bidzilya,william algar,and anthony gale.with the exception of lynn hainer,all the individual plaintiffs are domiciled in the state of pennsylvania,are disabled,and have received medical assistance under medicaid lynn hainer brings suit as administratrix for the estate of her deceased niece addie smith.at the time of her death,addie was domiciled in pennsylvania,disabled,and receiving medical assistance through medicaid.the individual plaintiffs all have accounts in pooled trusts,with balances ranging from richard young to million zackery lewis in general,the individual plaintiffs balances are quite low,usually a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.the individual plaintiffs use or intend to use the balances in their accounts for a variety of purposes,including personal items,furnishings,therapy sessions,cell phone and cable service,and travel expenses.with the exception of michael bidzilya and william algar,who at the time of filing were years old and years old respectively,all the individual plaintiffs are under the age of.at the time of her death,addie smith was years old.
the trust plaintiffs are arc ct arc and the family trust.arc is a charitable organization managing trust accounts,with approximately million in funds under management.it currently manages approximately pooled trust accounts.it has managed approximately pooled trust accounts since its inception.all its trust beneficiaries are disabled,individuals.it does not open pooled trust accounts for beneficiaries over the age of.
disabled individuals seeking to establish an account in arc pooled trust sign an agreement providing that the trustee has sole discretion in disbursing funds and will do so for the beneficiary supplemental and life enhancing needs and care.the agreement further provides that the trustee may interpret liberally the term supplemental needs but all distributions shall be made solely for the benefit of the disabled beneficiary.arc has not approved the use of trust funds for luxury items and pennsylvania has never informed arc that any of its expenditures are unallowable.
prior to enactment of section,arc agreements provided that all funds in trust would be retained by arc upon the death of the beneficiary and would be used for the benefit of other beneficiaries.in,the social security administration and the pennsylvania department of public welfare dpw informed arc that its trust documents met the requirements of d c.following the enactment of section,dpw informed arc that its trust agreements did not comply with the new pennsylvania statute.in response,arc amended its trust agreements to provide that funds would be retained to the maximum extent allowed by law.since enactment of section,arc has retained the funds in the accounts of several deceased beneficiaries and paid some of those funds out for the benefit of other beneficiaries.in,pennsylvania sought a portion of the funds retained by arc following the death of thomas johnstone,but it has since withdrawn that request.
the family trust is a charitable organization managing trust accounts,with approximately million in funds under management.it currently manages approximately pooled trust accounts.it has managed approximately pooled trust accounts since its inception.unlike arc,the family trust does open pooled trust accounts for beneficiaries over the age of,with fourteen individuals permitted to do so since the enactment of section.all of the family trust beneficiaries are disabled,individuals.
disabled individuals seeking to establish an account in the pooled trust sign an agreement providing that the trustee has sole discretion in disbursing funds and will do so for the beneficiary extra and supplemental care.when the family trust inquired whether it was permitted to use funds in a beneficiary account to pay for her funeral expenses,it was informed that it was not permitted to do so.
the family trust agreements provide that all funds in trust are retained by the family trust upon the death of the beneficiary and used to provide support for individuals with disabilities to live safe,meaningful and productive lives.the family trust has used retained funds for general charitable purposes,not solely for other beneficiaries of its trust accounts.in,dpw informed the family trust that its trust documents met the requirements of d c 
gary alexander is the secretary of the pennsylvania department of public welfare.the dpw is charged with administration of the state medicaid program.it is also responsible for reviewing special needs trusts and for promulgating regulations or statements of policy to implement section.stat.ann.b.the dpw operates county assistance offices throughout the commonwealth to serve the citizens of pennsylvania.eric rollins is the executive director of the erie county assistance office.both alexander and rollins are defendants in this suit,having been sued in their official capacities.
following the enactment of section,dpw sought to terminate the medical assistance of mary wagner by asserting that assets she had transferred to the trust could not be exempted because the family trust trust agreements did not comply with section.in addition,dpw has objected to kenny atkinson and bernice tate participation in the family trust based upon the family trust failure to conform its agreements to section.dpw has not otherwise challenged the medical assistance eligibility of any individuals,terminated the medical assistance of any beneficiary,or attempted to block disbursements for failure to conform to section.but dpw stipulates that should it prevail in this litigation,it will enforce all provisions of section.also,dpw has directed all pooled trusts in pennsylvania to amend their master trust agreements and joinder agreements to conform to the requirements of section.
dpw has not promulgated official regulations or issued formal guidance regarding its interpretation of section.but it did create and circulate a document on special needs trusts to dpw attorneys and county assistance offices.
plaintiffs brought a putative class action in the eastern district of pennsylvania before judge jan dubois,challenging the validity of section and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief barring its enforcement.the original defendants included a host of state officials including the governor of pennsylvania,attorney general of pennsylvania,and others purportedly charged with enforcing section.by opinion dated august,the district court dismissed the claims against all individuals except the secretary of the pennsylvania department of public welfare and the executive director of the erie county assistance office.it concluded that the complaint adequately alleged that these two individuals had actually attempted to enforce section.in the same opinion,the district court dismissed substantive and procedural due process claims made by the plaintiffs none of these decisions appears to be challenged,except insofar as defendants continue to challenge the justiciability of plaintiffs claims.
after discovery and submission of stipulated facts,for summary judgment were filed by the parties.in a thorough and opinion,the district court granted plaintiffs motion for summary judgment almost in its entirety,holding that all but one of the challenged provisions of section are preempted by federal law however,the district court concluded that the offending provisions could be severed from the remainder of the law,and thus did not strike down section in its entirety.the district court also certified a b class action and appointed class counsel.
on appeal,defendants challenge the justiciability of plaintiffs claims,their ability to bring a private right of action,and the district court judgment that section is preempted by federal law.
constitutional standing is an essential and unchanging part of the requirement of article iii.lujan defenders of wildlife,d.reduced to its constitutional minimum,standing requires three elements an injury in fact consisting of an actual or imminent invasion of a legally protected interest a causal connection between the injury in fact and the defendants conduct and a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.see id.at.the party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.id.at.
defendants only challenge is to whether plaintiffs have an injury in fact defendants note several provisions of the law that they have allegedly never attempted to enforce.they particularly rely on arguments that they have never challenged trust disbursements under the expenditure provision of section b ii any expenditure from the trust must have a reasonable relationship to the needs of the beneficiary and they have never denied eligibility to form or maintain a trust based on the special needs provision of section b the beneficiary shall have special needs that will not be met without the trust.appellants principal br.at.
because the provisions of section are severable we must analyze each provision independently for the purposes of determining whether the plaintiffs have standing to challenge that particular provision.see contractors ass of,city of,cir.but should we conclude that even one of the plaintiffs has an injury regarding a specific provision of section,we need not examine the effect of that provision on the other plaintiffs.see montalvo huertas rivera cruz,cir where coplaintiffs have a shared stake in the litigation close identity of interests and a joint objective the finding that one has standing to sue renders it superfluous to adjudicate the other plaintiffs standing.
defendants deny plaintiffs have an injury in fact as regards the expenditure and special needs provisions so we must determine whether any of the plaintiffs have been subject to actual enforcement of the expenditure or special needs provisions or are likely to have these provisions enforced against them in the near future.we conclude that plaintiffs are indeed likely to have these provisions imminently enforced against them.first,all plaintiffs fall within the scope of these statutory provisions,such that plaintiffs would be burdened by these provisions if they were enforced.second,dpw has stated that it intends to enforce all the requirements of the statute should it prevail.this establishes an imminent injury in fact.
defendants believe that plaintiffs lack an injury in fact as to the special needs provision because they have not produced a single class member who can plausibly claim to be at risk of being denied access to a pooled trust under that provision.appellants principal br.at defendants point to cases where they have approved exceptionally large trusts implicitly arguing that they will not enforce the special needs requirement except in egregious cases.they believe plaintiffs lack an injury in fact unless one of the plaintiffs presents such an egregious case.similarly,because plaintiffs have failed to point to a specific expenditure that defendants have disapproved or threatened to disapprove,plaintiffs supposedly lack an injury in fact as to the expenditure provision.
but defendants position ignores the nature of these provisions.instead of being imposed on particular classes of individuals,these requirements are burdens on the nature of the trust itself affecting all beneficiaries and trustees of special needs trusts.with regard to the special needs provision,the pennsylvania statute requires that the trust existence be justified in relation to the special needs of the beneficiary.it defines special needs as items,products or services related to the treatment of the beneficiary disability.stat.ann.f.this requires that the trust be justified in relation to the treatment of the beneficiary disability.similarly,the expenditure provision requires any expenditure from the trust to have a reasonable relationship to the needs of the beneficiary.stat.ann.b ii.all special needs trusts are subject to these requirements.each of these provisions requires careful scrutiny of the trust,the beneficiary,and the beneficiary ongoing needs,and therefore each provision imposes an ongoing burden on beneficiaries and trustees.
plaintiffs are within the scope of the statute and therefore potentially affected by it.by itself,this is not sufficient to demonstrate constitutional standing.normally,plaintiffs would have the burden of demonstrating that there is an imminent threat of enforcement against them.but here dpw has relieved plaintiffs of that burden by stipulating that should it prevail in this litigation,it will enforce all provisions of section.therefore,the threat of enforcement is sufficiently imminent that plaintiffs have an injury in fact.
defendants also argue that should they prevail,they will not seek to terminate trusts,but rather seek to force their compliance with section.appellants principal br.at but it is unclear why this would deny plaintiffs an injury in fact.while terminating trusts would surely be more draconian,forcing such trusts to comply with an allegedly illegitimate statute is,from the perspective of constitutional standing,no less an injury in fact.
we hold that plaintiffs have constitutional standing to challenge section.
prudential standing requires that a litigant assert his or her own legal interests rather than those of a third party that the grievance not be so abstract as to amount to a generalized grievance and that the plaintiffs interests are arguably within the zone of interests protected by the statute,rule,or constitutional provision on which the claim is based.see mariana fisher,cir these requirements are clearly met in this case.
plaintiffs are asserting their own interests as beneficiaries and trustees of trusts the commonwealth of pennsylvania is attempting to regulate.their grievance is not so abstract as to amount to a generalized grievance.rather,it is clear,distinct,and particular to their status as beneficiaries and trustees.finally,the zone of interests analysis parallels our later consideration of whether plaintiffs have a private right of action.under gonzaga university doe,d,to determine whether congress intended to create a private right of action,we must look for language clearly imparting an individual entitlement,with an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.id.at.this test is both narrower than the test and fully encompassed within its boundaries.thus,should we conclude that plaintiffs have a private right of action,we must necessarily conclude that they satisfy the test.since our later analysis does conclude that plaintiffs have a private right of action,plaintiffs have satisfied the test.we therefore hold that plaintiffs have prudential standing to challenge section.
ripeness requires a substantial controversy,between parties having adverse legal interests,of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment.cas.pac.coal oil.
in step saver data systems,wyse technology,cir,we concluded that the most important factors in determining whether a case is ripe are the adversity of the interest of the parties,the conclusiveness of the judicial judgment and the practical help,or utility,of that judgment.id.at.adversity requires opposing legal interests.see id.at citing and quoting wright,miller kane,federal practice procedure,at ed.such opposing interests are clearly present here,as defendants have an obligation to enforce section,and plaintiffs seek to evade its strictures.conclusivity depends on the ability of a decision to define and clarify the legal rights or relations of the parties.id.at.a decision here would establish whether the statute can be enforced against the plaintiffs,so it would define and clarify plaintiffs legal rights.and declaratory judgments have utility because the clarity they bring enables plaintiffs and possibly defendants to make responsible decisions about the future.id.at.here,a declaratory judgment will enable the plaintiffs to make informed decisions about the administration of their trusts with a full understanding of section effects.
defendants argue that plaintiffs claims are not ripe,but do not clearly state which factors they believe are lacking.they argue that because section requires compliance with authoritative interpretations of the statute,because dpw is the agency charged with such interpretation,and because dpw has not released any such interpretations,the case is not ripe for decision.they are incorrect.
first,the statutory text has its own freestanding meaning and imposes requirements on trusts even without agency interpretation.defendants point to no authority requiring us to wait for an authoritative interpretation from a state agency before determining whether a state statute conflicts with federal law.and to the extent the agency is pleading for a chance to interpret the statute more leniently than the statute text might suggest,we question whether we can credit such an interpretation.as the supreme court said in united states stevens,d we would not uphold an unconstitutional statute merely because the government promised to use it responsibly.
second,the stipulated facts cite multiple attempts to enforce provisions of the statute.in one enforcement attempt,dpw denied mary wagner medical assistance because the trust agreement for the family trust did not comply with section.defendants claim this ineligibility decision was withdrawn,appellants reply br.at but that explanation is at best incomplete,and at worst misleading,particularly coming as it does in a reply brief.in fact,mary wagner,the trustee,and dpw entered into what is essentially a stay of the ineligibility determination pending resolution of this suit.should plaintiffs challenge fail,mary wagner and the trustee have agreed that the commonwealth will be paid up to fifty percent of remaining funds in mary wagner pooled account at her death.obviously,mary wagner interests remain adverse to those of the commonwealth.
finally,the stipulated facts indicate that dpw has created and internally circulated a document addressing various provisions of the statute.defendants argue that these guidelines have not been used to disapprove any accounts or expenditures,but that is beside the point.the document undermines defendants argument that they have not reached any conclusions on the scope and meaning of the statute.for example,they have concluded that luxury items can not be bought with trust funds and that n o assets can be added after age.
the issues raised by defendants will often be present in declaratory judgment cases.such actions are often brought specifically because legal rights and obligations are ambiguous or undefined.plaintiffs seek to clarify those legal rights and obligations.we understand that dpw has been entrusted by the pennsylvania legislature with the duty of interpreting section and we appreciate dpw stated intent to interpret the statute reasonably.but plaintiffs have satisfied step saver requirements.they are entitled to have section examined in light of federal law and to have their legal rights and obligations clarified.we hold that plaintiffs claims are ripe for adjudication.
defendants central argument,cutting across both the and the merits sections of their brief,is that d does not mandate that the states exempt special needs trusts meeting its criteria.defendants argument has been embraced by both the second and tenth circuits.see wong doar,cir keith rizzuto,cir.meanwhile,the eighth circuit suggests in a passing reference that d is mandatory.see norwest bank of,doth,cir.having given careful consideration to defendants arguments and to the positions of our sister circuits,we conclude that d imposes mandatory obligations upon the states.
defendants key point is that the beginning of the special needs exemption states this subsection shall not apply to any of the following trusts.d emphasis added.this language refers to the portion of the medicaid statute requiring states to count trusts against eligibility.it abrogates that section insofar as it applies to special needs trusts.both parties agree that this lifts the obligation levied upon the states by the provisions and says that the states do not have to apply the provisions to qualifying special needs trusts.but the provision does not specifically say that any trusts meeting these requirements shall not be counted as available assets for determining medicaid eligibility.
defendants argue that this creates a gap where the states can legislate.this was the second circuit position in wong doar,at congress negative command that d shall not apply to the trusts referenced in d does not,however,provide any guidance as to what rules shall apply to d trusts.similarly,in keith rizzuto,the tenth circuit concluded that section d provides an exception to a requirement.states accordingly need not count income trusts for eligibility purposes,but nevertheless may opt to do so.at see also hobbs ex rel.hobbs zenderman,cir applying keith to conclude that d a does not confer a private right of action.
t he intent of congress is the ultimate touchstone of preemption analysis.farina nokia,cir quoting medtronic,lohr,d.and because the best evidence of congress intent is what it says in the texts of the statutes,fogleman mercy,cir,we give controlling weight to the statutory text.but we believe that focusing solely on the words t his subsection has caused defendants and several courts to miss the forest for the trees.
in enacting the trust provisions of obra,congress provided a comprehensive system for dealing with the relationship between trusts and medicaid eligibility.after limited success with the medicaid qualifying trusts provisions enacted in,congress made a deliberate choice to expand the federal role in defining trusts and their effect on medicaid eligibility.evidence of this can be found throughout the medicaid statute.for example,the current text of a requires states to comply with section of this title with respect to treatment of certain trusts.before obra,the provision instructed states to comply with the provisions of section of this title with respect to liens,adjustments and recoveries of medical assistance correctly paid,and transfers of assets.a.it did not mention compliance with.
congress made a specific choice to expand the types of assets being treated as trusts and to unambiguously require states to count trusts against medicaid eligibility.its primary objective was unquestionably to prevent medicaid recipients from receiving health care while they sheltered their own assets for their benefit and the benefit of their heirs.but its secondary objective was to shield special needs trusts from impacting medicaid eligibility.and the supreme court has emphasized the importance of giving full effect to all of congress statutory objectives,as well as the specific balance struck among them.see rodriguez united states,d deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative it frustrates rather than effectuates legislative intent simplistically to assume that whatever furthers the statute primary objective must be the law.
congress intent was not merely to shelter special needs trusts from the effect of d.it was to shelter special needs trusts from having any impact on medicaid eligibility.this conclusion is rooted in the statutory text.if congress had intended to do as the defendants insist provide an exception to the rules through which the states were free to do as they wish it seems unlikely that congress would use the word shall in its command that t his subsection shall not apply.any number of constructions would have been more amenable to the defendants position.for example,congress could have said states are not required to apply this subsection to any of the following trusts.congress is not required to use any particular magic words,but its choice of an imperative like shall does give evidence of its intent.
even more important is the structure of the rules.while defendants focus on the specific structure of d and,both of these sit within a complex and comprehensive system of rules.congress rigorously dictates what assets shall count and what assets shall not count toward medicaid eligibility.state law obviously plays a role in determining ownership,property rights,and similar matters.here congress has not only provided a comprehensive system of rules,it has actually legislated on this precise class of asset.defendants argue that congress left a gap or an case with regard to these trusts.but with such a rigorous system,it seems clear that congress intended to create a purely binary system of classification either a trust affects medicaid eligibility or it does not.
finally,while this shades into our preemption analysis,it is important to note that d basically provides a federal definition for what constitutes a special needs trust.through this statutory provision,congress has set the boundaries for what will be considered a special needs trust under federal law.pennsylvania section adds requirements to this definition.as our preemption analysis will demonstrate,states are not free to rewrite congressional statutes in this way.
for these reasons,rooted in the text and structure of the medicaid statute,we respectfully disagree with the conclusion of the second and tenth circuits.we hold that in determining medicaid eligibility,states are required to exempt any trust meeting the provisions of d 
to find a private right of action under section the statutory provision must benefit the plaintiffs with a right unambiguously conferred by congress the right can not be so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence and the statute must impose a binding obligation on the states.see blessing freestone,d gonzaga doe,d.defendants challenge the first and third parts of this test.we conclude that plaintiffs have a private right of action under section.
medicaid provides eligible individuals with the statutory right to receive medical assistance and to receive it with reasonable promptness.see a,a a.our court has already concluded that medicaid provides a private right of action under section for interference with this right.see sabree ex rel.sabree richman,cir.plaintiffs have a right to receive reasonably prompt medical assistance so long as they meet the eligibility requirements as those requirements are defined by federal law.plaintiffs allege that section changes the eligibility requirements for medical assistance,contrary to federal law.thus,it interferes with plaintiffs right to receive medical assistance.plaintiffs therefore have a cause of action under section.
it is a closer question whether the trust plaintiffs have a private right of action here.to be sure,they do not have a right to receive medical assistance.we nonetheless conclude that the medicaid statute confers a private right of action upon the trust plaintiffs.
under gonzaga university doe,we must look for language clearly imparting an individual entitlement,with an unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.at.in gonzaga,the supreme court contrasted the individually focused terminology of title vi no person shall be subjected to discrimination with ferpa mandate that the secretary of education withhold funds from institutions violating its provisions.id.at.
based on gonzaga,at least two provisions of the medicaid statute confer rights upon the trusts.first,d says that the rules shall not apply to special needs trusts.this parallels the language from title vi and title ix no person shall be subjected to discrimination that the court has held to create individual rights.see gonzaga,at.second,a instructs that a state plan for medical assistance must comply with the provisions of section of this title with respect to treatment of certain trusts.this parallels the language from a already held by sabree to confer an individual right.in fact,they are both part of a list of requirements that congress concluded must be met by a state plan for medical assistance.while the instruction to comply is directed at the state,the right to have the state comply is directed at those affected by noncompliance.see sabree,at.in the case of section a,individual rights were conferred upon those eligible for medicaid.in the case of section a,individual rights are conferred upon the trusts.
defendants counterargument is that the special needs exemptions to the rules d are not mandatory.in order to confer a private right of action,the statute must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.blessing,at.otherwise it does not unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states such that plaintiffs can seek its enforcement through section.because we have already concluded that the special needs exemptions are mandatory,we must reject this argument.
we hold,consistent with our opinion in sabree,that the individual plaintiffs have a private right of action to enforce the application of the special needs exemptions.we further hold that d and a unmistakably confer a similar right on the trust plaintiffs.
we also conclude that the supremacy clause provides plaintiffs with an independent basis for a private right of action in this case supreme court precedent establishes that the supremacy clause creates an independent right of action where a party alleges preemption of state law by federal law.see shaw delta air lines,d a plaintiff who seeks injunctive relief from state regulation,on the ground that such regulation is preempted by a federal statute which,by virtue of the supremacy clause of the constitution,must prevail,thus presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.we acknowledged as much in thomas john hotel tourism ass gov t of the,cir a state or territorial law can be unenforceable as preempted by federal law even when the federal law secures no individual substantive rights for the party arguing preemption the supreme court has recognized that such a challenge presents a federal question which the federal courts have jurisdiction under to resolve.
our opinion in gonzalez young,cir,is not to the contrary.there we concluded that did not confer jurisdiction over a claim that the federal welfare program preempted new jersey law.but here section provides federal question jurisdiction so long as there is a civil action arising under the constitution,laws,or treaties of the united states.in any event,shaw gonzalez and commands that jurisdiction and a cause of action are present here.
we are compelled to hold that the supremacy clause provides a private right of action here 
our preemption analysis must necessarily examine each individual component of the pennsylvania statute to determine whether it conflicts with the medicaid statute.but we begin by determining whether congress had an overarching intent in enacting the provisions and the special needs exemptions.
the basic principles of a preemption analysis are familiar.first,the intent of congress is the ultimate touchstone of preemption analysis.farina,at quoting medtronic,at.second,we start with the basic assumption that congress did not intend to displace state law.id.at quoting maryland louisiana,d.third,when we are dealing with spending clause legislation,we require congress to speak unambiguously,because such legislation is in the nature of a contract between congress and the states,and the states are entitled to know the conditions under which they are accepting.pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,d.
bearing these principles in mind,we discern an overarching intent behind the trust exemptions.first,congress intended to mandate the exemption of special needs trusts from the rules.we explained our reasoning for this conclusion in section 
second,congress intended that special needs trusts be defined by a specific set of criteria that it set forth and no others.we base this upon congress choice to provide a list of requirements to be met by special needs trusts.the venerable canon of statutory construction expressio unius est exclusio alterius essentially says that where a specific list is set forth,it is presumed that items not on the list have been excluded.see,term limits,thornton,d noting that application of expressio unius leads to the conclusion that the qualifications for office expressed in the constitution are the sole requirements and other requirements can not be imposed waggoner gonzales,cir applying expressio unius to a list of requirements and concluding that expression of the extreme hardship requirement forecloses conclusion that additional requirements exist beyond extreme hardship.absent an explicit statement or a clear implication that states are free to expand the list,expressio unius leads us to conclude they are not.
third and finally,while congress did not intend to allow additional burdens targeted specifically at special needs trusts,there is no reason to believe it abrogated states general laws of trusts or their inherent powers under those laws.there is necessarily some tension between this conclusion and the bar on states adding requirements.for example,even application of the trustee traditional duty of loyalty to administer the trust solely in the interests of the beneficiaries.ann.a could be considered an extra requirement.but we reject the conclusion that application of these traditional powers is contrary to the will of congress.after all,congress did not pass a federal body of trust law,estate law,or property law when enacting medicaid.it relied and continues to rely on state laws governing such issues.
these three conclusions that the special needs exemptions are mandatory,that congress stated requirements for special needs trusts are exclusive,and that states retain their traditional regulatory authority guide our preemption analysis here 
pennsylvania retention provision provides 
u pon the death of the beneficiary or upon the earlier termination of the trust,the department and any other state that provided medical assistance to the beneficiary must be reimbursed from the funds remaining in the trust up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary before any other claimant is paid provided,however,that in the case of an account in a pooled trust,the trust shall provide that no more than fifty percent of the amount remaining in the beneficiary pooled trust account may be retained by the trust without any obligation to reimburse the department.
stat.ann.b iii.the medicaid statute,meanwhile,includes the following language 
to the extent that amounts remaining in the beneficiary account upon the death of the beneficiary are not retained by the trust,the trust pays to the state from such remaining amounts in the account an amount equal to the total amount of medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary under the state plan under this subchapter.
d c iv.these two provisions are irreconcilable.we conclude that congress intended to permit special needs trusts at the discretion of the trust to retain up to of the residual after the death of the disabled beneficiary.we therefore hold the repayment provision of section preempted by federal law 
plaintiffs argue that the medicaid provision leaves it to the trust to decide how much if any money should be provided to the state to reimburse it for medicaid expenses.we agree.this construction accords with the statutory text and congress evident solicitude for these pooled trusts evident by the fact that there is a special category of exemption for them.retaining the residual enables the trust to cover administrative fees and other overhead without increasing charges on accounts of living beneficiaries at the same time,should the trust attempt to pass the money to the deceased estate,this provision acts as a safeguard to ensure that the state gets repaid.see joseph rosenberg,supplemental needs trusts for people with disabilities the development of a private trust in the public interest,pub.int,to the extent the remaining balance in an individual trust account is retained by the pooled trust after the death of the beneficiary,the state is not entitled to be paid back.however,any amounts that are not retained by the pooled trust must be used to reimburse the state for the cost of medical assistance provided to the beneficiary during his or her lifetime.
defendants have not offered any reasonable alternative construction of the medicaid provision.their principal argument is that the medicaid statute makes no mention of who gets to decide the percentage retained by the trust.but plaintiffs construction of the statute which we find persuasive,particularly in the absence of a contrary construction from the defendants is that this is a protective provision,intended to shield the trust from repayment obligations.permitting the states to choose how much the trust can retain would eviscerate that protection.while pennsylvania seeks only of the trust residual,states would be free to demand any amount they wished,with the possible exception of,and the courts would be powerless to mediate these disputes.absent some statutory guidance,there is no reasonable way for us to say that demanding,or even of the residual is any less permissible than demanding.we can not believe congress would intentionally cripple its statute in that manner.
it is particularly noteworthy that this provision differs from the other three types of special needs trusts.in enacting the rules,congress designated three types of exempted trusts in successive statutory paragraphs at d a,b,and c.both the first and second exemptions,d a and b,require repayment up to the total amount expended for medical assistance.the provision,d c,is the only one of the three exemptions that qualifies this repayment obligation and permits the trust to retain some portion of the residual.this is strong evidence of congressional intent.see russello united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.
there is no question that congress could have chosen to strike the balance differently,determining that the trust could retain some portion of the residual while partially repaying the state.but congress chose to strike the balance in favor of the trust.it is important to remember that the residual here is not being passed to the deceased beneficiary estate.it is being retained by a charitable organization whose purpose is to operate special needs trusts for the benefit of the disabled.see d c i requiring that a pooled trust be established and managed by a association.to the extent any part of the residual is passed to the estate,states are free to seek repayment from those funds.but congress has given the trust discretion to determine whether to retain the residual.we hold the repayment provision of section preempted by federal law.
the expenditure provision of section b ii provides that any expenditure from the trust must have a reasonable relationship to the needs of the beneficiary.stat.ann.b ii.the medicaid statute sets no restrictions on the purposes for which trust funds can be expended.thus,the reasonable relationship requirement of section b ii transgresses congressional intent.we hold it preempted by federal law.
the commonwealth is justifiably concerned with the potential for fraud and abuse.while there is little if any evidence to demonstrate that the trust plaintiffs here have spent trust funds recklessly,it is always possible that trustees could do so.but states are not without tools to prevent abuse.the rules are built atop the states legal framework for trusts.special needs trusts are therefore subject to supervision by the courts and legal actions to enforce trustees fiduciary duties.and because pooled special needs trusts must be managed by organizations,they are similarly subject to the states legal rules for.we trust that these statutory tools are robust enough to curtail abuses.but should states find these tools inadequate,they are free to petition congress to change the medicaid statute.should congress be unresponsive,states retain the option of withdrawing from medicaid.
the special needs requirement of section b attempts to restrict pooled special needs trusts to beneficiaries with special needs that will not be met without the trust.stat.ann.b.the pennsylvania statute defines special needs as those items,products or services not covered by the medical assistance program,insurance or other liability source for which a beneficiary of a special needs trust or his parents are personally liable and that can be provided to the beneficiary to increase the beneficiary quality of life and to assist in and are related to the treatment of the beneficiary disability.these limitations do not appear in the medicaid statute,which only requires that individuals be disabled.
defendants point to the flexibility of the term quality of life as support for their contention that this provision is not inconsistent with medicaid requirements.plaintiffs rightly note that the pennsylvania statute requires both that the items will enhance the beneficiary quality of life and that they be related to the treatment of the beneficiary disability.congress did not include any requirement that proceeds from a special needs trust be used solely for treatment of the beneficiary disability.starting from the assumption that congress intended to exempt all legally constituted trusts meeting the requirements of d from counting against medicaid eligibility,and did not intend to permit additional restrictions beyond those it specified,the special needs requirement of section b transgresses congressional intent.we hold it preempted by federal law.
defendants claim that this requirement,much like the reasonable relationship requirement,is needed to prevent abuse of the trusts and the purchase of luxury items.but while preventing abuse is a laudable goal and one with which congress may agree,that requirement is not reflected in the medicaid statute.and of course states retain their full complement of general trust and laws to combat waste,fraud,and abuse.should a state find these tools inadequate,it may petition congress for statutory changes,or it may withdraw from medicaid entirely.
the age provision of section b attempts to restrict pooled special needs trusts to beneficiaries under the age of.stat.ann.b.congress did not include an age restriction for pooled special needs trusts.on that basis alone,the age restriction in section b transgresses congressional intent.
our conclusion is bolstered by a close examination of the other trust exemptions for trusts.in enacting the rules,congress designated three types of exempted trusts in successive statutory paragraphs at d a,b,and c.only the first exemption,d a,is restricted to an individual under age.the other two exemptions including pooled special needs trusts at d c contain no similar language.this is strong evidence of congressional intent not to impose an age restriction on pooled special needs trusts.see russello united states,d where congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.and,indeed,defendants conceded at oral argument that if we held d to be mandatory and binding,the age restriction must fall.we agree,and hold the provision preempted.
we note here that defendants were attempting to protect elderly beneficiaries of special needs trusts from potentially invalidating at least temporarily their medicaid eligibility.through a quirk of the medicaid statute,elderly individuals and over transferring assets into a pooled trust are made ineligible for medicaid for a period of time.see rosenberg,supra,pub.int.at discussing operation of the penalty.before the district court,defendants argued that this was a drafting error by congress.they may well be correct but this is not a mere scrivener error that we can correct judicially.congress could have rationally concluded that the benefits of making special needs trusts available to elderly individuals outweighed the burden of the penalty.as it stands,congressional intent as exemplified by the text of the statute is clear.the commonwealth goal may be laudable,but if congress perceives a problem,congress will have to fix it.
the enforcement provision of section c states if at any time it appears that any of the requirements of subsection b are not satisfied or the trustee refuses without good cause to make payments from the trust for the special needs of the beneficiary and,provided that the department or any other public agency in this commonwealth has a claim against trust property,the department or other public agency may petition the court for an order terminating the trust.stat.
