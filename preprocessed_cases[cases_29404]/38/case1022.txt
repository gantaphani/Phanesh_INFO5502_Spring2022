during his employment as a coal miner and foreman,the petitioner,terry gunderson,was exposed to coal dust and developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.in january,gunderson received a letter from the national institute for occupational safety and health informing him that an taken as part of a monitoring program indicated that he suffered from pneumoconiosis,a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mine employment.b.pneumoconiosis encompasses a cruel set of conditions that afflict a significant percentage of the nation coal miners with severe,and frequently crippling,chronic respiratory impairment.mining ass dep t of labor,quoting usery turner elkhorn mining,d.
in response to this letter,gunderson sought benefits from blue mountain energy,his longtime employer,under title iv of the federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended,the black lung benefits act.he alleged that he suffered from clinical pneumoconiosis and legal pneumoconiosis.see discussing those two diseases.
the district director of the office of workers compensation programs granted gunderson claim for benefits,but blue mountain energy appealed that decision to an administrative law judge alj.the alj heard conflicting evidence gunderson doctors concluded that he suffered from pneumoconiosis arising from coal dust exposure and that he was disabled because of the disease,while doctors testifying on behalf of blue mountain energy opined that gunderson respiratory problems were caused by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease arising from his smoking habit.
after reviewing the evidence,the alj rejected gunderson claims.with regard to clinical pneumoconiosis,the alj found that the medical reports did not support gunderson contentions.as to legal pneumoconiosis,the alj found that the doctors reports,while conflicting,were all,and,alj materials,order,filed march,at.in the alj view,both parties experts opinions were entitled to equal weight.the alj therefore denied the claim on the ground that gunderson had not met his burden of proving that his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was caused by his work as a coal miner.the department of labor benefits review board affirmed the alj decision.
in this appeal,gunderson challenges only the alj ruling regarding legal pneumoconiosis.he argues that the alj failed to provide a sufficient explanation of the decision to deny that claim and erred in excluding a letter from the director of the division of respiratory disease studies at the national institute of occupational health and safety reporting that an was positive for pneumoconiosis.
we agree with gunderson that the case should be remanded for further proceedings.the alj cursory statement that the evidence from both parties was entitled to equal weight does not constitute a sufficient reason or basis for his decision,as required by the administrative procedures act,c a.however,we further conclude that the alj did not err in excluding the director letter.
background 
most of the relevant facts are not disputed.we begin with gunderson particular circumstances and then turn to the regulatory scheme implementing the black lung benefits act and the proceedings in this case.
a.gunderson employment and medical history 
gunderson worked more than thirty years in underground coal mines,beginning in january,when he accepted a position in geneva,utah.in,he became a superintendent of that mine,which required him to work underground half of the time.in,he moved to colorado and worked as director of operations at a mine there until.
in the,gunderson engaged in a variety of other activities.he ran a retail business with his,drove a truck,and did some warehouse work.
gunderson returned to coal mining in,when he accepted a position as a safety inspector with blue mountain energy underground mine in rangely,colorado.he was promoted to shift foreman and then to general foreman,and he continued to work at that same mine until january.throughout much of his career as a coal miner,gunderson smoked cigarettes.he began in and quit in,consuming about a pack each day during that period.
blue mountain energy rangely mine produced as much as two million tons of coal each year.the company used continuous mining techniques,including a longwall machine that would produce up to tons of coal each hour.at the evidentiary hearing,gunderson explained that these mining activities generated large amounts of coal dust.in his words,c oal mining is a dusty business.if you not eating coal dust,you blowing rock dust.rec.tr.of may,hr g,at.
gunderson reported that his work in the coal mine required extensive physical activity.he sometimes walked to miles a day,often while carrying up to ten pounds of equipment.he also had to lift to pound logs,as well as to pound timbers,which were used to reinforce the roof.
despite these physical demands,gunderson reported little difficulty in doing his coal mining work until the latter part of his career.he testified at the evidentiary hearing that,by,i could keep up the pace.i was fatigued all the time i could walk on level ground.i could even walk up some grades.but by the end of the day,i was just so beat,i went home,i walked in the house and flopped in my chair and did get up till i went to bed.id.at.he further stated that he now lacks the stamina he once had to do chores at home and that,in attempting these tasks,he becomes short of breath.i do a little bit and then i go sit down and rest i just do have the stamina.seems like i wear out easy.id.at.
in the administrative proceedings,the parties introduced substantial medical evidence,providing a detailed account of the onset of gunderson pulmonary disease.in particular,in april,a report of gunderson regular physical examination described him as healthy except for mild,nonspecific interstitial disease,which a radiologist noted on an subsequent readings contained similar findings.in october,a radiologist read gunderson as showing mild to moderate,nonspecific interstitial disease.in june,the same radiologist concluded that gunderson revealed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and mild nonspecific interstitial disease,as well as small areas of atelectasis,a condition in which all or part of a lung becomes airless and collapses.
in july,gunderson had a lung scan,which showed a mild deficiency in blood circulation in the upper part of the lungs.that same month,he underwent a stress test on a treadmill,which showed no chest pain or arrhythmia and indicated normal blood pressure.however,in,a radiologist at mary hospital read gunderson and reported that t he lungs are hyperexpanded consistent with underlying emphysema.there is linear scarring at the right lung base.rec.employer ex,at.
in august,gunderson reported fatigue and shortness of breath to a family practitioner,who diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.that same month,gunderson submitted to an as part of a monitoring program administered by the national institute of occupational safety and health.in january,he received a letter from ronald schell of the mine safety health administration informing him that the august s hows you have enough coal workers pneumoconiosis black lung to be eligible for the option to work in a low dust area of a mine,director ex.
in april,gunderson again reported fatigue to a treating physician.in september,a physician at the western colorado lung center evaluated gunderson and diagnosed s imple coal workers pneumoconiosis and probable mild chronic obstructive pulmonary disease connected to his h istory of tobacco use.rec.employer ex,at.
statutory and regulatory background 
the black lung benefits act,defines pneumoconiosis as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mining employment.b.it is caused by inhaling coal dust into the lungs over a long period.energy west mining oliver,cir internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also dorlands illustrated medical dictionary ed defining pneumoconiosis as a condition characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs,usually of occupational or environmental origin,and by the tissue reaction to its presence and defining coal workers pneumoconiosis as a form caused by deposition of large amounts of coal dust in the lungs,typically characterized by centrilobular emphysema.as coal workers pneumoconiosis advances,it may cause physical disability and ultimately may induce death by cardiac failure,and may contribute to other causes of death.usery,at.congress enacted the black lung benefits act to compensate coal miners who have become totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis arising out of employment.see a.to obtain benefits under the black lung benefits act,a miner must demonstrate that he satisfies three conditions he or she suffers from pneumoconiosis the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mining employment and the pneumoconiosis is totally disabling.energy west,at.black lung benefits are normally paid by a miner employer.mining ass dep t of labor,see also.if the employer can not be identified,the claim is paid from the black lung disability trust fund administered by the government and financed by a tax on coal.mining ass n,at.
although the black lung benefits act offers a general definition of pneumoconiosis,see b,the statute does not set forth the standards to be used in determining whether a particular lung disease satisfies this definition.however,pursuant to its authority to implement the black lung benefits act,see id.a,the department of labor has promulgated regulations interpreting b definition of pneumoconiosis to encompass two distinct types of compensable lung diseases clinical pneumoconiosis and legal pneumoconiosis.see a.this interpretation comports with the approach that many circuits had previously followed.see andersen,office of workers comp.programs,cir citing those cases.
according to the department of labor regulations,clinical pneumoconiosis consists of those lung diseases the medical community refers to as pneumoconiosis the conditions characterized by permanent deposition of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure a.these diseases include,for example,coal workers pneumoconiosis,anthracosilicosis,anthracosis,anthrosilicosis,massive pulmonary fibrosis,silicosis or silicotuberculosis,arising out of coal mine employment.id.
in contrast,legal pneumoconiosis describes a broader class of lung diseases that are not pneumoconiosis as the term is used by the medical community.the term includes any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae including any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.a.a chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arises out of employment if it is significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by,dust exposure in coalmine employment.id.b.
under the black lung benefits act,the administrative process begins when a miner or his or her survivor files a claim with the district director of the department of labor office of workers compensation programs.the district director investigates the claim,notifies the interested parties,and makes a preliminary determination whether the claimant is eligible for benefits and whether a particular mine employer should be held responsible.see also mining ass n,at discussing the benefits claims and appeals process.
after the district director renders a decision,either party may appeal to an alj and request a hearing.in turn,the alj decision may be appealed by either party to the department of labor benefits review board,and,ultimately,to the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the injury occurred.c.the hearings and appeals are governed by the administrative procedures act.see d providing that hearings on claims for compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act are governed by the administrative procedures act provision regarding adjudicatory hearings,a applying d to claims for benefits under the black lung benefits act establishing requirements for considering evidence and issuing findings that apply when adjudicatory hearings are required under.
c.gunderson claim for benefits and the administrative proceedings 
after he received the january letter reporting that his was positive for pneumoconiosis,gunderson filed a claim under the black lung benefits act.the district director granted his request,finding that gunderson suffered from pneumoconiosis,was totally disabled by it,and that blue mountain energy was the responsible operator.
blue mountain energy then appealed to an alj and requested a formal hearing.the parties presented conflicting evidence,including reports,reports from physicians some of whom examined gunderson and some of whom merely reviewed his treatment records,and a ct scan.six reports concluded that gunderson had pneumoconiosis.five reports found no evidence of the disease,as did the report of the ct scan.three physicians mark shockey,robert cohen,and john parker concluded that gunderson had pneumoconiosis,while two other physicians disagreed lawrence repsher and joseph renn.
after hearing this evidence,the alj issued a decision denying gunderson claim for benefits.the alj addressed both types of pneumoconiosis described by department of labor regulations clinical and legal pneumoconiosis.see a.
as to clinical pneumoconiosis,the alj concluded that the lack of a definitive indication of substantial amounts of particulate matter in the lungs and the fibrotic reaction of the lung tissue to that deposition caused by dust exposure in coal mine employment,meant that gunderson had not established that he had that disease.the alj noted the disagreement among the physicians who had reviewed the evidence and added that two of the doctors who had found that gunderson had suffered from pneumoconiosis cohen and shockey had relied on inadmissible expert reports in reaching their conclusions,alj materials,order,filed march,at.given the evidence available to cohen after discounting the inadmissible reports,it seems unlikely that a finding of clinical pneumoconiosis could be maintained.id.
as to legal pneumoconiosis,the alj found that there was clearly a difference of opinion among physicians who have given detailed statements in this case,alj materials,order,filed march,at.the alj assessed the conflicting evidence as follows 
all of the physicians are extremely qualified to discuss gunderson pulmonary problems.except for shockey,who did not provide an extensive curriculum vitae,all have had significant experience with internal and pulmonary medicine,including the publication of articles in this field,professional appointments in the field of pulmonary medicine and teaching positions at local universities.further,all of their reports are and.moreover,despite the fact that renn and cohen disagree as to the meaning of some of gunderson test results,their findings and reports are each.
the undersigned finds that these reports are evenly balanced,and should receive equal weight.as is noted above,the claimant bears the burden of establishing the presence of pneumoconiosis by a preponderance of the evidence.the claimant has not proven that he has legal pneumoconiosis.
since the claimant has not established the presence of either clinical or legal pneumoconiosis,the criteria of a has not been met.
id.at footnote omitted.the alj therefore denied gunderson claim for benefits.
in the course of his decision,the alj excluded a january letter from the director of the division of respiratory disease studies at the national institute of occupational health and safety to the chief of the division of health of the mine safety health administration.the letter reported the results of a chest as positive for pneumoconiosis.however,the referenced was not included in the record.
in explaining his decision to exclude this letter,the alj invoked the department of labor regulations that limit the number of that each party may submit and require reports to contain specific information 
the results of this will not be considered since the claimant has already designated two determinations in support of his affirmative case.since the limitations set forth in are mandatory and can not be waived,can not be considered.moreover,cx fails to show the date the was taken,the date the was read by a doctor,the quality of the film,the name of the doctor who interpreted the,the qualifications of the doctor who interpreted the,or the type of opacities found.it therefore does not meet the standards for set forth in a 
gunderson filed an appeal of the alj decision with the labor department benefits review board.among other arguments,he advanced the two contentions that he now raises in this appeal.the benefits review board rejected both arguments,and affirmed the alj decision denying gunderson claim for benefits.
ii.discussion 
gunderson now argues that the alj failed to provide a sufficient explanation of his decision to deny the claim for benefits under the black lung benefits act and erred in excluding the january letter from the director of the division of respiratory disease studies.
standard of review 
gunderson first argument raises a legal question that we review de novo.see stalcup peabody coal,cir examining de novo the question of whether an alj in a black lung case provided an adequate explanation for the denial of benefits.
in contrast,in considering gunderson second argument which challenges a decision to exclude evidence we afford considerable deference to the agency tribunal.in general,the formulation of administrative procedures is a matter left to the discretion of the administrative agency.laird icc,cir.this discretion includes the power to make reasonable,nonarbitrary decisions regarding the admission or exclusion of evidence.see second taxing dist.of city of norwalk ferc.thus,aljs generally have broad authority over their hearings,nlrb.jackson hosp,cir,and w e review the alj exclusion of the evidence for an abuse of discretion.manna pro partners,nlrb,cir.
in addition,the administrative procedures act directs reviewing courts to take due account of the rule of prejudicial error.as a result,we may overturn the alj decision only if the error in excluding evidence prejudicially affect ed a substantial right of a party.see sanjuan ibp,cir applying the prejudicial error rule to a judgment on a jury verdict.an error is prejudicial only if it can be reasonably concluded that with such evidence,there would have been a contrary result.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
b.the alj failed to provide a sufficient explanation of his decision that gunderson did not suffer from legal pneumoconiosis.
gunderson first contends that the alj failed to comply with the administrative procedures act provision requiring agency tribunals to explain the grounds for their decisions.that provision states that 
a ll decisions,including initial,recommended,and tentative decisions,are a part of the record and shall include a statement of 
findings and conclusions,and the reasons or basis therefor,on all the material issues of fact,law,or discretion presented on the record 
c a emphasis added.in gunderson view,the alj did not provide the reasons or basis for rejecting the legal pneumoconiosis claim.instead,the alj just threw up his hands,implying he could not decide who was right on a scientific basis.aplt br.at.
in response,blue mountain energy maintains that the alj complied with his obligations under the apa.it further argues that the finding that gunderson did not establish his entitlement to benefits is supported by substantial evidence and that the alj credibility findings can not be revisited by this court on appeal.
section c a reasoned explanation requirement 
gunderson argument is grounded in fundamental principles of administrative law.section c a,which he invokes,requires an agency adjudicative decision to be accompanied by a clear and satisfactory explication of the basis on which it rests.barren creek coal witmer,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that requirement serves several important interests.
first,it enables appellate courts to engage in meaningful judicial review.id.in addition,an adequate statement of reasons or findings also helps avoid judicial usurpation of administrative functions,assures more careful administrative consideration,and helps the parties plan their cases for judicial review.see also dakota underground,sec y of labor,cir observing that,in light of an agency decision inadequacy,we can not assess the correctness of the alj apparent determination that a regulatory violation occurred,nor can we evaluate the alj characterization of the violation as willful dickson sec y of defense,because the agency only listed the facts and stated its conclusions,but did not connect them in any rational way,the agency decisions are arbitrary and capricious.where an agency has failed to explain the path it has taken,we have no choice but to remand for a reasoned explanation.citation,internal quotation marks,and footnote omitted.of course,t his duty of explanation is not intended to be a mandate for administrative verbosity or pedantry.if a reviewing court can discern what the alj did and why he did it,the duty of explanation is satisfied.piney mountain coal mays,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
this duty of explanation has added importance for cases in which medical or scientific evidence has been presented.a scientific dispute must be resolved on scientific grounds.this requires the alj to articulate a reason and provide support for favoring one opinion over another.stalcup,at internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also freeman united coal mining benefits review,of labor,cir stating that c oncomitant with the alj duty to resolve all conflicts in the medical evidence is the responsibility to provide some general articulable basis for rejecting certain key medical evidence that favors or disfavors an award of benefits.as judge posner has written,that obligation comports with the elementary principles of rational.sahara coal fitts,cir.it also accords with the deference courts generally afford to agency action that implicates scientific and technical judgments within the scope of agency expertise.see wyoming united states,cir internal quotation marks omitted.that expertise allows agencies to relax the rules of evidence because they are deemed to have the skill needed to handle evidence that might mislead a jury.they have a corresponding obligation to use that skill when evaluating technical evidence.peabody coal mccandless,cir citation omitted.
there are a variety of ways in which an agency decision may fail to meet the obligation to resolve a scientific dispute on scientific grounds.for example,it may wrongly attempt to avoid the scientific controversy altogether by basing its decision on which side has more medical opinions in its favor.stalcup,at.alternatively,the agency may erroneously decide the case on a theory of reliability that has no scientific basis.see peabody coal,at concluding that an alj could not base his decision on the mere fact that one expert had performed the autopsy while others with conflicting opinions had examined tissue slides because there was no medical reason to believe that visual scrutiny of gross attributes is more reliable than microscopic examination of tissue samples as a way to diagnose pneumoconiosis.in other instances,the agency decisionmaker may err by providing only a cursory statement that one expert opinion outweighs another,thereby leaving a reviewing court unable to determine the analytic process behind the result.barren creek,at see also milburn colliery hicks,cir holding that an alj failed to comply with c a when he relied upon summary conclusions that were not fully explained or supported.
application of c a in black lung benefits act cases 
our sister circuits have applied these precepts in a number of black lung cases,remanding for further proceedings when the agency has failed to adequately explain its assessment of disputed medical and scientific evidence regarding the causes of a miner pulmonary disease.for example,in stalcup,the alj stated that three physicians found no pneumoconiosis,while two other physicians found the existence of the disease and then explained that b ecause these opinions are entitled to equal weight,i now find that the miner has not established the existence of pneumoconiosis.at.in remanding,the seventh circuit held that the alj had impermissibly merely counted noses and had erred by dodg ing the scientific controversy by counting the reliable physicians on each side.id.because the alj had failed to indicate why the opinions of the doctors finding no pneumoconiosis are more persuasive than the contrary opinions,he failed to satisfy his c a obligation and a remand was warranted.
similarly,in barren creek,the third circuit remanded a black lung case to the agency because the alj had provid ed virtually no explanation for his acceptance of some opinions and his rejection of others.at.the court observed that the apa demands a substantially longer and more explanatory discussion on the part of the alj for the basis of his decision and the rejection of substantial probative evidence to the contrary and that g iven the amount and variety of medical information in the record,the one paragraph which the alj devotes to explaining his choices among the evidence is completely inadequate.id.at.
finally,in milburn colliery,the fourth circuit found a similar deficiency in an alj order that merely stated that b ased upon the totality of the evidence,in particular the opinion of a particular doctor,which i credit,i find that the claimant coal worker sic pneumoconiosis clearly is,at least,a significant contributing cause of such total disability.at first and last alteration in original.in the court view,that conclusion was not supported with the valid reasoning required under the apa.id.at see also sahara coal,at remanding a black lung case to the agency because n othing in the administrative law judge opinion offers a clue as to how to choose between the two physicians opinions.these cases are persuasive,and they guide our analysis here.
the alj decision in gunderson case 
like the courts in stalcup,barren creek,milburn colliery,and sahara coal,we can not discern the reasons or basis,c a,for the alj rejection of gunderson claim that he suffered from legal pneumoconiosis.the alj failed to resolve the scientific dispute on scientific grounds.stalcup,at internal quotation marks omitted.
in particular,from the alj statement that the conflicting opinions are evenly balanced,and should receive equal weight,alj materials,order,filed march,at,we can not tell how he evaluated their opinions.the mere fact that equally qualified experts gave conflicting testimony does not authorize the alj to avoid the scientific controversy by declaring a tie.see stalcup,at w hen an alj is faced with conflicting evidence from medical experts,he can not avoid the scientific controversy by basing his decision on which side has more medical opinions in his favor.of course,there may be some issues as to which scientific knowledge does not permit an alj to identify the more probable of the disputed expert opinions.however,if that is the case,then alj has a duty to explain,on scientific grounds,why a conclusion can not be reached.stalcup,at.merely stating that the evidence is evenly balanced,and should receive equal weight,without further explanation,is not sufficient.see,alj materials,order,filed march,at.
in reaching this conclusion,we reject blue mountain energy contention that requiring a more detailed,explanation from the alj sets the bar too high.see aple br.at stating that gunderson argument that the alj somehow is required to resolve perceived conflicts in medical literature in the course of resolving the factual disputes in the case and then relate the clinical evidence to the articles is an extraordinary demand supported by no authority.the alj task is not to resolve general scientific controversies,but instead to determine the facts of the case at hand and apply the law accordingly.this is a task that is routinely assigned to judges and to juries and that may be accomplished by careful consideration of many factors,including the qualifications of the respective physicians,the explanation of their medical opinions,the documentation underlying their medical judgments,and the sophistication and bases of their diagnoses.sterling smokeless coal akers,cir burton reynolds tobacco,cir concluding that a jury was capable of evaluating extensive expert testimony on the scientific and medical literature describing the relationship between smoking and peripheral vascular disease in determining whether the defendant had a duty to warn of those risks bitler smith,cir concluding that a jury was capable of evaluating expert testimony regarding whether copper sulfide particles found on the valve seat in this case were sufficient to cause a leak.
moreover,with regard to disputes concerning the existence and causes of pneumoconiosis,an alj has the benefit of a substantial inquiry by the department of labor.for example,the department regulations characterize pneumoconiosis as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure.c.an alj may properly rely on those regulations when assessing scientific testimony.see roberts schaefer,office of workers comp.programs,cir concluding that an alj could properly limit the weight assigned to an expert opinion because the opinion conflict ed with c recognition that pneumoconiosis can be latent and progressive and was contrary to the congressional findings and purpose central to the blba midland coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir holding that an alj could properly rely on the department finding on the scientific question whether legal pneumoconiosis is a disease that can be latent and progressive.
we further note that,although there are certainly instances in which agency tribunals have failed to provide a reasoned explanation in black lung cases,there are also a number of reported decisions,thankfully,in which aljs have complied with the apa standard,even when closely disputed scientific testimony is involved.for example,in consolidation coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir,the alj heard conflicting evidence from two of the same experts who testified in gunderson case cohen and renn.instead of concluding,as the alj did here,that the experts testimony was evenly balanced,and should receive equal weight,alj materials,order,filed march,at,the alj in consolidation coal offered an explanation as to why cohen had the better view the alj found cohen opinion most persuasive because he carefully discussed the substantial body of scientific evidence documenting the causal relationship between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and occupational exposure cohen integrated this medical evidence along with the miner medical record to conclude that coal dust exposure did contribute to his obstruction.at.see also consolidation coal,office of workers comp.programs,cir affirming an alj explicit finding that an expert negative reading of the ct scan was unreliable,for the judge was of the opinion that the record failed to establish that the expert ha d sufficient knowledge,training,or expertise in reading and interpreting a ct scan for the diagnosis of legal pneumoconiosis freeman united coal min.summers,cir concluding that an alj could properly credit the testimony of one expert over others because of that expert remarkable clinical experience and superior knowledge of research peabody coal hill,cir concluding that the alj explanation was sufficient when he offered specific reasons for crediting and discounting the testimony of physicians regarding the existence of pneumoconiosis,including a the fact that the mining company experts did not persuasively discount the effects of the miner years of underground employment in rejecting the impact of coal dust exposure in their analysis of the cause of the miner disability and offered no detailed analysis to support ruling out coal mine employment as the cause of the miner respiratory condition b that the opinions of some experts did not take into account the miner smoking history c that another expert opinion accounted both for coal dust exposure and smoking history in di
