kathryn rollins appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the commissioner of the social security administration,affirming the commissioner denial of rollins application for disability benefits under title ii of the social security act.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm.
background 
rollins was injured in a car accident in august.since then,she has experienced pain in her muscles and joints,primarily in her neck and shoulders,but also in her legs,hips,arms,and wrists.she also testified that she suffers from fatigue and stress or depression,mainly from dealing with her pain.
in,a rheumatologist,carol young,diagnosed rollins as suffering from fibromyalgia,a syndrome that has been widely recognized in the medical community for only about years.as the seventh circuit has explained,
fibromyalgia cause or causes are unknown,there is no cure,and,of greatest importance to disability law,its symptoms are entirely subjective.there are no laboratory tests for the presence or severity of fibromyalgia.the principal symptoms are pain all over,fatigue,disturbed sleep,stiffness,and the only symptom that discriminates between it and other diseases of a rheumatic character multiple tender spots,more precisely fixed locations on the body and the rule of thumb is that the patient must have at least of them to be diagnosed as having fibromyalgia that when pressed firmly cause the patient to flinch.
sarchet chater,cir.when examined,rollins was found to have all possible tender spots.
rollins application for disability benefits was denied after a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the appeals council of the social security administration office of hearings and appeals subsequently denied review,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.rollins then sought judicial review in federal district court and consented to have her case heard by a magistrate judge.the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment,and the court ruled in favor of the commissioner.this timely appeal followed.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court order upholding the commissioner denial of benefits.harman apfel,cir.we must affirm the decision of the commissioner if it was supported by substantial evidence in the record and applied the correct legal standards.reddick chater,cir.substantial evidence must be more than a scintilla,but it need not amount to a preponderance.tidwell apfel,cir.
iii.discussion 
young reports 
rollins argues that the alj erred by rejecting various statements made by rollins treating physician,young.the alj may not reject the opinion of a treating physician,even if it is contradicted by the opinions of other doctors,without providing specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.reddick,at.
the alj provided adequate reasons for not fully crediting young statements.for example,he noted that on october,young claimed that rollins was disabled,despite the facts that young also claimed that rollins had improved since her original examination on july,and young findings at the july examination indicated that rollins was not disabled.
these reasons are supported by substantial evidence.on july,young described rollins as a w ell developed,well nourished middle aged female in no acute distress and prescribed a conservative course of treatment,including a recommendation to avoid strenuous activities.these are not the sort of description and recommendations one would expect to accompany a finding that rollins was totally disabled under the act.
in addition,the alj noted that some of young recommendations were so extreme as to be implausible and were not supported by any findings made by any doctor,including young.in particular,young claimed that rollins condition prevented her from engaging in any bending,stooping,crouching,crawling,kneeling,climbing,and balancing,and also indicated that rollins should never be exposed to any smoke,fumes,dust,temperature extremes,humidity,vibrations,or noise,among other things.there is no indication in the record what the basis for these restrictions might be,and rollins herself has never claimed to have any problems with many of the conditions and activities that young instructed her to avoid.moreover,the restrictions appear to be inconsistent with the level of activity that rollins engaged in by maintaining a household and raising two young children,with no significant assistance from her ex husband.
in sum,the alj provided adequate reasons,under the appropriate legal standard,for finding that young opinion was not controlling.
rollins testimony 
rollins argues that the alj improperly assessed the credibility of her testimony regarding the severity of her pain and the degree to which it incapacitates her.
o nce a claimant produces objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment,an alj may not reject a claimant subjective complaints based solely on a lack of objective medical evidence to fully corroborate the alleged severity of pain.bunnell sullivan,cir en banc.if the alj finds the claimant pain testimony not to be credible,the alj must specifically make findings that support this conclusion,and the findings must be sufficiently specific to allow a reviewing court to conclude the alj rejected the claimant testimony on permissible grounds and did not arbitrarily discredit the claimant testimony.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.if there is no affirmative evidence that the claimant is malingering,the alj must provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the claimant testimony regarding the severity of symptoms.reddick chater,cir.
assuming,without deciding,that fibromyalgia does constitute a qualifying severe impairment under the act,we nonetheless conclude that the alj stated sufficient specific reasons for not fully crediting rollins pain testimony.for example,the alj noted that when rollins was discharged from the behavioral medicine center of loma linda university medical center after treatment for addiction to painkillers,the doctors discharging her said that she had no restrictions on activity and gave her a global assessment of function level of,indicating only mild symptoms and generally quite adequate function.while subjective pain testimony can not be rejected on the sole ground that it is not fully corroborated by objective medical evidence,the medical evidence is still a relevant factor in determining the severity of the claimant pain and its disabling effects.c.the alj also pointed out ways in which rollins claim to have totally disabling pain was undermined by her own testimony about her daily activities,such as attending to the needs of her two young children,cooking,housekeeping,laundry,shopping,attending therapy and various other meetings every week,and so forth.for example,in her daily activities questionnaire,rollins stated that she attended to all of her children needs meals,bathing,emotional,discipline,because her husband worked six days a week,usually from early in the morning until.in the same questionnaire,she also stated that she left the house daily to go to places such as her son school,taekwondo lessons and soccer games,doctor appointments,and the grocery store.
it is true that rollins testimony was somewhat equivocal about how regularly she was able to keep up with all of these activities,and the alj interpretation of her testimony may not be the only reasonable one.but it is still a reasonable interpretation and is supported by substantial evidence thus,it is not our role to it.fair bowen,cir.
consequently,we reject rollins argument that the alj improperly discounted her testimony.the alj gave clear and convincing reasons for discounting portions of rollins excess pain testimony,and those reasons were supported by substantial evidence.
c.the vocational expert 
rollins argues that the alj erred in framing his hypothetical questions for the vocational expert,because the questions did not include all of the limitations caused by her pain.the omitted limitations,however,were only those that the alj found did not exist.because the alj included all of the limitations that he found to exist,and because his findings were supported by substantial evidence,the alj did not err in omitting the other limitations that rollins had claimed,but had failed to prove.
rollins argues that the alj exhibited improper bias against her.
rollins argument is without merit.aljs and other similar administrative officers are presumed to be unbiased.this presumption can be rebutted by a showing of conflict of interest or some other specific reason for disqualification.verduzco apfel,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.it is true that the alj remarks occasionally exhibited sarcasm or impatience,particularly with respect to young reports.but expressions of impatience,dissatisfaction,annoyance,and even anger,that are within the bounds of what imperfect men and women sometimes display do not establish bias.liteky united states,d.rather,rollins was required to show that the alj behavior,in the context of the whole case,was so extreme as to display clear inability to render fair judgment.id.at.rollins has pointed to nothing in the record that rises to this level.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the district court is 
i respectfully dissent for the reasons that the majority glosses over the record and attempts to reintroduce a standard that an en banc panel of this court unequivocally rejected ten years ago.in doing so,it reaches a conclusion contrary to the testimony of the vocational expert.
it is axiomatic that o nce the claimant produces medical evidence of an underlying impairment,the commissioner may not discredit the claimant testimony as to subjective symptoms merely because they are unsupported by objective evidence.lester chater,cir.see also light soc.sec,cir bunnell sullivan,cir en banc.while the majority claims that it bases its decision on both rollins credibility and the medical record,i can not believe this is possible.
kathryn rollins has fibromyalgia.no one in this case has seriously contested this fact,and even the alj acknowledged that she has it.the district court properly treated any argument that rollins was not impaired as waived.see meanel apfel,cir.although the majority suggests that fibromyalgia may not qualify as a underlying impairment for their subjective pain analysis,this court has held otherwise a number of times.see,harman apfel,cir bunnell,at.nor have we been the only circuit to find that fibromyalgia is a qualifying impairment for which subjective pain testimony may be considered.see,sarchet chater,cir kelley callahan,cir lisa sec y of of health human,cir preston sec y of health human,cir per curiam.
fibromyalgia,also known as fibrositis,is a type of muscular or rheumatism that affects principally muscles and their attachment to bones,but which is also commonly accompanied by fatigue,sleep disturbances,lack of concentration,changes in mood or thinking,anxiety and depression.lang disability plan of sponsor applied remote,cir citing fibromyalgia,arthritis foundation pamphlet at.these symptoms comport entirely with rollins subjective complaints.
standard of review 
the majority confuses our standard of review.it is true that we must uphold the commissioner decision to deny benefits if it is supported by substantial evidence.however,once the claimant has met her burden of showing that she has been diagnosed with a medical impairment that could cause her symptoms,then u nless there is affirmative evidence showing that the claimant is malingering,the commissioner reasons for rejecting the claimant testimony must be clear and convincing.reddick chater,cir citing lester,at.this is not a new or obscure standard.see holohan massanari,cir morgan comm r of the soc.sec,cir regennitter comm r of the soc.sec,cir light,at smolen chater,cir johnson shalala,cir.there is no evidence of malingering here,and the justification offered by the alj,and adopted by the commissioner,is not clear and convincing.
ii.rollins testimony 
rollins clearly demonstrated that she has an underlying impairment which is reasonably likely to be the cause of alleged pain.bunnell,at.moreover,her medical reports contain specific findings that she is not malingering,and no contrary evidence was introduced.as a result,the adjudicator may not discredit her allegations of the severity of pain solely on the ground that the allegations are unsupported by objective medical evidence.see also lester,at.instead,the alj must discredit the claimant subjective testimony by finding that she is not credible.
credibility 
the alj rejection of rollins testimony was in error.to find the claimant not credible the alj must rely either on reasons unrelated to the subjective testimony,reputation for dishonesty,on conflicts between her testimony and her own conduct,or on internal contradictions in that testimony.light,at.although we give deference to the alj in determining a claimant credibility,an alj can not seek to justify negative credibility findings by ignoring competent evidence in the record that suggests an opposite result.gallant heckler,cir.that is exactly what happened in this case.
an alj must specifically identify what evidence undermines the claimant complaints.lester,at.see also embrey bowen,cir.the alj stated that rollins complaints were not reflected in her daily activities and were too vague.a review of the full record,however,reveals a very different picture than the conclusory sketch drawn by the alj.
an ability to keep to an a day,a week schedule without accumulating too many absences is a for many jobs.it therefore is a factor in determining a claimant residual functional capacity.ssr.see also a and a reddick,at holding that it was legal error for alj to fail to take into account claimant capacity to undertake sustained work activity.rollins testified that her pain and fatigue were too severe to enable her to keep a regular work schedule the alj disagreed,opining that rollins daily activities belied her complaint.while it is true that the activities that the alj listed comport with the lifestyle of a relatively healthy individual,he did not list the activities that rollins actually described.
rollins is now a single mother of two boys.the alj,in rebutting her pain testimony,wrote that she did the cooking,light housekeeping,laundry,shopping,drove the children to school occasionally,and when they were in sports,drove them to their practices and games,and went to their games.in fact,rollins testified that she rarely cooked and then usually only frozen foods or hot dogs that the only housework she did was the dishes and even this she is unable to complete two or three nights a week that it takes her almost two hours to make it through the grocery store and she requires help unpacking her cart and getting her bags to the car and that during her bad days she could not drive her children to sports and a neighbor would do it or the children would miss their game.none of this contradicts her statements about being in extreme,though fluctuating,pain 
the alj also found probative the fact that rollins attended aa meetings,monthly pain management meetings,and church every other week and that rollins appears to be capable of meeting all these various temporal commitments on a regular,recurring basis.again,this is not what rollins testified.instead,she said that she was often in too much pain to go to church and that the last time she went she had only lasted to minutes of an hour and a half service that sometimes she has to leave the aa meetings because it is too painful to sit and that when she is having a bad day she is unable to drive to the doctor office.she testified that she had to stop her extra activities such as being a room mom and te am mom due to her pain and fatigue.contrary to the alj portrait of rollins as capable of caring for her two boys,she also testified that on days when she has debilitating migraines her children either take care of themselves or a neighbor or her helps out 
there was also credible medical evidence that rollins suffers from migraine headaches that keep her in bed once or twice a month.the alj said that her complaints were vague.on the contrary,her testimony was that she has good days and ba
