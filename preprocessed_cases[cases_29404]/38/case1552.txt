discussion 
jurisdiction 
as a preliminary matter,we must determine whether we have jurisdiction to entertain nyeholt petition under.section provides in relevant part that 
an action of the secretary to which section a or of title or both refers other than an action relating to the adoption or revision of the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title is subject to judicial review.such review shall be in accordance with chapter of title and may be sought only in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
emphasis added.
nyeholt argues that we have jurisdiction to hear his challenge to dc because,although excludes actions relating to the schedule of ratings from its grant of jurisdiction,it does not specifically preclude constitutional challenges from being brought under that provision.nyeholt argues that under the supreme court decision in johnson robison,d,which addressed an earlier statute delineating the scope of review of a decision of the dva,clear and convincing evidence is needed in order to overcome the presumption that judicial review is available for constitutional challenges to the schedule of ratings.nyeholt contends that neither the language of nor its legislative history provides such evidence,and further argues that the only relevant legislative history addressing the issue,a statement in a report issued by the house veterans affairs committee,is directly to the contrary.
the secretary of veterans affairs responds that the statutory scheme created by the text and legislative history of,when read in conjunction with those of a and b,clearly establishes that congress has foreclosed all judicial review of matters pertaining to the rating schedule and thus overcomes the presumption that judicial review of constitutional challenges is available.the secretary also argues that there is no indication in that congress intended to exempt constitutional challenges from its blanket prohibition on judicial review,contrary to the express provision for review of constitutional challenges in c and d the secretary further contends that because the house veterans affairs committee statement relied upon by nyeholt appears nowhere in the corresponding senate report,there is no indication that the full congress adopted that statement.finally,the secretary argues that nyeholt reliance on johnson is misplaced because that case addressed a different jurisdictional statute and involved a challenge to a legislative enactment,rather than an administrative enactment such as dc.
we conclude that we have jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges to the schedule of ratings under.only upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of congressional intent may access to judicial review be restricted.abbott labs.gardner,d.the evidence relied upon by the secretary in arguing that we lack jurisdiction under over constitutional challenges relating to the schedule of ratings falls short of that standard.
although plainly excepts from appealability actions relating to the schedule of ratings from its jurisdictional grant,nowhere in the text of that provision are constitutional challenges mentioned.the secretary acknowledges that fact,but argues that the express provision for review of constitutional challenges in c and d,and the absence of any corresponding reference in,demonstrates that congress did not intend to provide this court with the power to review such challenges under.he thus in effect argues that the implication created by the presence of a provision in one portion of a statute here,and the absence of that provision in another here,can constitute the clear and convincing evidence of jurisdictional restriction needed to arrive at the conclusion that congress intended to preclude this court from reviewing constitutional challenges.however,aside from the fact that adopting the secretary argument would act to reverse the presumption that review of constitutional challenges is available under,the only relevant legislative history is directly to the contrary.
as noted by nyeholt,the house veterans affairs committee report made clear that it intended to expressly preclude review of the schedule in the bill except for challenges to the constitutionality of the schedule,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.this statement,although not conclusive of the intent of congress,indicates that review of constitutional challenges to the schedule of ratings was to be preserved.furthermore,the fact that the corresponding senate report does not include a similar statement can not be interpreted as evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption that judicial review of constitutional challenges is available.rather,absent an express provision that such review is prohibited,we read the legislative history,such as it is,as confirming our view that congress did not intend to preclude constitutional challenges from review under.griffith fed.labor relations,holding that a conference committee deletion of a provision in the original senate bill expressly providing for review of constitutional claims did not support an inference strong enough to satisfy the clear and convincing evidence standard for precluding constitutional challenges.
furthermore,our conclusion that we have jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges under is on all fours with the supreme court analysis in johnson.johnson involved the identical issue presented in this case,albeit in the context of an earlier,statute,a,which governed appeals from decisions of the veterans administration,the predecessor to the dva.that provision read in relevant part as follows 
t he decisions of the administrator on any question of law or fact under any law administered by the veterans administration providing benefits for veterans shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the united states shall have power or jurisdiction to review any such decision by an action in the nature of mandamus or otherwise.
