this case concerns whether members of the houston municipal employees pension system hmeps may bring a declaratory judgment action to declare their rights under the statute that created hmeps even when,as hmeps argues,that statute provides no right to judicial review of decisions by hmeps pension board.hmeps sought the dismissal,for want of jurisdiction,of an action for injunctive relief and declaratory judgment brought by craig ferrell,and other plaintiffs plaintiffs,collectively.the trial court issued an interlocutory order denying hmeps jurisdictional plea,and the court of appeals affirmed the trial court order,dist.hmeps appealed to this court contending the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial court denial of hmeps jurisdictional plea and in analyzing the case under the doctrine of exclusive jurisdiction,rather than holding that article of the texas revised civil statutes provides no right to judicial review of pension board decisions and ferrell claims are barred by sovereign immunity on the day ferrell response to hmeps petition for review was due to be filed,ferrell took a voluntary without prejudice.we hold ferrell has an absolute right to his claims,and,because ferrell case is now moot,we vacate the court of appeals judgment as to ferrell and the trial court orders to the extent that they affect ferrell claims,and we dismiss ferrell case.we further hold that the plaintiffs who joined ferrell action are not entitled to seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in this case.we therefore reverse the court of appeals judgment as to the plaintiffs and dismiss their claims for want of jurisdiction.

ferrell began his law enforcement career as a cadet in the houston police academy and,from to,served as a police officer in the houston police department.during that period,ferrell participated in the houston police officers pension system hpops.in,having obtained a law degree,ferrell went to work for the legal services division of the houston police department,where he still works.because he was no longer classified as a police officer,he withdrew his contributions from hpops and began accruing credit in hmeps,a separate pension system covering employees of the city of houston.in,hmeps issued a written acknowledgment of statutory application which read,in pertinent part 
a person is not eligible for hmeps membership for the time period during which the person was in a position covered by another pension system to which the city of houston contributes city pension system.
a person can not receive any credited service in hmeps for the time during which the person was not a member of hmeps.
later that year,ferrell requested that hmeps award him service credit for the time he spent as a police officer.in january,hmeps executive director david long sent ferrell a letter denying his request and informing him that a person may receive credited service in hmeps only for time during which the person is a member of hmeps.
in march,ferrell sued hmeps on multiple theories,including breach of fiduciary duty,breach of contract,and negligent misrepresentation.ferrell also sought a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to pension benefits in hmeps for each year he worked for the city of houston,beginning in.hmeps filed a motion to dismiss,or plea to the jurisdiction,seeking to dismiss ferrell suit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis of sovereign immunity.ferrell then amended his petition,dropping all claims except his action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief.in a second amended petition,ferrell expressly eliminated any request for money damages but sought an additional declaration that he was entitled to service credit in hmeps for his time in the houston police academy.
subsequently,in a first supplemental petition,houston police officers joined ferrell action for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief specifically,they sought a declaration that they were entitled to service credit in hmeps for the time they spent as cadets in the houston police academy,from may to september,and an order directing the board to credit their retirement service accounts accordingly.the plaintiffs allege they originally requested such credit from the pension board in a march letter.hmeps claims to have no record of any such letter.regardless,the record shows that hmeps became aware of the plaintiffs claims when the plaintiffs joined ferrell action,if not before,and the record further indicates the pension board has not yet made a determination as to those claims 
in a supplemental motion to dismiss,hmeps again asserted it was immune from suit and contended the actions brought by ferrell and the additional plaintiffs were not ripe because hmeps had not yet determined whether they were entitled to service credit for their time spent in the police academy.hmeps also asserted the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over ferrell claim for service credit for the years of his employment as a police officer because a declaratory judgment in his favor would entitle him to pension benefits exceeding the maximum jurisdictional limit of the trial court.
the trial court denied hmeps plea to the jurisdiction solely on the basis of hmeps assertion that it was immune from suit.hmeps appealed to the court of appeals which,holding the doctrine of exclusive jurisdiction does not apply in the context of this action for declaratory judgment,affirmed the trial court denial of hmeps plea to the jurisdiction.at.hmeps then timely filed this appeal.
