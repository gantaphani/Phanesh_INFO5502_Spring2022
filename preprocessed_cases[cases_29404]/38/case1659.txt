the city of los angeles petitioned for review of an order of the workers compensation appeals board wcab awarding a full,death benefit to the california department of industrial relations,death without dependents unit dwd unit,pursuant to labor code section,subdivision a notwithstanding the city payment of in death benefits to the estate of jaime foster pursuant to section,subdivision a b.because the escheat of a death benefit to the state after partial payment to the estate of a deceased effect,the award of two death benefits for a single inconsistent with the governing statutes and the legislative policy they implement,we annul the order.
factual and procedural background 
jaime foster was employed as a firefighter by the city.while on duty on the afternoon of august,foster was involved in a fatal accident at the time of her death foster was years old she was not married and had no children or other dependents within the meaning of sections through.foster died intestate.
the city promptly began advancing workers compensation death benefits to foster mother,gloria foster,pursuant to section,subdivision a b,which provides,except as otherwise provided in this section,the death benefit in cases of total dependency shall be as follows for injuries occurring on or after january,in the case of no total dependents and no partial dependents,two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the estate of the deceased employee.the city reported the payments to gloria foster on a form filed with the department of industrial relations on september.
on november,the dwd unit filed an application for adjudication of claim with the local district office of the wcab in los angeles,alleging foster died without dependents and seeking payment of death benefits from the city pursuant to section,subdivision a,which provides,whenever any fatal injury is suffered by an employee under circumstances that would entitle the employee to compensation benefits,but for his or her death,and the employee does not leave surviving any person entitled to a dependency death benefit,the employer shall pay a sum to the department of industrial relations equal to the total dependency death benefit that would be payable to a surviving spouse with no dependent minor children for injuries occurring on or after july,but before january.the city filed an answer disputing the dwd unit claim because it was paying a death benefit to foster mother.
on august,gloria foster filed a formal application for death benefits.also on august,gloria foster filed a petition,and then on october,an amended petition,to be appointed administrator of her daughter estate under the independent administration of estates act.the amended petition listed gloria foster as jaime foster sole heir and identified as property of the estate only an unliquidated amount of damages from a potential lawsuit concerning foster death.at the city request,the claims of the dwd unit and gloria foster on behalf of the estate of jaime foster were consolidated.
on july,the governor signed into law assembly bill reg.sess,which amended section by adding new subdivision h this section does not apply where there is no surviving person entitled to a dependency death benefit or accrued and unpaid compensation if a death benefit is paid to any person under paragraph of subdivision a of section.see stats,ch.uncodified section of assembly bill declares subdivision h is intended to clarify existing statutory requirements.stats,ch,i t is the intent of the legislature to clarify existing statutory requirements governing the payment of death benefits to the survivors of deceased employees under the workers compensation system when the employee suffered a fatal injury.
on november,division three of this court held section,subdivision a b,unconstitutional because the california constitution enabling provision for the workers compensation law cal,art.xiv,does not identify workers estates as a permissible class of beneficiaries.six flags,workers comp.appeals bd.th,d six flags.immediately thereafter,the city filed a petition to terminate liability for death benefits to the estate and to dismiss gloria foster claim.on july,the workers compensation administration law judge granted the city petition.by this time the city had paid in death benefits to the estate of jaime foster.
the dwd unit claim proceeded to trial.on march,the workers compensation administrative law judge ordered the city to pay the dwd unit less credit for previously paid to the estate of jaime foster.the judge explained,the only issue in this matter is whether defendant the city is entitled to a credit for the money they paid pursuant to a conflicting but enacted law at the time the payments were made.this court believes that equity requires that a credit be given in this matter.the defendant in this matter paid benefits pursuant to a valid and existing law passed by the state of california to now allow another state agency to collect the death benefit without credit because the law was declared unconstitutional,appears to this court to be i nequitable.
the dwd unit petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.in his report on reconsideration recommending the petition be denied,the workers compensation administrative law judge defended his initial decision the history of death benefits in california workers compensation law has always provided that the death without dependents unit would receive no death benefits,where family member dependents were entitled to benefits.while the new statute provided for payment of death benefits to the deceased worker heir and not dependents,it is equally clear the legislative intent was to terminate dwd right to death benefits where labor code a is applicable.this fact is evidenced by the passage of legislative bill ab,which provided that no payment was due dwd where an estate was paid under labor code a.while this bill was passed,it never went into effect because of the decision in the six flags case.the bill,however,indicates that the legislature acknowledged a conflict and would have resolved it in favor of the city in this matter.
the wcab granted reconsideration and ordered the city to pay the full death benefit to the dwd unit under section,subdivision a,with no credit for sums paid in death benefits to the estate of jaime foster pursuant to section,subdivision a b.the wcab explained section,subdivision a,requires an employer to pay a death benefit to the dwd unit when an employee with no dependents dies as a result of an injury that arose out of or in connection with employment.prior to its invalidation in six flags,section,subdivision a b,required an employer to pay a death benefit to the estate of a deceased employee with no dependents who had died as a result of an injury that arose out of or in connection with employment.when the legislature added subdivision a to section provisions for the payment of death benefits in,it did not amend section,subdivision a requirement for payment to the dwd unit.accordingly,the wcab concluded,there is no actual conflict between the two statutes.at the time the applications were filed in this case,defendant was obligated to pay benefits to both dwd and the deceased estate.
unlike the workers compensation administrative law judge,the wcab did not find the legislature enactment of new subdivision h to section significant,noting the effective date for the new provision was january.however,because the six flags decision had invalidated section,subdivision a b,prior to that date,section h likewise became inoperative,since it depended on the unconstitutional statute for its operation.finally,whether or not the failure to credit the city for its payments to the estate of jamie foster was inequitable,the wcab concluded it lacked authority for allowing a credit against an amount due to dwd pursuant to an unambiguous and unchanged statute for an amount paid to another party pursuant to a statute that has been declared invalid.
the city petitioned the wcab for reconsideration.the wcab denied the petition,reiterating its view that the city was liable for death benefits under both section,subdivision a b,and section,subdivision a,until the former provision was found unconstitutional in six flags and that section,subdivision h,does not assist the city because it never became operative.
on the city petition,we issued a writ of review on june.prior to oral argument,we invited the parties to submit supplemental letter briefs addressing whether,if this court were to agree with the city interpretation of its obligations under sections,subdivision a b,and,subdivision a,the remedy would be to relieve the city of all responsibility for any payment to the dwd unit,or to order a credit for payments it had made to gloria foster or the decedent estate.

the constitutional and statutory provisions for death benefits and other payments on the death of an injured employee 
article xiv,section of the state constitution authorizes the legislature to create a comprehensive system of workers compensation the legislature is hereby expressly vested with plenary power,unlimited by any provision of this constitution,to create,and enforce a complete system of workers compensation,by appropriate legislation,and in that behalf to create and enforce a liability on the part of any or all persons to compensate any or all of their workers for injury or disability,and their dependents for death incurred or sustained by the said workers in the course of their employment,irrespective of the fault of any party.paragraph of this section,approved by the voters as a constitutional amendment in to former art.xx,added to the legislatures authority the power to provide for the payment of an award to the state in the case of the death,arising out of and in the course of the employment,of an employee without dependents see six flags,supra,th at,d travelers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.d.travelers ins.e scheat to the state of california of workers compensation death benefits required a specific amendment of article xx,section,of the constitution now art.xiv,the constitutional provision authorizing the workers compensation act.
as it has for more than years,section provides the death of an injured employee does not affect the liability of an employer for accrued and unpaid expenses for medical treatment or disability benefits.any such sums are to be paid to the dependents,or,if there are no dependents,to the personal representative of the deceased employee or heirs or other persons entitled thereto,without administration.
section provides,when an injury arising out of or in connection with employment causes death,with or without disability,the employer shall be liable,in addition to any other benefits provided by this division,for all of the following a reasonable expenses of the employee burial not exceeding five thousand dollars.b a death benefit,to be allowed to the dependents when the employee leaves any person dependent upon him or her for support.
sections and prescribe the amount of the dependency death benefit,as authorized by section,subdivision b,and specify the allocation of the death benefit when there is more than one dependent.for example,if an employee had two total dependents,and regardless of the number of partial dependents,the death benefit for injuries occurring between july,and december,was,and for injuries occurring on or after january,is,subd.a.the death benefit in this example would be divided equally between the two total dependents,par.i f there is more than one person wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee,the death benefit shall be divided equally among them.
by its literal terms section,subdivision a,purports to set the amount of death benefit only in cases of total dependency.this notwithstanding,section,subdivision a a and b provide for an award of a death benefit i n the case of no total dependents and one or more partial dependents.similarly,section,subdivision a b,added in,as amended in,provides a death benefit f or injuries occurring on or after january,in the case of no total dependents and no partial dependents,two hundred fifty thousand dollars to the estate of the deceased employee.
section,enacted upon voter approval of the constitutional amendment authorizing the escheat of death benefits to the state see atlantic richfield workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,atlantic richfield travelers,supra,d at,provides in subdivision b,where the deceased employee leaves no surviving dependent,personal representative,heir,or other person entitled to the accrued and unpaid compensation referred to in section,the accrued and unpaid compensation shall be paid by the employer to the department of industrial relations.with respect to death benefits,rather than unpaid compensation,subdivision a provides,whenever any fatal injury is suffered by an employee under circumstances that would entitle the employee to compensation benefits,but for his or her death,and the employee does not leave surviving any person entitled to a dependency death benefit,the employer shall pay a sum to the department of industrial relations equal to the total dependency death benefit that would be payable to a surviving spouse with no dependent minor children for injuries occurring on or after july,but before january.subdivision h,added to section in by assembly bill reg.sess,provides,this section does not apply where there is no surviving person entitled to a dependency death benefit or accrued and unpaid compensation if a death benefit is paid to any person under paragraph of subdivision a of section.see stats,ch.
the six flags decision 
in six flags,supra,th,d our colleagues in division three invalidated section,subdivision a b,holding the legislature was not authorized by the state constitution to direct workers compensation death benefits to a deceased worker estate a constitutional amendment to article xiv,section,adding deceased workers estates as a class of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation benefits,is necessary before the legislature is empowered to promulgate a statute awarding workers compensation death benefits to a deceased worker estate.six flags,at,d.in reaching this conclusion the court first summarized the supreme court decisions in commercial cas.ins.indus.acc.com.cal,and yosemite industrial acc.com.cal,overturning legislation that had required an employer to pay specified sums to a state fund to benefit workers in general if an employee suffered a fatal injury in the course of his or employment and left no dependents to whom a death benefit could be paid.see six flags,at,d.the six flags court then reviewed the constitutional amendment and the ballot pamphlet distributed to voters,which explained the legislature lacked the authority to require an award of workers compensation death benefits to the state absent an amendment to the constitution specifically designating the state as a permissible beneficiary of such an award.id.at,d.
based upon the rationale of commercial cas.ins.indus.acc,supra,cal,and yosemite industrial acc,supra,cal,as well as the supreme court amendment decision in atlantic richfield,supra,cal d,division three held the legislature plenary power under article xiv,section,can be used only for the purposes set forth in the other section of that constitutional provision t he legislature in the exercise of its plenary power to establish a complete system of workers compensation did not have authority to expand by statute the classes of beneficiaries entitled to workers compensation death benefits beyond the three beneficiary classes,workers,dependents,and the state,identified in article xiv,section.six flags,supra,th at,d.finally,the court held estates are not dependents within the meaning of sections through six flags,at,d and concluded an award of a death benefit to a nondependent estate does not further the underlying policy of the workers compensation laws,which is to compensate workers and their dependents for a loss of earnings based upon death.id.at,d.
the legislature did not intend to require an employer to pay death benefits both to the estate or surviving heirs of a deceased employee and to the dwd unit 
the wcab decision in favor of the dwd unit in this case is straightforward a deceased employee estate can not be a dependent of the employee under sections through,as division three of this court held in six flags.six flags,supra,th at,d.payment of a death benefit to an estate,therefore,does not constitute payment of a death benefit to a dependent.see id.at,d.accordingly,even though payment to the deceased employee estate was mandated by section,subdivision a b,because foster left no survivor entitled to a dependency death benefit,her employer the city was also obligated to pay the dwd unit pursuant to section,subdivision a.
death benefits are payable to the state only if no other payment of death benefits is authorized by statute 
even considering only the literal meaning of the applicable statutes,the wcab reasoning is problematic.the first sentence of section,subdivision a,specifies,e xcept as otherwise provided,the death benefit in cases of total dependency shall be as follows italics added.the legislature then prescribes a variety of payments in six separately numbered subparagraphs,all under the label death benefit in cases of total dependency.see,subd.a.yet,as previously discussed,not all those payments are for cases of total a provides for payments in cases of partial dependency when there are no total dependents,and subdivision a for payments when there are neither total nor partial dependents.
given that the legislature has categorized all these payments as death benefits in cases of total dependency in section,subdivision a,even though some are not,if we consider that section and section as parts of a unified whole,there is no compelling reason not to construe similar language in section,which refers to dependency death benefits,also to include all of those payments,even if that term might have a different meaning in another context.see generally in re marriage of harris cal th,d,we do not construe statutes in isolation,but rather read every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.that is,although the terminology in the two provisions differs to some extent,it is reasonable to conclude the legislature intended when it enacted section to authorize payment of a statutory death benefit to the state only if there is no person qualified to claim a death benefit under section.see travelers,supra,d at.provides for escheat to the state only when no other payment of death benefits is properly made atlantic richfield,supra,cal d at,the state is not entitled to any payment in death benefit cases of partial dependency.
in fact,when subdivision a was initially added to section by assembly bill reg.sess,the same legislation also created a new subsection c to section,conclusively presuming the surviving parent or parents of a deceased employee to be wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee i n the event that no person qualifies as a total or partial dependent of the deceased employee stats,ch.in other words,a surviving parent like gloria foster was conclusively presumed to be a dependent for purposes of the statutory death benefit when the deceased employee had no real dependents.as described at page of the report by the assembly committee on insurance on assembly bill reg.sess,as amended january,these new provisions clarif y that when an employee dies without dependents,death benefits will be paid to the parent s or,if there are no surviving parents,to the employee estate.nothing in the language of assembly bill itself or in its legislative history suggests an intent to require the employer to pay this death benefit to a deceased employee parents or his or her estate and also to make an additional death benefit payment to the dwd unit pursuant to section,subdivision a.
death benefits can not escheat to the state if a benefit is paid to a deceased employee dependents or legal heirs 
as division three explained nearly years before its decision in six flags,section is limited by and must be interpreted consistently with the constitutional amendment that permitted the legislature to authorize the escheat of death benefits to the state.travelers,supra,d at.see also atlantic richfield,supra,cal d at,there is precedent in this area for the proposition that the legislature may not go beyond the precise terms of the constitutional enabling,perhaps,that it may use its plenary or police powers to promote the overall purposes of the workers compensation scheme.to be sure,the constitutional amendment was specifically directed to an award to the state in the case of the death,arising out of and in the course of the employment,of an employee without dependents.but,as noted by both the supreme court in atlantic richfield,at page,and division three in travelers,at page,consistent with the doctrine of escheat the unopposed ballot argument in favor of the proposition spoke in terms of legal heirs,not dependents under existing law the death benefits from workmen compensation award,which normally are paid to legal heirs,are paid to no one if legal heirs can not be found.a yes vote on proposition would allow the legislature to enact laws which would require that such benefits be paid to a state fund when no legal heirs can be found.
although jaime foster died without dependents,her mother was her legal heir.under section any accrued and unpaid compensation for medical treatment or disability benefits would have been paid to her,and under section,subdivision b,the dwd unit would have no claim to any such compensation.until invalidated by the court in six flags,supra,th,d,foster mother similarly was entitled to a death benefit under section,subdivision a b,as her sole legal heir.as described in the ballot argument,because those benefits were paid to foster legal heir,no escheat to the state would be warranted and none is authorized if section is interpreted consistently with the legislative history of the constitutional amendment.see travelers,supra,d at.t he voters pamphlet,however,discusses the amendment in terms of the state receiving the death benefit where the employee dies without dependents amendment summary leaves no dependent heirs cost analysi
