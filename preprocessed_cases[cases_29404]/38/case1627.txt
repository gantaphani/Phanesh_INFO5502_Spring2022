since,retired employees of the city and county of san francisco the city have been eligible to receive a supplemental cost of living allowance supplemental cola as part of their pension benefits when the retirement fund earnings from the previous year exceeded projected earnings.on november,city voters passed proposition c,an initiative measure that,among other things,amended the charter of the city and county of san francisco to condition the payment of the supplemental cola on the retirement fund being fully funded based on the market value of the assets for the previous year.
protect our benefits pob,a political action committee representing the interests of retired city employees,appeals from a superior court order denying its petition for writ of mandate seeking to invalidate this amendment as an impairment of a vested contractual pension right under the contract clauses of the federal and state constitutions with respect to current city employees and employees who retired after the supplemental cola first went into effect on november,we agree the full funding requirement can not stand.with respect to employees who retired prior to november,we conclude they had no vested contractual right in the supplemental cola and that consequently,the amendment may be applied to their pensions.we reject pob claim that the full funding requirement must be set aside for the additional reason that the board of supervisors for the city and county of san francisco board of supervisors failed to obtain an adequate actuarial report before placing proposition c on the november,ballot 
factual and procedural history 
san francisco public pension plan 
the city operates its own retirement system,which is known as the san francisco employees retirement system sfers and is overseen by the city retirement board.sfers administers a pension plan that pays defined benefits to retired city employees based on their years of service,age of retirement and the highest amount of their compensation for a specified period.see mason retirement board th.the funding for pension benefits comes from three sources contributions from current city employees,contributions from the city,and investment earnings on assets sfers holds in trust for retirees the fund.
as part of its administration of the fund,the retirement board retains an independent actuary to produce an actuarial valuation of the fund each year.the actuarial valuation method used for the fund includes a smoothing technique in which gains or losses in asset values are spread out over a period,thus dampening the volatility of the valuation of the fund assets.the actuary also calculates the funding ratio,that is,the ratio of the fund assets to its actuarial liabilities when the fund assets exceed its actuarial liabilities,it is said to be fully funded.the valuation of the fund and its funding ratio can also be calculated on a market basis,which measures the fair market value of the fund assets if the entire portfolio were to be liquidated as of a certain date,and compares that valuation to the fund actuarial liabilities.in any given year,the actuarial valuation of the fund might exceed the market valuation,or vice versa.
according to a actuarial valuation report,the fund was fully funded,on both an actuarial and a market basis,during each fiscal year from through.the fund was not fully funded during fiscal years through,the years coinciding with the national financial crisis that began in.
basic cola 
retired city employees have long been eligible to receive an annual cost of living adjustment to their pension payments based on changes in the consumer price index the basic cola,generally of up to two percent.
supplemental cola 
in the election held on november,city voters adopted proposition c,an initiative measure amending the city charter charter to establish a supplemental cola for city retirees in addition to the basic cola.proposition c added charter section,which required all earnings of the retirement fund in the previous fiscal year which are in excess of the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets to be placed in a reserve account and used to pay a supplemental cola of up to three percent of current benefits,inclusive of the basic cola.charter,a,added.expected earnings were defined as the earnings projected by the actuarial assumption for return on assets that was in place for that fiscal year.ibid.
charter section did not initially provide that the supplemental cola would be added to a retiree pension on a permanent basis.rather,in years when the funds in the reserve account were insufficient to pay the supplemental cola,pensions would revert to the level they would have been if supplemental cost of living adjustments had never been made.charter,b,added.the amount of money placed in the reserve account would not exceed the amount necessary for the immediate fiscal year and the following two years,and,as the ballot digest explained the reserve account would not be used to offset years of investment income,or to reduce the city contributions to the retirement system.however,when the reserve account had enough money to fund three years of cola increases,any additional money would be used to offset years and to reduce the city contributions to the retirement system.voter information pamp.
supplemental cola made permanent 
on march,city voters passed proposition b,an initiative making the supplemental cola permanent,in the sense that once it had been added to an employee pension payment,it could not be reduced.proposition b amended charter section as follows c on and after june,any supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment,once paid to a member,shall not be reduced thereafter.d on and after june,the reserve account set forth in this section shall be used to finance only the increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments for the next ensuing fiscal year as set forth in section a.if there are insufficient funds in the reserve account to pay the increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments for the next ensuing fiscal year,then the increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments for that fiscal year shall not be paid.however,any excess earnings as defined in this section shall be accumulated until an amount sufficient to make one fiscal year increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustments is reached.charter,c d,as amended.
supplemental cola increased 
on june,city voters passed proposition b,which changed the qualifications for retiree health and pension benefits,established a retiree health care trust fund,and raised the maximum annual amount of the supplemental cola from percent to percent,less the amount of any basic cola.the supplemental cola provisions were placed in newly enacted charter section,which stated that if the excess earnings in a particular year are insufficient to pay a percent supplemental cola,then to the extent of excess earning,said allowances shall be increased in increments of percent up to the maximum three and percent of the allowance as of june,less the amount of any cost of living adjustment charter,b,added june.when the previous year earnings exceeded the expected earnings but were not sufficient to fund any supplemental cola,the retirement board shall reserve the excess earnings for that year.said reserved earnings shall accumulate only until such time that said reserved earnings,plus the next year earnings in excess of the expected earnings on the actuarial value of the assets,are sufficient to fund one fiscal year increase in the supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment,at which time the earnings in reserve shall be withdrawn and used to fund a supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment,subd.c.as under prior law,a ny supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment,once paid to a member,shall not be reduced thereafter,subd.d.
financial crisis and effect on the fund 
in fiscal year,the fund lost about percent of its value due to the financial crisis and economic downturn of that period.consequently,the fund was no longer fully funded,meaning it no longer contained assets sufficient to pay its actuarial liabilities.measured by the actuarial value of its assets,the fund fell from percent funded as of july,to only percent funded as of july.measured by the market value of its assets,the fund went from percent funded as of july,to percent funded as of july.
november,election proposition c 
in the general election held november,city voters adopted proposition c,an initiative measure making numerous changes to the financing and scope of sfers pension benefits and retiree health care.the findings and purpose section of the ballot explained between june and january,the dow jones industrial average declined.this historic decline and the subsequent great recession have harmed the city budget in two ways.first,it caused the city tax and fee revenues to be significantly lower than expected,worsening the city deficit.second,it caused the retirement fund to drop from being fully funded based on the actuarial value of the assets or more than fully funded to being only partially funded.as a result,to make up the shortfall in the retirement fund,the city has had to increase substantially its employer contributions,further exacerbating the city deficit.voter information pamp.
although the changes effected by proposition c were extensive,only one is germane to this case the amendment of charter section d hereafter section d to provide to clarify the intent of the voters when originally enacting this section in,beginning on july,and july of each succeeding year,no supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment shall be payable unless the retirement system was also fully funded based on the market value of its assets for the previous year.charter,d,as amended.the amendment did not change the requirement that excess earnings be reserved when insufficient to fund a supplemental cola and accumulated until they were sufficient to fund a supplemental cola payment,subd.c.
petition for writ of mandate 
pob filed a petition for writ of mandate code civ,challenging the constitutionality of section d.the petition alleged the new full funding requirement impairs vested contractual pension rights under the federal and state constitutions because notwithstanding language in the provision characterizing it as a clarification of existing law,it was a change that diminished the supplemental cola benefit.
the trial court denied the writ petition and entered judgment in favor of the city.in its statement of decision,the court construed section d as doing no more than subjecting retirees to those gains reasonably to be expected from the pension contract.it reasoned section d returns supplemental colas to the purpose for which the voters originally added them to the city charter to allow retirees to share in surplus earnings of the retirement fund when the fund can afford to do so.as the relevant pages from the city voter pamphlets show,the voters enacted supplemental colas in,and expanded them in and,after being assured,in the relevant ballot pamphlet materials,that the retirement fund was fully funded,and that the city was benefiting from the fund investment earnings by making little or no employer contributions to the fund.under such circumstances,the voters were told,it would be unfair not to allow retirees to also share the bounty the voters were urged that if the economically flush times redounded to the benefit of the city and its current employees,then retirees,too,should share that benefit.citation.the legislative history of the relevant charter amendments from onward shows that the availability of supplemental colas was tied to whether the fund was fully funded indeed,were the retirement fund not fully funded in,or,it seems quite unlikely that the voters would have approved or extended supplemental colas,as they did.the court recognized section d technically alter s an obligation of a contract,but concluded it was consistent with the spirit or basic theory for which the voters added and extended supplemental cola benefits to the charter from to.it additionally found that even if section d impaired the contractual rights of current employees and those who retired after the supplemental cola first went into effect in,it did not do so with respect to employees who had by that time already retired because they did not exchange their labors for the benefits created after retirement and for that reason gained no vested contractual rights to them.citations.
pob appeals from the judgment.code civ,subd.a.
ii.discussion 
pob argues section d impairs the vested contractual rights of city workers and pensioners because the full funding requirement reduces the supplemental cola pension benefits.the city responds the trial court ruling was correct,and that even if employees who retired after the supplemental cola first went into effect in had a vested right impaired by the full funding requirement,employees who retired before the supplemental cola was first implemented can not claim such a right.we conclude the amendment may be constitutionally applied to employees who retired before the effective date of the initiative establishing the supplemental cola,but not to current employees or those who retired after the effective date of the initiative

vested pension rights general principles 
a public employee pension constitutes an element of compensation,and a vested contractual right to pension benefits accrues upon acceptance of employment.betts board of administration cal d,betts.unlike other terms of public employment,which are wholly a matter of statute,pension rights are obligations protected by the contract clause of the federal and state constitutions,art.i,cl.cal,art.i.citations.united firefighters of los angeles city city of los angeles d,united firefighters.upon accepting public employment,one acquires a vested right to a pension based on the system then in effect,and to additional pension benefits conferred during his or her subsequent employment.id.at fn.

colas as vested pension rights 
the reduction of a cost of living allowance,without a comparable new advantage,has been held to impair the pension contract.in united firefighters,for example,the voters had approved cost of living adjustments for retired city employees in,d at.the adjustments were tied to the consumer price index and were initially capped at two percent,but a amendment eliminated the cap and allowed the adjustments to fully reflect the amount of inflation each year.ibid.in,the voters passed a charter amendment imposing a three percent cap on the cost of living adjustment.ibid.the court concluded the amendment capping the annual adjustment impaired a vested contractual right to an uncapped adjustment because it burden ed employees with a disadvantage while offering no comparable advantage such as reducing the amount of their pension contributions.id.at.the court rejected the city argument the three percent cap was permissible as to employees hired before the uncapping of the cost of living adjustment in,which was designed to protect the pensioners purchasing power o nce the cost of living adjustment was uncapped in,plaintiffs did have a reasonable expectation that pension benefits earned thereafter would be fully adjusted for inflation and their standards of living thus would be protected from any further diminution.id.at.
similarly,in pasadena police officers association city of pasadena d,pasadena police,the city charter was amended in to provide for a cost of living adjustment in addition to the basic pension,at a rate equal to the annual percentage change in the consumer price index.in,after years of inflation resulting in a dramatic increase in the cost of living adjustments,the city charter was amended to cap the annual cost of living adjustment at two percent for certain members.id.at.the court found the cap impaired a vested right.id.at.
section d impairs a vested pension right to the supplemental cola 
the reasoning of united firefighters and pasadena police applies to section d.before the enactment of section d,sfers retirees were entitled to receive a supplemental cola benefit when the fund actual earnings exceeded expected earnings,without regard to the fund market value or actuarial liabilities.section d conditions the payment of the supplemental cola on the fund being fully funded based on the market value of its assets.because there might be some years in which the fund will earn more than projected,but will not be fully funded under a market value measurement,the full funding requirement results in a detriment to pensioners who would otherwise be entitled to receive the supplemental cola.this diminution in the supplemental cola can not be sustained as reasonable because no comparable advantage was offered to pensioners or employees in return.betts,supra,cal d at.
allen does not support city arguments 
citing allen,supra,cal d at page,the city argues the full funding requirement imposed by section d is permissible under the constitutional principle that laws which restrict a party to those gains reasonably to be expected from the contract are not subject to attack under the contract clause,notwithstanding that they technically alter an obligation of a contract.the decision in allen is distinguishable and does not support the conclusion the full funding requirement under section d was reasonably to be expected by city employees and pensioners.
at issue in allen was the formula for computing the pensions of former state legislators,which had for many years been set at five percent of the current salary for sitting legislators multiplied by the pensioner years of service.allen,supra,cal d at.though this formula in theory allowed for increases in pension benefits enabling retirees to maintain a fairly constant standard of living despite fluctuations in living costs,the compensation for sitting legislators remained stagnant at a month between and,for what was then a job.id.at.
in,the legislature adopted a statute providing for cost of living increases for retired state legislators that was designed to replace the previous formula that had not proved effective in maintaining retirees purchasing power.allen,supra,cal d at.effective january,the legislature was changed to a lawmaking body and legislators were given the power to set their own salaries,which had formerly been fixed by the state constitution.ibid.legislative salaries jumped from a month to annually,with a proviso that this new salary would not be used to compute the pension benefits of any former legislator who had retired before that date.ibid.
former legislators who had served during the term,but had retired before and who had only worked as legislators,obtained a writ of mandate from the superior court compelling the payment of benefits based on the annual salary.allen,supra,cal d at.the supreme court reversed.it reasoned that by implementing a cost of living allowance in,the legislature had extended relief to retirees in a manner that was then within its power,accomplish ing directly what it no longer realistically could expect to occur as an incident of the original statutory scheme.id.at.the original law had held out to the covered employees a fluctuation provision whose theory and objective,whatever its literal means,was to sustain the living standard of the system beneficiaries.this objective was now being met with a substitute formula,which tied the benefit amount to cost indices rather than current salaries.the sharp salary increase to was not tied to the creeping progression of cost indices.neither had it any relevancy to the retirement law objective.that objective was being met by the substitute formula,and the restriction in no way obstructed it.id.at,citing lyon flournoy d,lyon.the restriction preserved the basic character of the earned benefit but withheld a windfall unrelated to its real character.allen,at,citing lyon,at.
the retirees who sought the additional benefit in allen had already been provided with a cost of living adjustment that gave them a superior benefit when compared with the previous system linking pension benefits with the current legislators salaries.to give them the additional cost of living increase they sought based on the substantially higher salary that went into effect after the nature of the job had changed would have given the retired legislators a significant unearned windfall.there is no comparable windfall in the present case,which requires us to determine the permissibility of a restriction on the existing supplemental cola benefit,rather than an entitlement to an unforeseen increase in pension allowances.see teachers retirement bd.genest th,distinguishing allen and finding contract clause violation in provision reducing state obligation to fund a supplemental benefit maintenance allowance for retired teachers united firefighters,supra,d at retirees whose benefits increased when cost of living adjustment was uncapped did not receive a windfall profit,but only their due.
nor did the basic character of the supplemental cola in this case include a full funding requirement based on the market value of the fund.allen,supra,cal d at.excess earnings must be placed in the reserve fund and either used to pay a supplemental cola or accumulated until the funds are sufficient to pay a supplemental cola until the supplemental cola is paid,they can not be used for another purpose.were full funding such a basic component of the supplemental cola,we would expect the charter to contain a provision allowing the city to first use the excess funds to pay down any deficit in the fund as a whole or to offset earnings in other years.that the fund might have been fully funded when the supplemental cola was implemented does not mean the supplemental cola was contingent on full funding.see united firefighters,supra,d at though property taxes had been used to fund cost of living adjustment,city could levy other kind of taxes and the reduction in property taxes following proposition did not justify reduction of the adjustment.
full funding was not a precondition to the supplemental cola before 
the city argues full funding has been a condition of the supplemental cola since its inception,meaning that when section d was amended as part of proposition c in november,it did not reduce that benefit.the city acknowledges none of the previously enacted charter provisions have expressly mentioned full funding as a condition of paying the supplemental cola,but argues the ballot materials from prior elections show such a requirement was implicit.
when interpreting a law added by voter initiative,we look to its language as the best indication of the voters intent.city of claremont kruse th,claremont.when that language is unambiguous,we presume the voters intended the meaning apparent on the face of the provision.ibid.extrinsic materials,such as analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet,may be used to interpret ambiguous language or to confirm the plain meaning of the provision.silicon valley taxpayers garner th,jenkins county of los angeles th.they may not be used to add to or rewrite the provision to conform to an assumed intent that is not apparent in its language.claremont,at.
given the absence of any reference to full funding in the,and supplemental cola provisions,the city suggestion that we glean such a requirement from the ballot materials asks us to employ legislative history in a manner beyond its capacity to shed light on the text of the statute.city of sacramento public employees retirement system th.but,even if we look to the ballot materials to determine the voters intent,we discern no intent to require full funding as a condition of paying the supplemental cola.
initiative proposition c 
we turn first to the ballot materials for proposition c,the initiative that first enacted the supplemental cola,which include a digest of the measure,the controller statement,arguments for and against the measure,and paid arguments for and against the measure.the digest and controller statement do not contribute to our analysis because they do not refer to full funding or the overall financial health of the fund.voter information pamp.
one of the opponents arguments to the measure characterized the supplemental cola as f reely giving away public money and compared it to the habits of juan and eva peron when they controlled argentina in the mid century.in rebuttal,the board of supervisors made the following statement we should improve benefits for retired city employees.it s fair.retired city employees are living at the poverty level after a career of public service.proposition c provides a cost of living adjustment for all retirees including police and fire equal treatment for all retirees.surveys of other public retirement systems show that this protection is a common and accepted plan feature.the retirement fund is more than funded.proposition c does not change this.we can afford this help.voter information pamp,italics added.
the paid arguments in favor of the initiative included the following statement proposition c is fair to the retiree and to the city.retired city employees are entitled to fairness.they dedicated themselves to serving the public.inflation has eroded their purchasing power as much as.many of them receive per month or less.they live below the poverty line.they were promised their benefits would be increased once the retirement fund was funded.now,the fund is more than funded.this year,the city pays nothing into the fund for uniformed employees and a minimal for other employees while employees continue to contribute or more of their pay into the fund.proposition c corrects the unfairness.it time to keep the promise voter information pamp,italics added.
although the quoted portions of the ballot materials refer to the fund being fully funded,they do not suggest full funding is a condition of the proposed supplemental cola.one of the paid arguments against the measure advised the voters the opposite was true prop osition c is fiscally irresponsible.it is questionable business practice to funnel excess earnings into a reserve account to fund additional benefits,as required by the legislation,without specifying how to balance the general retirement fund in years of earnings.the city controller projects that cost in years would be about million in dollars.vote no on voter information pamp,italics added.
from the arguments for and against the measure,the voters in would have understood that while the fund was currently funded,there was no provision requiring that excess funds be used to maintain that level of funding.this was the primary complaint of one of the opponents of the measure,which advised voters to reject the supplemental cola precisely because the excess earnings should instead be used to balance the fund as a whole in years when earnings did not exceed expectations.voter information pamp.in light of the information provided in the ballot materials,we can not say the voters intended the supplemental cola to be contingent on full funding.indeed,given that full funding for actuarial purposes is a term of art not defined in the ballot materials,we can not infer voters would have appreciated the difference between the fund ability to meet actuarial liabilities and its ability to meet its current obligations in a particular year.see county of orange association of orange county deputy sheriffs th,fn.orange over the years,the term unfunded liability has created considerable confusion for the readers of actuarial reports.the confusion arises when the term is thought of in the same manner as accounting liabilities.that is,the connotation was that the money was owed by the plan or somehow the plan was deficient.the truth of the matter is that the past service liability and the unfunded liability are a function of the actuarial methods and assumptions used to fund a pension plan.
initiative proposition b 
proposition b,which was passed in,made the supplemental cola permanent.the ballot materials provided to voters included the following statement by the city controller should the proposed amendment be adopted,in my opinion,the cost to the city and county would increase,as estimated by the retirement system actuary,by about million per year for the next years,dropping after years to an ongoing cost of approximately million.however,no cash would be required since the city retirement system has a large surplus.while the cost of this proposal would reduce that surplus,the city nonetheless would not be required to make employer contributions to the retirement system for approximately the next years.voter information pamp,italics added.the proponent argument in favor of proposition b and the paid arguments in favor of proposition b also referred to the surplus in the fund.id.at.
an intent to condition the supplemental cola on full funding can not be gleaned from these ballot materials.while voters were aware the fund currently had a surplus,the language of the initiative itself provided that excess earnings placed in the reserve fund would be used to either pay the supplemental cola or,if not sufficient to do so,accumulated until the supplemental cola could be paid.because the text of proposition b made it clear the excess earnings in the reserve fund could not be used to offset other actuarial liabilities before making the supplemental cola payments as provided,we can not infer the voters intended to make such payments contingent on full funding.ballot materials may be indicative of the voters intent,but they may not be used to nullify the language of the statute as it was in fact enacted.planned parenthood affiliates swoap d.
initiative proposition b 
proposition b,passed in,made significant changes to the funding of the health care system for retired employees.while it also increased the cap on the supplemental cola,this was not the most prominent aspect of the measure.the ballot materials for proposition b in devoted considerably more space to the health care amendments than to the supplemental cola,and made no reference to full funding or a surplus.the voters were simply told the measure would raise the supplemental cola from percent to percent,less the basic cola,and allow for the incremental payment of the supplemental cola when excess funds were insufficient to cover the maximum payment.voter information pamp.june.nothing in the ballot materials suggests the voters intended to condition the supplemental cola on full funding.
section d does not merely clarify existing law 
taking a slightly different tack,the city suggests the initiative merely clarified the law as it already existed because the voters intended to condition supplemental cola payments on full funding when they passed proposition b in.the city relies on the text of section d,which states,to clarify the intent of the voters when originally enacting this section in,beginning on july,and july of each succeeding year,no supplemental cost of living benefit adjustment shall be payable unless the retirement system was also fully funded based on the market value of the assets for the previous year.voter information pamp,emphasis added.
the initiative enacting section raised the supplemental cola from percent to percent and provided for incremental payments to be made in years when funds were not available for the full supplemental cola.thus,if the initiative is construed to impose a full funding condition for the supplemental cola,that requirement could arguably be upheld because pensioners were given a comparable advantage in exchange.betts,supra,cal d at.

for the reasons previously discussed,nothing in the text or ballot materials of the initiative can be construed to tether the supplemental cola to full funding.the bulk of the initiative concerned retiree health benefits and additionally increased the cap on the supplemental cola by half a percent.the ballot materials from do not mention full funding,and there is no indication that issue was on the voters radar at all.there having been no requirement of full funding when the voters passed the initiative,proposition c effected an unmistakable change in when it amended section d.mcclung,supra,cal th at.this aspect of the measure can not be upheld on the theory section d is merely a clarification of existing law.
section d may be applied to employees who retired before november,
sfers pension benefits did not include a supplemental cola until voters approved the addition of section to the charter in the election held november.this provision was effective and operative on november.see cal,art.ii,subd.a initiative measure approved by majority of voters takes effect the day after the election unless the measure provides otherwise thompson board of supervisors d,fn.rules regarding construction of statutes apply to construction of local ordinances.the city argues that even if section d is construed to impair the contractual rights of current employees and employees who retired on or after the effective date of the supplemental cola,employees who had previously retired did not have the same vested rights.we agree.
first,we reject pob contention the city has forfeited the right to challenge the vested right claims of pre november,retirees by failing to raise the issue as an affirmative defense in its answer to the petition for writ of mandate.see marich telecommunications,th,affirmative defense must be pleaded and proved.an affirmative defense is an allegation of new matter in the answer that is not responsive to an essential allegation in the complaint where the answer alleges facts showing that some essential allegation of the complaint is not true,those facts are not new matter,but only a traverse.bank of new york mellon preciado th supp.here,pob alleged in its petition that all city retirees and current employees had a vested right in the supplemental cola the vested nature of the right held by former employees who retired before november,was an essential element of pob causes of action and the city was not required to separately plead the status of those retirees as an affirmative defense.
turning to the merits whether employees who had already retired had a vested right in the supplemental cola a similar issue was addressed in claypool wilson th claypool.in that case,the court considered a challenge to a state law repealing a supplemental cost of living adjustment available to retired state employees and replacing it with a new supplemental cost of living adjustment.id.at.with respect to employees who had retired before the former supplemental colas went into effect,the court found no vested contractual rights were at issue.the contractual basis of a pension right is the exchange of an employee services for the pension right offered by the statute.citation.a member whose employment terminated before enactment of a statute offering additional benefits does not exchange services for the right to the benefits.id.at see olson cory cal d,judicial pensioners whose services terminated before effective date of law providing for unlimited cost of living increase had no vested right to that benefit,though pensioners whose benefits were based on the salary of sitting judges who were entitled to increase were also entitled to increase retirement cases,supra,th at right to pension is defined by the benefits and law in place when an employee is rendering services,not by changes that occur after retirement.
the court conclusion in claypool is consistent with pasadena police,supra,d,in which the court considered the effect of a charter amendment that capped a formerly uncapped cost of living adjustment on city pensions.pasadena police,at.with respect to current employees,the court found the amendment impaired a vested contractual right that was not offset by a comparable benefit ibid.with respect to employees who had retired before any cost of living allowance went into effect,there was no vested right based on the contract in effect during their employment since these members had completed all their years of service and retired before any cola benefit was enacted,they never gave services with the reasonable expectation that their pensions would be adjusted for changes in the cost of living.id.at.however,because these retirees had later given up other benefits to opt into a modified pension plan that included the supplemental cost of living allowance,they had provided the consideration giving rise to a new contractual right to the supplemental cost of living adjustment.id.at.pob has not directed us to any subsequent contract that might entitle employees who retired before november,to a cost of living allowance such as that in pasadena police.
pob cites a number of decisions for the proposition that a pensioner benefits may be increased after retirement based on services previously rendered.sweesy.retirement bd.cal d,sweesy orange,supra,th at nelson city of los angeles d,nelson brummund city of oakland d,brummund.none of these authorities hold that an employee who has already retired has a vested right to a subsequently enacted increase in pension benefits,and pob has cited no case standing for thi
