christine nixon petitions for review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board the board.the board affirmed the decision of the office of personnel management opm denying the petitioner request for survivor annuity benefits under the civil service retirement system csrs.christine nixon office of pers,no,slip op,initial decision.we vacate and remand.
background 
robert nixon worked in the federal civilian service,and participated in the csrs retirement program.nixon and his judy nixon were divorced.on april,they entered into a divorce agreement that provided nixon former spouse with csrs survivor benefits.opm received a copy of the divorce agreement.nixon retired on june.his monthly annuity was reduced because of the provision of survivor benefits to his former spouse.
nixon former wife remarried on march,at age.at that point,she became ineligible for survivor benefits because,under h b i,a former spouse becomes ineligible for survivor annuity benefits upon remarriage before reaching age.the divorce agreement contained a similar provision.nixon apparently requested information from opm about the requirements for terminating his survivor benefits.by letter dated november,opm informed nixon that opm will not develop for your former spouse marriage certificate.it is her or your responsibility to notify opm by sending a copy of the marriage certificate.a certified copy of the marriage certificate can be obtained from the jurisdiction in which she was married.it is a public record.app.at.it appears that nixon made attempts to contact his former spouse directly,and that she refused to cooperate.he also made efforts to contact her through her former attorney,who declined to assist nixon.nixon then made unsuccessful efforts to secure the marriage certificate from public records.
nixon married christine nixon formerly christine walker on december.in order to provide survivor benefits to his new wife under the csrs,nixon was required to make a written election within two years of their marriage.k a on september,nixon sent opm an explaining his desire to substitute survivor benefits for his new wife for those being provided to his 
i was married on and have not sought survivor benefits for my current wife because i have been trying since july to have my taken off because she remarried before age.i have been unsuccessful in finding a copy of my marriage license and your agency will not contact her to ask for a copy.the two year limit since i married my current wife is fast approaching so if i ca get her the whole s urvivor annuity i need to get her the remaining portion of my annuity.
app.at.on september,opm responded,informing nixon of the need to elect survivor benefits for his new wife within two years of their marriage.opm also stated that nixon could still elect the maximum survivor benefit for your spouse and then at a later date provide our office with a copy of her marriage certificate,apparently referring to the certificate from his former spouse remarriage.app.at.nixon subsequently informed opm by letter that he was unable to obtain a copy of his former spouse marriage certificate despite having caused to be searched the public records of the whole state of california with negative results,and,after providing his former spouse married name and mailing address,he asked opm to write her a letter requesting a copy of her marriage certificate since i have no way of obtaining it myself.app.at evidently concerned about the cost of providing benefits for both his current and former spouse,nixon asked opm to determine what amount of survivor annuity my current spouse is entitled to and how much my annuity would be reduced if we should make that election.id.
on october,opm informed nixon that electing maximum survivor benefits for his current spouse would entail an additional monthly reduction in his annuity of,which would entitle his current spouse to receive per month upon nixon death.opm noted that i n the event your former spouse would lose her court awarded benefits the monthly survivor rate for your new spouse would automatically increase to.app.at opm also advised nixon that it is your burden to provide our office with a copy of your former spouse marriage certificate.id.at.nixon did not respond,and it is undisputed that he did not submit to opm a formal,written election of survivor benefits for his new wife.on january,opm by letter notified nixon that the time limit for electing survivor benefits for his new wife had elapsed.nixon died on may.
in the course of the board proceeding,opm admitted that nixon was ineligible for survivor benefits retroactive to march,when she remarried.thus,during the entire period between the time of his former wife remarriage in and his death in,nixon annuity was reduced each month to pay for survivor annuity benefits to which his former wife was not entitled.
on june,the petitioner requested survivor benefits from opm.opm denied her request on august,on the ground that nixon did not make the required election.she appealed to the board.in an april,initial decision,the administrative judge affirmed,concluding that the appellant deceased spouse did not file an election and the record establishes no basis for disregarding the express statutory language which requires such election initial decision at.addressing petitioner argument that opm had committed harmful error by failing to independently establish whether nixon was still entitled to a survivor annuity,the administrative judge stated that petitioner had 
failed to show that opm was required to contact judy nixon after robert nixon had informed opm that she had remarried before the age of.the regulations instead make it clear that,if judy nixon remarried before the age of,she was obligated to advise opm that she had remarried within days of her marriage it is understandable that the petitioner and her deceased husband felt exasperated by the situation.however,the appellant did not show that opm regulations required it to take any certain action after robert nixon advised opm that his former spouse had remarried.
id.at emphases added.the administrative judge thus concluded that opm did not commit harmful error by advising nixon that it was not obligated to undertake efforts to determine judy nixon marital status and that nixon had to submit the marriage certificate from his remarriage in order to terminate her survivor benefits.the board decision became final when the petitioner request for review by the full board was denied on october.
the petitioner timely sought review in this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we will affirm the board decision unless it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule or regulation or unsupported by substantial evidence.c yates merit.prot.
the petitioner contends that nixon failed to formally elect survivor benefits for her because opm communications were misleading as to what was required in this case to substitute survivor benefits for survivor benefits when the former spouse had remarried.nixon was concerned about the cost of adding benefits for the petitioner without terminating the deduction for his benefits opm communications led nixon to believe that he could not satisfy opm requirement for terminating the benefits.the petitioner argues that nixon intent to grant her a survivor annuity should be controlling,and that the board denial of her request for benefits was not in accordance with law.
we first consider whether opm was obligated to accurately inform nixon about the costs of electing survivor benefits for his new wife and the mechanism for terminating his benefits upon her remarriage.we conclude that such notice was required.
under the spouse equity act,t he director of the office of personnel management shall,on an annual basis,inform each annuitant of such annuitant rights of election under sections j and k of title,united states code note.thus,opm is required to send annual notices to all annuitants relating to changes they are entitled to make to their survivor annuity elections upon termination of a marriage by divorce,annulment,or death,or remarriage,after retirement.hairston office of pers.this notice is mandatory,brush office of pers,and the information must be correct and not misleading.wood office of pers.when nixon remarried,he was entitled to receive full and accurate notice of his election rights with respect to his new spouse,including accurate information as to the costs of electing a survivor annuity for his new spouse.
we next address whether,in the circumstances of this case,the notices sent to nixon were misleading.we conclude that they were,insofar as,in its october,letter,opm stated that the cost of the survivor annuity deduction could not be reduced unless nixon himself established that his former spouse had remarried,unassisted by opm,notwithstanding what nixon had told opm about his unsuccessful efforts to obtain his former wife marriage certificate.
under section h b i,a former spouse survivor benefits automatically terminate upon remarriage before age,and deductions from the annuitant monthly benefits stop.d however,opm advised nixon that he was obligated to provide proof of his former spouse remarriage.the government contends and the board agreed that b vi b b require an annuitant to submit proof of a former spouse ineligibility before terminating deductions for benefits.the regulations contain no such requirement.rather,they require notice from the former spouse.in applying for survivor benefits,the former spouse must submit to opm a statement that he or she will notify opm within calendar days of the occurrence of any remarriage before age,and opm may subsequently require recertification of such a statement b vi b b.
as indicated above,on two occasions,nixon stated to opm in writing that he wished to apply for a survivor annuity for petitioner.in addition,in his last letter to opm,he wrote that he had been unable to obtain the requested marriage certificate,and he gave opm his former wife married name and mailing address and asked opm to write and request the certificate.
it is true,as the administrative judge noted,that it is the obligation of a former spouse to notify opm of a change in his or her marital status.it is also true that the regulation does not require opm to seek recertification from a former spouse.pursuant to b,opm may require recertification that the former spouse has not remarried before reaching the age of.however,we think that,if a former spouse fails in his or her obligation to notify opm of her remarriage,opm is obligated to check the matter by direct communication,at least when,as here,opm i is told that the former spouse has remarried ii is informed that efforts have been obtain the marriage certificate and iii is provided with the former spouse married name and mailing address.in other words,opm abuses the discretion given to it in section b when it is in possession of the kind of information that it had here but refuses to act by making efforts to contact the former spouse.
the situation here is similar to the one we confronted in muwwakkil office of personnel management.under the spouse equity act,opm must notify a former spouse of an employee request for refund of retirement contributions,j,and under b,an employee on requesting a refund is obligated to inform opm of the existence of a former spouse.in muwwakkil,the employee did not notify opm of his former marriage.at.we held that opm was obligated to determine whether a former spouse existed if it had evidence in its files that there might be a former spouse,even if the employee failed to satisfy the regulatory obligation to disclose a former marriage.id.at.
given the circumstances of this case,opm effort to place the burden of proving his former spouse ineligibility on nixon represented an abuse of its discretion under b.it was also contrary to the policy of the spouse equity act,on which is based.the requirement that nixon submit proof of his former spouse remarriage is predicated on the counterintuitive assumption that the relationship between former spouses is cooperative.in muwwakkil,we stated that the assumption that congress in enacting the spouse equity act intended to allow the financial rights of one former spouse to be subject to the whim and caprice of the other is inconceivable given the acrimonious relationship that often exists between former spouses,and the economic motivation the one might have to misrepresent the facts relating to the financial rights of the other.at.so too,here,placing the burden of proving the ineligibility of his on nixon in the face of what opm knew,at least as of october,would allow the financial rights of one former spouse to be subject to the whim and caprice of the other,a result inconsistent with congressional intent.
in the face of the information that it had received from nixon,opm insistence on october,that it was nixon burden to provide our office with a copy of your former spouse marriage certificate,was an abuse of discretion and,in the circumstances,incorrectly placed the burden on nixon of undertaking further efforts to produce the certificate.in other words,in light of what it had been told,opm incorrectly stated that,unless nixon proved,without any assistance from opm,that his former spouse had remarried,there would be an additional and substantial cost for electing current spouse survivor benefits.
the dissent agrees that,in view of the information nixon provided,opm abused its discretion by refusing his request to contact his former spouse to confirm that she had indeed remarried before age.the dissent notes,however,that even though nixon was misinformed regarding his obligation to obtain the documentation necessary for terminating his former spouse benefits,nothing prevented him from electing survivor benefits for his new wife.under these circumstances,the dissent states,our decision is contrary to office of personnel management richmond,d.in richmond,a civilian retiree richmond who did not wish to exceed a statutory limit on earnings that would disqualify him from continuing to receive a disability annuity based upon his years of civilian service with the navy sought advice from an employee relations specialist at the navy public works center civilian personnel department.richmond sought information about how much he could earn in a retirement job without exceeding the statutory limit.after receiving incorrect information from the personnel department,richmond took employment that caused him to exceed the statutory limit on earnings,as a result of which he lost his disability payments for six months,in the total amount of.id.at.the court ruled that richmond was not entitled to recover the lost payments.it held that the misleading information richmond had received did not estop the government from denying richmond the payments when he exceeded the statutory limit on retirement earnings.id.at.
our holding today is not contrary to richmond.we have recognized the command of richmond.with that recognition,we have stated,however 
the supreme court has held that the government is not generally subject to estoppel or a waiver of restrictions on eligibility for benefits even when the applicant is given misleading information that results in prejudicing his efforts to obtain the benefits.see office of pers.mgmt.richmond,d.congress,however,has specifically directed opm to inform annuitants on an annual basis of their rights to elect survivor annuities for former spouses,and this court has held,reasonably enough,that a statutory directive to provide such information means that the information must be correct and not misleading.it is not a significant extension of that principle to hold that opm is required to provide accurate information to annuitants not only in the document that is denominated the annual notice of election rights,but in any other earlier document opm provides to annuitants on that subject so that the notice is not diluted or contradicted.
we likewise do not think our holding today represents a significant extension of the principle of correct and information.contrary to the dissent,as wood recognized,this statutory obligation is not satisfied simp
