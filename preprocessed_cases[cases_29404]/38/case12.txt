section of the public health services act imposes ceilings on prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to specified health care facilities or covered entities,dominantly,local providers of medical care for the poor.the program program is superintended by the health resources and services administration hrsa,part of the department of health and human services hhs.it is tied to the,much larger medicaid drug rebate program,under which manufacturers gain medicaid coverage for their drugs.to qualify for participation in this program,a manufacturer must enter into a standardized agreement with hhs undertaking to provide rebates to states on their medicaid drug purchases.the amount of the rebates depends on a manufacturer average and best prices,as defined by legislation and regulation.the program,like the medicaid rebate program,uses a form contract as an mechanism.the program also draws on the larger scheme pricing methodology.in the program contract,called the pharmaceutical pricing agreement ppa,manufacturers agree to charge covered entities no more than predetermined ceiling prices,derived from the average and best prices and rebates calculated under the medicaid rebate program.
hrsa may require a manufacturer who overcharges a covered entity to reimburse that entity.hrsa may also terminate the manufacturer ppa,which terminates as well the manufacturer eligibility for medicaid coverage of its drugs.currently,hrsa handles overcharge complaints through informal procedures,but the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca directs the secretary to develop formal procedures.once those procedures are in place,hrsa will reach an administrative resolution,which will be subject to judicial review under the administrative procedure act apa.in addition to authorizing compensation awards to overcharged entities,the ppaca provides for the imposition of monetary penalties payable to the government.
respondent santa clara county county,operator of several entities,filed suit against astra and eight other pharmaceutical companies,alleging that they were overcharging entities in violation of the ppas.asserting that entities are the ppas intended beneficiaries,the county sought compensatory damages for breach of contract.the district court dismissed the complaint,concluding that the ppas conferred no enforceable rights on entities.reversing,the ninth circuit held that,while entities have no right to sue under the statute,they could proceed against drug manufacturers as beneficiaries of the ppas.
held suits by entities to enforce contracts running between drug manufacturers and the secretary of hhs are incompatible with the statutory regime.as the county has conceded,covered entities have no right of action under itself.congress vested authority to oversee compliance with the program in hhs and assigned no auxiliary enforcement role to covered entities.nonetheless,the county maintains that the ppas are contracts enforceable by covered entities as beneficiaries.this argument overlooks that the ppas simply incorporate statutory obligations and record the manufacturers agreement to abide by them.the agreements have no negotiable terms.like the medicaid rebate program agreements,the ppas provide the means by which drug manufacturers opt into the statutory scheme.a suit to enforce an manufacturer agreement,therefore,is in essence a suit to enforce the statute itself.telling in this regard,the county based its suit on allegations that the manufacturers charged more than the ceiling price,not that they violated an independent substantive obligation arising from the ppas.
the ninth circuit reasoned that suits like the county would spread the enforcement burden instead of placing it entirely on the government.but spreading the enforcement burden is hardly what congress contemplated when it made hhs administrator of the interdependent medicaid rebate program and program.suits by entities would undermine the agency efforts to administer these two programs harmoniously and uniformly.notably,the medicaid rebate program statute prohibits hhs from disclosing pricing information that could reveal the prices a manufacturer charges for its drugs.had congress meant to leave open the prospect of beneficiary suits by entities,it likely would not have barred them from obtaining the very information necessary to determine whether their asserted rights have been violated.
the ninth circuit noted that hhs office of the inspector general has reported on hrsa inadequate enforcement authority.but congress did not respond to the reports of lax enforcement by inviting entities to launch lawsuits.instead,congress opted to strengthen and formalize hrsa enforcement authority,to make the new adjudicative framework the proper remedy for covered entities complaints,and to render the agency resolution of those complaints binding,subject to judicial review under the apa.

section of the public health services act,supp,imposes ceilings on prices drug manufacturers may charge for medications sold to specified health care facilities.those facilities,here called or covered entities,include public hospitals and community health centers,many of them providers of services to the poor.the program program is superintended by the health resources and services administration hrsa,a unit of the department of health and human services hhs.drug manufacturers opt into the program by signing a form pharmaceutical pricing agreement ppa used nationwide.ppas are not transactional,contracts.they are uniform agreements that recite the responsibilities imposes,respectively,on drug manufacturers and the secretary of hhs.manufacturers eligibility to participate in state medicaid programs is conditioned on their entry into ppas for covered drugs purchased by entities.
it is conceded that congress authorized no private right of action under for covered entities who claim they have been charged prices exceeding the statutory ceiling.this case presents the question whether entities,though accorded no right to sue for overcharges under the statute itself,may nonetheless sue allegedly overcharging manufacturers as beneficiaries of the ppas to which the manufacturers subscribed.we hold that suits by entities to enforce contracts running between drug manufacturers and the secretary of hhs are incompatible with the statutory regime.
congress placed the secretary acting through her designate,hrsa in control of prescriptions.that control could not be maintained were potentially thousands of covered entities permitted to bring suits alleging errors in manufacturers price calculations.if entities may not sue under the statute,it would make scant sense to allow them to sue on a form contract implementing the statute,setting out terms identical to those contained in the statute.though labeled differently,suits to enforce and suits to enforce ppas are in substance one and the same.their treatment,therefore,must be the same,n o matter the clothing in which entities dress their claims.tenet doe.
