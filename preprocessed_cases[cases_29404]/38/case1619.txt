in,the legislature adopted legislation,which as of june,dissolved the redevelopment agencies ra that had been formed by municipalities throughout the state under the provisions of the community redevelopment law health et hereafter crl.see see also assem.bill ex.session hereafter ab.before their dissolution,the operations of ra were funded by way of tax increment financing.
ab provided a fairly detailed scheme for winding down the operations of ra,distributing their assets,and resolving claims against them.in particular,ab created successor agencies that were given responsibility over certain obligations of each dissolved ra.importantly,under the dissolution legislation,the liability of successor agencies was limited to the value of the assets those agencies received from their respective predecessor ra.
shortly before the legislature dissolved ra,plaintiffs and appellants virginia macy,a resident of the city libreria del pueblo,and california partnership collectively plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate against the fontana redevelopment agency the agency,alleging the agency failed to provide the low and housing required under the crl.plaintiffs asked for relief in the form of the payment of million into the agency low and housing fund lmihf.
after enactment of ab,plaintiffs amended their petition and added defendant and respondent city of fontana the city,initially in its role as the successor agency provided by ab,and later also in its separate capacity as a municipal corporation.in its capacity as a municipal corporation,the city filed a demurrer to the petition,arguing that under ab only a successor agency may be held liable for the preexisting obligations of an ra.the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
we affirm.under the scheme adopted by the legislature under ab,the liabilities of dissolved ra are limited to the assets transferred to successor agencies.there is nothing in ab,or later amendments to the dissolution legislation,that would extend that liability beyond an ra assets to municipalities and their general funds.as we explain,the low and housing liabilities plaintiffs seek to enforce arose under the crl and were calculated as a percentage of tax increment funds collected by ra prior to dissolution of ra,those liabilities were never the liabilities of municipalities and their general funds.an extension of ra statutory liabilities to municipalities and their general funds would require a very clear expression of the legislature intention to depart from the historical treatment of low and housing obligations no such expression appears in ab or later amendments to the dissolution legislation.
contrary to plaintiffs argument on appeal,neither the city control over the agency,nor a agreement the city made with the agency and a developer with respect to distribution of its tax increment revenue,will support a claim against the city in its municipal capacity.although the city controlled the agency,the city control did not make the city and its general fund liable for the agency obligations with respect to disposition of tax increment revenue.admittedly,under the terms of the agreement,the city received a percentage of the agency tax increment revenue,and in light of the agency obligations to its lmihf,arguably those payments to the city were improper.however,the agreement was subject to a successful validation proceeding brought by the agency,which,as we explain,foreclosed any claims against the city with respect to tax increment funds it received under the agreement.
factual and procedural background 
since,the crl has required that ra use percent of their revenue in support of low and housing.fontana redevelopment agency torres th,fontana i see et as fully set forth in the court opinion in fontana i,for a number of years the agency failed to meet the low and housing obligations imposed on it under the crl.id.at.
in substantial measure,this failure grew out of the agency agreement to pay its tax increment revenue to a developer,who was the predecessor in interest of real party in interest,ten ninety,ten ninety.the agency agreed to pay its tax increment revenues to ten ninety in exchange for capital and construction financing ten ninety provided for the completion of infrastructure improvements needed for development of housing units and related commercial and other use facilities.fontana i,supra,th at.the agreement with ten ninety was called an owner participation agreement opa and,in addition to the agency and ten ninety,by way of amendment,the city became a party to the opa in.
under the amended opa,the agency agreed that its tax increment revenues would be paid to a fiscal agent and that the fiscal agent would pay percent of the revenues to ten ninety and percent of the revenues to the agency and the city.the amended opa stated that the infrastructure ten ninety financed would support the development of low and housing and that the agency payments to ten ninety thereby met the agency low and housing obligations under the crl.the amended opa further stated that the payments the city received under the amended opa were compensation to the city for fiscal costs the city incurred as a result of ten ninety development within the city.importantly,the agency and the city brought a validation action under code of civil procedure section with respect to the amended opa,and a final judgment finding that the amended agreement was valid was entered.
in,the legislature amended section and expressly required that funds for low and housing be used for improvements if the improvements are made as part of a program which results in the new construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing units for low or persons that are directly benefited by the improvement or the agency finds that the improvements are necessary to eliminate a specific conditions that jeopardizes the health or safety of existing low or residents.italics added.
in,the state department of housing and community development the department performed an audit of the agency programs,including in particular its compliance with the crl low and housing obligations.the department audit found that the agency needed to reimburse two of its lmihf a total of million.see fontana i,th at.following the department audit,the agency and the department entered into a settlement agreement under which the agency agreed to pay million into one of its lmihf.ibid.
at the time of the settlement agreement,the agency also approved the issuance of tax allocation bonds totaling million.the agency planned to issue the proceeds of the bonds as a means of meeting its obligations to ten ninety.
the agency brought a validation proceeding in which it sought validation of both its settlement agreement with the department and issuance of the bonds.in fontana i,a resident of the city and a nonprofit community organization,libreria del pueblo,libreria,challenged the validation,and,on appeal,they were successful.the court found that the settlement agreement with the department was not subject to validation under code of civil procedure section and that the bond issue was invalid because,if the bonds were issued,the agency would exceed debt limitations it had adopted.fontana i,supra,th at.in the alternative,the court found the bonds were unlawful because they would perpetuate the agency failure to meet its low and housing obligations.id.at.the court noted the defendants were not challenging the validity of prior implementation plans the agency had adopted,the opa,or any amendment of the opa.id.at.however,the court found that the defendants in fontana i could challenge the validity of the agency new effort,by way of the settlement agreement with the department and the issuance of new bonds,to perpetuate its past unlawful practices.id.at.the court stated what the record inescapably demonstrates is the agency lack of compliance with the required percent contribution for affordable housing since although defendants may not be able to challenge earlier actions by the agency,they should be able to curtail this most recent effort to evade the statutory obligation to provide and promote affordable housing.id.at.
c.these proceedings 
on june,plaintiffs filed a petition for a writ of mandate in which they alleged that the agency was continuing its practice of failing to use percent of its tax increment revenues in support of low and housing,as required by section et.plaintiffs alleged that between and,the agency had failed to pay into its lmihf a total of million otherwise required by section 
ab became effective as of june.under its terms,no new ra could be created,and,as we indicated,it provided a detailed scheme for winding down the activities of existing ra.in short,it provided that,other than an ra housing assets,all assets and liabilities of individual ra would be assumed by individual successor agencies and that the ra housing assets would be assumed by individual housing successors.ab gave any municipality that created an ra the option of becoming either the ra s successor agency,housing successor,or both ab also permitted local housing authority to become housing successors.significantly,ab,discontinued as of june,the obligation of ra and their successors to pay percent of their tax increment revenue in support of low and housing,subd.c,subd.d.
following adoption of ab,the city elected to become the agency successor agency because the city was not willing to do so,the fontana housing authority housing authority became the agency housing successor.in light of the city election,plaintiffs amended their petition to add the city as a defendant in its capacity as the agency successor agency and the housing authority as housing successor.as we indicated at the outset,later plaintiffs amended their petition to add the city in its capacity as a municipal corporation.plaintiffs alleged that under the amended opa the city had assumed responsibility for the agency compliance with the crl and further that it had unlawfully received and continued to unlawfully receive tax increment revenues.
the city,in its capacity as a municipal corporation,demurred to the complaint,and its demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.a judgment of dismissal was entered in the city favor,and plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal 
discussion 
contrary to plaintiffs suggestion on appeal,nothing in the crl itself makes a municipality,such the city,responsible for the obligations of an ra.see pacific states enterprises,city of coachella th,pacific states enterprises.in pacific states enterprises,a developer sued a city alleging breach of contract by the city ra.in affirming an order sustaining the city demurrer without leave to amend,we stated redevelopment agencies are governmental entities which exist by virtue of state law and are separate and distinct from the communities in which they exist.health and safety code section states there is in each community a public body,corporate and politic,known as the redevelopment agency of the community.health and safety code section states an agency may a sue and be sued c make and execute contracts and other instruments necessary or convenient to the exercise of its powers.
and case law holds that the mere fact that the same body of officers acts as the legislative body of two different governmental entities does not mean that the two different governmental entities are,in actuality,one and the same.citations.this principle was perhaps stated most succinctly in the county of continental d opinion thus,the board of supervisors of the los angeles county flood control district which is comprised of the same legislative body of persons as the board of supervisors of the county of los angeles,when acting as such,are not county officers,but state officers,and any action taken by such board is not action by the board of supervisors of the county of los angeles,as such,or of the county of los angeles.d at bracketed material added.
thus,the legislative body which exercises local governmental power within a given jurisdictional territory a community may,if it so chooses,also exercise the powers of the redevelopment agency in that territory.but when a dual capacity legislative body acts as the governing board of a redevelopment agency,it is the redevelopment agency which is acting by and through that legislative body and when that same legislative body acts as the governing body of the community,city over which it exercises local governmental powers,it is the community which is acting by and through that legislative body.the redevelopment agency and the community are not one and the same governmental entity.the redevelopment agency,by state law,exists in each community with certain limited powers and functions health,it is not the same entity as the community within which it exists.the mischief which would be done if it were otherwise is apparent.as argued by the city in its respondent brief permitting a damages suit against the city for an alleged breach of contract by the redevelopment agency is as improper as allowing a redevelopment agency to take city funds earmarked for welfare assistance and spend it on a new commercial development.although the city hypothetical example may be a bit extreme,we agree in principle with the concern which it highlights.pacific states enterprises,supra,th at,fn.omitted.
the holding of pacific states enterprises with respect to an ra contractual liability applies to its statutory responsibilities as well.an ra and a municipality may,as here,have the same governing body however,given their separate identities and liabilities,the statutory duties imposed on the ra may not be ascribed to the municipality 
in this regard,we note that the low and housing obligation of ra was defined as a percentage of tax increment revenues received by ra.plainly,given this definition,this obligation was never considered one imposed on a city general fund.
we also reject plaintiffs suggestion that the city may be held liable under ab and related legislation for the agency low and housing obligations.
ab was enacted in in the midst of a state and local fiscal crisis engendered by the economic recession that had commenced in.ab.by its terms,ab was enacted as means of alleviating that crisis by dissolving ra and transferring to municipalities,school districts and community college districts,the property tax increment revenue ra would otherwise collect and devote to redevelopment activities.ab.in particular,in enacting ab,the legislature expressly set forth its intent to a llocate property tax revenues to successor agencies for making payments on indebtedness incurred by the redevelopment agency prior to its dissolution and allocate remaining balances in accordance with applicable constitutional and statutory provisions.ab,subd.j.as we have indicated,among other matters,ab discontinued the requirement that agencies and their successors provide support for low and housing,subd.c,subd.d.nothing on the face of ab itself imposes on municipalities any liability with respect to a dissolved ra low and housing obligations under ab,only successor agencies have such responsibility and then only to the extent they have received funds from a dissolved ra.see ab,subd.j.
in,in legislation,the legislature adopted and the governor signed ab.as the city points out,ab was enacted as a means of assuring that assets and income successor agencies received from dissolved ra were in fact distributed to all the local agencies,school districts and community college districts the legislature intended as recipients of the funds.in this regard,ab subjected successor agencies and municipalities acting as successor agencies to an audit procedure and,for purposes of conducting such audits,defined cities and counties as including agencies it controlled.the audit procedures to which the expanded definition of cities set forth in section applies do not expressly or by implication expand the liability of municipalities rather,as the city contends,the expanded definition is simply a procedural device that gives the required audits necessary breadth.
in sum,ab and ab do not lend themselves to an interpretation under which municipalities,although among the local agencies intended to benefit from dissolution of ra,would have their lia
