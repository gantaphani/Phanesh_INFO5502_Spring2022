factual and procedural background 
plaintiff employment and disability history 
plaintiff began employment for sacramento county the county as an automotive service worker on december.his employment with the county automatically qualified him as a miscellaneous tier iii member of scers.he is credited for working just over six years for the county,and at the time of his disability retirement request,he was classified as a range a,auto mechanic.plaintiff duties required him to perform repairs and install light bars and other added equipment to build up law enforcement vehicles.he was required to lift up to pounds.

throughout,plaintiff met with medical professionals after he applied for workers compensation benefits.on march,edward tapper,an orthopedic surgeon,examined plaintiff.based on an mri,tapper diagnosed plaintiff with a herniated disc at.in his initial report dated april,tapper noted that plaintiff was at that time doing his regular job and did not appear to be a qualified injured worker for workers compensation purposes.in a report dated july,tapper opined that plaintiff had a percent permanent impairment related to his cervical disc herniation and a possible three percent whole person impairment related to myofascial pain syndrome.
on april,beth bathgate,an orthopedic surgeon,examined plaintiff and issued a report two months later.she also diagnosed plaintiff with a herniated disc at.she concluded that plaintiff was permanent and stationary for workers compensation purposes,noting that he had returned to work after sustaining both injuries.bathgate judgment was that plaintiff had percent impairment of the whole person as a result of his cervical disc injury.she stated that plaintiff could continue work as tolerated but also noted that plaintiff had work preclusions from repetitive neck flexion and extension and heavy lifting.

part of the county investigation required plaintiff to receive a psychological evaluation by mark kimmel.kimmel saw plaintiff on january.kimmel concluded that plaintiff was not fit for duty and that he was potentially a danger to others based on his recurrent and poorly controlled mood states,coupled with poor impulse control and reactivity.kimmel recommended plaintiff be evaluated by a psychiatrist and take anger management and stress management courses.as a result of kimmel findings,plaintiff was removed from administrative leave and placed on medical leave effective january.
plaintiff exhausted his leave balances and was on unpaid leave effective february.on april,plaintiff exhausted his family medical leave act and california family rights act entitlement 
plaintiff was reevaluated by kimmel on may,and was found fit to return to work.plaintiff received vacation pay and sick leave pay during the same week,which was compensation to which he was entitled for attending the may medical evaluation.this was the last compensation plaintiff received from the county.it was paid on may.
on june,plaintiff security clearance was reinstated.however,plaintiff did not return to work.
between october,and november,the county had a company monitor and video record plaintiff performing his activities.these activities included bending down to fix his sprinklers and also lifting objects.
plaintiff submitted a note to the county dated november,from his personal physician,paul seites.seites wrote that plaintiff was not able to work from june,to september,
on january,plaintiff saw another physician,mark king,who reviewed plaintiff condition.in his report,king described his findings as mild degenerative changes of the cervical spine from through with osteophytes.he did not opine that plaintiff was at anytime substantially incapacitated from the performance of his duties.
on march,lori kleczka,a personnel analyst employed by the county,sent plaintiff a letter outlining his leave history.the letter referenced a letter from seites indicating that plaintiff needed to be off work through february.the letter also referenced a plaintiff failure to respond to a reasonable accommodation request form she sent to him on december,and went on to explain that due to business necessity,the county could not approve any more leave.the letter discussed three options.he could voluntarily resign,which would allow him to request reinstatement up to three years.he could submit an application for retirement and the letter advised him to contact scers to discuss his retirement options.lastly,he could return to work if he could produce a medical release.the letter explained that if he did not exercise one of those options by march,he would be considered absent without leave and subject to disciplinary action or termination.
on april,plaintiff signed his application for disability retirement.the application was submitted to scers on may,and was deemed completed by scers on june.

in a letter to scers dated june,seites,the doctor who had written in november of that plaintiff was not able to work from june,to september,now stated plaintiff has been continuously disabled from.seites stated that he had been following plaintiff since,and when plaintiff sustained the neck and back injury in.seites stated that since the injury,plaintiff pain has been increasing and h e is unable to perform tasks that are more than sedentary.this is due to unrelenting intractable pain in neck radiating to arm with paresthesias and numbness in hands.he has cervical disc disease.seites also wrote,the disability is permanent.
on june,plaintiff added a letter to his application stating,i paul cameron have decided to pursue disability solely based on sic my neck injury only which h as caused cervical disc disease.
on september,scers disability specialist bill schnathorst sent a letter to plaintiff,stating,this is to confirm that you met the filing requirements for disability retirement effective june,and the investigation process has begun.the letter further stated that plaintiff had the burden of producing evidence to support his application by a preponderance of the evidence.boldface underscoring omitted.
on august,schnathorst sent an to plaintiff wife,patty cameron,in part saying,y our husband met the filing requirements for disability retirement.schnathorst apologized for the delay.
at the request of scers in,robert henrichsen,an orthopedic surgeon,evaluated plaintiff henrichsen reviewed plaintiff medical history and records,and performed a physical examination of plaintiff.in a report dated january,henrichsen stated diagnostic impressions included degenerative disc disease to the cervical spine,symptoms of referred pain to his left upper extremity,and physical deconditioning.he opined that plaintiff does have permanent disability relevant to his cervical spine.henrichsen report stated,plaintiff permanent limitations occurred when he went off work which,to my understanding,was.from to he continued his employment.italics added.
when plaintiff testified during the administrative hearing,he claimed he did not recall being arrested in december,or being placed on administrative leave.later,he admitted having been charged with a crime and said he had to obtain legal counsel to get his job back.
after being informed of the real reason plaintiff left work in,henrichsen testified that he could not determine at what point plaintiff became permanently incapacitated.rather,all he could state with certainty is that plaintiff was permanently incapacitated from the performance of his job duties as of january,when he examined plaintiff.
on september,andrew burt,an orthopedic surgeon,examined plaintiff and reviewed his medical history.in his report,burt discussed the medical and work history reported to him by plaintiff.plaintiff told burt that his neck pain increased gradually after his injury.the pain was aggravated by pushing,pulling,lifting,and positioning in the course of his work.plaintiff reported having to take more medications with the passage of time.based on plaintiff,burt wrote,eventually,plaintiff could no longer tolerate the aggravation of his pain associated with the heavy physical demand of his work and he had to leave the job on jan.burt added,plaintiff continues to have significant symptoms.he has not worked in any capacity since he had to leave the job on jan.
burt diagnosed plaintiff with chronic discogenic neck pain,degenerative cervical disc disease,c ervical disc herniation,and p ersistent protrusion.regarding plaintiff ability to work,burt opined the condition has rendered plaintiff unable to continue working as a mechanic with a date of onset of jan.
proceedings before the alj regarding the timeliness of the application 
scers referred plaintiff application to the office of administrative hearings for an evidentiary hearing.after two days of testimony,the hearing had not yet concluded.during a status conference on october,scers argued that plaintiff application for disability retirement was late and therefore could not be processed.during a status conference on november,both parties agreed to allow the alj to make a determination of whether the application for disability retirement was timely prior to reconvening the administrative hearing.on february,the alj released her proposed decision,finding that plaintiff discontinued his service with the county on may,the last date he earned compensation,and because plaintiff did not file his application until may,the application was not timely.
in the proceedings before the alj,scers argued that the last date plaintiff had worked and had his income deducted was on december.the alj disagreed and determined that the last date he received income was on may,however,even that later date did not help plaintiff.in making this determination,the alj looked to section,which sets forth alternative timing deadlines by which a disability retirement application must be filed the alj focused on the two alternative circumstances under which an application is timely in section that were potentially applicable in this case the application shall be made within four months after his or her discontinuance of service or while,from the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application,he or she is continuously physically or mentally incapacitated to perform his or her duties.additionally,the alj looked to section,subdivision a,which defines service as uninterrupted employment of any person appointed or elected for that period of time for which deductions are made from his earnable compensation from the county or district for such service while he is a member of the retirement association.
the alj then cited weissman los angeles county employees retirement d weissman,which holds that discontinuance of service plainly and ordinarily means a member who has ceased to work for a salary from which deductions were made.id.at.
relying on sections and,as well as weissman,the alj determined that plaintiff application was not timely under the third alternative in the application shall be made within four months after his or her discontinuance of service.the alj found this alternative inapplicable because the last date plaintiff had funds deducted from his income was on may,when he was compensated for his may,appointment with kimmel.therefore,since his application was received on may,he did not apply during or within four months of discontinuance of service.
the alj found the application was not timely under the fourth alternative,which allows the application to be filed while,from the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application,he or she is continuously physically or mentally incapacitated to perform his or her duties.seites was the only doctor who found that plaintiff had been continuously disabled,but he said the period of continuous disability began june.plaintiff had argued that bathgate findings showed that plaintiff was continuously disabled because he could not perform any heavy lifting or do repetitive motion with his neck.this would mean plaintiff was incapacitated beginning on april.however,after seeing bathgate,plaintiff returned to work for eight months and did not stop his normal duties of work until december of for reasons plaintiff claimed related to his cervical spine.plaintiff also argued that henrichsen had opined he was permanently incapacitated.however,during the administrative hearing,it was discovered that plaintiff had not mentioned his arrest in december of to henrichsen.when henrichsen was informed about plaintiff administrative leave after his arrest,he no longer could confirm that plaintiff had been incapacitated from.instead,henrichsen stated that plaintiff was incapacitated from january,the date of his examination.
lastly,plaintiff contended that the doctrine of equitable estoppel prevents scers from raising the issue of the timeliness of plaintiff application.he argued that he somehow relied on the assurances of schnathorst that plaintiff met the filing requirements for disability retirement effective june,and that schnathorst was doing everything in his power to move plaintiff case along.
the alj agreed with scers that the correspondence from schnathorst merely confirmed that plaintiff had met the minimum filing requirements under the scers bylaws.the letters were not acknowledgement of the merits of the application,including its timeliness,which depended on proof of continuous incapacity.
the alj also noted that generally,four elements must be present in order to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.driscoll city of los angeles cal d.
the alj found that scers was not apprised of the facts regarding the issue of timeliness of the application until the administrative hearing began.while the alj found that kleczka,the county personnel analyst,was so apprised,the alj also determined the county and scers are separate legal entities and knowledge of the county could not be imputed to scers.further,the alj found plaintiff was aware of the true facts because he knew that his treating physician did not deem him to be incapacitated until june.because scers was unaware of these facts until the second day of the administrative hearing and plaintiff was aware of all the facts regarding his application and the true date he was incapacitated,the alj ruled scers was not estopped from making the untimeliness claim 
scers relied upon the alj ruling in denying plaintiff retirement application.
writ of administrative mandate 
after scers rejected the retirement application based on the alj findings,plaintiff sought a writ of administrative mandate in sacramento county superior court.he contended that the scers board decision was not supported by the evidence and that his application should have been accepted.the trial court denied the petition.
in ruling on plaintiff writ petition,the trial court followed the same reasoning as the alj.it focused on the language in the third and fourth alternatives in section,which states that the application must be submitted within four months after his or her discontinuance of service,or while,from the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application,he or she is continuously physically or mentally incapacitated to perform his or her duties.
regarding the third alternative in section,the trial court looked to section,which defines service as a period of time which deductions are made from the member earnable compensation.plaintiff last compensation related to his last fitness for duty appointment with kimmel on may.plaintiff was thus found to have discontinued his service at the latest on may,the last day for which he received compensation.because plaintiff sent the application to scers a year later,the application was made long after the four month limitation period in section.consequently,the court found it was not an abuse of discretion to deny him retirement with regards to discontinuance of service.
regarding the fourth alternative in section,that the application shall be accepted if from the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application,he or she is continuously physically or mentally incapacitated to perform his or her duties,plaintiff argued that the reports of seites,kimmel,burt,king,tapper,and bathgate show he was continuously incapacitated since.the trial court did not agree.
the trial court noted that both bathgate and tapper opined that plaintiff was only temporarily incapacitated.kimmel found that plaintiff was not fit for duty for psychological reasons in january and later found he was fit to return to work in may after plaintiff attended anger management and stress classes.king offered no opinion as to whether plaintiff was substantially incapacitated from the performance of his regular duties at any time.seites opinion is the only opinion that found plaintiff continuously incapacitated for any period of time,but he fixed the beginning of plaintiff continuous incapacitation as june.the court found his testimony to be unhelpful because it did not establish that plaintiff had been continuously incapacitated during the preceding month beginning on may,when plaintiff was last compensated.burt opinion was that plaintiff had a chronic condition rendering plaintiff unable to work since january.however,the trial court found burt opinion to have been significantly undermined by the erroneous belief that plaintiff stopped working in january because of neck and arm pain related to his service connected injuries,when plaintiff had actually been placed on administrative leave for psychological reasons.lastly,henrichsen could not establish incapacitation earlier than january.
the trial court then weighed the medical information and the surveillance video of plaintiff puttering around in his yard,playing catch with his dogs,and easily moving about in a normal and unfettered fashion and found the board did not abuse its discretion when it determined the earliest date plaintiff was incapacitated was june.
discussion 
standard of review and legal principles concerning the application for disability retirement 
plaintiff has not contested the board factual findings,and factual findings not contested must be accepted as true.black state personnel board d.when a trial court considers a final administrative decision that substantially affects a fundamental vested right,the court examines the administrative record for errors of law and also exercises its independent judgment upon the evidence.code civ,subd.c fukuda city of angels cal th,fn.when the trial court exercises its independent judgment,as it did here,we employ the substantial evidence test in our review.when the superior court has rendered its judgment on mandamus and the judgment is appealed,the power of the appellate court is governed by the substantial evidence rule,the determination of whether the evidence,viewed in the light most favorable to the respondent,sustains the findings of the trial court,resolving any reasonable doubts in favor of those findings.harmon board of retirement d,accord,fukuda,at.
the retirement benefits for sacramento county employees are generally set forth in the county employees retirement law of cerl et.county employees may be entitled to disability retirement benefits regardless of their age if they have become permanently incapacitated as a result of injury or disease substantially arising out of and in the course of their employment,subd.a.the retirement board,here scers,is vested with the authority to grant disability retirement.
when seeking disability retirement benefits,the member must file an application for disability retirement benefits,subd.a a member may be retired for disability upon the application of the member.an application for disability retirement benefits must be made within the time limits set forth in section.see fn,ante.
ii.timeliness of plaintiff application 
continuous.the parties contentions 
plaintiff contends that he was continuously disabled within the meaning of section before he filed his application.he asserts that the numerous reports from different medical professionals when viewed together prove he was disabled and not able to perform his work.plaintiff relies primarily on the opinion of his personal physician,seites.plaintiff insists that out of all of the doctors who he had seen,seites was the only doctor who reviewed his complete medical history and provided medical opinions regarding his disability since may.thus,plaintiff argues that seites determination is the most accurate and should be adopted by the court.additionally,plaintiff reply brief points to the fact that burt and henrichsen independently came to the conclusion that plaintiff was disabled.
scers discounts burt testimony that plaintiff stopped working as of january,because of his neck and arm pain because plaintiff did not leave work at that time or for that reason.scers also highlights that henrichsen could only determine the date of incapacitation to be no earlier than january.therefore,scers contends henrichsen opinion is not helpful to plaintiff case because the determination was made two years after plaintiffs application was sent to scers.
as noted,an application for disability retirement is timely under section if made while,from the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application,he or she is continuously physically or mentally incapacitated to perform his or her duties.plaintiff asserts his application was timely because he was continuously incapacitated from the discontinuance of his service to the time he submitted his application.accordingly,the resolution of plaintiff contention turns on the definition of discontinuance of service and whether he was continuously physically incapacitated at all times between the discontinuance of his service and the time he applied for disability retirement.
as the alj and trial court noted,the court in weissman,supra,d,defined the term discontinuance of service set forth in section.in weissman,a county employee retired from service,but then had a heart attack about a month later.about three and months after retiring,he applied for disability retirement,but the retirement board refused to accept the application because he had previously retired from service.weissman,at.in a writ petition,the plaintiff argued that he complied with section by making the application for disability retirement within the four months allowed by that statute.weissman,at.the trial court issued the writ,ruling that the plain language of section compelled the retirement board to accept the application.weissman,at.in addressing the issue raised on appeal whether under section,the retirement board was prevented from accepting a member application for disability retirement after the member received a service pension the weissman court interpreted the relevant statutes.in construing the term discontinuance of service in section,the court wrote the ordinary meaning given to the word discontinuance is termination or cessation of activity.t he statute defines service in section as uninterrupted employment for a period of time for which deductions are made from the member earnable compensation.it follows that discontinuance of service plainly and ordinarily means a member who has ceased to work for a salary from which deductions were made.weissman,at.because the plaintiff applied for disability retirement within the section four months grace period after his discontinuance of service,the retirement board was required to accept the plaintiff application.weissman,at.
plaintiff here attempts to distinguish weissman by arguing that the facts in that case are different from those in his case.as plaintiff notes,we do not have an individual who had already retired and who has now asked for a disability retirement rather than a service retirement.this is true however,that factual distinction does not affect the value of the weissman court statutory construction of section or the statutory point in time that is the date of discontinuance of service.weissman analysis regarding that term is directly on point and we adopt it here.
plaintiff relies on dodosh county of orange d,a case that predated weissman,to argue that his service for purposes of section continued as long as plaintiff was an employee.specifically,plaintiff relies on language in dodosh he acknowledges is dicta d iscontinued service,meaning an unpaid leave of absence during which time the person remains an employee.but as weissman demonstrates and as we discuss in more detail post,whether the member is or is not still an employee when the application is made is not a critical factor in determining when there has been a discontinuation of service.
to put the dodosh dicta in context,a brief look at that case is necessary.in dodosh,a deputy sheriff took a leave of absence due to injury.when his physician notified the county he could return,he voluntarily resigned to take employment elsewhere.dodosh,supra,d at.the day following his resignation,the plaintiff received a refund of his retirement contributions.id.at.nearly a year later,the plaintiff applied for disability retirement,and the retirement board determined he was no longer eligible.id.at.his petition for writ of mandate was denied by the trial court.on appeal,the sole issue was whether the plaintiff was eligible to apply for disability retirement,and the court determined he was not because,having withdrawn his contributions,he was no longer a member of the county retirement system.ibid.the dodosh court noted the statutory definition of a member included a person who leaves county service,but elects to leave his or her contributions on deposit.ibid.because the plaintiff had withdrawn his retirement contributions after his resignation,he was no longer a member.relying on section,the plaintiff asserted he was eligible for disability retirement even though he was no longer a member.dodosh,at.but the dodosh court correctly observed that section refers to members and thus contemplates that only members can apply for disability retirement.dodosh,at.
having resolved the matter,the dodosh court went further than it needed to go.citing section,the court said additionally,service means uninterrupted employment for that period of time for which deductions are made from an employee earnable compensation citation.therefore,discontinued service means an unpaid leave of absence,during which time the person remains an employee.dodosh,supra,d at.no statutory interpretation analysis was provided by the dodosh court to support the second sentence in this quotation,the very part of dodosh upon which plaintiff here relies.the weissman court rejected the dodosh dicta when it determined that the plaintiff in that case was still eligible to apply even though he had retired.weissman,supra,d at.like the court in weissman,we too reject the dodosh dicta.the legislature has defined discontinuance of service to refer to the period of time during which a member who has ceased to work for a salary from which deductions were made.weissman,at.it is this legislative definition we must apply.
plaintiff contends he was still an employee and eligible to apply as of march.in support of this contention,he points to the march,letter he received from lori kleczka,the county personnel analyst,in which she provided him with three options.he argues that this shows he was still considered a county employee of the date of the letter.from this,he argues the concept of discontinuation of service involves not only the meaning of the cerl but the county understanding of plaintiff status such that they could advise him of his rights including the right to seek a disability retirement from his employer.but plaintiff cites no legal authority or analysis for this proposition and we are aware of none.we may properly disregard contentions perfunctorily asserted without legal development.people freeman cal th,fn.freeman people carroll th,fn.carroll people bragg th,bragg tilbury constructors,state comp.ins.fund th,tilbury constructors.
in any event,plaintiff is incorrect when he asserts the concept of discontinuation of service involves something more than the meaning of the cerl.the meaning we must apply here is what the legislature set forth in the cerl,and nothing more.if the legislature wanted to define service as the period during which a person is a county employee,it could easily have done so.instead,the legislature defined service differently.as we have noted,section,subdivision a,defines service as uninterrupted employment of any person appointed or elected for that period of time a for which deductions are made from his earnable compensation from the county or district for such service while he is a member of the retirement association.italics added.as can be seen by the italicized text,employment is just one component of the definition of service as it applies here.when we look to the other language we have italicized,it is clear that the period of employment is not the focus of the statute.service as defined in the cerl is the period of time f or which deductions are made from a member earnable compensation.thus,when this period discontinues,the relevant section alternative time limitations for submitting an application for disability retirement are triggered.these alternatives do not turn on whether the member remains an employee of the county.they turn on the point in time when the member stopped being compensated for his employment and consequently,stopped making contributions
