gerald overman applied for social security disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income payments,claiming that he was unable to work due primarily to fatigue related to graves disease,anemia,and vision problems.after conducting a hearing an administrative law judge alj denied benefits,relying on testimony by a vocational expert ve to find that,though overman could not return to his past work,he could perform a significant number of other available jobs.on review by the district court,the court found that substantial evidence supported the alj conclusion.in this appeal,overman challenges the alj reliance on the ve testimony.we will discuss the record that was before the alj prior to addressing those contentions.
overman,currently years old,is a graduate.for fifteen years before the alleged onset of disability,he worked at a resort.his duties included maintaining and repairing the golf course irrigation system,setting up for conventions,and performing other small repairs.in overman began to feel overheated,shaky,and fatigued on a regular basis,and he experienced a rapid,unexplained weight loss of more than pounds.in november of that year,already suffered from diabetes,hypertension,glaucoma,cataracts,and severe his job because he was too fatigued to continue working.
overman reported his symptoms to his treating physician,john mckevett,and was referred to an endocrinologist who diagnosed overman with graves disease,a form of hyperthyroidism that may cause weight loss,tremulousness,and weakness,among other symptoms.stedman medical dictionary,ed.graves disease is chronic,but the symptoms are treatable.see,graves disease july.mayoclinic.com he dsection.he also was diagnosed with anemia,which frequently causes fatigue and lethargy in its sufferer.stedman medical dictionary at.
overman began radioactive iodine therapy for his graves disease in late december.he filed his application for benefits shortly thereafter.the therapy initially alleviated some of overman symptoms,but then instead of producing too much thyroid hormone,overman began producing too little,a condition called hypo thyroidism,which like hyper thyroidism often causes fatigue and muscle weakness.stedman medical dictionary at.roughly of patients treated with radioactive iodine experience this overcorrection of thyroid function,after which they usually require lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy.endocrinologists tested overman thyroid function every four to eight weeks throughout and sent the results to mckevett,who prescribed a replacement drug called synthroid.after taking synthroid for two weeks,overman told mckevett that he still tired easily but his energy level was slowly but surely improving.at the same visit,the doctor noted moderate generalized weakness,but stated that this was also slowly improving.mckevett records reflect that overman dosage of synthroid was adjusted several times over the next months.but by the end of that period,mckevett still had not determined the correct dosage and attributed overman continued fatigue to not being conditioned to the medication.as for overman anemia,the records do not mention any treatment for that ailment,and overman did not know at the time of his hearing whether he was still anemic.
overman also submitted records from his optometrist and opthalmologist concerning his vision problems.the opthalmologist reported that overman suffered from pathologic myopia,glaucoma,and cataracts.he said that overman visual acuity of made any visual task difficult and his eyesight would continue to deteriorate.his optometrist reported that overman had open angle glaucoma and myopic degeneration resulting in poor vision in general and almost no night vision.both doctors agreed that overman vision would likely worsen over time.the medical records show that overman diabetes and hypertension were,for the most part,during the alleged period of disability.
at the hearing before the alj in november,overman testified that he was still taking synthroid for his thyroid condition but that his doctor had not yet determined the correct dosage.he also testified that he took medication for his diabetes but was not.he said that he was nearsighted,wore glasses,and could watch tv as long as he was within five feet of the set.regarding his daily activities,overman testified that he tries to do things around the house but finds it very tiring and that,during the six months prior to the hearing,if he sat down in a chair for more than five minutes he would fall asleep.overman testified that he could feed and bathe himself and that his performance of household chores did not significantly change after the onset of disability in november.he said that he could drive during the day but not after dark as he had no night vision.he also said that he could walk a half mile on flat terrain as long as it was not too cold out,but that in the cold his extremities go numb due to his diabetes.he said that the numbness had worsened over time and was not always associated with cold temperatures.finally,overman testified that his resort maintenance job had been unskilled and primarily required making small repairs to door knobs,light switch covers,and the like.he left the job in november after fainting at work.he said that he would not be able to return to that job because he could not tolerate working outdoors in hot weather and because he was routinely required to lift more weight than mckevett recommended.
julianne koski,a family practitioner and agency consultant,also testified at the hearing.having reviewed overman medical records,koski concurred that overman suffered from graves disease,severe myopia with glaucoma,diabetes,and hypertension.she testified that it was difficult to determine overman corrected visual acuity from his medical records,but she guessed that it was no better than when corrected with glasses.she also concurred that he suffered from cataracts,which,in her opinion,were not yet visually significant.koski opined that none of overman impairments met or equaled social security medical listings,so she analyzed how,in her view,his ailments impacted his residual functional capacity.she said that overman could not perform work requiring fine discrimination or significant reading,should stay away from hazards and extreme temperatures,should avoid all ropes and scaffolding and climb ladders only occasionally,should never lift more than fifty pounds but could lift twenty pounds on a more frequent basis,and should not do any repetitive lifting.she did not recommend any limitations on overman ability to sit or stand.
the last witness at the hearing was the vocational expert ve,kenneth ogren.the alj asked the ve,hypothetically,whether a person with a residual functional capacity as described by the limitations on reading,fine discrimination,and extreme do any of overman past relevant work.the ve answered that the limitation ruled out overman prior work,much of which was performed outdoors.the alj then asked,hypothetically,whether there were other jobs in the region that a person with those same limitations could perform.the ve answered that such a person could perform two occupations hand packager,and that is at dot and rack room worker.a hand packager manually packages materials and products,and a worker tends machines that fill metal kegs with beer in the or racking room of a brewery both positions require a medium level of exertion.see dep t of labor,dictionary of occupational titles ed,available at.according to the ve,there were and such jobs,respectively,available in minnesota.the district court rejected overman argument that the ve should have used a wisconsin rather than a minnesota database to evaluate the number of available jobs,but overman does not renew that argument on appeal.finally,the alj asked the ve whether his testimony was consistent with the dictionary of occupational titles dot,and the ve answered yes.
