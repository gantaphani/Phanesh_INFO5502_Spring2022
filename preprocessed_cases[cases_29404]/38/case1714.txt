under the health care program,a health care provider can be reimbursed annually for depreciation on buildings and equipment that are used to provide services to patients.under applicable regulations,the depreciation is based on the historical cost of the asset,which is generally the provider cost of acquiring and significantly improving it.the provider sets forth these figures in yearly cost reports that may be audited.
the health care provider here,redding medical center redding,made current claims for depreciation reimbursement,which the department of health services dhs timely audited.redding maintained that dhs was foreclosed from requiring redding to submit documentation of the historical costs of the claimed depreciable assets if those costs had been previously reported in a cost report that was considered true and correct under welfare and institutions code section because it was not audited or reviewed within three years of the close of the period covered by the report or,if later,of the date of its submission.
we disagree with redding.if a health care provider continues to claim depreciation,it must stand ready to document the historical cost underlying the current claim.this is particularly true where,as here,the health care provider during the audit has submitted evidence showing that it has made depreciation changes over time,including changes in historical costs.consequently,we affirm the judgment that denied redding petition for administrative mandate.
background 
california implements the federal medicaid program through its program.welf,et et provides medical care to indigent persons.dhs administers the program.redding provides hospital services to patients.see redding medical center bontá th,d bontá.
dhs is required to reimburse providers of hospital services for their costs,tit.dhs does so by making interim payments during a fiscal year that are later reconciled with a final settlement of a fiscal year cost report.bontá,supra,th at,d.hospitals such as redding are to be reimbursed for their a llowable costs determined in accordance with applicable medicare standards and principles of reimbursement,tit,subd.a,italics added bontá,supra,th at,d mission community hospital kizer th,d california has chosen to incorporate certain medicare statutes and regulations into its regulatory scheme.
pursuant to these reimbursement standards and principles,redding may claim reimbursement for costs,including depreciation costs.a.reimbursable depreciation costs include a n appropriate allowance for depreciation on buildings and equipment used in the provision of patient care.a.the allowable depreciation must be b ased on the historical cost of the asset and its estimated useful life.a a.generally,h istorical cost is the cost incurred by the present owner in acquiring the asset it also includes the costs of significantly bettering or improving the asset.b ii d.for example,if a provider acquired a hospital building in for with an estimated useful life of years and had not significantly improved it,the annual allowable depreciation cost for the building would be,divided by if,then,percent of the patients treated at the hospital during a particular fiscal year were patients,reimbursement obligation for that fiscal year depreciation cost on the building would be,percent of.
this case arose after dhs timely audited redding cost reports for the and fiscal years.in those reports,redding claimed annual depreciation reimbursement for a variety of buildings and equipment.most of these assets had been acquired prior to the two fiscal years at issue,and two of the assets had been acquired as early as.depreciation on assets acquired during the and fiscal years is not at issue.
during the audit,redding submitted a lapsing schedule to dhs.this schedule showed that,based on past medicare audits,redding had made adjustments to historical costs of assets on which redding claimed continuing depreciation in the and fiscal years.redding explained the lapsing schedule to the dhs auditor as follows a medicare lapsing schedule was prepared to incorporate the medicare audit adjustments on fixed assets additions and disposal.the most common audit adjustments made by the medicare auditors were additions disallowed due to lack of invoices,difference in historical cost between the books and the invoices,incorrect assignment of assets estimated useful lives and assets disallowed due to non existence sic of assets during physical inspection.during the administrative hearing in this matter,the dhs auditor testified that the lapsing schedule indicated there were differences in the reporting of historical costs for purposes of cost reporting and purposes of financial reporting.
the lapsing schedule prompted dhs to test the accuracy of the historical costs portion of redding depreciation schedules for the two fiscal years at issue,and.dhs did this by selecting certain assets from the depreciation schedules and asking redding to document their reported historical cost.
redding largely balked at providing the documentation of these historical costs.redding staked its ground on the concept of administrative finality it saw embodied in section.that section gives dhs three years to audit a cost report that covers a particular cost reporting period,after which the information contained therein is deemed true and correct,subd.a.redding argued that since depreciation costs had been previously allowed on the assets at issue in finalized cost reports,that was the end of the particular historical costs and depreciation amounts had been finally settled for all future cost reports.the administrative law judge had noted that the historical costs of assets listed on redding depreciation schedules had never actually been audited.
dhs disagreed with redding point about finality,and disallowed depreciation reimbursement on the tested assets for the and fiscal years based on the lack of documentation.dhs decision significantly reduced redding claimed depreciation for these two fiscal years.
redding failed to overturn dhs decision at the administrative review stage and received the same result at the initial judicial review when it unsuccessfully petitioned for administrative mandate.code civ.as we shall explain,we agree with these critical reviews.
discussion 
the issue is whether dhs was legally section and the notion of administrative requiring redding,during a timely audit,to document the historical costs of depreciable assets on which redding claimed current reimbursable depreciation,when those historical costs had been set forth in cost reports which were considered true and correct under section.this issue presents a question of law involving statutory interpretation that we review independently.viking ins.state farm mut.auto.ins.th,d.
our objective in interpreting a statute is to determine legislative intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.professional engineers wilson th,d.the first thing we do is read the statute,and give the words their ordinary definitions unless special definitions are provided.id.at,d.if the meaning of the words is clear,then the language controls if not,we may use various interpretive aids.id.at,d.
section,subdivision a,the statute at the center of things,states in relevant part a amounts paid for services provided to beneficiaries shall be audited by the department,dhs in the manner and form prescribed by the department.the department shall maintain adequate controls to ensure responsibility and accountability for the expenditure of federal and state funds c ost reports and other data for cost reporting periods beginning on january,and thereafter shall be considered true and correct unless audited or reviewed within three years after the close of the period covered by the report,or after the date of submission of the original or amended report by the provider,whichever is later.
as dhs persuasively argues,the most reasonable interpretation of section,subdivision a,is that if dhs has not timely audited a cost report,the data for that cost reporting period will be considered true and correct but only for that particular cost report,not for future cost reports.this interpretation is borne out by section language.in subdivision a,that language refers to data for cost reporting periods,which shall be considered true and correct unless audited or reviewed within three years after the close of the period covered by the report italics added.subdivision a b adds in consistent fashion,data for the fiscal periods in question.italics added.
this interpretation also finds support in case law.in robert kennedy medical center belshé cal th,d,robert kennedy,our state high court construed section,subdivision a,as apparently requiring dhs to audit a cost report within three years of its filing or of the close of the period covered by the report.but the court also concluded that this deadline does not apply to reimbursement determinations based on that cost report.id.at,d.along the way,the robert kennedy court recognized the limited scope of the requirement of section,subdivision a,explaining that the sole consequence of dhs failure to audit or review a provider cost report or other data within three years is that such information shall be considered true and correct.robert kennedy at,d,quoting palmdale hospital medical center department of health services th,d palmdale,italics in palmdale.that is,the information shall be considered true and correct for reimbursement determinations based on that particular cost report.
citing the robert kennedy decision,this court,in kaiser foundation hospitals belshé th,d kaiser,stated that p ursuant to section,if dhs does not audit the cost report within three years,the figures provided in that report must be accepted as true and used in the calculation to determine the proper amount of reimbursement.id.at,d.while dhs must raise any challenge to the accuracy of the provider cost report within three years,the final reimbursement figure may be determined after that period of time,fn.
as dhs maintains,in auditing redding for the and fiscal years,dhs was not considering the same data within the meaning of section even if that data had been reported in a prior cost report.instead,dhs was reviewing data that were specific to the current depreciation claims in the and costs reports.in other words,dhs was keeping its focus on the current depreciation claims before it and was not reopening or reauditing past cost reports.the data in those past cost reports were deemed true and correct for those cost reports if those reports met the criteria set forth in section,subdivision a.
furthermore,historical costs which are the underpinning of depreciation claims include the costs of betterments or improvements to an asset that significantly extend the asset estimated useful life or productivity.b ii d.these betterments and improvements dispute the notion of fixed historical costs based on past cost reports or audits.redding submission of the lapsing schedule during the audit only supports this view.in that lapsing schedule,redding acknowledged making changes in historical costs and other depreciation factors through the years pursuant to medicare audits.the lapsing schedule itself,then,also disputes the notion of fixed historical costs based on past cost reports or audits.
in short,to the extent redding continues to claim depreciation reimbursement,it must stand ready to document the historical cost underlying that current claim.this aligns with section,subdivision a directive to dhs to maintain adequate controls to ensure responsibility and accountability for the expenditure of federal and state funds.
the applicable federal regulations also support this interpretation of section,subdivision a.as noted,under the federal regulations that apply to the program,redding is entitled to claim depreciation reimbursement on buildings and equipment used to provide patient care,based on the historical cost of the asset.a,a,b see,tit,subd.a.
pursuant to these federal regulations,providers must maintain and have available for inspection documentation that supports their reimbursement requests.title of the code of federal regulations,part,provides as relevant 
a general.the principles of cost reimbursement require that providers maintain sufficient financial records and statistical data for proper determination of costs payable under the program essentially the methods of determining costs payable involve making use of data already available from the institution basis accounts,as usually maintained 
d continuing provider recordkeeping requirements.the provider must furnish such information to the intermediary,dhs as may be necessary to i assure proper payment by the program the provider must permit the intermediary to examine such records and documents as are necessary to ascertain information pertinent to the determination of the proper amount of program payments due.these records include,but are not limited to,matters pertaining to iv asset acquisition,lease,sale,or other action last italics added.
and title of the code of federal regulations,part,reiterates as pertinent 
a principle.providers receiving payment on the basis of reimbursable cost must provide adequate cost data.this must be based on their financial and statistical records which must be capable of verification by qualified auditors 
c adequacy of cost information.adequate cost information must be obtained from the provider records to support payments made for services furnished to beneficiaries.the requirement of adequacy of data implies that the data be accurate and in sufficient detail to accomplish the purposes for which it is intended.adequate data capable of being audited is consistent with good business concepts and effective and efficient management of any organization it is a reasonable expectation on the part of any agency paying for services on a basis.
in conjunction with these applicable federal regulations,then,section,subdivision a,requires documentation of asset acquisition costs,historical costs see b no matter when the asset was acquired,so long as depreciation on that asset is being claimed for the fiscal year that is under review pursuant to a timely audit.
the law does not require that any particular kind of record be used to document historical cost or asset acquisition,such as original invoices or receipts.instead,the records that are offered for these purposes must satisfy the general standards of accuracy and detail set forth in section and the applicable federal regulations.
redding raises several red flags regarding this interpretation of section,subdivision a,but their unfurling only confirms our view.
redding begins with the concept of administrative finality it sees embodied in section.redding argues that under our interpretation of that section,dhs auditors may routinely disregard final reimbursement settlements from previous fiscal years and conduct new audits of the previously audited historical costs of assets for any fiscal year in which depreciation expenses are claimed.redding is mistaken.
under our interpretation of section,subdivision a,no finalized prior settlement or finalized prior cost report or data are subject to being reopened,changed or reaudited.under our interpretation,dhs may not question the veracity of cost reports outside the prescribed review period of three years unless one of the exceptions to the review period,such as fraud or willful delay,is implicated,which is not the case here.see kaiser,supra,th at fn,d palmdale,supra,th at,d.if a cost report is not audited or reviewed within that prescribed period,that cost report and its data are considered true and correct,but only for purposes of that particular cost report.this makes sense.the true and correct status accorded data under section,subdivision a,arises only if dhs has failed to audit or review the cost report and data within the prescribed review period.unaudited and unreviewed data should not be deemed true and correct for eternity,as opposed to just the period covered by the report.and even if there have been past audits,the depreciable assets may have been bettered or improved or their data adjusted in the interim.as noted,the lapsing schedule shows that redding has made changes and adjustments in historical cost fig
