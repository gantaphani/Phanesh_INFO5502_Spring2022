background 
owen has sought treatment for lower back pain since at least.between october and february,owen regularly visited steven paulsrud,who prescribed painkillers and muscle relaxants and administered steroid injections for owen condition.an mri of owen lower back performed in november revealed m ild discogenic changes at the level with no focal disc herniation.in december,paulsrud noted that although the mri revealed no significant pathology,owen was experiencing back pain with radiation into his right leg.
owen attended an initial physical therapy evaluation in january,but he failed to attend his subsequent physical therapy appointments.in march,paulsrud observed that owen was suffering from mild lower back pain but was doing very well and had good strength and range of motion.paulsrud also encouraged owen to quit smoking and modify his diet,but paulsrud noted the following month that owen would not follow regular exercise or dietary plans.in july,less than three weeks prior to the alleged disability onset date,paulsrud observed that owen back pain was intermittent.shortly after the alleged disability onset date,paulsrud noted that owen had increased his activity and,despite his continuing lower back pain,was doing better.
owen visited rhea allen,who had treated him for a hand injury in july,for a consultative examination in march.allen noted that owen suffered from lower back pain but handled his daily living activities independently.based on a physical examination and a review of various treatment notes and the november mri,allen concluded that owen could lift ten pounds frequently and pounds occasionally carry pounds occasionally stand for an entire workday,given normal breaks walk for up to four hours each workday sit in a chair with a backrest without limitation,given normal breaks and stoop,climb,kneel,and crawl occasionally.although allen recommended that owen avoid work requiring highly repetitive,forceful gripping and grasping,she stated that he could perform light manufacturing work.
in may,wilson,a medical consultant for the iowa disability determination services bureau,completed an rfc assessment form for owen.wilson reached similar conclusions regarding owen physical limitations as had allen and explained that he had given great weight to allen opinions and recommendation.
when owen returned to paulsrud in may,paulsrud encouraged owen to try to get back to work.paulsrud completed an rfc assessment form in which he indicated that owen condition would likely cause him to be absent from work about four days a month.paulsrud referred owen to physical therapy.owen attended the initial physical therapy evaluation but then cancelled six consecutive physical therapy appointments.
robert knox completed an rfc assessment form in june,finding owen alleged limitations to be inconsistent with his activities of daily living.knox indicated that owen could lift pounds frequently and pounds occasionally stand and walk for about six hours each workday,given normal breaks sit for about six hours each workday,given normal breaks and push and pull without limitation.
paulsrud completed an rfc assessment form in august,concluding that owen could lift ten pounds occasionally could sit or stand for minutes before changing position could stoop,crouch,and climb stairs occasionally had limited ability to reach overhead,push,and pull should never climb ladders should avoid working with machinery,at extreme temperatures,and at heights and would likely be absent from work more than three times a month because of his condition.
in january,paulsrud completed an rfc assessment form in which he indicated that owen could lift ten pounds frequently and occasionally could stand and walk for about four hours each workday,given normal breaks could sit for about four hours each workday,given normal breaks could climb stairs occasionally could never twist or climb ladders could sit or stand for minutes before changing position and must walk around for five minutes every half hour.
an mri of owen lower back performed in october revealed m ild degenerative disc disease without significant interval change and m inimal left posterolateral disc protrusion.paulsrud completed a fourth rfc assessment form that month,finding that owen experienced sedation and drowsiness for one to two hours as side effects of his medication and that owen could work no more than four hours a day to start.in november,owen received an epidural steroid injection and was instructed to limit his activity for two to three days and to avoid heavy lifting.
on february,one week before the end of owen alleged disability period,owen informed paulsrud that he had recently fallen on ice and was experiencing neck and leg pain.on february,three days after the end of the alleged disability period,owen visited the emergency room with severe back pain.at the end of february,paulsrud noted that owen was unable to stay in one position for more than minutes.
in a letter to owen attorney dated march,paulsrud stated that owen two mris revealed degenerative disk disease caus ing a contact in owen lumbar spine.paulsrud also explained that owen would initially need to limit any work to four hours a day and that it is difficult for individuals with owen condition to find employment unless they are retrained for clerical work.in june,wilson completed another rfc assessment form and stated that the liberal recommendations contained in paulsrud march letter were not supported by owen medical record and that owen complaints were not supported by the october mri.
at owen hearing before the alj on october,a vocational expert responded to a number of hypothetical questions based primarily on allen and paulsrud assessments of owen physical limitations.first,the vocational expert testified that the limitations set forth by allen following her march consultative examination would preclude performance of owen previous duties as a construction worker and foundry worker but would allow him to perform the duties of a parking attendant,rental clerk,and cashier ii clerical.second,the vocational expert testified that owen could perform the duties of a parking attendant,arcade attendant,and survey worker if owen could lift ten pounds frequently and occasionally could stand and walk for up to four hours each day could sit for up to four hours each day with changing of position every minutes could not twist or use ladders could stoop,crouch,work overhead,push,and pull infrequently could climb steps occasionally could not be exposed to extreme temperatures and could not work around machinery or at heights.these limitations were derived from paulsrud august and january rfc assessment forms.
the vocational expert also testified,however,that if the second hypothetical were amended so that owen had to change position every minutes and walk around for five minutes after minutes of expressed in paulsrud january rfc assessment he would be unable to perform any unskilled jobs.furthermore,based on limitations set forth in paulsrud may,august,and october rfc assessment forms,the vocational expert testified that owen would be unable to perform any job if he had to miss more than three days of work each month or could work only four hours each day.finally,the vocational expert testified that owen would be unable to perform any job if he were unable to stay awake,a limitation apparently based on owen testimony at the hearing that his medication puts him to sleep and on paulsrud statement in his october rfc assessment form that owen experienced sedation and drowsiness as side effects of his medication.
in his december,decision concluding that owen was not disab
