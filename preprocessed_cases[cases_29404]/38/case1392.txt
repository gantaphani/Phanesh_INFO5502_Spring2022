james peake,secretary of veterans affairs the secretary,appeals from a decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court,permitting a survivor of a deceased veteran to proceed with a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation dic.rodriguez nicholson.that decision overturned a ruling by the board of veterans appeals the board and held that application of,as amended in january,to a dic claim pending prior to the amendment,took away a substantial right.the veterans court held that the board application of amended to appellee maria rodriguez rodriguez case had an unlawful retroactive effect.because amended does not have an unlawful retroactive effect,we reverse.
background 
as we have done in similar cases,we find it useful to briefly review the statutes governing the award of dic benefits to survivors of deceased veterans before discussing the facts of this particular case.
dic is a monthly benefit paid to certain survivors,such as a spouse,of certain deceased veterans.a veteran surviving spouse may receive dic benefits if the veteran died from a disability.a veteran dies from a disability when the disability was a principal or a contributory cause of the death.a.
alternatively,if a veteran death is not,provides that a surviving spouse may still receive dic benefits if the veteran had received,or was entitled to receive,compensation at the time of his or her death for a disability that had been continuously rated totally disabling for a period of or more years immediately preceding death.b 
in,the general counsel of the united states department of veterans affairs the department announced an interpretation of that precluded survivors of veterans from bringing claims for dic benefits using a hypothetical entitlement approach.va coun.prec.july.under this approach,if the survivor of a deceased veteran can prove that a veteran would have been entitled to receive compensation for a disabling disability for ten years prior to death,then the survivor may claim dic benefits under,even though the deceased veteran did not actually receive such compensation.a survivor could meet this evidentiary burden by showing,for example,that the veteran actually was disabled for ten or more years prior to death,but did not file a claim and,therefore,did not receive compensation for that period of time,or the veteran actually did file a claim,but the claim was improperly denied by the board.
with this background,we now turn to the facts of the case at hand.
rodriguez is the widow of feliz,a veteran who served three years with the army national guard,and then served on active duty in the army for twenty years.concluded his service in.in,he applied to the department for a determination of for a variety of physical ailments.the department determined that three of his conditions,including diabetes mellitus,were and listed them as disabling.
by,diabetes had worsened and,as a result,his left leg was amputated below the knee.in,the veteran affairs regional office varo raised disability rating to,effective from april.two years later,the varo ruled on two additional claims by.first,the varo declined to increase his disability ratings for various other ailments,and second,it refused to assign an earlier effective date for the disability rating for his diabetes.ultimately died from complications associated with liver cancer in august.
in september,rodriguez filed a claim seeking dic benefits under both and.at that time,we had not yet interpreted the entitled to receive language of.for approximately six years prior to the time rodriguez filed her claim,however,the department had been refusing to recognize claims using the hypothetical entitlement approach.
in november,the varo found that death was not,and that he had only been listed as disabled for five years prior to his death.it thus concluded that rodriguez had failed to meet either of the conditions required to be eligible for dic.rodriguez appealed these findings to the board.
while rodriguez appeal was pending before the board,the veterans court issued several decisions interpreting and its implementing regulation.these decisions interpreted the entitled to receive language to permit a dic claimant to pursue a hypothetical entitlement approach.green brown.carpenter west.wingo west.
in green,the veterans court held that a surviving spouse could use any evidence available at the time of applying for dic to attempt to demonstrate that the veteran hypothetically would have been entitled to receive a different decision on a prior benefits claim,and that the different decision would have resulted in the veteran receiving a disability rating for at least ten years prior to death.at accord carpenter.at.similarly,in wingo,the veterans court held that a surviving spouse could argue hypothetical entitlement where the department of defense had rated a veteran disabled more than ten years prior to his death,but the veteran had only applied for benefits one month before his death.at.
in july,the board remanded rodriguez claims for additional development and.in january,the secretary promulgated a final rule amending to preclude reading a hypothetical entitlement approach into.see fed.reg.the amendment defined entitled to receive to mean that the deceased veteran had actually been rated disabled for at least ten years prior to death,but,for one of several enumerated reasons was not receiving compensation.
in october,the varo again denied rodriguez claims,and in december,the board affirmed the varo decision that death was not related to a disability.the board deferred consideration of rodriguez claim,however,pursuant to a stay issued by this court in national organization of veterans advocates,secretary of veterans affairs,nova i.
in nova i,we held that the phrase entitled to receive,as used in,is ambiguous.id.at.we deferred deciding whether the secretary amendment to was valid,however,in order to give the department an opportunity to explain why it had interpreted the same phrase differently in another regulation id.at.in reaching this result,we agreed with the department that the amendment to was interpretive rather than substantive,which alleviated the notice and comment period requirements that otherwise would have attached under the administrative procedures act.id.at.
in january,in national organization of veterans advocates,secretary of veterans affairs,nova ii,we found that,in attempting to comply with nova i,the department had decided to continue to interpret the language of as excluding new claims filed posthumously by a veteran survivor,that is,claims where no claim had been filed during the veteran life or the claim had been denied and was not subject to reopening.finding it reasonable,we deferred to the department interpretation,thus upholding the department decision to interpret entitled to receive as barring the hypothetical entitlement approach.id.we remanded the case on the ground that the department had failed to bring its interpretation of into conformity with its interpretation of,but we lifted the stay on claims such as rodriguez claim.id.at.
in june,the board affirmed the varo decision to deny rodriguez dic claim.in making this decision,the board relied on the amended version of that barred a claimant use of the hypothetical entitlement approach.on a separate issue,the board also found that the department had complied with its notice obligations under the veterans claims assistance act of vcaa.the vcaa requires that the department advise claimants of any information that the claimant will need to provide the department in order to substantiate the claim,a,stat.the department must also make reasonable efforts to assist the claimant in obtaining relevant records.id.
rodriguez appealed the board decision to the veterans court,which in august reversed the board decision and remanded the case to the board.in doing so,the veterans court held that the board had acted unlawfully when it retroactively applied the amended version of to rodriguez dic claim,because the amendment to had removed a substantive right that existed at the time the claim was filed.the veterans court further held that the board should analyze rodriguez claim under green,carpenter,and wingo,the line of cases that permit a dic claimant to allege hypothetical entitlement when applying for benefits.
on the vcaa issue,the veterans court ruled that the department had not met its duty under the vcaa of advising rodriguez of the evidence necessary to substantiate her dic claim under,using the hypothetical entitlement theory.the veterans court found that such failure would have the natural effect of prejudicing rodriguez,which therefore shifted the burden to the department to show that its failure to advise rodriguez had not actually caused her prejudice.ultimately,the veterans court found that the department had failed to establish that it had no documents under its control relevant to rodriguez claim,and,therefore,had not met its burden.
this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to d.
ii.discussion 
we may review a decision by the veterans court with respect to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof other than a determination as to a factual matter that was relied on by the veterans court in making the decision.a.in doing so,we must decide all relevant questions of law and set aside any regulation or interpretation relied on by the veterans court that is a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or d without observance of procedure required by law.id.at d.
we review the veterans court legal determinations de novo.see dittrich west,citing prenzler derwinski.therefore,we review,without deference,the veterans court legal determinations regarding the validity of a law or any interpretation thereof.bingham nicholson.we may not review factual determinations or the application of law to fact.d.
the secretary argues that applying amended to rodriguez dic claim did not create an unlawful retroactive effect because it did not retrospectively diminish any of her rights to benefits.the secretary alleges that the veterans court erred by not using the test outlined by this court in princess cruises united states.according to the secretary,under the princess cruises test,the amended regulation does not have an impermissible retroactive effect.
in landgraf usi film products,d,the seminal case regarding the retroactive application of a statute,the united states supreme court recognized that retroactivity is not favored in the law and the presumption against retroactive legislation is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.at the same time,a statute does not operate retrospectively merely because it is applied in a case arising from conduct antedating the statute enactment or upsets expectations based in prior law.id.at.internal citations omitted.therefore,in analyzing whether a particular statute should be applied to a case that originated before the statute was passed,a court must ask whether the new provision attaches new legal consequences to events completed before its enactment.id.at.
to determine whether the application of a new statute would have retroactive effect,the supreme court has suggested that the familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations offer sound guidance.id.at.in addition,courts should consider three factors,specifically whether it would impair rights possessed by a party when he acted,whether it would increase a party liability for past conduct,or whether it would impose new duties with respect to already completed transactions.id.at.if the statute is found to have a retroactive effect,then our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.id.
in princess cruises,we applied the holding in landgraf to retroactive application of rules and regulations and recognized that landgraf explicitly requires the court to consider the nature and extent of the change in the law,not merely whether a change has occurred.id.at emphasis in original quoting landgraf,at.to that end,we created a test encompassing the factors laid out in landgraf the nature and extent of the change of the law the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event and familiar considerations of fair notice,reasonable reliance,and settled expectations.id.quoting landgraf,at.if,under this test,a rule or regulation appears to have a retroactive effect,then the rule or regulation can not be applied to cases pending at the time of its promulgation.
we do not know why the veterans court did not apply the princess cruises test to the facts here,but we agree with the secretary that application of the test is appropriate in this case.the veterans court issued its decision in august,after princess cruises was decided in february thus the test was available to the veterans court at the time of its ruling.we therefore proceed to analyze whether has a retroactive effect under the princess cruises test.
the nature and extent of the change of the law 
in its decision,the veterans court found that the nature and extent of the change in the law was substantial.we agree with the veterans court that,during the years after green was issued but before nova i stayed the cases,rodriguez and others like her had a cognizable claim for dic benefits under the hypothetical entitlement approach.consequently,many claimants who would have had a claim for dic benefits under the green interpretation of no longer have a claim due to the amendment of.our analysis,however,can not end there.
the secretary asserts that the amendment to was neither an unforeseeable nor a fundamental change in law.essentially,the secretary argues that,from until the veterans court issued its opinion in green in,the department interpreted both and its implementing regulation,as precluding the hypothetical entitlement approach.in support of this,the secretary points out that the general counsel for the department officially announced this interpretation in.then,when the veterans court decisions in green and its progeny breathed life into the hypothetical entitlement theory,the secretary responded by amending to clarify that could not be read to allow hypothetical entitlement claims.
in addition,the secretary points to our decisions in nova i and nova ii,holding that the language of is ambiguous with regard to whether it allows hypothetical entitlement claims.the secretary cites national cable telecommunications association brand x internet services,d,for the proposition that courts owe deference to an agency reasonable regulatory interpretation of an ambiguous statute,even where a court has previously adopted a different interpretation.because rodriguez should have expected that deference would be shown to the secretary interpretation of the ambiguous entitled to receive language,the secretary contends that the amendment can not be considered a sharp or unexpected change in law.
according to rodriguez,however,the amendment did not reaffirm the department settled position because the department position was only settled within the private recesses of its institutional mind.she argues that the interpretation of was sufficiently unclear to allow the green interpretation by the veterans court.thus,the department position only became clear in when it amended.
we agree with the secretary that,from until green was decided in,the department interpretation of the entitled to receive language of and clearly precluded dic claims using the hypothetical entitlement approach.while the statutory language remained ambiguous,the secretary interpretation did not.
furthermore,in nova i,we found that was an interpretive rule rather than a substantive rule.in reaching this conclusion,we cited paralyzed veterans of america west,for the proposition that substantive rules are those that effect a change in existing law or policy or which affect individual rights and obligations.nova i,at internal quotations omitted.interpretive rules,on the other hand,clarify or explain existing law or re
