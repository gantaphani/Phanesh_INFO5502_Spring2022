background 
retaliation claims 
though cognitively gifted,has several neurological disabilities and attention deficit disorder.his disabilities affect his speech,language skills,motor coordination,and vision.has been eligible for special education services under the idea since he enrolled in the school district in.when the school district first evaluated,it found him eligible for services only under the idea speech and language impairment category,even though his parents also expressed concerns about possible motor impairments.in,parents continued to have these concerns and had him privately tested by an independent evaluator.they learned he had significant motor deficits and,in february,asked the school district for an individualized education program iep meeting to discuss adding services to improve his motor skills.
parents contend the school district then began what has become a long history of ongoing retaliation,coercion,intimidation,and threats.they allege the school district no longer allowed them to attend iep meetings before or during school,forcing them to find child care,and began limiting the time allotted for iep meetings,requiring them to attend multiple meetings and miss work each time.they further allege the school district brought school administrators and lawyers into iep meetings who would harass and scream at them.they also make numerous related allegations,including that the school district disallowed former school occupational therapist from continuing to work with him because she advocated for him at an iep meeting placed in a storage closet for occupational therapy refused to afford them the same privileges as other parents,such as helping in the classroom and attending school functions and wrote them numerous harassing and intimidating letters.
as their relationship deteriorated,parents began pursuing formal complaints against the school district.in april,they filed a federal lawsuit unrelated to this case.they allege the judge orally directed the school district not to treat differently from other children and not to test without parental consent.was then diagnosed with a vision impairment,and his parents asked the school to provide vision therapy as a related service under iep.the school refused,and parents began providing the therapy themselves.after the school district denied their request for reimbursement,parents requested a due process hearing on the matter.they allege the retaliation only worsened at this point.in fact,they allege the school district devised a scheme to subject to countless needless and intrusive tests,which brings us to their next claim.
reevaluation claim 
in may,iep team convened to discuss his continued eligibility under the idea.the team first determined he was eligible to continue receiving speech services based on a reevaluation conducted in february.however,over his parents objections,the team questioned his continued eligibility for services addressing his motor impairments,which he had been receiving under the idea other health impaired ohi category since august.because he had made significant progress on his ohi goals,the school district hired an expert to administer several different tests to.the school district sent a letter to his parents requesting consent to conduct the reevaluation,explaining was due for his triennial evaluation under the idea and his services might no longer be appropriate given his progress.
parents refused to consent to the reevaluation,complaining has been tested and tested and that needless or repetitive testing must be avoided.they argued the evaluation would include several tests unrelated to the ohi category,such as iq tests and psychiatric evaluations,and asserted this unnecessary testing constituted harassment.after a series of attempts to secure consent from parents,the school district requested a due process hearing to enforce its right to evaluate by an expert of its choice.the alj ruled in favor of the school district and ordered parents to cooperate with the reevaluation.
procedural history 
and his parents filed a complaint against the school board and several defendants in their official and individual capacities,seeking injunctive relief and damages for retaliation in violation of the ada,section,the idea,the first amendment,and they also challenged the order entered by the alj requiring parents to consent to the school district reevaluation.the district court first dismissed the plaintiffs retaliation claims because they were subject to the idea exhaustion requirement,and the plaintiffs had neither exhausted their administrative remedies nor shown such an effort would have been futile.the court then affirmed the alj order,construing the school board motion for summary judgment as a motion for judgment on the record.and his parents subsequently filed this appeal against the school district and three individuals in their personal capacities,stanley hawkins and wendy jacobs,lawyers who represent the school district,and sandy foxworth,a former special education administrator for the school district.
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of a motion to dismiss under b for failure to state a claim,accepting the allegations in the complaint as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.hill white,cir.t he usual civ.summary judgment principles do not apply in an idea case.loren atlanta indep.sch,cir.because nothing prevents district judges from factfinding under civ.in idea cases,their decisions are better described as judgment s on the record.id.at quotation omitted.we,in turn,review the district judge interpretations of law de novo and w here the district court does not receive any additional evidence or testimony,this court stands in the same shoes as the district court in reviewing the administrative record and may,therefore,accept the conclusions of the alj and district court that are supported by the record and reject those that are not.id.quotation omitted.
iii.discussion
