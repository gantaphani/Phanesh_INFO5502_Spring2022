this appeal arises following the determination,by the administrator of the center for medicare and medicaid services,that rural health clinics in louisiana do not furnish hospital services,and hence are not eligible for certain reimbursements.because we find that interpretation to be unreasonable,we reverse.
facts and proceedings 
statutory and regulatory background the medicaid program 
medicaid is designed to enable states to offer medical assistance to certain,elderly,and disabled individuals whose income and resources are inadequate to pay for necessary medical services.see.under the medicaid statute,the federal government and the states cooperate and share the cost of providing medical assistance to persons.
the medicaid statute gives each state flexibility in designing and administering its own medicaid program.under the statute,a state that elects to participate in the program submits a state plan for review and approval by the secretary secretary of the department of health and human services hhs.see generally.a state that seeks to change its state plan may submit a state plan amendment to the center for medicare and medicaid services cms for review and approval.see recording secretary delegation of authority for approving state plan amendments to cms.cms,on behalf of the secretary,is required to approve a state plan amendment that complies with all applicable statutes and regulations.b.once cms approves a state plan amendment,the secretary pays the state a percentage of the total amount the state expended as medical assistance under the state plan.a.the percentage for louisiana for the current fiscal year is.see,see also,raising louisiana percentage to for the fiscal year starting october.
provisions for disproportionate share hospitals 
in,congress added a requirement that state plans include higher reimbursement rates for public hospitals and teaching hospitals which serve a large medicaid and low income population and which are particularly dependent on medicaid reimbursement a a noting that a state plan must provide for a public process for determination of rates of payment under the plan for hospital services under which such rates take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of patients with special needs.to meet the disproportionate share dsh requirement,states must define and list dsh hospitals that serve a greater percentage of medicaid and patients.a see also b restricting dsh designation to hospitals with utilization rates exceeding or to hospitals whose medicaid inpatient utilization rate is at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate of all hospitals receiving medicaid payments.states must provide an appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment for such services.id.additionally,the statute contemplates that reimbursements will reflect not only the cost of caring for medicaid recipients,but also the cost of charity care given to uninsured patients.id.b basing definition of utilization rate in part on quantity of charity care provided by the hospital.in and,congress added specific requirements for states to comply with this general mandate through higher payments to designated hospitals.
and limits on dsh payment adjustments 
in,congress directed the secretary to determine limits on federal funding for dsh payments for each fiscal year,using a statutory formula.see f capping louisiana dsh allotment for fiscal year at million and for future fiscal years to the cap adjusted by the consumer price index.in,congress responded to reports that some hospitals received dsh payment adjustments that exceeded the net costs,and in some instances the total costs,of operating the facilities,by requiring limits on dsh payments.see,at,reprinted in,noting dsh payment adjustments seeped into state general funds to cover care items including road construction.
the limitations are at the heart of the dispute in this case.the amendment limits the amount of dsh payments to a specific hospital to 
the costs incurred during the year of furnishing hospital services as determined by the secretary and net of payments under this title,other than under this section,and by uninsured patients by the hospital to individuals who either are eligible for medical assistance under the state plan or have no health insurance or other source of third party coverage for services provided during the year.
g a emphasis added.
cms has not promulgated any regulations specifically addressing the dsh limit and thus has not addressed the use of the term hospital services as it relates to those limits.in a letter to state medicaid directors dated august,the health care financing administration hcfa,cms predecessor agency,stated 
there are several important considerations that must be made in determining the cost of services under the dsh limit,whether for medicaid or uninsured individuals.first,the legislative history of this provision makes it clear that states may include both inpatient and outpatient costs in the calculation of the limit.second,in defining costs of services under this provision,hcfa would permit the state to use the definition of allowable costs in its state plan,or any other definition,as long as the costs determined under such a definition do not exceed the amounts that would be allowable under the medicare principles of cost reimbursement hcfa believes this interpretation of the term costs incurred is reasonable because it provides states with a great deal of flexibility up to a maximum standard that is widely known and used in the determination of hospital costs.

rural health clinics rhcs 
rhcs generally furnish those diagnostic and therapeutic services and supplies that are commonly furnished in a physician office or at the entry point into the health care delivery system.c.rhcs also provide medical emergency procedures as a first response to common injuries and acute illness and has available the drugs and biologicals commonly used in life saving procedures,such as analgesics,anesthetics local,antibiotics,anticonvulsants,antidotes and emetics,serums and toxoids.id.c.services in rhcs are furnished by a physician or a practitioner,such as a nurse practitioner or physician assistant,acting under the direction of a physician.id.b.
louisiana efforts to increase dsh payment adjustments 
louisiana is largely rural and most of the rural areas are medically.see.may,listing urban areas from the census.recognizing that small rural hospitals bear significant costs for the services they provide to uninsured patients through their clinics louisiana sought guidance from hhs as to how those costs could be taken into account as part of a rural hospital dsh payment adjustment.in a january,letter senator john breaux asked donna shalala,the then secretary of hhs,to clarify when rhc costs could be taken into account for dsh purposes.in her response,secretary shalala wrote 
while i agree that a state has discretion to license or formally approve a rhc as an outpatient hospital clinic for purposes of the medicaid dsh program,i can not require that states consider the costs of such a facility in calculating dsh limits.under applicable law,a state has the flexibility to include a rhc under the license of the hospital,to separately license a rhc,or to issue a license which recognizes the dual nature of the clinic as both an outpatient hospital clinic and an rhc.where a state has chosen to license these clinics as hospital outpatient departments,and they are certified as part of the hospital,the state would be able to include the uncompensated care costs related to hospital outpatient services in the calculation of a hospital dsh payment limit.however,if the state has decided that its rhcs are to be separately licensed,then the clinics costs can not be included in dsh calculations.
our understanding is that louisiana law requires separate licensing of rhcs and does not provide for any other formal approval process to designate outpatient hospital facilities.even if an rhc in
