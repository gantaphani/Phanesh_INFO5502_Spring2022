nancy jacques defendant or appellant has appealed a sentence imposing restitution.in sentencing appellant to make restitution,the sentencing court could have relied on one of two statutes that give it such authority,but it did not indicate which statute it relied upon.it may well be that sometimes the best choice is not to choose at all.we do not think such proposition helpful here.yet,because the two statutes have different requirements,they have created a confusing anomaly for sentencing courts.we write in this case to remedy that anomaly.
on march,jacques pled guilty to a single count of an indictment charging her with converting to her own use social security funds intended for another.see a.she was sentenced in the united states district court for the southern district of new york before chief district court judge michael mukasey to three years probation and ordered to pay in restitution.
on this appeal from her sentence,jacques makes two separate challenges first,she contends it was error to impose restitution given her present and future inability to pay second,she avers that her right to be present at sentencing was violated because several conditions of her probation appeared in the written judgment of conviction,but were not mentioned orally at her sentencing.we vacate the sentence and remand this case to the district court to afford it an opportunity to articulate reasons for the order of restitution.
background 
jacques son,christopher,was born in july with a brain disorder.in early defendant applied to the social security administration for supplemental security income ssi benefits on her son behalf.the application was granted,and she began receiving monthly ssi checks.in response to allegations of neglect,connecticut state authorities removed christopher in march from the home jacques shared with wilfred frazier,her husband and christopher biological father,and placed the infant in foster care.on may,the connecticut superior court for juvenile matters terminated jacques and frazier parental rights with respect to christopher.
between the time of christopher removal in and may,jacques continued to receive ssi checks in all,totaling she continued to cash them even though christopher was no longer in her custody.as a result of jacques conduct,the government charged her with four counts of social security fraud.see a prohibiting anyone,having made application to receive any social security benefit for the use and benefit of another and having received it,from knowingly and willfully convert ing such benefit or any part thereof to a use other than for the use and benefit of such other person.
defendant pled guilty,pursuant to a plea agreement,to a single count of ssi fraud.in exchange,the government agreed to drop the remaining three fraud counts and to recommend a reduction in jacques offense level for acceptance of responsibility.the plea agreement also stipulated that defendant total offense level should be seven,and that she should be in criminal history category i,which,under the united states sentencing guidelines,yielded a sentencing range of zero to six months of imprisonment.in a rider to the plea agreement,jacques agreed that t he court may order that the defendant make restitution under.
the presentence investigation report presentence report,prepared by the probation office,contained the following information pertinent to this appeal.jacques,a haitian citizen,is a permanent resident of the united states.she was years old at the time of the sentencing and is a high school graduate,but with virtually no work experience,other than working as a babysitter for per week from to.her husband frazier supports her financially.although jacques and frazier currently have no dependents,they did have five other children in addition to christopher.one child died of sudden infant death syndrome in,and the other four were removed from the couple home by new york city welfare authorities.
according to the presentence report,jacques has no assets,no liabilities,and a net worth of zero.the probation office recommended that the sentencing court impose no fine because defendant was currently unable to pay one.although it made no predictions with respect to her future earning ability,the probation office recommended that restitution be imposed in the amount of.
defendant was sentenced on june.at the outset of the proceeding,the district court rejected the presentence report recommendation that jacques be ordered to receive mental health counseling.chief judge mukasey did not make any findings with respect to her mental condition,but reasoned instead that such counseling was unrelated to the offense at issue.
the sentencing court agreed with the presentence report calculation of the applicable range of zero to six months of imprisonment,but it declined to impose a prison sentence,choosing instead a period of probation.it further ordered jacques to make restitution in the amount of at the rate of percent of her earnings during that period,and to sign a confession of judgment at the end of the probationary period in whatever amount remains unpaid.if she were to pay the full amount in less than three years,then probation would terminate at that point.
although the district court did not mention at sentencing any conditions of probation other than the payment of restitution,the written judgment listed additional conditions.two of these defendant not commit another federal,state or local crime and that she refrain from illegally possessing a controlled mandatory conditions of probation under the sentencing guidelines,applicable to all probationary sentences regardless of the underlying crime.see a.thirteen other conditions were derived from the list of standard conditions that the sentencing guidelines recommend,but do not mandate for all defendants.see c.one additional defendant not possess a a special condition recommended by the guidelines for all defendants convicted of felonies.see d.
under the heading special conditions of supervision the written judgment stated that jacques must,inter alia,comply with all immigration and naturalization service obligations provide the probation office with access to her financial information and seek the permission of the probation office before incurring new credit charges or opening new lines of credit.only the first of these three conditions was not derived from the sentencing guidelines.the second and third special conditions of supervision were the special conditions recommended by the guidelines for all cases where a court orders restitution requirement of access to financial information or imposes an installment payment schedule restriction on new credit.see d.
we turn now to the two challenges jacques brings to her sentence.
discussion 
i restitution order 
a restitution order is reviewed for abuse of discretion.see united states salameh,cir per curiam,cert.denied,d,d.we have explained that,because a restitution order requires a balancing of what may be incompatible factors,the sentencing court is in the best position to engage in such balancing,and its restitution order will not be disturbed absent abuse of discretion.united states ismail,cir per curiam.insofar as review involves an interpretation of law,we proceed de novo.see united states grant,cir.
in this case the district court did not identify the statute it relied upon for its authority to order restitution.the government contends the order is authorized by either b,which pertains specifically to cases of ssi fraud,or the more general restitution provision of.appellant,in contrast,insists that does not authorize an order of restitution in her case.
before addressing these arguments we note that in congress made significant amendments to the general restitution provisions of title.see antiterrorism and effective death penalty act of,stat.there are no relevant substantive differences between the present version of these provisions and the version in effect in,when jacques committed the offense of which she was convicted.specifically,title still allows imposition of restitution under in any criminal case pursuant to a plea agreement and requires that,in determining whether to impose restitution under,the sentencing court consider the same factors that were mandatory in,the loss sustained by victims,financial resources of defendant,and financial needs and earning ability of defendant and her dependents.compare a,a b i supp.v with a,a.thus,we need not decide whether the amendments apply to jacques case.our reasoning and conclusions here are equally applicable to cases involving pre and versions of title.united states kinlock,cir finding the mandatory factors in the pre and title restitution provisions are the same.
in claiming that does not apply to her case,appellant cites our decision in united states fore,cir.in fore,we observed that a authorizes a court to order restitution only when sentencing a defendant convicted of offenses listed in that subsection.id.at.violations of title of the united states code,of which both jacques and fore were convicted,are not included in that list.id.because the court authority to order restitution depends upon the statute,th e omission of title offenses in section a deprives the district court of the power to order restitution for social security fraud convictions.id.
the present case is distinguishable from fore.unlike fore,who was convicted by a jury,jacques pled guilty.in a rider to the plea agreement,she agreed that the court may order that she make restitution under.this concession brings into play a subsection of the statute that was not at issue in fore,one that provides that a sentencing court may also order restitution in any criminal case to the extent agreed to by the parties in a plea agreement.a see also united states gottesman,cir distinguishing a,which by its terms applies only to offenses specified in the statute,from a,which does not contain a similar limitation.hence,we agree with the government that the district court may have relied on either b or as its source of authority for the restitution order imposed in this case.as discussed below,a remand is necessary under either of these statutes.
restitution pursuant to 
title expressly requires that,in deciding whether to impose restitution pursuant to,a district court consider the amount of the loss sustained by each victim as a result of the offense,the financial resources of the defendant,the financial needs and earning ability of the defendant and the defendant dependents hereafter the mandatory factors,and such other factors as the court deems appropriate.a see also a b i supp.v listing the factors district courts must consider under united states ben zvi,cir same united states thompson,cir same.
appellant asserts that the district court imposed restitution only in case she str uck it rich in the future and because of the moral value of requiring her to get a job.she argues that these were improper factors for a sentencing court to consider and that it failed to consider her ability to pay,as required under.she further maintains that the district judge statement that he was not very confident she would find a job constituted a finding that she would be unable to make restitution payments.
we agree with defendant that the district court statements at sentencing lack the specificity required for us to be sure that it considered the mandatory factors.although a sentencing court is not required to set forth its findings in detail,the record must reflect that it has considered the statutorily mandated factors.united states mortimer,cir see also kinlock,at noting the record must demonstrate that the court considered the mandatory factors united states porter,cir porter ii same.
yet,we can not agree with appellant interpretation of the district court remarks at sentencing,and instead think it likely that on remand it will be able to support its current restitution order.although chief judge mukasey used the phrase strike it rich,the context of the reference suggests that he did not rely on this possibility as a reason for imposing restitution.after hearing defense attorney argument that restitution should not be imposed because of defendant limited financial means,the district court asked,i assume the government wants me to impose restitution against the possibility that she strikes it rich some day.the prosecutor responded that the reason for imposing restitution was that 
there is no indication why she has been employed since,and she suggests nothing about why she ca.she can certainly at least attempt to make a dent in the amount that she stole by getting employed in the next few years and making some payments in a percentage for the benefit of the child.
as this context makes clear,the reference to striking it rich was an invitation to the prosecutor to explain his reasons for advocating restitution despite jacques indigency,not a statement of the sentencing court reasons for ultimately ordering restitution.
the sentencing transcript does not show that the district court considered jacques future earning ability.the only comment on this subject came in response to defense counsel assertion that he lacked confidence that his client would be able to find a job.the district court replied,i ca say that i very confident,but the effort has a certain moral value to it.we decline appellant invitation to interpret this expression of doubt about her ability to secure employment as a finding of her inability to do so.porter ii,at when there is doubt about ability to pay,the court should order full restitution.united states porter,cir porter i despite the use of the word may,we have held that the purpose of the restitution provision is to require restitution whenever possible.
moreover,the district court reference at sentencing to the possibility that the restitution order would spur jacques to get a job indicates that it did not view defendant employment prospects as hopeless.this reference also indicates that the court expected the restitution payments to come not from her winning a lottery or some other windfall,but from her earned wages.
further,we disagree with appellant contention that the district court abused its discretion by considering the moral value of using restitution as a tool to encourage her to get a job.the restitution statute expressly allows a sentencing court to take into account,in addition to the mandatory factors,such other factors as the court deems appropriate.a b i ii supp.v.jacques is a mother who stole over meant to benefit her disabled infant son.giving her an incentive to secure a source of income so that she can pay back the stolen money is a reasonable sentencing consideration and one plainly related to the offense.
we reject,in addition,jacques argument that because she has never held a job in the past and currently has no assets,it is unrealistic to expect her to pay back the money she appropriated.appellant equates her being able to comply with the restitution order to a miracle.we can not adopt this characterization.quite the contrary,we see no good reason why a high school graduate who is apparently in good physical health can not find a job and pay back the she took from her infant son.ben zvi,at i n the absence of a defendant showing a restricted future earnings potential by a preponderance of the evidence,it is entirely reasonable for a district judge to presume future earnings in ordering restitution.
restitution pursuant to b 
as noted earlier,the district court could have imposed restitution pursuant to,a provision describing criminal penalties for ssi fraud.subsection b of states that a district court may impose full or partial restitution on a defendant who has committed ssi fraud in her role as,or in applying to become,a representative payee on behalf of another individual if the violation includes a willful misuse of funds.b.unlike the provisions of,there are no statutorily mandated factors for a sentencing court to consider when directing restitution pursuant to b.nevertheless,the parties agree that even under b the district court must consider the defendant ability to pay restitution.because,as explained above,the record is unclear with regard to whether the district court determined that jacques had the ability to pay restitution,we
