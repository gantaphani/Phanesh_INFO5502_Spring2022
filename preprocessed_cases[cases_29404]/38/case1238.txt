this is an appeal from the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court.cerise checo initially sought an increased disability rating for a back injury,which the board of veterans appeals denied on july.however,checo was homeless and unable to obtain mail until october,when she finally received a copy of the adverse decision.she eventually filed her notice of appeal noa days late.the veterans court concluded that checo noa was untimely and that she failed to show why her homelessness warranted equitable tolling.see checo shinseki.
we conclude that the veterans court used an inappropriate due diligence standard and erred in determining that checo homelessness did not cause a day delay in her filing.therefore,we vacate the veterans court dismissal of checo appeal and remand this case for further proceedings.
background and procedural history 
checo initially filed a claim seeking an increased disability rating for lumbosacral spinal stenosis,including disk bulges at the and vertebrae,which is currently rated at a disability.on july,the board of veterans appeals issued a decision denying her request.checo was homeless at that time,residing in shelters and temporary housing without the ability to receive mail.on september,checo contacted the department of veterans affairs va to provide a new address,and she received a copy of the adverse decision on october,after days of the day filing period under had passed.on december,checo filed an noa of the decision,days after the expiration of the day period.in the noa,she wrote due to economic hardship,i been homeless for extensive periods of time since july,residing in shelters and temporary housing.during this time,i was unable to receive mail and did not learn about the hearing and subsequent decision until a copy of the decision was mailed to her in october.j.
under bove shinseki,the clerk of the veterans court may identify late appeals and issue show cause orders for why these appeals should not be dismissed.see.pursuant to this policy and before any substantive briefing occurred,the clerk of the veterans court ordered the secretary to file a response discussing whether the circumstances in checo case warranted the equitable tolling of the day judicial appeal period 
in its response,the secretary noted that it appears that checo homelessness was due to circumstances beyond her control.the secretary also stated that checo homelessness would have delayed her filing of her noa.id.at.
after the veterans court accepted the secretary concession that checo homelessness qualified as an extraordinary circumstance,it ruled that checo nonetheless failed to prove the two other necessary diligence and direct causation to warrant equitable tolling.see checo.at.the veterans court then dismissed checo appeal.id.at.
ii.discussion 
checo challenges two aspects of the veterans court order.first,she questions whether the veterans court acted within its authority when it raised the timeliness issue sua sponte under bove.second,checo disputes the veterans court conclusion that she is not entitled to equitable tolling.we address each of checo challenges in turn.
a.the bove decision 
as noted above,in bove shinseki the veterans court directed the clerk of the court to identify late appeals and issue orders for why these appeals should not be dismissed.at.checo and both argue that bove,which was never appealed to this court,should now be overruled.we have jurisdiction to review veterans court decisions concerning any challenge to an interpretation of a statute,regulation,or rule under a.cummings west,cox west,these questions of legal interpretation are clearly within our jurisdiction.such legal determinations of the veterans court are reviewed without deference.bingham nicholson,citation omitted.
to begin her argument,checo notes the distinction between time limitations,which are waivable,and jurisdictional limitations,which are not.see,eberhart united states,d c rules thus assure relief to a party properly raising them,but do not compel the same result if the party forfeits them.she argues that here the veterans court practice of raising timeliness issues on its own eliminates the opportunity for the secretary to waive the right to challenge the appeal period limitation.
checo also argues that if congress had wanted a to be,it would have done so.instead,according to checo,this veterans court procedure creates the appearance of bias against disabled veterans.barrett nicholson,i t was for the purpose of ensuring that veterans were treated fairly by the government and to see that all veterans entitled to benefits received them that congress provided for judicial review.
next,checo points out that judicial review of veterans board decisions is an adversarial process,so she contends that only the parties should present the issues.see bobbitt principi,f iling an appeal to this court is not an action within the,manifestly veterans benefits system.rather,it is the first step in an adversarial process challenging the secretary decision on benefits.citation omitted.
finally,checo requests that we compare the veterans court to the social security disability program,as it has been called an analogous system.henderson ex rel.henderson shinseki,d.and the supreme court has stated that the time period for filing an appeal for judicial review of a social security decision is waivable.see bowen new york,d.
we have considered all of checo arguments,but we do not find them persuasive.while checo relies on several cases that distinguish and jurisdictional limitations,she fails to point to a single case that affirmatively states that the veterans court can not raise sua sponte a limitation.further,as the government notes,the supreme court has permitted district courts to raise statute of limitations issues sua sponte.see,day mcdonough,in sum,we hold that district courts are permitted,but not obliged,to consider,sua sponte,the timeliness of a state prisoner habeas petition.
regarding checo arguments that congress could have,and did not,make a unwaivable,we conclude that congress nonetheless gave the veterans court broad discretion to prescribe,interpret,and apply its own rules.the veterans court uses that discretion here to require that a claimant file an noa within the time allowed by law.see.b authorizing the veterans court to take such action as the court deems appropriate,including dismissal of the appeal,when a party fails to comply with a rule of the veterans court.
further,the fact that proceedings in the veterans court are adversarial does not prevent the veterans court from managing its cases,which it does by requiring its clerk to identify late noas and issue orders before any substantive pleadings are filed.and we note that even when an noa is untimely,the veterans court still considers whether equitable tolling applies,so this procedure does not create any unfair bias.
finally,despite the similarities between veterans appeals and social security cases,we note that parties in social security cases are still subject to federal rule of civil procedure c.this rule requires a party to state any affirmative defense in response to a pleading,so it makes sense in those cases to allow waiver of time limitations.but the federal rules of civil procedure do not apply to the appellate veterans court.
for the foregoing reasons,we see no reason at this time to overrule the holding in bove that grants the veterans court authority to address untimely filings sua sponte we conclude that in this case the veterans court did not err by raising sua sponte the untimely appeal issue.
equitable tolling 
we next turn to whether the veterans court erred in ruling that checo is not entitled to equitable tolling.as we stated previously,this court has jurisdiction to review the legal determinations of the veterans court under.however,we may not review the veterans court factual findings or its application of law to facts.singleton shinseki,citing reizenstein shinseki.
in order to benefit from equitable tolling,the veterans court has previously required a claimant to demonstrate three elements extraordinary circumstance due diligence and causation.see mccreary nicholson,adhered to on reconsideration.this is consistent with other jurisdictions and also with the guidance provided by the supreme court,and neither party challenges this test here.see irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d we have allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies but the principles of equitable tolling do not extend to what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.
extraordinary circumstance 
during oral argument at the veterans court,the secretary acknowledged that it has conceded that checo homelessness qualifies as an extraordinary circumstance in this case.see.the veterans court accepted this concession,and we agree we therefore conclude that checo has satisfied the extraordinary circumstance element.
due diligence 
in addition to an extraordinary circumstance,a party who seeks equitable tolling must also show due diligence.see irwin,at harper ercole,cir mccreary.at.we begin our inquiry by considering for which period checo needed to show such due diligence during the entire day appeal,during the period of extraordinary circumstances,ending on october,when she received a copy of the,during the period between the end of the extraordinary circumstances and the date of filing the noa,between october,and december,or during some other period 
although this is an issue of first impression in this court,we find the second circuit analysis in harper ercole persuasive.see at.there,the second circuit concluded that due diligence must only be shown during the requested tolling period,which can occur at any time during the statutory period.id.the second circuit explained that a court may suspend the statute of limitations for the period of extraordinary circumstances and determine timeliness by reference to the total untolled period without requiring a further showing of diligence through filing.id.the parties refer to this in their briefing as the approach because the clock measuring the day appeal period is stopped during the extraordinary circumstance period and starts ticking again only when the period is over.as applied to this case,the approach would mean that the appeal period was suspended between july,and october,and we would only need to consider whether checo has shown diligence during that time.
the veterans court,however,has previously required a showing of due diligence throughout the entire appeal period.see mccreary.at.in that case,the extraordinary circumstance came in the form of a hurricane due to the storm,the claimant misplaced his appeal papers.id.the veterans court found that the claimant could have found and filed his papers at some unspecified time before the expiration of the limitations period despite the hurricane.see id.at.as applied to this case,the mccreary standard would require us to examine whether checo showed due diligence from july,the beginning of the day appeal period until december,the date that she filed her noa.
checo argues that the approach should apply in this case,making the relevant due diligence period the days that she was homeless between july,and october,with the entire day appeal period starting to run upon her receipt of the adverse decision.she claims that the approach applies when the extraordinary circumstance period has a definite end date for equitable tolling.here,that definite end date is october,marking the end of her homelessness.she argues that the mccreary standard is a fallback approach,one that is to be used only when the extraordinary circumstance period has no end date,such as the recovery period after a hurricane.during oral argument before the veterans court,the secretary agreed that the approach would be appropriate in checo case.see t he secretary does not contest that the court should use the approach.see also oral arg.tr.before the veterans court the secretary conceded that it did not have a problem with the approach.
we agree with both parties and adopt the approach.as a result,we conclude that checo must only demonstrate due diligence during the extraordinary circumstance period,which began on july,and ended on october.and if she is successful in demonstrating both due diligence and causation during this time period under the approach the appeal clock would begin to run on october,making her noa filed on december,timely 
below,checo explained to the veterans court in her noa that while she was homeless she was unable to receive mail and did not learn about the hearing and subsequent decision until october.the veterans court nonetheless concluded not only that checo had failed to prove due diligence but also that she failed to even assert that she acted diligently.checo.at emphasis added.the government argues that this factual finding is not subject to review by our court and that we must therefore uphold the veterans court determination that the statute should not be equitably tolled.
although we may not review the veterans court factual findings,we may review whether the veterans court erred as a matter of law in using an improper standard of due diligence for checo.see a.the supreme court has stated that t he diligence required for equitable tolling purposes is reasonable diligence,not maximum feasible diligence.holland florida,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
however,we lack sufficient information to even determine what diligence standard the veterans court used in concluding that checo had not met her burden.we note that during oral argument before the veterans court,the secretary suggested that checo should have sought general delivery of her mail knowing that there was an outstanding board decision or an appeal pending before the board.but such action was impossible for checo,as she stated that she was unable to receive mail,so she had no new address to provide until september,when she contacted the.the secretary did not challenge the veracity of that assertion.
the veterans court stated that checo should have cited actions that she took during the period of time sought to be tolled that would tend to prove such diligence in pursuing her appeal.checo.at.but it remains unclear what further actions she needed to specifically cite to support her claim that she acted diligently.indeed,during oral argument in our court,the government counsel expressed hesitat ion to put out factors as to what she could have done or should have done.oral arg.tr.see also id.at q would the government feel that it was necessary to challenge a statement that said i tried my best a i think that is a very difficult question.since we do not know what would have been necessary to prove due diligence to the veterans court,we are unable to evaluate whether it used too high of a due diligence standard.
we therefore remand checo case back to the veterans court so that it may clarify and apply an appropriate due diligence standard to the facts of checo case as well as engage in further fact finding as necessary.
below,the veterans court emphasize d that checo failed to provide any facts to support a finding of direct causation between her homelessness and her failure to file her noa within the day judicial appeal period.checo.at.thus,the veterans court concluded that checo had not carried her burden.id.
we conclude that this was a legal error,as the veterans court used the wrong test for causation.the veterans court required checo to prove why her homelessness caused her inability to file the noa within the day appeal period,but as discussed above in section,under the approach checo only needed to demonstrate causation between her homelessness and the period she sought to be tolled,the day period.see generally harper,at.
in her noa,checo explained that while she was homeless,she was unable to receive mail and did not learn about the hearing and subsequent decision until a copy of the decision was mailed to her on october,marking the end of the day period she now seeks to toll.thus,although checo failed to explain why her homelessness caused a delay between october,and the end of the appeal period,she did indeed explain why her homelessness caused a delay during the day period.
