plaintiff sunline transit agency sunline appeals from a judgment entered after the trial court denied sunline petition to vacate a contractual arbitration award,and granted a petition to confirm the award,brought by sunline employee,rafael navarette navarette,and amalgamated transit union,local the union,referred to collectively as respondents.in the award,the arbitrator found that sunline terminated navarette without good cause in violation of the collective bargaining agreement,also known as a memorandum of understanding the mou.sunline was thus ordered to reinstate navarrete as a motor coach operator bus driver,with back pay,less interim earnings and vocational rehabilitation compensation.
sunline contends the arbitration award should be vacated on the grounds the award contravenes public policy under the workers compensation act wca,et and the arbitrator exceeded his powers under the mou code civ,subd.a sunline also argues that respondents were estopped from using arbitration as a competing forum to contest workers compensation findings and remedies.
we conclude the trial court properly denied sunline motion to vacate or modify the arbitration award and appropriately confirmed the award,as corrected.the award neither invades the exclusive jurisdiction of the workers compensation appeals board wcab nor was entered in excess of the arbitrator powers under the mou.
the union challenges the trial court insertion in the judgment of language declaring that navarrete is judicially estopped later to claim continuing permanent disability benefits in the pending workers compensation case.the union contends the trial court did not have authority to issue a judgment containing this additional language,which was not in conformity with the arbitration award.we agree,and order the language stricken from the judgment.in all other regards,the judgment confirming the arbitration award,as corrected,is affirmed.
facts and procedural background 
navarrete began working for sunline as a bus driver in april.during his employment with sunline,navarrete sustained numerous industrial injuries and submitted six separate workers compensation claims,including three in,one in and two in.
on february,navarrete was injured while conducting a pretrip inspection of his bus.navarrete sustained injuries to his head,neck,back,shoulders,right wrist,right leg and right ankle.as a consequence,navarrete was placed on an industrial leave and filed a workers compensation claim.
in september,navarrete and sunline agreed to designate richard woods woods as an agreed medical examiner ame,who was to examine navarrete and evaluate his disability and need for medical care under the wca.
in november,woods examined navarette and reviewed his medical records related to his injuries sustained on february,as well as navarrete medical records related to his previous industrial injuries and workers compensation claims.
on february,navarrete treating physician,douglas roger roger,gave navarrete a return to work slip,which stated navarrete was temporarily partially disabled and able to return to modified work as a bus driver on february.the slip included a restriction against lifting more than pounds.because of this restriction,sunline refused to allow navarrete to return to work.sunline notified navarrete that as of february,per the mou article section k your employment with sunline transit agency terminates.
the mou mentioned in the notice of termination referred to a collective bargaining agreement,which sunline and its employees union entered into,effective from april,through march.the mou contained written terms and conditions of employment relating to sunline employees,including its bus drivers.the mou specified employee grievance procedures and provided for arbitration in the event a dispute arose concerning interpretation or application of the mou terms.
article,section k of the mou,cited in sunline employment termination notice as the ground for terminating navarrete,stated employees shall lose all seniority rights and employment shall cease for any of the following reasons k if an employee is absent from work for an industrial illness or injury in excess of two years.as of february,navarrete was absent from work at least two years due to his industrial injury sustained on february.
when sunline and the union met on february,to discuss navarrete employment termination grievance,sunline agreed to send roger a copy of navarrete job description,along with an inquiry as to whether navarrete would be able to perform the essential duties of his job based on the job description.in return,the union agreed not to appeal to the second grievance level under the mou,until roger responded to the inquiry.navarrete job description,which sunline provided roger,included the following 
primary duties,responsibilities,job outcomes 
assists passengers as necessary and deals courteously and effectively with passengers,the public and fellow employees at all times.
calls out all major intersections as prescribed by ada and company policies assists special passengers as instructed.
performs related duties as necessary or special assignments as directed.
navarrete job description also included the following 
working conditions 
walking,reading,writing,bending,stooping,speaking,hearing and repetitive motion of wrist,hands,leg neck and head prolonged sitting.
ability to operate wheelchair lift and maneuver wheelchairs and their vehicles used by disabled to accommodate.
there were no lifting requirements listed in the job description.
in response to sunline inquiry regarding navarrete ability to return to work,roger stated,ok to return to work as a motor coach operator.
by letter dated february,sunline notified navarette that roger confirmed that the same work restrictions applied and therefore sunline previous decision to terminate navarette based on mou article,section k still stands.sunline further notified navarrete that a grievance hearing was set pursuant to the mou,during which navarrete could present his case.
on march,roger provided a disability status report confirming that navarrete was able to return to his job as a bus driver on march,without any restrictions.roger noted he was awaiting the ame report.
meanwhile,on march,woods completed the ame report.the report was sent to the parties on march.woods concluded in the report that navarrete had a permanent disability and his condition was stable and not likely to improve.woods further concluded that,based on navarrete stated job duties and due to accommodations and work restrictions currently imposed,navarrete was not capable of performing his usual and customary duties.he therefore was eligible for vocational rehabilitation.
sunline conducted a hearing on navarrete termination grievance on march,and on march,sunline notified navarrete that,based on woods statement that navarrete was unable to return to work without restrictions,sunline decision to terminate his employment as of february,in accordance with article,section k of the mou,stands.
in response,the union notified sunline it was appealing the first level decision and was requesting that the matter proceed to the second level under the mou.on april,sunline conducted a second level grievance hearing on navarrete termination grievance,and informed him by letter dated april,that the termination decision stands pursuant to article,section k of the mou.sunline also noted that navarrete had been provided with the ame report stating that he was unable to return to his job and was eligible for vocational rehabilitation under the wca.
the union,on navarrete behalf,filed a demand for arbitration appealing from sunline final decision on april.arbitration under the mou was to be conducted by a tripartite arbitration board,consisting of one arbitrator selected by the union,one arbitrator selected by sunline,and a third,neutral arbitrator selected from a list of arbitrators listed in the mou.because the votes of the arbitrators selected by sunline and by the union offset each other,the third,neutral arbitrator the arbitrator issued the controlling written arbitration decision,which sunline challenges in this appeal the arbitration award.
in september,woods provided a supplemental ame report,stating he had reviewed additional medical records but his opinions in the original ame report remained the same.
on november,navarrete termination grievance was arbitrated.the parties agreed that the issue to be arbitrated was the following was the grievant terminated for cause if not,what is the appropriate remedy during the hearing,sunline and the union presented evidence.due to roger issuing on november,a release without restrictions,the hearing was continued to allow roger to testify as to navarrete current physical condition.
in december,the parties agreed to submit the case without roger testimony,conditional upon the union withdrawing evidence of roger november release without restrictions.sunline objected to the november release because it occurred after expiration of the termination period and sunline did not have an opportunity to roger.in addition,sunline argued the november release conflicted with the wcab jurisdiction over navarrete industrial injury claims.
sunline position at arbitration was that,because of the lifting restriction,navarrete was incapable of performing his job as a bus driver because he could not assist wheelchair passengers with their wheelchairs on the bus.
the union argued that sunline did not have good cause to preclude navarrete from returning to work on february,and,in turn,did not have good cause to terminate him since there was no evidence navarrete had any physical limitations that prevented him from driving a bus.
the arbitrator stated in his detailed arbitration decision,issued on february,that sunline initial decision to preclude navarrete from returning to work on february,and thereafter to terminate him,was based solely on the lifting restriction.the arbitrator concluded this did not constitute good cause since sunline failed to establish any specific lifting requirements,and testimony disclosed that sunline instructed its bus drivers not to lift anything they felt they could not lift and to seek assistance when necessary.the arbitrator did not find the ame report persuasive because it assumed navarrete job required lifting,whereas the job description did not include lifting as a requirement.lifting wheelchairs was not a required job duty and a bus driver was also not required to lift a passenger who fell out of a wheelchair on the bus.
the arbitrator further explained that he did not find persuasive woods opinion that navarrete was incapable of performing his duties due to lifting restrictions,because woods erroneously assumed navarrete job required heavy lifting and other strenuous physical activity,but there was no evidence that bus drivers were required to engage in any heavy lifting,overhead reaching,repetitive bending and stooping,or forceful pushing,pulling or repetitive work above the shoulder level.
with regard to sunline contention that the arbitrator improperly decided matters subject to the wcab exclusive jurisdiction,the arbitrator stated in his decision in making this decision,i have not made any determination as to the principles under workers compensation statutes.more specifically,i have given no consideration to the terms whole person impairments and impairments under workers compensation law.as with my analysis with respect to the employer contentions dealing with the application of the ada,other statutes and regulations,i have considered the evidence in this record solely in relation to their application to the terms of the collective bargaining more specifically whether proper and just cause existed to terminate the grievant.whether the grievant had an impairment under workers compensation law and whatever workers compensation might find in terms of percentages of impairment is not necessarily a factor in my than i note that the grievant does not have anywhere near a whole person impairment rating.
the arbitrator thus found the union arguments persuasive that the employer failed to demonstrate that the grievant was incapable of performing his duties as of february.to the contrary,i find that the weight of the evidence demonstrates that the grievant was and is capable of performing the duties and that he was capable before his two year industrial leave expired.
based on these findings,the arbitrator concluded that sunline did not have proper and just cause to terminate navarrete.therefore,his termination violated the mou and navarrete was entitled to reinstatement to his former position,restoration of all lost benefits due to termination,and reimbursement for all back pay,less interim earnings and vocational rehabilitation compensation.
in footnote,the arbitrator added that,parenthetically,the grievant reinstatement will be without restriction inasmuch as on november,roger issued a release without restrictions.
on march,sunline filed in the superior court a petition to vacate the arbitration award or,alternatively,to correct it by striking footnote.sunline sought to vacate the award under section,subdivision a,on the ground the arbitrator exceeded his powers by attacking the foundation,findings and opinions of the ame report,deciding medical and disability related issues not submitted for arbitration,violating public policy under the wca,violating sunline statutory rights under the wca,and issuing an award subjecting sunline to remedies and findings conflicting with those in the workers compensation forum.respondents filed a response and a to confirm the arbitration award.
on june,the trial court heard sunline and the union petitions.during the hearing,the trial court noted,it appears the workers compensation case is still pending,and to the extent that navarette now claims he is able to work,he is judicially estopped later to claim continuing permanent disability benefits.the court added that medical conditions are evolving,and a finding of permanent disability in november of does not preclude a different finding later.respondents objected to the court declaring navarrete judicially estopped from continuing to claim permanent disability because he was being reinstated in his job.sunline argued navarrete could not be reinstated in the arbitration proceedings and then claim permanent disability in his pending workers compensation case,since this would result in mutually inconsistent remedies.
on august,the trial court entered an order denying sunline petition to vacate the arbitration award,but granting modification of the award by striking footnote.the court further granted respondents petition to confirm the arbitration award,as corrected.
on august,the court executed the proposed judgment,prepared by sunline,which stated the arbitration award was confirmed,as corrected to delete footnote.the following additional language,which was not included in the court order,was added to the judgment navarrete is judicially estopped later to claim continuing permanent disability benefits in the pending workers compensation case.
sunline appeals the judgment and the union.
standard of review of arbitration awards 
in reviewing the arbitration award and trial court judgment,we apply the following principles california public policy supports the use of private arbitration to resolve disputes.citations.to promote this alternative means of dispute resolution,the law minimizes judicial intervention in the proceedings,in part,by the doctrine of arbitral finality.citation.thus,the general rule is that an arbitrator decision can not be reviewed for errors of fact or law.citation.citation.b oth because it vindicates the intentions of the parties that the award be final,and because an arbitrator is not ordinarily constrained to decide according to the rule of law,it is the general rule that,the merits of the controversy between the parties are not subject to judicial review.citations.more specifically,courts will not review the validity of the arbitrator reasoning.citations.further,a court may not review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting an arbitrator award.citations.citation.jones humanscale th,jones.
it is thus well settled that the scope of judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely narrow w ith limited exceptions,an arbitrator decision is not generally reviewable for errors of fact or law,whether or not such error appears on the face of the award and causes substantial injustice to the parties.citation.citation.judicial review of private arbitration awards is ordinarily limited under section to the statutory grounds for vacating an award code civ,and correcting an award code civ.citation.city of palo alto service employees internat.union th.
in relatively rare instances the court may also vacate or correct an arbitration award,w here according finality to the arbitrator decision would be incompatible with the protection of a statutory right or where the award contravenes an explicit legislative expression of public policy.citations.city of palo alto service employees internat.union,supra,th at.absent a clear expression of illegality or public policy undermining this strong presumption in favor of private arbitration,an arbitral award should ordinarily stand immune from judicial scrutiny.moncharsh heily blase cal th.
exceptions based on violation of a statute or public policy 
vacating an arbitration award based on public policy or a statutory right requires an explicit legislative expression of a public policy violated by the award or a conflict with a statutory scheme.otherwise,courts are reluctant to invalidate an arbitrator award because the legislature has already expressed its strong support for private arbitration and the finality of arbitral awards in title of the code of civil procedure.et absent a clear expression of illegality or public policy undermining this strong presumption in favor of private arbitration,an arbitral award should ordinarily stand immune from judicial scrutiny.moncharsh heily blase,supra,cal th at.
sunline contends this court should independently review the award and vacate it because the award invades sunline statutory rights under the wca and the overriding public policy of the wca.we disagree.the arbitration award,in which sunline was ordered to reinstate navarrete in his job and reimburse him for back pay and benefits,less interim earnings and vocational rehabilitation compensation,does not conflict with workers compensation jurisdiction over navarrete separate workers compensation claims.
generally,under the workers compensation doctrine,when an injured employee is entitled to recover workers compensation benefits,those benefits constitute the employee exclusive remedy against the employer and his or her fellow employees.t he basis for the exclusivity rule in workers compensation law is the presumed compensation bargain,pursuant to which the employer assumes liability for industrial personal injury or death without regard to fault in exchange for limitations on the amount of that liability.the employee is afforded relatively swift and certain payment of benefits to cure or relieve the effects of industrial injury without having to prove fault but,in exchange,gives up the wider range of damages potentially available in tort.citation.fermino fedco,cal th,fermino,quoting shoemaker myers cal d.
the exclusivity rule does not apply when the employer conduct falls outside the scope of compensation bargain.fermino,supra,cal th at shoemaker myers,supra,cal d at.the exclusivity rule only applies when there is a personal physical injury or death.charles vacanti,state comp.ins.fund cal th,vacanti.
summarizing these principles,the california supreme court,in fermino,supra,cal th at pages,stated that there is a tripartite system for classifying injuries arising in the course of employment.first,there are injuries caused by employer negligence or without employer fault that are compensated at the normal rate under the workers compensation system.second,there are injuries caused by ordinary employer conduct that intentionally,knowingly or recklessly harms an employee,for which the employee may be entitled to extra compensation within the workers compensation system.third,there are certain types of intentional employer conduct which bring the employer beyond the boundaries of the compensation bargain,for which a civil action may be brought.
here,the essence of the wrong was a violation of an employment right,wrongful termination without good cause,not the occurrence of a personal physical injury.determination of the issue arbitrated did not require the arbitrator to make findings as to sunline liability for navarrete industrial personal injuries or as to compensation for such injuries.rather,the issue arbitrated concerned whether sunline wrongfully terminated navarrete based on article,section k of the mou,which allows sunline to terminate an employee who has been absent from work for an industrial illness or injury in excess of two years.it was undisputed navarrete was absent from work for more than two years,navarrete suffered an industrial injury on february,and remained off work for more than two years.
the dispute in this case concerns whether there was good cause for sunline to refuse to allow navarrete to return to work before expiration of the period based on the lifting restriction.in making this determination,the arbitrator was not required to make factual findings on the nature and extent of navarrete disabilities or his workers compensation remedies.whether the lifting restriction was a valid ground turned on whether navarrete could perform his job duties in spite of the lifting restriction.if he could,there was no valid basis for sunline refusing to allow navarrete to return to work,and navarrete termination was not based on good cause because it was due to sunline unjustifiably preventing him from returning to work within two years.
the workers compensation exclusivity rule thus does not apply because sunline act of refusing to allow navarrete to return to work on february,fell outside the scope of workers compensation bargain.fermino,supra,cal th at shoemaker myers,supra,cal d.whether there was good cause for precluding navarrete from returning to work was the issue to be decided by arbitration,and was not encompassed by the wca.
in amalgamated transit union local los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th lamta,which is factually similar to the instant case,the court rejected essentially the same argument sunline raises,that the wcab had exclusive jurisdiction over the wrongful termination matter.the court in lamta held that the workers compensation exclusive remedy doctrine did not preclude arbitration,under the collective bargaining agreement,of an employee grievance,in which the employee sought to return to work after recovering from an industrial injury.the employer,metropolitan transportation authority mta,precluded the employee from returning to work because the ame concluded the employee should not do so without modifying her job.the mta concluded it could not implement the modifications proposed by the ame and therefore deemed the employee a qualified injured worker.
the worker in lamta filed a grievance,seeking to return to work and recover back pay.lamta,supra,th at.meanwhile,in the workers compensation proceedings,both the ame and a doctor retained by mta agreed the employee could return to work.id.at.the employee union filed a petition to compel arbitration of the employee grievance seeking to return to work.the trial court denied the petition,noting that nothing in the collective bargaining agreement required the mta to arbitrate the issue of an employee ability to return to work if the employee has a pending workers comp claim and an agreed medical examiner has stated that the employee needs modification,vocational rehabilitation or restriction.id.at.after the appeal was filed,the employee underlying workers compensation claims were resolved.ibid.
the court in lamta rejected the employer contention that the employee grievance,seeking to return to work,related directly to her workers compensation case and was an attempt to circumvent the workers compensation findings and remedies.lamta,supra,th at.the lamta court concluded that,regardless of the underlying workers compensation claims,the union,on behalf of the employee,was entitled to arbitrate the grievance.ibid.
the court in lamta reasoned that the arbitration claim,is the flip side of a workers compensation claim and distinguishable from it.lamta,supra,th at.this is because the arbitration claim does not seek compensation or concern any related right of liability citation for an industrial personal injury.citation.rather,she seeks her salary for when she was allegedly no longer suffering the disabling effects of an industrial injury and was able to work,but was denied the right to work guaranteed in the collective bargaining agreement.the employee sutherland thus did not attempt to arbitrate injury compensation issues that were pending before the wcab,and the union acknowledges that there can not be a double recovery of backpay.ibid.
the lamta court further noted that the employee grievance may reasonably be construed by an arbitrator to include not just a demand for back pay for when sutherland should have been working,but also a demand that she actually be returned to work lamta,supra,th at,and a return to work is not one of the workers compensation benefits available by statute,and covered by division of the labor code to which the exclusive remedy rule would apply.see vacanti,supra,cal th at.sutherland return to work was thus a remedy unavailable in this workers compensation context,further undermining the notion of the exclusivity of workers compensation as a remedy here.accordingly,workers compensation is not an exclusive remedy in the present situation and does not bar arbitration of sutherland claim.lamta,supra,th at.the court added,whether sutherland was available for work even with a job modification or restriction,which the union argues would not affect her normal job requirements,is a matter for the arbitrator to determine.id.at.
likewise,here,workers compensation does not preclude the arbitrator from making findings that sunline wrongfully refused to allow navarrete to return to work,and ordering his reinstatement,along with back pay.
sunline argues lamta,supra,th is distinguishable because lamta involved a petition for arbitration,rather than a petition to vacate or modify an arbitration award.we do not consider this a significant difference since in both instances the underlying issue was whether the workers compensation exclusive remedy doctrine barred arbitration of an employee grievance challenging the employer refusal to allow an employee to return to work after sustaining an industrial injury.
sunline acknowledges in its appellant opening brief that under lamta,supra,th,sunline was obligated by the mou to arbitrate whether there was just cause to terminate navarrete,but argues the instant case is distinguishable because in lamta,there was no dispute among medical doctors as to the nature and extent of the lamta employee industrial injuries.here,sunline argues,navarrete industrial injuries and remedies were subject to pending workers compensation claims under the overriding,exclusive workers compensation scheme.as a consequence,sunline argues the arbitration award,ordering navarrete reinstated and entitled to back pay,must be vacated because it conflicts or may conflict with workers compensation medical findings and compensation determinations.we disagree.
as in lamta,in the instant case the issue arbitrated did not require adjudication of any disputes over the nature of navarrete industrial injuries or remedies.even though there were pending,underlying workers compensation claims,the arbitrator was not barred under the workers compensation exclusive remedy doctrine from deciding whether navarrete was wrongfully precluded from returning to work and,as a consequence,terminated without good cause.lamta,supra,th at.as the california supreme court noted in vacanti,courts have exempted wrongful termination claims from exclusivity and thus have allowed an employee to recover economic damages on a wrongful termination claim because the damages arose out of the act of not out of an injury to the employee person.vacanti,supra,cal th at see also pichon pacific gas electric d,pichon.
we also reject sunline contention that the arbitration award creates the possibility of double recovery.the court in pichon,supra,d at page,acknowledged that there is a substantial risk of double recovery if an employee does suffer a compensable injury in addition to incurring economic or contract damages as a result of the termination of employment because,in addition to compensating for medical costs,workers compensation compensates for lost wages for the period of disability.thus,if these damages were calculated without regard to the period of disability for which the employee may be compensated by workers compensation,the employee would recover twice.according to the pichon court,under such circumstances,t he appropriate solution is to set off from any damages the amount of compensation paid.thus,for example,if appellant was in fact totally and permanently disabled,as claimed by the respondents in this case,he may not have any contract damages in excess of the compensation he is entitled to for this injury.in that case,it may then be appropriate to dismiss the remaining claims.ibid.
here,the arbitration award avoids double recovery.the award expressly provides that reinstatement will include reimbursement for all back pay,less interim earnings,less vocational rehabilitation compensation as well as restoration of all benefits that the grievant lost as a result of the improper termination.the arbitrator further reserved jurisdiction over the issue of back pay in the event the parties were unable to reach agreement on the amount.
sunline reliance on sunnyvale unified school dist.jacobs th sunnyvale,for the proposition the arbitration award violates public policy and statutory rights under the wca is misplaced.in sunnyvale,a probationary teacher labor representative filed a grievance on the teacher behalf,complaining that the school district violated procedures required under the collective bargaining agreement when not reelecting a probationary teacher.id.at.the matter was arbitrated pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement,and the union labor representative petitioned to confirm the arbitration award.id.at.the award ordered reinstatement of the probationary teacher based on a finding that the teacher was terminated in retaliation for participating in protected activities.id.at.
on appeal,the sunnyvale court held that,since the nonreelection decision may not be the subject of collective bargaining,the arbitrator has no jurisdiction over a nonreelection dispute.sunnyvale,supra,th at.the sunnyvale court concluded that,even though the collective bargaining agreement contained provisions setting forth arbitration procedures for grievances arising from not reelecting a probationary teacher,the arbitrator did not have any power to decide the grievance contesting nonreelection because the matter was preempted by state law and the exclusive jurisdiction of the public employment relations board perb.id.at.
the instant case is distinguishable,not only because it does not concern perb,but also because the issue arbitrated in this case does not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the wcab.the arbitrator jurisdiction over the termination grievance was not preempted by jurisdiction in another forum and there was thus no violation of any public policy or statutory right.
we note that,although the parties discuss at length judson steel workers comp.appeals bd.cal d,judson,we decline to consider the decision since it concerns a theory raised by the respondents for the first time in this appeal.the respondents cite judson for the proposition that termination of an employee due to absence from work because of an industrial injury constitutes unlawful discrimination under labor code section.judson,at.the respondents argue that the mou provision,which sunline relied upon in terminating navarrete art,k,was unlawful under judson because it required termination of an employee,whose absence due to industrial injury,exceeded two years.since this contention was not raised during the grievance proceedings,arbitration,or in the trial court,the issue was forf
