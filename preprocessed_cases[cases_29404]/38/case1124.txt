bobo and neighborhood health services 
bobo has been a emergency physician since,working primarily at druid city hospital in tuscaloosa,alabama.he also served as medical director of the alabama fire college,where he trained firemen and paramedics in emergency medical services.governor don siegelman appointed bobo state emergency medical director,and bobo served on governor siegelman transition team from november to january.bobo also held other positions,including physician for the university of alabama football team,and plant physician at uniroyal goodrich.in addition,bobo founded emergicare,a clinic where patients do not need appointments in order to see a doctor.
in the,bobo and three other doctors,pediatrician phil phillips,general surgeon charles rose,and obstetrician and gynecologist karl harbin created neighborhood health services nhs,a limited liability corporation.the doctors formed nhs to provide primary medical care to patients who would otherwise be forced to use the emergency room.bobo and attorney boolis boohaker are the administrators of nhs.bobo serves as managing partner and owns percent of nhs.mary jo looser,former administrator of the maternity waiver program for the health department in a five county area,serves as executive program director of nhs.nhs has two other employees,charlotte jamison,care coordinator director,and pat lagrone,director of quality assurance.
the medicaid maternity waiver program 
gwendolyn williams,commissioner of the alabama medicaid agency from,testified at bobo trial that congress created the maternity care program mcp in to address alabama high infant mortality rate and low level rate of prenatal care.the mcp purpose was to ensure comprehensive medical services to pregnant women on medicaid,beginning with prenatal treatment and following mother and child through the postpartum stage.
williams worked with federal agencies to construct a special maternity medicaid program,labeled a waiver program,because it requires the patient to waive mandated medicaid requirements such as freedom of choice.the program,entitled maternity waiver program mwp,waives certain medicaid requirements in exchange for an established network of services,specific doctors,hospitals,and other medical providers.under the program,the expectant mother has a case manager who functions as an overseer of the mother medical treatment.williams worked with the alabama medicaid agency to increase reimbursement rates and also worked with the department of health and other agencies to establish a solid network of providers.after initial tests in a few counties,the program expanded statewide.
under the mcp,the alabama medicaid agency divided the state of alabama into districts.the districts at issue in this case are district,which consists of lamar,fayette,pickens,tuscaloosa,and bibb counties,and district,which consists of green and hale counties.entities within each district wishing to provide mwp services bid competitively to offer a complete package of benefits including prenatal visits,delivery,postpartum medical care,and case management.williams testified that approximately percent of the funding for the program comes from the federal government via the united states department of health and human services,with the remaining percent of funding provided by the state.the initial statewide budget to finance the mwp was.
williams association with bobo 
williams testified that she first met bobo in early,when he expressed an interest in the mwp.after that first meeting,williams stated that bobo called her almost weekly,offering suggestions about the mwp.williams testified that bobo calls became increasingly hostile,so that she ultimately refused to accept his calls.in july,however,williams met with bobo to discuss whether the mwp would use requests for proposals rfp or invitations to bid itb to seek potential providers.bobo requested that the mwp use the rfps because then price would not be the sole determining factor that the agency would consider in awarding the contracts.bobo also relayed his concerns over the length of the process and the delays in awarding the contracts.williams responded that she did not have the authority under state law to use only rfps.
consequently,in october,the agency released the itbs.this program requires the bidders to provide detailed documentation regarding access to care,participating hospitals,average care time devoted to each patient,and other pertinent information.the bidders provided this information via contracts or signed letters of intent.nhs submitted bids for most of the districts.
the bidding process 
vicki huff,former alabama medicaid agency director of medical services,testified that her office prepared the itbs.she stated that the agency received bids with a bid price that represented the service provider estimated cost per birth.the two original bidders in district were nhs and alabama health network ahn,a coalition composed of druid city regional health authority,bibb county medical center,pickens county medical center,west alabama health network,and the capstone health services foundation.ahn is a consortium of hospitals and clinics created specifically to bid on contracts.for district,nhs bid and ahn bid to provide services under the mwp.the bid price represented the cost to deliver one child,including comprehensive prenatal care,education,and postpartum care.after the agency evaluated the itbs,state finance director,henry mabry,iii,notified nhs that it had received the contract for district.
as to district,of the three bidders,nhs,ahn,and tombigbee health care authority,nhs bid was the highest,totaling per delivery compared to ahn bid of per delivery.the state awarded district to ahn.
on march,mabry distributed a letter to all the bidders identifying the preliminary winning bids.this letter identified nhs as the mwp recipient for districts,and on may,bill newton,the acting purchasing director for the alabama department of finance,notified nhs and ahn that all bids received for district had been cancelled and district would have to be rebid due to irregularities in the bid process.newton informed nhs that the agency would ask for rebids at a later date.
on june,ahn filed a lawsuit protesting the rebid.ahn and the state medicaid agency and the state finance department settled the lawsuit.nhs did not submit a second bid for district.the state then awarded district to ahn.
conduct at issue 
pam parsons,an assistant for development at the university of alabama,testified that bobo contacted her around may,regarding capstone medical center capstone,a physician residency program within the university of alabama college of community health sciences.bobo requested that parsons relay information to the university president,andrew sorenson,and to the associate dean for clinical affairs at the college of community health sciences,marc armstrong.bobo requested parsons pass along that nhs would pay to the university via capstone if ahn would withdraw its bid for district and its for district.bobo would get part of this money from the fire college and nhs would pay the remainder.in exchange,bobo would guarantee admissions to capstone and contract with capstone to have residents serve as first aid station attendants during alabama football games.when parsons contacted sorenson,he informed her that the university would not be involved in the bidding process.on,parsons stated that during her state grand jury testimony in july,she testified that bill jones,the university of alabama director of governmental relations and chief lobbyist,called bobo statements negotiations,and commented to her that they were not unusual.
armstrong testified that in addition to his work at the college of community health sciences,he worked with capstone training residents.he stated that he was a member of the board of directors at capstone health services foundation,a member of ahn,but acknowledged that he had no position or authority with ahn.armstrong testified that bobo and parsons each telephoned him twice regarding the bidding process for the mwp.in armstrong first conversation with bobo,bobo represented that nhs would win the for district because of assurances from the governor.bobo told armstrong that if ahn did not for district,bobo would arrange for the college of community health sciences to receive per year from the fire college to lecture the emergency medical trainees and provide residents to administer first aid at alabama football games.bobo also stated that he would pay for capstone to take care of nhs medicaid inpatients.
armstrong also testified that he was troubled by bobo offer and even thought bobo was asking him to participate in a crime.therefore,he contacted his boss,dean bill curry of the alabama school of medicine,and capstone business manager,john maxwell.curry recommended that armstrong put the substance of bobo call in writing and contact ahn attorney.ahn attorney instructed armstrong to tape record any conversation with bobo.armstrong further testified that parsons contacted him the day after he first spoke with bobo,indicating that she was supportive of bobo offer and asking armstrong if she could do anything to help consummate the deal.ahn attorney also recommended that armstrong tape record any further conversations with parsons.
in a may,telephone conversation with armstrong,bobo mentioned that nhs was a good business and that he had good people to run it.bobo informed armstrong that the deal was an ideal way to help capstone program with its funding difficulties.bobo mentioned that no strings were attached except what they had talked about the other day.he stated that nhs would do contracts and work for capstone,and he also stated that this offer was not a bribe,but purely a business proposition.
in a subsequent telephone conversation with parsons,armstrong stated bobo offer clearly we getting from bobo,from the fire college,and from nhs.armstrong told parsons that although he was not publicly involved with ahn,bobo contacted him because he and bobo have a good relationship.parsons admitted that sorenson understood bobo offer to mean that the university would receive or nothing.
at bobo trial,maxwell testified that he was president of ahn,but received compensation from the university for his work at capstone and from capstone health services foundation.maxwell testified that during his conversation with bobo,bobo indicated that he would do all he could to keep up the number of deliveries within the bounds of the law.maxwell also stated that no bid was in effect for district when he spoke with bobo a second time,at or near the end of may.
in a may,telephone conversation with maxwell,bobo stated that he had made an offer that was good for everybody.bobo mentioned that he needed district as his home base because nhs had received the bids for several surrounding districts.bobo informed maxwell that we may do it all through the fire college i managed to get some additional funds put in the fire college with the blessings of the administration we would like to contract with some existing programs,rural health,we do an institution exchange.after repeating the offer that he had made to armstrong,bobo stated that they needed to see where else they could plug programs to make contracts work to total the offered amount.
in a subsequent telephone conversation with maxwell on june,bobo encouraged maxwell to do some convincing.bobo assured maxwell that he would get in pocket,and that it would not be a one time deal,but would occur every year.bobo stated that nhs would get the bid because bobo could afford to go low on the price due to the contracts he allegedly had.bobo commented that he would give capstone some money every year and keep the residents busy.maxwell responded that it made a lot of sense to him,and as far as he was concerned,they had a deal.
karl harbin,a partner with nhs,testified that he understood that the agency would not select the entity solely based on price,but would consider the entity that best met all of the requirements.harbin did not participate in the bid process,but did discuss it with bobo.harbin stated that,in one of his conversations with bobo,bobo mentioned his discussions with armstrong and maxwell.bobo told harbin that these individuals were thinking of not bidding on the program because they thought nhs had the best program,and that they were concerned about capstone financial situation.bobo told harbin that he had assured armstrong and maxwell that with his political connections,he could obtain some funding from the legislature for capstone,similar to the institution exchange in which the university of alabama at birmingham uab participates.
harbin further testified that bobo threatened,in no uncertain terms,that if bobo obtained the funding for capstone,ahn should not on district.bobo asked harbin to call curry and others about his offer.bobo called harbin late one night informing him that a nick from montgomery had flown to tuscaloosa to discuss the mwp bids with bobo.harbin stated that when he discussed this information with an fbi agent,he told the agent that nick had a projected budget below which nhs should bid and that nick had provided this figure to bobo.harbin estimated that this meeting between nick and bobo occurred around may of.
bobo trial testimony 
bobo testified at trial and denied all charges,stating that he believed in good faith that he had a right to do what he did.bobo testified that he spoke to armstrong only about capstone,not ahn.bobo stated that he viewed nhs as a means to provide quality medical services for indigent pregnant women,but that he also hoped to recoup his investment and make money from the program.bobo testified that he had encouraged armstrong to talk with everyone about the offer.bobo explained that he did not want the proposed arrangement with the fire college disclosed,not because he thought it was illegal,but because he had not worked out the details.bobo stated unequivocally that he was not trying to prevent anyone from being a provider rather,he was negotiating an agreement between providers.
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court denial of a motion to dismiss the indictment for abuse of discretion,but the sufficiency of an indictment is a legal question that we review de novo.united states pendergraft,cir internal citation omitted.
iii.discussion 
for an indictment to be valid,it must contain the elements of the offense intended to be charged,and sufficiently apprise the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.russell united states,d internal quotations omitted united states sanchez,cir en banc,cert.denied,d.an indictment not framed to apprise the defendant with reasonable certainty,of the nature of the accusation against him is defective,although it may follow the language of the statute.russell,at.at internal quotations and citations omitted.furthermore,if the indictment tracks the language of the statute,it must be accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform the accused of the specific offense,coming under the general description,with which he is charged.id.at.at see also hamling united states,d.when the indictment uses generic terms,it must state the offense with particularity.russell,at.at.additionally,an indictment must enable the defendant to enter a plea that will bar any future prosecutions for the same offense.hamling,at.at.
the indictment in this case alleges that the alabama medicaid agency set the deadline for the mwp bid process at march,and that nhs and ahn participated in the mwp program by submitting bids.in describing armstrong and ahn,the indictment states that armstrong and several of his associates and acquaintances formed the alabama health network ahn which is made up of druid city hospital regional health authority,bibb county medical center,pickens county medical center,west alabama health network,and members from capstone health services foundation.vol,doc.the indictment further states that,after receiving bids for district,the agency sent a letter to ahn informing it that district was to be rebid due to confusion in the bidding process,and the agency reset the deadline for june.see id.
count i of the indictment charges that bobo 
did unlawfully,willfully,and knowingly combine,conspire,confederate and agree with others known and unknown to knowingly and willfully execute and attempt to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud a health care benefit program,that is,the maternity care program being administered by the alabama medicaid agency,and financed by the health care financing administration of the united states department of health and human services and the state of alabama,in violation of title,united states code,section.
in support of this count,under manner and means,the government alleges that bobo offered to pay ahn for each year of the mwp if it would refrain from submitting a rebid on district and give up its contract in district,and that this offer was part of the scheme and artifice to defraud.see id.the indictment lists the overt acts as the telephone calls bobo made to armstrong and maxwell and the call that the unindicted made to armstrong regarding bobo offer.
in count ii,the indictment incorporates the information supporting count i and charges that bobo 
did knowingly and willfully execute and attempt to execute a scheme and artifice to defraud a health care benefits program,that is the maternity care program,operated by the alabama medicaid agency and financed by the health care financing administration of the united states department of health and human services and the state of alabama,in violation of title,united states code,section.
the indictment does not set forth the manner and means by which the scheme and artifice to defraud operated,except to incorporate the manner and means supporting the conspiracy count.the indictment also does not contain the remaining language of the statute which provides,in part,that the fraud must be in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits,items,or services.see.
typically,an indictment sets forth what the scheme was designed to deprive the victim of and then describes by what means the scheme was designed to be accomplished.see,belt united states,cir united states dynalectric,cir noting that a mail fraud indictment charged defendants with conspiring to devise a scheme and artifice to defraud the victim of money and their right to free and open competition in the bidding process.here,the underlying statute,refers to fraud in connection with the delivery or payment of health care benefits,items or services.not only does the indictment fail to mention a fraud in connection with the delivery or payment of health care benefits,items,or services in counts i and ii,but it also fails to specify of what precisely bobo was allegedly trying to defraud the mwp program benefits,items,services,or money.the benefits,items,or services could have been the difference in the bids from the prior round of bids between ahn and nhs,as the government contended at trial.alternatively,the benefits,items,or services could have been the money that bobo proposed he would get from the legislature for capstone.however,the indictment makes only a broad allegation of fraud in a health care benefit program without the required specificity.an indictment that requires speculation on a fundamental part of the charge is insufficient.see hamling,at.at.
furthermore,the indictment does not specify the scheme or artifice to defraud with which the government was charging bobo.the indictment contains no indication of what the government contended was unlawful about bobo conduct.at various times throughout the trial,the government mentioned bobo offer of as a bribe or as part of a bid rigging scheme.however,the government made no mention in the indictment of a federal statute which prohibits the type of conduct alleged here.see,dynalectric,at.even if the government mentioned bribe in the indictment,no evidence exists to support such an allegation.bobo did not offer a bribe to a competing bidder.the alleged bribe was made to armstrong,who testified that he had no authority over the competitor,ahn see webster third new internat l dictionary defining bribe as a price,reward,gift or favor bestowed or promised with a view to pervert the judgment or corrupt the conduct esp.of a person in a position of trust.the government did not state in the indictment that bobo offer of to capstone for its residents to work the first aid station at football games and for it to provide care for some of his medicaid patients is a crime under the health care fraud statute.
likewise,the indictment did not charge a violation of alabama law.alabama has no requirement that professional service contracts be competitively bid.see a.the indictment also contained no allegation that bobo conduct would violate the rules of the bid process,even if a bid process were pending at the time even if the new bid process had required competitive bidding,no allegation exists that,in the absence of the alleged scheme,the mwp would have paid a lower price or received a better quality program.see,mcnally united states,d indictment alleged mail fraud.furthermore,there is no allegation in the indictment that any future rebid by nhs would in any way adversely affect the mwp.
because the government incorporated the paragraphs from count i of the indictment in count ii,the jury may have believed that the overt acts alleged to support the conspiracy charge were sufficient to describe the alleged scheme or artifice to defraud.however,we have held that the overt acts are to support the charge of conspiracy,not to describe an alleged scheme to defraud.united states adkinson,cir.even if overt acts could describe the scheme or artifice to defraud,they fail in this case.overt act b alleges that bobo offered the to capstone,not ahn as the government alleges in the manner and means paragraph supporting count thus,we can not merely assume that the jury unanimously agreed on which overt acts.see united states gipson,cir the failure of the jury to unanimously agree on which overt act constitutes the scheme deprives bobo of the right to a unanimous verdict.see id.
due to the inadequacies in the indictment,we can not discern what scheme the jury found bobo had committed.hence,count ii can not stand.where the scheme to defraud alleged in the substantive count is not sufficient to state an offense,a conspiracy count based upon the charge must also be found deficient.see mcnally,at.at.thus,count i also fails.accordingly,we conclude that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment because it does not state an offense under the health care fraud statute,and thus,as a matter of law,is deficient 
iv.conclusion 
although we do not condone bobo offer,we can not
