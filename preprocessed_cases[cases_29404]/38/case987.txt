the commissioner of social security determined that nadine reed is not entitled to disability benefits or supplemental security income.the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner on reed challenge to that decision,and reed appeals.we find that the administrative law judge rejected for an improper reason reed request for a consultative examination.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
born in,reed was employed for almost a decade as a nurse aid,until poor health forced her to resign.she later worked for approximately one year as a post office clerk but quit in after a dispute with her coworkers.
for over ten years,reed has suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus,known as sle,or simply lupus.an autoimmune disease primarily afflicting young women,lupus has various manifestations,including inflammation of the kidneys and lesions on the skin.reed also complains of fatigue and chronic lower back pain.beginning in january,she received treatment at the south central primary care center and maricopa medical center in phoenix,arizona.
in january,reed applied for disability benefits under title ii of the social security act,et,and for supplemental security income based on disability under title xvi of the act,et.upon referral by the disability determination service of the arizona department of economic security,reed was examined by a consultative examiner,arcot premkumar,a physician specializing in internal and pulmonary medicine.premkumar confirmed that reed suffers from lupus,noting that she had cutaneous hypersensitivity,but finding no restriction in motion in her joints.premkumar did not reach any conclusion regarding reed capacity to work or to perform the various functions associated with her previous employment.
at an april hearing before an administrative law judge alj,reed medical records and testimony were reviewed by internist and neurologist lawrence teitel.according to teitel,reed medical reports suggest that so long as she takes medication,her case of lupus is at less than a moderate level of severity for purposes of the social security listing of impairments.see et.teitel concluded that reed retained a residual functional capacity rfc to perform light work.drawing on teitel conclusion,the alj found that reed can do her past work as a postal clerk,which is classified at the light exertional level.he therefore concluded that reed was not under a disability as defined in the social security act.
reed petitioned for review to the social security appeals council,which remanded the case to the alj,directing him to address reed subjective complaints,fatigue and make findings regarding her credibility.during the administrative hearing on remand,reed requested a consultative examination by a rheumatologist,arguing that rheumatologists are the medical specialists best suited to address cases of lupus.the alj rejected reed request for reasons central to this decision,as detailed below.reiterating his prior conclusion that reed lupus was not disabling,the alj found reed not fully credible with respect to her subjective complaints,and once again issued a decision unfavorable to her.
reed again sought review by the appeals council,arguing inter alia that the alj had exhibited bias when rejecting her request for an additional consultative examination.the bias allegation centered on the following colloquy between reed counsel and the alj 
counsel i feel a rheumatologist is the best specialist to address lupus.
alj you know the problem with that is that we only have two available for consultative examinations.both of which are totally unreliable.because they treat all the cases here and everybody is disabled.every report i ever seen from them,so i do trust anything they send me.so,that the problem.because i considered,frankly,sending this out to a rheumatologist,and i ca get anybody that i trust to tell me i do want to shortchange you but i do trust any of those two doctors,i just do.
counsel the fact that medical reports come back positive more often than not,that may be a reflection of the nature of the people the doctor is seeing you seem to have some personal feelings about the doctors the state agency sends people to.i do know how i can possibly address that.
alj l ike i said,that the problem,because it occurred to me immediately to send it out to a rheumatologist,but that would do me absolutely no good.
counsel i still ask you to give consideration to a rheumatological consultative examination,if all else fails.
alj i would mind doing a consultative examination,frankly,but,like i said i do know where to send it 
counsel i s it possible to ask the state agency to contract with a doctor that is outside their panel for a examination 
alj i think we tried that once and they told us to stick it,frankly,in a nicer way than that,but that pretty much what they said.
the appeals council denied review,finding no basis for the allegations that the administrative law judge demonstrated bias.
reed brought this action in the federal district court for the district of arizona,which granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner,finding the determination that the plaintiff is not disabled as a result of her lupus supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record as a whole and free from reversible legal error.this appeal followed.
the social security act has been with us since.act of august,stat.it affects nearly all of us.the system administrative structure and procedures,with essential determinations numbering into the millions,are of a size and extent difficult to comprehend.but s uch a system must be it must work.

critical to the fair and effective operation of the system for distributing social security benefits based on disability is the gathering and presentation of medical evidence.the burden of demonstrating a disability lies with the claimant.bowen yuckert,d.but it is equally clear that the alj has a duty to assist in developing the record.armstrong commissioner of soc.sec,cir d f id.at d f see also sims apfel,d social security proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.it is the alj duty to investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits.one of the means available to an alj to supplement an inadequate medical record is to order a consultative examination,a physical or mental examination or test purchased for a claimant at the social security administration request and expense.
although referrals to consultative examiners may be made by the social security administration ssa,d responsibility for the consultative examination process rests not with the ssa but with cooperating state agencies.id.at s a,s a.among the responsibilities shouldered by state agencies is the task of recruiting suitable physicians to perform consultative examinations.id.at s f,s f.the regulations also require state agencies to review the results of consultative examinations for compliance with applicable guidelines.id.at s f,s f.recognizing that review of the consultative examination process will sometimes require medical expertise,ssa regulations require state agencies to institute p rocedures to encourage active participation by physicians in the consultative examination oversight program.id.at s f,s f.
in addition,the ssa itself monitor s both the referral processes and the product of the consultative examinations obtained,a procedure that may include reviews by independent medical specialists.id.at t a,t a.although secondary to the oversight provided by state agencies,ssa monitoring is thorough,involving periodic comprehensive reviews of each state agency to evaluate its management of the consultative examination process,as well as ongoing special management studies of the quality of consultative examinations purchased.id.at t b,c,t b,c see also j requiring the commissioner to promulgate regulations setting forth detailed standards for consultative examination referrals and procedures for monitoring both the referral process and the products of the examinations.
within this regulatory framework,the commissioner has broad latitude in
