the secretary of the department of health and human services appeals the decision of the district court that she improperly excluded the labor costs of certain types of hospitals from her calculation of medicare reimbursements due to appellees.because we conclude that the secretary exclusion of these costs was based on a reasonable interpretation of her statutory authority,we reverse the judgment of the district court.
in,congress created the prospective payment system pps as a new means to provide medicare reimbursements to hospitals for medical care requiring at least one night stay.see social security amendments of,stat,see also se.med.ctr.sebelius,describing how the pps works transitional hosps.of shalala,same.hospitals that participate in the pps are called subsection d hospitals,named after the statutory provision that identifies them.see d b.these facilities are best described as acute care general hospitals.transitional,at quoting,at,reprinted in.of relevance to this appeal,critical access hospitals,which are usually located in rural areas and have fewer than beds,are excluded from subsection d and receive medicare reimbursements under a payment scheme different from the pps.see e,mm proposed changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,may,hereinafter proposed fy rates.
under the pps,a significant component of the medicare payment subsection d hospitals receive is reimbursement for their wages and costs.d e i.because these costs vary widely across the country,congress requires the secretary to adjust medicare reimbursements according to area differences in hospital wage s.id.to do so,the secretary calculates a wage index for each area employing the area classification system used by the office of management and budget by dividing the area average hourly hospital wage by the national average.see changes to the hospital inpatient prospective systems and fiscal year rates,hereinafter final fy rates.she uses the wage to as the factor by the adjust the labor cost component of medicare reimbursements.
congress requires the secretary at least every months to update the factor on the basis of a survey conducted by the secretary and updated as appropriate of the wages and costs of subsection d hospitals in the united states.d e i.the secretary conducts this survey by compiling wage data from cost reports submitted annually by hospitals.see changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,hereinafter final fy rates.the secretary removes data from this survey that fail to meet certain criteria for reasonableness,including data that are incomplete,inaccurate,or otherwise aberrant.id.at see also final fy rates.at.from this scrubbed survey,the secretary calculates each area proposed wage index.before putting the wage index in final form,she solicits comments from the public.see publication of schedules for determining prospective payment rates.because of the time required to scrub the data,the secretary calculates each year wage index using data from the survey conducted three years earlier.see final fy rates.at final fy rates.at.
prior to,the secretary included wage data for facilities that were subsection d hospitals during the survey year but were no longer classified as such by the time she calculated the wage index.in may,the secretary proposed a revision to this approach that would exclude wage data for hospitals that were subsection d hospitals during the survey year but became critical access hospitals before the year the index was actually calculated.see proposed fy rates.at.commenters generally supported removing data for critical access hospitals from the wage index,and the secretary implemented the proposal.final fy rates.at.one commenter raised the issue that is now the centerpiece of this appeal,arguing that the wage index should include data for facilities that qualified as subsection d hospitals at the time of the survey,including those later reclassified as critical access hospitals.id.the secretary concluded,however,that inclusion of data for these critical access hospitals has a substantial negative impact on the wage index for subsection d hospitals because they have significantly different labor costs.id.specifically,in percent of all labor market areas with hospitals that converted to critical access status some time after fy,the average hourly wage for critical access hospitals is lower than the average hourly wage for other subsection d hospitals in the area.id.the secretary continued to include wage data for other facilities that converted to d status,as long as their data met her criteria for reasonableness.id.she explained,w age data for these hospitals,unlike cahs,are not necessarily unique compared to other hospitals,and these terminating or converting hospitals provide an accurate reflection of the labor market area.id.at.
the secretary first applied this policy when calculating the fy wage index.see final fy rates.at.in calculating the wage index for massachusetts,she excluded labor cost data from two facilities that had become critical access hospitals after,the survey year nantucket cottage hospital and martha vineyard hospital.the secretary also excluded the labor costs of these hospitals from the fy wage index.see changes to the hospital inpatient prospective systems and fiscal year rates.
on march,a group of subsection d hospitals in massachusetts filed suit in the district court seeking,among other things,injunctive relief requiring the secretary to recalculate the fy wage index using data from facilities that qualified as subsection d hospitals in,including nantucket cottage hospital,and to adjust medicare reimbursements to the massachusetts hospitals accordingly.the parties filed for summary judgment.on february,the district court granted appellees motion,concluding that the secretary interpretation of d e i failed at chevron step one because the statute requires that the wage index reflect the labor costs of all subsection d hospitals whose cost reports were used to conduct the annual survey,regardless of their status at the time the index is calculated.see anna jaques hosp.leavitt,d.the court also rejected as arbitrary and capricious the secretary explanation that the wage data from critical access hospitals and subsection d hospitals were so different that they justified her new policy of excluding the former from the wage index.see id.at.as a remedy,the court ordered the secretary to recalculate the fy wage index for massachusetts using data from all facilities that qualified as subsection d hospitals in,including data from nantucket cottage hospital.see anna jaques hosp.leavitt,at,order accompanying opinion the secretary filed a motion for reconsideration,which the district court denied.anna jaques hosp.leavitt,at july.in a related lawsuit,appellees also challenged the secretary calculation of the fy wage index for massachusetts on the same grounds.on november,the district court granted summary judgment for the hospitals in light of its previous decision.anna jaques hosp.leavitt.the secretary appealed each decision.
we have jurisdiction to consider this consolidated appeal under.because the district court entered a summary judgment,we review its decision de novo and therefore,in effect,review directly the decision of the secretary.luke hosp.thompson,quoting lozowski mineta.
this appeal turns on three issues raised by the secretary whether her interpretation of d e i,the statutory provision requiring annual calculation of the wage index,is permissible under chevron whether she acted arbitrarily by failing to adequately explain her approach to calculating the wage index and whether she acted arbitrarily by treating data from similarly situated facilities differently.the secretary raises a fourth issue,which we need not reach because our resolution of the others renders it moot.
we review the secretary interpretation of d e i under chevron framework.when congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,that is the end of the matter.chevron natural res.def.council,d.but if we determine the statute is silent or ambigu
