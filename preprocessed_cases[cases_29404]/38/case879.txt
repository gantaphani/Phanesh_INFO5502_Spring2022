appellants who were plaintiffs in the district court,and will be referred to as plaintiffs here are residents of four neighborhoods,as well as two community groups each representing a neighborhood.the neighborhoods are outside the city of modesto city and within the city sphere of influence although not incorporated into the city proper such neighborhoods are known as unincorporated territory or islands.the modesto sphere of influence includes such unincorporated islands partly or completely surrounded by the city including the four plaintiff islands and other unincorporated areas.
plaintiffs filed a complaint in the district court in,claiming that the actions and inactions of the defendants city and stanislaus county in failing to provide the neighborhoods with adequate municipal services and to bring the neighborhoods into the city constituted intentional discrimination based on race or ethnicity,in contravention of the constitution and federal statutes,and also of california statutes.the complaint was amended three times.in a series of opinions in the spring and summer of,the district court granted motions for summary judgment that were addressed to the third amended complaint tac the plaintiffs claims were dismissed in their entirety.in a further opinion,the district court awarded costs to the defendants.plaintiffs timely appealed these adverse decisions.
background 
plaintiffs neighborhoods are known as,or land,robertson road,and or the garden.these neighborhoods are urban,residential developments which were built in the and.at that time,builders were not required to construct infrastructure such as sewers,street lights,sidewalks,curbs,or gutters.census data show that in the neighborhoods populations were not however,by the latino population in each of the four neighborhoods had increased substantially although did not yet constitute a majority of the population.by all four neighborhoods were.according to the third amended complaint tac,they resemble neighboring parts of modesto in terms of residential density,but are easily differentiated by the lack of basic services such as sidewalks,street lights and road maintenance.tac.
it is undisputed that the neighborhoods lack a variety of infrastructure needs commonly associated with urban communities.lacks sewer lines,storm drains,sidewalks,curbs,and gutters.is connected to the city sewer system,but lacks storm drains,curbs,gutters,and sidewalks.lacks sewer connections,sidewalks,storm drains,curbs,and gutters.robertson road has been approved to connect to the city sewer system but lacks storm drains,curbs,gutters,and sidewalks.
the city and the county have a stated policy of encouraging the elimination of urban islands through annexation into the city.annexation can offer many benefits to a community,including the provision of municipal services by the city and the ability to vote in city elections.however,various steps need to be taken before a community can be annexed,including determining whether the community wants to be annexed,what governmental authority will receive what percentage of property tax revenues,and whether the infrastructure present in the community meets the city standards.
with regard to taxes,the city and the county must agree on how property tax revenues from the area to be annexed will be shared.if an unincorporated area is not annexed by the city,all property tax revenues go to the county.in,the city and the county entered into a master tax sharing agreement mtsa.the mtsa provides that for all covered communities,upon annexation,the city will take of property tax revenues and the county will take the rest.certain communities are specifically exempted from the mtsa,and in order for these communities to be annexed,the city and county need to enter into a separate agreement.in,and robertson road were excluded from the mtsa.in,applied for annexation,but the attempt failed,allegedly in part because the city and the county could not agree on the division of property tax revenue.the mtsa was amended in,and at that time was specifically exempted.the mtsa was also amended in to include a portion of land adjacent to that had previously been excluded.at the same time,the remaining provisions of the mtsa were expressly reaffirmed.er.according to the tac,exclusion from the mtsa is problematic because 
the disparate treatment of the plaintiff neighborhoods under the master tax sharing agreement creates a disincentive for the county to build infrastructure in the plaintiff neighborhoods since building such infrastructure to city standards does not assure that the city will not demand additional financial concessions from the county by way of tax sharing as a prerequisite to annexation of the plaintiff neighborhoods.the disparate treatment of the plaintiff neighborhoods under the master tax sharing agreement also imposes a chilling effect on plaintiffs own annexation efforts.plaintiffs reasonably view the annexation application process as futile disproportionally weighted against their prospects of annexation and therefore are less willing to undertake the burdensome process of applying.the master tax sharing agreement thus deters infrastructure development in the plaintiff neighborhoods and makes it relatively easier for residents of unincorporated areas covered by the master tax sharing agreement to become modesto citizens.
plaintiffs contend that exclusion from the mtsa deters the county from investing in infrastructure in neighborhoods that would otherwise be eligible for infrastructure upgrades and annexation.they argue that the county is unwilling to invest in developing infrastructure in a community without substantial assurance that the city will negotiate a agreement and annex the community.for those communities covered by the mtsa,this threshold concern is inapplicable.
in addition to dealing with issues,island neighborhoods also face issues relating to sewage disposal.the county has no sewage treatment plant of its own,and the city is not required to provide sewer services to communities,some of which have aging and deteriorating septic systems.in,measure a was passed by modesto city voters,prohibiting the city from authorizing any extensions of sewer trunk lines to unincorporated areas without first holding an advisory election in,measure m was passed,extending the requirement of an advisory election from one applying only to the extension of sewer trunk lines to one that applied before any sewer improvements at all could be made in unincorporated areas.in,the city council approved a resolution adopting an implementation policy for measure m.the implementation policy divides islands into two categories substantial and insubstantial.according to the policy,the city council has the sole discretion to deem islands substantial or insubstantial the terms are not defined in the policy.substantial islands are not eligible for measure m votes until negotiations with the county regarding fiscal issues are complete,while insubstantial islands can have a measure m vote without the need for fiscal negotiations between the city and county.fiscal negotiations,it seems,require that the county agree to install all infrastructure,including storm drains,curbs,gutters,sidewalks,street lighting,and streets,all to city standards.this is known as the infrastructure condition.
plaintiffs argue that the city policies with regard to the provision of sewer access are applied in a way that discriminates against them.plaintiffs contend that the determination of what is a substantial island has been applied in an inconsistent,discriminatory way,and the infrastructure condition has been imposed only on latino islands and not on islands,which have had measure m votes before all infrastructure was built.
with regard to the status of sewage disposal in the plaintiff neighborhoods,has sewer access and robertson road was approved for sewer access.and do not have sewer access,though the two individual plaintiffs residing at the border of have been able to hook up to a sewer line running at the edge of the neighborhood.the septic systems in and are failing,causing untreated sewage to leach into groundwater and potentially creating a public health hazard the county,after determining that it did not have the financial ability to fulfill all of the infrastructure needs of the area including,postponed the building of infrastructure and sewer access in but did build infrastructure and sewers in some of the neighborhood surrounding known as shackleford.with regard to robertson road,as a result of the public health crisis resulting from the leaching of sewage into groundwater,the city made an exception to the infrastructure condition and entered into an agreement with the county to build sewers but no other infrastructure in.however,plaintiffs allege that despite the known urgency of the need for sewer services in and,the county has given priority to the building of other infrastructure,such as storm drains,in communities.plaintiffs allege that this priority practice is faulty and discriminatory.
another issue facing communities is the provision of services and emergency responders.as with sewer services,the city is not required to provide these services to communities not part of the city,so all and personnel are provided by the county.plaintiffs allege that the time it takes for county personnel to respond to calls for service in their neighborhoods is longer in part because county sheriff deputies must often drive through city territory to respond to calls from island neighborhoods.plaintiffs also allege that the response times within the unincorporated island communities are longer for the island neighborhoods than for the island neighborhoods.
ii.proceedings before the district court 
plaintiffs filed a complaint against the city,the county,and other defendants in the district court for the eastern district of california on august.the original complaint alleged violations of the fair housing act in the defendants failure to provide municipal services to the plaintiff neighborhoods,violations of equal protection in the defendants implementation of their annexation decisions,violations of title vi in the defendants land use and municipal services policies,violations of the california fair employment and housing act,violations of other provisions of the california code,and nuisance.
defendants filed a motion to dismiss,and some of plaintiffs claims,including their claims under the fair housing act,were dismissed.plaintiffs subsequently filed a first amended complaint on april.the city moved to dismiss the first amended complaint as inconsistent with the prior order on the motion to dismiss.pursuant to a stipulation,plaintiffs withdrew the first amended complaint and filed a second amended complaint on may.plaintiffs then agreed,on august,to limit their claims regarding inadequate municipal services to three areas sewers,police services,and bilingual assistance.plaintiffs then sought,and were granted,leave from magistrate judge beck to file the third amended complaint.
the third amended complaint included five counts.the first two counts,brought pursuant to,allege intentional discrimination in violation of equal protection as guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment and by title vi of the civil rights act codified at d in the exclusion of three of the plaintiffs neighborhoods from the mtsa between the city and the county the city application of its measure m policy concerning the extension of sewer infrastructure disparate provision of emergency services and the county policies regarding funding and construction of public infrastructure.the third count was brought under the fair employment and housing act feha,and california government code l,and alleges that the city and county provide municipal services in a manner that discriminates against the plaintiff neighborhoods.the fourth count alleges violations of california government code in the provision of municipal services,and the fifth count alleges common law and statutory nuisance.
defendants filed four separate summary judgment motions pursuant to an order from the district court dividing the issues for summary judgment.in their memoranda in opposition to the motions,plaintiffs presented,among other evidence,expert reports and statistical analysis purporting to show the discriminatory impact of the city and county actions.the district court granted the motions for summary judgment in their entirety.
in the first opinion on summary judgment,issued may,the district court reviewed plaintiffs claims alleging intentional discrimination in the exclusion from the mtsa.the district court rejected plaintiffs statistical evidence with regard to mtsa,in part because the court found that the statistics did not compare the plaintiffs neighborhoods with the entire latino population in the unincorporated areas.the district court also found that the proffered evidence of impact was not sufficient to show evidence of intent the court found that the one failed annexation attempt of did not demonstrate intent,and neither did allegedly discriminatory statements of city officials.as a result of this conclusion,the district court also held that plaintiffs title vi claims must fail because those claims also require proof of intentional discrimination.in addition to this finding,the district court held that the statute of limitations would bar plaintiffs mtsa claims.finally,the district court concluded that plaintiffs california feha claims had been abandoned,and that the claim would otherwise be able to proceed but was barred by the statute of limitations.
the second opinion,issued may,dealt with plaintiffs claims,which alleged intentional discrimination in the city implementation of the measure m policy.the district court again rejected plaintiffs evidence on this set of claims,finding that neither the statistical nor historical evidence proffered showed discriminatory impact or intent.this conclusion led the district court to grant summary judgment to defendants on the equal protection claim as well as the title vi claim.with regard to the claim for sewer services,the court found that plaintiffs did not state a prima facie case because they did not show a disparate impact.
the third opinion,issued july,was directed at claims filed only against defendant county,and granted summary judgment on plaintiffs claims of discrimination in the response times of law enforcement and the provision of bilingual police officers and emergency responders.the district court concluded that there was no evidence of slower response times in the plaintiff communities and thus there was no evidence of discriminatory impact or discriminatory intent.the district court also found that bilingual services were provided in a way rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.
the district court fourth opinion,of july,also only concerned the county,and granted summary judgment on plaintiffs claims of discrimination in the prioritization of infrastructure needs.the district court found that the county priority list passed rational basis review and was not unconstitutionally arbitrary.the district court issued another opinion on august,granting summary judgment to defendants on plaintiffs claims of discrimination in the provision of parks,allocation of state government funding,and creation of a common law nuisance.none of these claims are raised in this appeal.the district court,in this opinion,also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over plaintiffs other state law claims.finally,the district court,on december,awarded defendants in costs.

iv.discussion 
statute of limitations 
plaintiffs filed their original complaint on august.the city and county argue that plaintiffs are barred from making any claims based on events that occurred before because plaintiffs federal claims are subject to a statute of limitations in considering statute of limitations issues,the court is to look at when the operative decision occurred and to separate from the operative decisions those inevitable consequences that are not separately actionable.rk ventures,city of seattle,cir internal citations and quotations omitted.the district court found that plaintiffs claims alleging discrimination in their exclusion from the mtsa were based on the enactments of the mtsa in and,and the court then found that rather than a continuing violation,any alleged harm was instead the continuing ill effects of the alleged past violation and therefore the claims were barred.
plaintiffs put forth two arguments as to why this decision was in error.first,they argue that the continuing violations doctrine preserves their claims against each individual act of discrimination.second,they argue that the reenactment of the mtsa in was a separate act for which they can seek redress.
the continuing violations doctrine permits a plaintiff to sue for all discriminatory acts that occurred during the limitations period,even if the policy or other event giving rise to the discrimination occurred outside the limitations period.a plaintiff must show that a pattern or practice of discrimination creates an ongoing violation.however,discrete discriminatory acts will not create a pattern of discrimination without more claims can not be based on sporadic discriminatory acts but rather must be based on discriminatory conduct that is widespread.cherosky henderson,cir citing int l of teamsters united states,d.
the district court correctly concluded that plaintiffs had not shown the existence of a pattern or practice of discrimination but rather ongoing harm resulting from earlier discrete decisions.though plaintiffs argue that the earlier decisions the and mtsa enactments were applied by conduct throughout the limitations period,they offer no evidence of this.plaintiffs claim under the mtsa is that it chills their annexation attempts a claim discussed in greater detail below,see infra part iii b,but any chilling flows inexorably from the mtsa itself and not from any actions of defendants subsequent to the mtsa.
however,though plaintiffs can not show an ongoing violation,the of the mtsa in will preserve plaintiffs claim that their exclusion chills their annexation attempts.er.the question is whether the reenactment was the inevitable consequence of an earlier decision or instead the result of independent consideration.rk ventures,at knox davis,cir.the agreement is entitled the first amendment to master property tax sharing agreement.the main thrust of the agreement is the inclusion of a particular piece of property that had been previously excluded.section three of the agreement provides that e xcept as herein amended,the provisions of the agreement are expressly reaffirmed and remain in full force and effect.
the district court erred in dismissing the agreement as merely an automatic renewal of a past action.instead,the agreement expressly altered some of the terms of the former agreement and retained other terms,such as the exclusion of the plaintiffs neighborhoods.the city contention that the agreement was an unrelated discrete act of no relevance to this case is not persuasive part of plaintiffs claim is that they were intentionally excluded from the mtsa,and the agreement in expressly provided for retention of the mtsa provisions not amended.moreover,the agreement was not merely an inevitable consequence of the and agreements,because one of the consequences of those agreements was to exclude the parcel that the agreement instead included 
the district court erred in finding plaintiffs mtsa challenge barred by the statute of limitations.because this conclusion stems from the mtsa,plaintiffs may not challenge the or mtsa,but they may use those events as evidence to establish motive and to put their claims in context.carpinteria valley farms county of santa barbara,cir.
statistical evidence 
plaintiffs claims alleging violations of equal protection and title vi require similar must show that actions of the defendants had a discriminatory impact,and that defendants acted with an intent or purpose to discriminate based upon plaintiffs membership in a protected class.lee city of los angeles,cir.where,as here,the challenged governmental policy is facially neutral,proof of disproportionate impact on an identifiable group,such as evidence of gross statistical disparities,can satisfy the intent requirement where it tends to show that some invidious or discriminatory purpose underlies the policy.see village of arlington heights metro.hous.dev,d hazelwood school dist.united states,d.
plaintiffs contend that gross statistical disparities alone may constitute proof of a practice of discrimination and relieve plaintiffs from their burden of showing intent to discriminate.hazelwood,at.this is true,but it is the rare case where impact alone will be sufficient to invalidate a challenged government action.see arlington heights,at.noting that absent evidence of very stark statistical disparities,impact alone is not determinative,and the court must look to other evidence.
in addition to statistical evidence showing discriminatory impact,other factors to be considered in determining whether there is evidence of intent or purpose to discriminate include the historical background of the decision,the sequence of events leading up to the decision,and any relevant legislative or administrative history.arlington heights,at.if there is no evidence of intentional discrimination,then the court assumes that the challenged actions were not based on discrimination and must inquire only whether the actions were rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.hispanic taco vendors of washington city of pasco,cir.
exclusion from the mtsa 
plaintiffs claim that three of their neighborhoods were excluded from the mtsa because of their population,and that this exclusion constitutes a barrier to annexation erected by the city and county in support of this claim,plaintiffs put forth statistical evidence comparing the ethnicity of the population in the three plaintiffs neighborhoods excluded by the mtsa to those covered by the mtsa the differences in the proportions of latinos in the areas excluded and included are statistically significant.overall,according to the census,the islands excluded from the mtsa were latino,while the islands included in the mtsa were latino.
in granting summary judgment to defendants on this claim,the district court rejected plaintiffs use of census statistics from older census data show that the neighborhoods were not all at the enactment of the mtsa in and before the amendment.however,plaintiffs contend,and the census data show,that the neighborhoods were clearly trending towards becoming over time.plaintiffs also note that,which was excluded by the mtsa for the first time,had been under latino in,but had become latino by,and,having become,it was excluded.moreover,the use of census data is appropriate for analyzing the of the mtsa.the census data in the record are reproduced below.
plaintiffs experts compared the percentage of the population identified as latino in all the island neighborhoods excluded from the mtsa to the percentage of the population classified as latino in the included neighborhoods the difference in the percentage of the population identified as latino is statistically significant.er.
the district court found problems with the statistical comparisons made.the district court concluded,plaintiffs selectively analyze the latino population within each of the three impacted county islands,but do not adequately statistically analyze the latino population in relation to either the total population or total latino population.er.however,this reference to the total latino population is unclear.plaintiffs did compare the total latino population in the excluded areas to the total latino population in the included areas.moreover,plaintiffs compared the total population of the excluded areas to the total population of the included areas and found that,using the census figures,the mtsa included more than it excluded.defendants contend that plaintiffs statistics are inconsequential because the islands populations also include white citizens who obviously have not been treated any differently from the latinos in these islands.city resp.br.at.defendants do not point to any precedent for conducting this type of analysis as the question is whether particular islands have been excluded because of their racial composition,the type of comparison conducted by plaintiffs is appropriate.
in addition to this evidence,plaintiffs point to the annexation of two white neighborhoods,el vista,a neighborhood but not an island,and pelandale mchenry,also not an island,as evidence that the city gave preference to those neighborhoods over the latino neighborhoods.the district court disregarded this evidence,finding that because those two neighborhoods were not islands they were not similarly situated with the plaintiffs neighborhoods.defendants,arguing that the district court was correct,point out that do not require county infrastructure funding,so there would be no dispute over.however,this fact would seem to lend support to plaintiffs contention that the need for their neighborhoods to independently negotiate tax revenues is a barrier to annexation apparently either inclusion in the mtsa or,in the alternative,status means that negotiations about tax revenues do not,in all instances,need to take place in order for annexation to be accomplished.
plaintiffs point to the failed annexation attempt by in,where the inability of the city and county to timely agree on how tax revenues would be shared doomed the application.plaintiffs also point to the annexation of fairview village bordering in.when evaluating the fairview village application,the regional agency charged with regulating annexations recommended that the entire island be included in the annexation proposal.er.this recommendation was not adopted,and there is evidence that the proponents of the fairview village annexation believed that the inclusion of in the proposal would kill the annexation.er.plaintiffs also offer the declaration of juan mercado,a resident of,in which he states his belief that can not be annexed due to its exclusion from the mtsa and relates his difficulties in persuading his neighbors to support an application for annexation in the absence of the assurance provided by the mtsa.er.based on this testimony and the evidence about other annexations,a reasonable factfinder could conclude that exclusion from the mtsa is indeed a barrier to annexation that neighborhoods covered by the mtsa do not face 
finally,the district court did not conclude,as a matter of law,that plaintiffs had not shown disparate impact.rather,the district court,when analyzing plaintiffs mtsa claim under the equal protection framework,ruled that,even assuming that the mtsa disparately impacted latinos,the statistics did not give rise to an inference of intentional discrimination.er.moreover,although the district court rejected plaintiffs statistical evidence in the course of analyzing the mtsa claim under equal protection,it did find,in the course of analyzing plaintiffs companion california government code claim,that plaintiffs had presented some evidence of disparate impact.the district court stated that it could not conclude as a matter of law,that a reasonable jury would be unable to find disparate impact.er 
given the context of the reenactment,the trend of the neighborhoods to become more over time,the unsuccessful application,and the example of the fairview village annexation,we conclude that plaintiffs have presented evidence of discriminatory impact which,in turn,has created a sufficient inference of discriminatory intent to permit them to present their mtsa claim to a factfinder.we will reverse the district court decision on this claim.
measure m and the provision of sewer services 
plaintiffs argue that the infrastructure requires the county to install all infrastructure in an island up to city standards before the city will,pursuant to measure m,permit city voters to consider extending sewer services to that applied in a discriminatory way.the infrastructure condition is only imposed on islands that the city deems substantial,and there is no definition of what makes an island substantial.the infrastructure condition was imposed on the latino areas of shackelford latino which includes and robertson road latino,but was not imposed on the islands of latino,latino,latino,latino,and emerald elm latino er.plaintiffs argue that the condition is imposed in an ad hoc,discriminatory fashion.
of the islands which have had measure m votes,the combined population is latino,but the islands which have been deemed therefore not subjected to measure undisputedly.it is undisputed that the difference between the percentage of latinos in the islands that were and were not subjected to the infrastructure condition is statistically significant.er.the city contends that this statistical comparison is meaningless,because a comparison of insubstantial islands with substantial islands ignores the fact that no substantial white island has received a measure m vote.plaintiffs use the smaller white islands exempted from the requirement to calculate the statistics.though the city argues that the rest of the islands should be included in the calculations,the other islands are properly left out of the analysis because they have neither been subjected to nor exempted from the condition yet,as there is no evidence that they have sought a measure m vote.
plaintiffs contend that the city application of the differentiation strengthens the inference of discriminatory intent.it is undisputed that the terms are undefined and that the city has refused to define the terms even in the face of recommendations that it do so.er.additionally,the city does not pay for infrastructure whether it imposes the infrastructure condition or not the county provides and pays for it.the city purported concern for the financial aspects of installing infrastructure in a larger island would seem to be less compelling where the city is providing none of the funding for that infrastructure.the city argues that it is trying to manage expectations of annexation,because it is not just sewer access but all infrastructure that is required before annexation can be considered,and that people living in the islands will believe that annexation will naturally follow a measure m vote,which can not be the case if the infrastructure is not completed.however,this does not explain why the city would waive the infrastructure requirement for the smaller islands,which will still need the county to provide that infrastructure before they can be annexed.some of these islands have indeed had a measure m vote,a vote which has not yet been followed by annexation,and there is no evidence that this situation has resulted in any problems for the city.
it is clear that the infrastructure condition has the potential to have a real effect on the ability of island areas to connect to basic services as the district court noted,the county and the city have put unincorporated county islands in a difficult county policy focuses on sewer repair before improvements,while the city policy favors an infrastructure improvement approach before a measure m advisory vote on sewers.it is undisputed that the city and county policy are at odds.er.
although the statistics,and the conflicting policies,are troublesome,the reality is somewhat different.sewer services are provided to only of the unincorporated,shackelford,and robertson are latino and minority sewer services were extended to the latter two neighborhoods after those islands had become,although it is undisputed that these neighborhoods were subject to the infrastructure condition initially and sewer services were extended to these areas only after the city found that failing septic systems created a public health crisis.er.still,robertson road succeeded in obtaining an exemption and getting sewer access,as did part of shackelford.moreover,no white island has sewer those islands which have already been the subject of a measure m vote and are therefore in receipt of permission from city voters to extend the sewer system to reach them.given this evidence of a lack of disparity in actual access to sewer services,plaintiffs statistical evidence is insufficient to give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.the district court grant of summary judgment to the city on the sewer issue will be affirmed.
and emergency response times 
plaintiffs contend that the dispatch time the time lapse between a call to and the dispatch of an officer and the total response time the time lapse between a call and the arrival of an officer on scene,including dispatch time of emergency and personnel are slower in islands than in islands.
the first question is the proper unit of measure.plaintiffs argue that dispatch time is a more important measure,because that factor is entirely controlled by the individual answering the call,while response time is influenced by other factors such as geographical distance,driving speeds,traffic,and weather.the county contends that the total response time is the only measure that matters in terms of any potentially discriminatory impact because it is what actually affects the individual making the person seeking assistance is concerned simply with the overall time it takes emergency personnel to arrive.the dispatch times and response times discussed in the district court opinion are as follows 
averages,modified from county expert report er 
the second issue is one of control.the county asserts that it does not control the dispatch center,stanislaus regional also known as the dispatch agency or,and so can not be responsible for any potential issues relating to dispatch time,but only for response time.the county contends that it is only in control of the time it takes a dispatched officer to arrive,which is included in response time.the district court found that there was a dispute over the level of control the county exercised over and did not resolve the issue 
the county does not appear to dispute that dispatch times to the plaintiffs neighborhoods are slower than dispatch times to islands and to the rest of the county.similarly,plaintiffs do not seem to dispute that latino unincorporated areas and the plaintiffs neighborhoods actually had quicker response times for some of the period in question than did the rest of the unincorporated areas.er showing that between,and,response time to the plaintiffs neighborhoods was minutes and response time to all the unincorporated areas was minutes.the district court concluded that while the dispatch times are slower,the response times by the sheriff deputies are quicker,yielding no meaningful difference for residents of latino unincorporated areas who call.the difference,if at all,is reduced to seconds.er.
however,the difference in dispatch time between the plaintiff neighborhoods and islands was,between and,at a minimum,almost two minutes the difference between the minutes that the county asserts it took for officers to be dispatched to the plaintiff neighborhoods and the minutes it took for officers to be dispatched to islands during that same period.at a minimum,the difference in response times,according to the county,for that same period was almost one minute the difference between the minutes it took to respond to calls in the plaintiffs neighborhoods and the minutes it took to respond to calls in the islands.plaintiffs expert has asserted that these differences are statistically significant defendants expert asserts that these numbers do not represent a meaningful difference.er.the county offers no reason why dispatch times should be different between neighborhoods there is some testimony in the record indicating that differences in dispatch times would be unusual.er.
the county argument that response time is the most important measure to the person waiting for the police to arrive has weight,and plaintiffs have shown that,even looking only to response time,the differences between the time to respond to the plaintiffs neighborhoods and the islands is statistically significant.moreover,the county focus on response time ignores the fact that dispatch time is a component of response,if dispatch times were more equitable,response times would follow suit.
this court can not agree that,as a matter of law,a difference of one minute can be characterized as not making a meaningful difference when one is waiting at one home for or emergency personnel to arrive,particularly in the absence of any explanation for why the time difference exists.a factfinder should decide if the difference is material and if so if the difference is explainable on grounds other than the ethnicity of the population of the neighborhoods or if plaintiffs have proved that the county has intentionally discriminated against them in the provision of services.the grant of summary judgment to the county on plaintiffs law enforcement claim will be reversed.
the issue of whether and to what extent the county controls the dispatch agency was not resolved by the district court and can not be resolved by this court.on remand,the district court should consider whether the county can be responsible for the dispatch agency as a matter of law,or whether there are issues of fact regarding the control of the dispatch agency that can not be resolved at the summary judgment phase.
provision of infrastructure 
this claim concerns a priorities list the county adopted in in order to set out priorities for the construction of infrastructure.plaintiffs contend that despite the acknowledged fact that the most pressing need in the county was for sewers in areas with failing septic systems,the county ignored this need in order to construct other,less important,infrastructure in communities.specifically,they challenge the choice to construct storm drainage in keyes,south ceres,and salida instead of sewers in and or storm drainage in any of the plaintiffs neighborhoods.plaintiffs also argue that even if there was not intentional discrimination,the priorities list is so arbitrary that it is not rationally related to a legitimate government purpose and so fails an equal protection challenge under rational basis review.
the district court found that the priorities list,as a whole,did not favor white neighborhoods over latino neighborhoods and that because the undisputed evidence is that all the neighborhoods on the priorities list have infrastructure needs for which there is not enough money there was not enough of a disparate impact on the latino neighborhoods to raise an inference of discriminatory impact.er emphasis in original.the district court also found that the county actions can be explained by a myriad of community and planning concerns having nothing to do with the ethnicity of the plaintiffs neighborhoods.er at.
plaintiffs contend that the county shifting around of the order of priorities on the list is evidence of procedural irregularity in the.for example,the construction of sewers in was third on the list as part of the project of constructing sewers in the larger neighborhood of shackelford which includes but was dropped to eleventh when the county found the cost of putting sewers into the whole shackelford neighborhood was too expensive and scaled back the project.however,the person who created the priorities list testified at a deposition that the list was simply list of needed things,with no actual intent to rank any infrastructure need over any others.er.the list was then adopted by the board of supervisors as a priority list in.
plaintiffs point out that the construction of storm drainage in advance of the construction of sewers violated the county own policies of making sewers the highest priority,using funds to serve the most urgent needs of the greatest number of people,and developing infrastructure in island neighborhoods to promote annexation.constructing storm drainage in keyes is not inexpensive,and,according to plaintiffs,actually far more expensive than installing sewers or storm drains in the plaintiffs neighborhoods.see app.reply br.charts comparing costs.the county,in addition to arguing that the keyes storm drains project actually benefitted a significant latino population,contends that keyes was in more dire need of storm drainage than some of the plaintiff neighborhoods were in need of sewer access,because keyes is overwhelmed during rainstorms with significant water and the septic systems in and are not failing.plaintiffs dispute this,contending that the storm water in keyes is not nearly as bad as the storm water in or the septic needs in.in the context of a motion for summary judgment,these disputed facts must be construed in plaintiffs favor and therefore we are required to assume that the needs in keyes were not as pressing as the needs in the plaintiffs neighborhoods.however,it is also the case that the priorities list as a whole places some projects in latino neighborhoods above some projects in white neighborhoods.
setting aside the issue of ranking the relative direness of the need,all of the items on the priorities list represent needed infrastructure,and some of the plaintiffs neighborhoods,such as robertson road,have already received the benefit of significant infrastructure construction.there may have been some irregularities with the decision to build the keyes storm drains before sewers in the plaintiff neighborhoods however,in the context of many infrastructure needs and the need of the county to utilize limited sources of funding,in addition to testimony of the creator of the list that the list was not intended to rank projects,there is not sufficient evidence to give rise to an inference of discriminatory intent.
with regard to the plaintiffs claim that the priorities list and the construction of storm drainage failed even rational basis review,the county was entitled to summary judgment.the county presented reasons why it chose to undertake certain projects first,reasons largely related to the sources of the funding for the projects and the need to construct subsurface infrastructure before infrastructure the county was permitted to take these factors into account.despite plaintiffs view that their neighborhoods face the most pressing infrastructure problems,there is no requirement that the county order the list according to need.app.br.the county actions will be upheld as long as they bear a rational relation to a legitimate government actions do not have to be the wisest or most efficient options for government action.because it is undisputed that all the projects on the list were needed,the creation of the priorities list bears a rational relation to infrastructure needs in the county.
the district court grant of summary judgment to the county on plaintiffs infrastructure claim will be affirmed.
c.the fair housing act and claims 
the fair housing act,b,makes it unlawful to discriminate against any person in the terms,conditions,or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling,or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,because of race,color,religion,sex,familial status,or national origin.hud,the agency tasked with implementing the fha,has enacted regulations relating to.prohibits failing or delaying maintenance or repairs of sale or rental dwellings or limiting the use or privileges,services,or facilities associated with a dwelling because of discrimination.plaintiffs allegations under the fha are as follows 
defendants have discriminated in the provision of services and facilities in connection with plaintiffs housing including but not limited to an ongoing discriminatory failure to provide adequate law enforcement protection and emergency services,and other basic services such as lighting and sidewalks,street maintenance,refuse removal,and drainage to plaintiffs based in substantial part on the race,ethnicity,ancestry,color or national origin of the residents of the latino unincorporated neighborhoods,in violation of b.
as a general matter,fha claims are evaluated under the framework of the title vii discrimination analysis and may be brought under theories of both disparate treatment and disparate impact.see budnick town of carefree,cir.to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact,a plaintiff must show at least that the defendant actions had a discriminatory effect.keith volpe,cir.this requires proof of the occurrence of certain outwardly neutral practices,and a significantly adverse or disproportionate impact on persons of a particular type produced by the defendant facially neutral acts or practices.pfaff dep t of housing and urban,cir citing palmer united states,cir.a defendant may then rebut a plaintiff proof of disparate impact by supply ing a legally sufficient,nondiscriminatory reason.affordable hous.dev.city of fresno,cir quoting pfaff,at.
plaintiffs fha claims were dismissed by the district court in the court held that plaintiffs could not state an fha claim because the statute is limited to discrimination in the provision of services in connection with the acquisition of a dwelling,rather than discrimination in the provision of services to existing homeowners and renters.
this court,in prior instances where we have considered claims brought under the fha,has not differentiated between claims based on whether the alleged discrimination occurred at the time of or after the acquisition of the housing.for example,in ojo farmers group,cir,we recently addressed the fha in the context of discrimination in homeowner insurance rates.
we have also held,in harris itzhaki,cir,that a plaintiff who claimed she was subject to eviction notices following her complaint of race discrimination could state a claim under the fha.in harris,after the plaintiff,an woman,sought the assistance of a local housing organization,the organization employed housing testers to confirm her complaint that the defendant landlord treated prospective and white tenants differently.we held that plaintiff could pursue her fha claim,finding that she had standing because she was an aggrieved person under the act and that she had established a prima facie disparate treatment claim under the act.again,we did not make any distinction based on the fact that the plaintiff claim which was related to her eviction had necessarily arisen after she acquired the housing.
the seventh circuit has also grappled with this issue.in halprin prairie single family homes of dearborn park,cir,plaintiffs were jewish homeowners who contended that their property was vandalized and they were harassed because of their religion.the court concluded that of the fha was generally concerned with the provision of services in connection with access to housing and not problems with the provision of services after the sale or rental.the court did permit,dubitante,plaintiffs claim to proceed under a different part of the statute.section makes it unlawful to coerce,intimidate,threaten,or interfere with any person in the exercise or enjoyment of,or on account of his having exercised or enjoyed,or on account of his having aided or encouraged any other person in the exercise or enjoyment of,any right granted or protected by section,or of the fha.implementing this part of the statute is a regulation which prohibits threatening,intimidating or interfering with persons in their enjoyment of a dwelling because of the race,color,religion,sex,handicap,familial status,or national origin of such persons,or of visitors or associates of such persons.c.the court found that the regulation unmoored from its tie to and so permitted a claim based on interference with enjoyment of a dwelling that has taken place after the dwelling has been acquired.in so doing,the court expressed doubt as to the validity of this regulation,noting that the language of the regulation may stray too far from its statutory authorization to be permissible,but finding that its validity was,in that case,unchallenged with regard to itself,the court found that a s a purely semantic matter the statutory language might be stretched far enough to reach a case of constructive eviction.halprin,at.
