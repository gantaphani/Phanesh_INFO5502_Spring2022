teresa and joseph basco appeal from summary judgment granted in favor of gil machin,director of section housing of hillsborough county,florida,and patricia bean,administrator of hillsborough county,florida,on their complaint asserting violations of due process pursuant to when their housing subsidy was terminated for the presence of an unauthorized resident.we reverse.
teresa basco was a qualified participant in the section program of her local public housing authority,the health and social services department of hillsborough county,florida pha the pha administers the housing choice voucher program for the department for housing and urban development hud.that program provides monetary and rental assistance to families.as a section participant,teresa basco entered into a lease for a residence in tampa,florida with her mother and landlord,donna vanderlaan in the lease,basco indicated that only she,her husband,and five minor children would reside in the assisted unit.the pha and vanderlaan entered into a housing assistance payments contract hap contract,which provided that the pha would pay a specific amount each month to vanderlaan on behalf of basco.the hap contract restricted the residents of the assisted unit to those listed in the lease.in connection with receiving section assistance,basco signed a form acknowledging that her benefits could be terminated for any violation of the terms of the hap contract,including allowing disturbances at her unit and failing to notify the pha of any changes in family composition.
hud regulations prohibit the presence of an unauthorized resident in assisted units,but do not prohibit a participant from having house guests.see h.at the relevant time,the pha interpreted these regulations in its administrative plan for the period by establishing particular rules regarding visitors 
any person not included on the hud who has been in the unit more than consecutive days without pha approval,or a total of days in a month period,will be considered to be living in the unit as an unauthorized household member.
absence of evidence of any other address will be considered verification that the visitor is a member of the household.
statements from neighbors the landlord will be considered in making the determination.
use of the unit address as the visitor current residence for any purpose that is not explicitly temporary shall be construed as permanent residence.
the burden of proof that the individual is a visitor rests on the family.in the absence of such proof the individual will be considered an unauthorized member of the household and the pha will terminate assistance since prior approval was not requested for the addition.
in november,an anonymous person who identified himself as a neighbor of basco telephoned the pha to provide information regarding disturbances at basco assisted unit,multiple police calls to the unit,and the arrest of a member of basco household.the pha assigned the matter to section housing counselor sarah matalon,who obtained from the tampa police department copies of two police reports involving basco assisted unit.
the first report,dated february,stated that joseph basco gave a sworn statement to the police indicating that his stepdaughter had run away with a man named emanuel jones,who staying at the house.the alleged sworn statement was not contained in or attached to the report.the february report further noted that basco said he called emanuel stepfather to come and collect emanuel belongings.the report noted that emanuel address was the same as that of basco unit.the second report,dated july,listed elonzel jones as an eyewitness to an alleged battery on basco by his stepdaughter,and listed elonzel address as that of the assisted unit.
based on these two police reports,section senior housing counselor sherry hanson sent basco a notice of intent to terminate along with copies of the reports.the termination notice advised basco that the pha intended to terminate her housing assistance based the presence of on an unauthorized resident in her unit in violation of and.although not expressly stated,the implication from the notice was that the pha believed that elonzel jones and emanuel jones were the same person that jones had been living in basco assisted unit between february and july that this totaled more than fifteen days and that jones was therefore an unauthorized resident.indeed,in its brief on appeal,the pha avers that the police reports reflected jones address over a five month period.
in response to the termination notice,basco requested a hearing.section participants are entitled to a pretermination of benefits hearing before an impartial hearing officer who is appointed by the tampa housing authority,an entity distinct from the pha.the pha sent basco a letter scheduling the hearing and advising her of her rights and also provided her with copies of the february and july police reports.
at the hearing and on behalf of the pha,matalon presented,as the only evidence,copies of the february and july police reports she had obtained.in her defense,both basco and her landlord testified that jones did not live at the assisted unit.basco also submitted a december,notarized letter from jones mother stating that jones had only ever lived at two addresses,neither of which was basco.to rebut the alleged statement by basco contained in the february police report,basco asked to have her husband directly testify by telephone the hearing officer denied the request and upheld the pha decision to terminate basco benefits,stating 
basco could not provide information regarding the unauthorized resident.basco gave a statement to police that states that jones stay sic in assist sic unit.landlord who is also basco sic mother became upset and demand sic extra time to gather more information records on jones.her request were sic denied.decision is upheld.
the bascos twice sought to have the hearing officer decision overturned.they met with gil machin,the acting operations manager of the pha,and presented new evidence,including a january,notarized letter from jones stating that he had only lived with his grandmother and mother,and that he had never lived in basco unit.after reviewing the new evidence,machin concluded that there was not a sufficient basis under hud regulations to overturn the hearing officer decision or to provide basco with a new hearing.the bascos also retained a legal services attorney,who again requested that machin reject the decision of the hearing officer.after reviewing the file a second time,machin again denied the request.in a letter to the bascos attorney,machin cited the pha administrative plan provision stating that t he burden of proof that the individual is a visitor rests on the family.in the absence of such proof the individual will be considered an unauthorized member of the household and the pha will terminate assistance 
the bascos then filed this suit,alleging deprivations of their right to procedural due process under e and,and.in particular,the bascos asserted that the pha denied them the opportunity to confront and witnesses against them,and improperly placed the burden of proof on them rather than on the pha,which sought to terminate their housing assistance.
the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the pha,finding no violation of due process.we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards as the district court.see,allen tyson foods,cir.
ii.discussion 
the bascos ask us to resolve two issues in appealing the district court grant of summary judgment.we must first decide if the pha or the section participant bears the burden of in an administrative hearing held under hud regulations to determine whether a participant housing subsidy should be terminated.if the pha bears that burden,we must then decide whether due process allows the burden to be met in this case by matalon submission of copies of the police reports.
hud regulations establish the substantive rights at issue and the basic procedures to be followed in an informal section termination hearing,but do not expressly address which party bears the
