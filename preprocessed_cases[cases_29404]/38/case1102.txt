the main question presented by this appeal is whether a person who alters records that have been subpoenaed by a grand jury obstructs an investigation of medicare fraud.see.marsha lynn appeals her convictions and sentences on charges of health care fraud,filing false claims,and obstruction of justice.we conclude that section governs alteration of the records subpoenaed by the grand jury because the proceedings of the grand jury were related to an investigation of medicare fraud by the department of health and human services.we affirm convictions and sentences,except that we vacate the forfeiture money judgment and remand to the district court for recalculation of the forfeiture amount.
background 
marsha lynn is a dermatologist who practiced in florida and regularly sought reimbursement from medicare for surgical procedures she performed on her patients.submitted her medicare claims to first coast service options,a private contractor that administers the medicare program in florida.first coast reviewed the claims prepared by and approved payments to her based on the current procedural terminology code that she identified on each claim.first coast regularly reviewed claims submitted by physicians and code usage to detect unusual diagnosis patterns or statistical anomalies that might suggest fraudulent billing.
during a review in,first coast noticed that florida dermatologists,including,were billing medicare at an aberrant rate under billing code,which is for a surgical procedure known as an adjacent tissue transfer or rearrangement that measures more than square centimeters and is unusual or complicated.the procedure is performed after the removal of a lesion or other defect under the skin,where the surgeon uses more than one side of a wound to create a skin flap to close the wound.the procedure is used to preserve the function of a body part,avoid critical structures,and minimize scarring or disfigurement.
on august,first coast notified by letter that it was conducting a focused medical review of the increased claims filed under billing code and requested that produce medical records.produced the records and copies of photographs from the patient files.cynthia dangerfield,the first coast employee who conducted the review,was concerned that the individual patient records were too similar and that the anatomical sites appeared to be too small for surgical procedures under billing code.
in october,first coast sent another letter to that mentioned the billing anomaly and requested medical records,photographs,and information about the size and cause of the original wounds.produced the records,but not the photographs.during the review,first coast determined that from through,billed medicare under code more often and for greater amounts than under any other billing code.also submitted claims more often and for greater amounts under code than any other physician in florida during the first halves of and.
in december,dangerfield prepared a report about the focused medical review and recommended that first coast conduct a comprehensive medical review of because she was much higher in terms of allowed dollars and numbers of claims than all other providers reviewed and appeared to have a coding billing issue.the report stated that may potentially be referred to the fraud unit but recommended no action.dangerfield also recommended that first coast publish an educational article in the medicare newsletter in florida and send educational letters to the providers with high rates of billing under code.in response,first coast published an article about the focused medical review and correct methodology for billing under code in the issue of the medicare newsletter in florida.
on february,first coast sent a letter to that informed her of the need for a comprehensive medical review.the letter stated that the review was based on a significant variance in her billing patterns compared with other physicians.in response to the letter,produced medical records.
in may,kathy jones,an employee of first coast,conducted the comprehensive medical review.jones became concerned that had not actually performed the surgeries that she billed to medicare because there were discrepancies between records about the sizes of lesions and the sizes recorded in pathology reports.the lesion sizes recorded by appeared to be too large for the anatomical sites involved in the operations.jones also observed that the operative reports submitted by appeared identical for all patients.
on june,jones contacted by telephone to discuss her billing practices and asked to explain the methodology that she used to select the billing code for the surgeries she performed.stated that she measured the initial wound and adjacent skin flap and took photographs.jones instructed her not to measure the skin flap and requested photographs for the files involved in the review.first coast did not receive any photographs,and on june,jones contacted betty hill,office manager,to request copies of photographs for the files involved in the review.jones also asked hill if surgical photographs included a centimeter rule,and hill responded that they did not.despite repeated requests for the photographs,first coast did not receive them.
first coast closed its comprehensive medical review and informed of the results.jones called on june,and instructed her to use the correct methodology for billing code,as outlined in the medicare bulletin,and to include a centimeter rule in her surgical photographs.agreed to follow those instructions.
brenda redfern,the first coast employee who closed the comprehensive medical review,stated in her report that first coast suspected of upcoding her claims but decided to educate her about proper coding and billing because it had been unable to scientifically determine the defect size based on the records.on july,jones sent a letter to that stated that jones found the majority of records to have large discrepancies between the documented lesion size s in the operative reports and in the corresponding lesion size s in the pathology reports that was too great to be ignored.jones reminded to measure and record the lesion sites to ensure proper payment is being made and to reduce the possible recovery of any future inappropriately paid dollars.first coast scheduled for reevaluation in january.
in january,gloria herring,an employee of first coast,conducted a probe review of billing practices based on continued billing anomalies.in a letter dated april,first coast informed about this review and asked her to produce medical records.produced the records,but did not produce any photographs.herring observed that all of operative reports were identical,which was noteworthy because procedures billed under code were,by definition,unusual or complicated.herring also determined that many of the documented surgical sites were too small for procedures billed under code,and herring adjusted the codes for several claims.on september,first coast issued a summary report about the previous reviews of billing practices and the results of the probe review.based on the results of the probe review,first coast requested repay overpayments on the adjusted claims in the amount of and required her to obtain preapproval to use code.
in may,agents of the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services searched office based on a federal search warrant for patient files associated with claims billed under code.the agents seized over files but could not locate about files.the files that were seized that contained photographs formed the basis of the fraud and false claim charges against.
in january,a federal grand jury issued a subpoena that directed to produce the missing files.produced of the missing files,but the majority of the records produced lacked photographs.attorneys later produced a box of loose photographs to the government.
in july,the grand jury returned an indictment against on counts of health care fraud,counts of filing false claims,id,and one count of obstruction of justice,id.the indictment alleged that defrauded medicare by fraudulently billing procedures under the code from
