cumberland county hospital system,cape fear valley health system cape fear health system or the hospital system,commenced this action to obtain a writ of mandamus compelling the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs to adjudicate immediately its administrative appeals on claims for medicare reimbursement.with over of its appeals on such claims awaiting assignment to an administrative law judge alj for more than days,the hospital system asserts that the secretary delay violates the congressional mandate that its appeals be heard and decided by aljs within days.see d a.
the parties agree that,as of february,the secretary had appeals awaiting assignment to an alj,and the secretary conceded in her brief that the number had by then climbed to more than appeals,creating a backlog.while acknowledging the unacceptability of the backlog,the secretary attributes it to an increased number of appeals within the medicare system and inadequate funding by congress to hire additional personnel.
the district court dismissed the hospital system complaint,relying on two independent grounds.it held that the hospital system does not have a clear and indisputable right to an alj hearing within a day time frame,as required for issuance of a mandamus order,and that the political branches,rather than the courts,are best suited to address the backlog in the administrative process.we affirm.
while we agree that the delay in the administrative process for medicare reimbursement is incontrovertibly grotesque,the medicare act does not guarantee a healthcare provider a hearing before an alj within days,as the hospital system claims.rather,it provides a comprehensive administrative process which includes deadlines and consequences for missed deadlines that a healthcare provider must exhaust before ultimately obtaining review in a united states district court.indeed,within that administrative process,a healthcare provider can bypass administrative reviews if such reviews are delayed,escalating for review by a united states district court within a relatively expeditious time.the issuance of a judicial order now,however,directing the secretary to hear the hospital system claims in the middle of the administrative process,would unduly interfere with the process and,at a larger scale,the work of the political branches.moreover,such intervention would invite other healthcare providers suffering similar delays to likewise seek a mandamus order,thereby effectively causing the judicial process to replace and distort the agency process.

in and,the secretary denied payment to the hospital system on over claims for reimbursement for medicare services that she had initially authorized.by september,the hospital system had over appeals on these claims that had been pending for more than days before the office of medicare hearings and appeals omha within hhs.those appeals related to claims for some million in reimbursement.the secretary has not even acknowledged receipt of some of the appeals,and with respect to others,she has reported a delay of over two years in assigning them to an alj.because reimbursement of such a large sum is essential to the hospital system operations,the hospital system commenced this action for a writ of mandamus,ordering the secretary to docket,assign to an alj,and decide its appeals within days,as required by the medicare act.see d a.it also seeks a declaratory judgment that the secretary delay in adjudication of medicare appeals violates federal law.
in its complaint,the hospital system alleged that the number of appeals to aljs quintupled during the two years of and,increasing from to,and that the aljs workload increased by almost from fiscal year to fiscal year.it alleged that,as of february,appeals were awaiting assignment to aljs.the secretary does not deny the existence of the backlog,nor its size,as the figures alleged by the hospital system are those published by hhs.indeed,in her brief,the secretary acknowledged that the backlog has grown rapidly to more than appeals and that,with omha current staffing of aljs,it would take over ten years for the aljs to dispose of those appeals.the allegations of the parties do,however,attribute the backlog to different causes.
the secretary asserts that the backlog is the result of an increased utilization of services the additional appeals from audits conducted under the recovery audit program instituted in and additional medicaid state agency appeals of medicare coverage denials for beneficiaries enrolled in both medicare and medicaid.she notes that she has been unable to reduce or even stabilize the backlog because congressional funding has remained relatively stagnant during the last five years and additional aljs therefore could not and can not be hired.she states,however,that the president budget proposes more than tripling the funding for omha and,in addition,proposes new processes that would facilitate the resolution of appeals at earlier stages in the administrative process.finally,the secretary points out that congress has been aware of the existing backlog for some time,has recognized the need for a legislative solution,and,indeed,is working on a solution.
cape fear health system does not disagree completely,but it contends that the backlog is mainly due to the secretary mismanagement of hhs resources.the hospital system points out that,while the agency has proposed pilot programs for alternative dispute resolution with respect to some types of reimbursement,it has not made those programs available for the types of reimbursement being claimed by the hospital system.furthermore,the hospital system contends that the increase in appeals from audits conducted pursuant to the recovery audit program is attributable to the perverse incentives of that program,which pays contractors contingency compensation based on monies they recover in denying improper or excessive claims.
regardless of the cause,however,the parties agree,and the district court found,that appeals have skyrocketed and have overwhelmed the medicare reimbursement process.
the district court granted the secretary motion to dismiss the hospital system complaint under federal rule of civil procedure b,relying on two independent grounds for doing so.first,the court concluded that the hospital system complaint failed to state a plausible claim for a mandamus order because it failed to demonstrate a clear and indisputable right to relief,as congress did not grant the hospital system an absolute right to an alj hearing within the day timeframe,and it failed to demonstrate that the secretary has a clear duty to provide such a hearing within the day time frame.second,as a matter of discretion,the court concluded that to grant mandamus relief would inappropriately intermeddle with the agency efforts and would fail to recognize hhs comparative institutional advantage in crafting a solution to the delays in the adjudication of appeals.the court explained that the political branches are to alleviate omha crippling delays.the court also noted in this regard that putting the hospital system at the head of the queue,where doing so would simply move all others back one space and would produce no net gain,should be avoided as a matter of equity.
the district court also denied the hospital system claim for declaratory relief,reasoning that,because the declaratory judgment act does not supply a right of action in the absence of a valid substantive claim,dismissal of the hospital system declaratory judgment must necessarily follow dismissal of its mandamus claim.
cape fear health system filed this appeal.
mandamus is a drastic remedy that must be reserved for extraordinary situations involving the performance of official acts or duties.kerr dist.court for the dist.of,d.accordingly,to show that it is entitled to mandamus relief,a plaintiff must show,among other things,that it has a clear and indisputable right to the relief sought and that the responding party has a clear duty to do the specific act requested.united states ex rel.rahman oncology,cir.
in this case,cape fear health system contends that the medicare act gives it a clear and indisputable right to have its appeals decided within days and that it imposes on the secretary a clear duty to accomplish that.in support of this contention,it emphasizes the mandatory language of the act,which provides that an alj shall conduct and conclude a hearing and render a decision on such hearing by not later than the end of the day period beginning on the date a request for hearing has been timely filed.d a emphasis added.it also points to the chief alj recent testimony before a congressional committee that the deadlines for aljs decisions were set and omha was created to reduce the average waiting time for a hearing decision that occurred under the prior scheme.it argues that the escalation mechanism in the medicare act a mechanism whereby healthcare providers can bypass alj review if they are delayed and proceed to the departmental appeals board and ultimately to the courts,see id.d does not diminish its right to an alj hearing because escalation is not mandatory but may be employed at the discretion of the appellant.and,in any event,it maintains that electing to bypass the alj hearing would result in its foregoing its right to create an administrative record at the alj hearing,thus forcing it to make a terrible choice either waive its right to due process,to make a record or suffer interminably until the secretary feels like affording it a hearing.
the secretary,by contrast,maintains that the medicare statute does not confer on the hospital system a right to a hearing within days that is enforceable through mandamus,emphasizing that the statute provides that the consequence of failing to adjudicate an appeal within days is that the provider may escalate that appeal to the departmental appeals board.the secretary argues that,while the statute establishes a time frame for decisions,it also recognizes that the time frame may not be satisfied and provides persons seeking review with a specific avenue of relief.because,as the secretary argues,such escalation is the remedy congress provided,the hospital system can not show indisputable entitlement to any other,regardless of whether escalation adequately ensures the particular administrative review that the hospital system seeks.
we begin by noting that the process that congress has provided for obtaining medicare reimbursement and administrative review of reimbursement decisions is comprehensive and specific a coherent regulatory scheme,gustafson alloyd,d which begins with the submission of a claim for reimbursement,continues through a detailed and multistep administrative process,and concludes with the provision for judicial review.accordingly,understanding the full process is necessary to address the hospital system argument that a court should enforce a specific,discrete element of the process through a writ of mandamus.
to obtain reimbursement for medicare services,a healthcare provider must,in the first instance,submit a claim to a medicare administrative contractor,a private contractor retained by hhs to make an initial determination regarding whether and in what amount the claim should be paid.see a,a.that determination by the medicare administrative contractor may,under a program that congress established in,be audited by a different government contractor,known as a recovery audit contractor.see id.h.congress created that audit program to serve the purpose of recouping overpayments,and it incentivized the recovery audit contractors by paying them on a contingent basis for collecting overpayments.id.h.healthcare providers wishing to challenge these initial claim determinations by the medicare administrative contractor or the recovery audit contractor must pursue a comprehensive,administrative review process before seeking review in court.
at the first step,a healthcare provider dissatisfied with either the initial determination or the results of an audit may seek a redetermination from the original medicare administrative contractor.see a.at the second step,if the healthcare provider is dissatisfied with the redetermination,it may seek reconsideration by a qualified independent contractor qic,another government contractor retained to independently review the evidence and findings upon which the previous determination was based.a c.in doing so,the qic may receive and consider any additional evidence the parties submit or that the qic obtains on its own.a.at the third step,the healthcare provider may challenge the qic decision by requesting a hearing before an alj.see d.the alj hearing process is administered by omha,a division within hhs that is independent of and funded through an appropriation separate from the division that oversees the contractors review during the first two steps of the administrative review process.see medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,stat,statement of organization,functions,and delegations of authority.june.at the fourth step,the healthcare provider may appeal the alj decision to the departmental appeals board for de novo review.see d.the departmental appeals board decision becomes the final decision of the secretary,which may then be reviewed in court.see id.b a.
the medicare act establishes deadlines for each step in the administrative review process and specifies the consequences when such deadlines are not met.the act directs that the first two steps of administrative review be completed by the medicare administrative contractor and the qic,respectively,within days.a c ii,c c i.if the qic fails to meet this deadline,the healthcare provider may bypass the qic determination and escalate the process by requesting a hearing before an alj,even though a decision by the qic is ordinarily a prerequisite to such a hearing.id.c c ii.with respect to the adjudication by an alj,the medicare act provides that an alj shall conduct and conclude a hearing on a decision of a qic and render a decision on such hearing by not later than the end of the day period beginning on the date a request for hearing has been timely filed.id.d a see also c providing a day deadline if the appeal had been escalated past the qic level.if the alj does not render a decision before the deadline,the healthcare provider may bypass the alj and again escalate the process by request ing a review by the departmental appeals board,notwithstanding any requirements for a hearing for purposes of the party right to such a review.d a.finally,if the departmental appeals board does not conclude its review within days,id.d a,or within days if the appeal had been escalated past the alj level,d,the healthcare provider may seek judicial review in a united states district court,notwithstanding any requirements for a hearing for purposes of the party right to such judicial review,d b see also.
in sum,in order to exhaust the administrative process for reimbursement of medicare services,a healthcare provider must present the claim in the first instance to a medicare administrative contractor and thereafter engage the process of review and appeal set forth in.while the statute imposes deadlines for completion at each step of the process,it also anticipates that the deadlines may not be met and thus gives the healthcare provider the option of bypassing each step and escalating the claim to the next level,ultimately reaching judicial review by a united states district court within a relatively prompt time.
the order that cape fear health system seeks would have the judiciary enforce an isolated deadline and thereby impose a process not contemplated by the medicare act indeed,in conflict with it.instead of having a delayed claim continue by escalation through the steps of the administrative process and ultimately to the courts,the hospital system would have a court order the secretary to address its claims without escalation,to the detriment of all other appeals then pending.the prec
