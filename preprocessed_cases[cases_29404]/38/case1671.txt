labor code section provides that when a public safety officer like each plaintiff here is disabled,whether temporarily or permanently,by injury or illness arising out of and in the course of his or her duties,he or she shall become entitled,to a leave of absence while so disabled without loss of salary emphasis added.the statute is part of the workers compensation law.its purpose is to provide special benefits to police,sheriffs,and firemen.the reason for such exceptional treatment for policemen and firemen is obvious not only are their occupations particularly hazardous,but they undertake these hazards on behalf of the public.the legislature undoubtedly sought to ensure that policemen and firemen would not be deterred from zealous performance of their mission of protecting the public by fear of loss of livelihood.biggers workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.
the principle question in this case is whether los angeles county policies concerning payment for excess accumulated vacation hours violate section.this is the problem normally,a deputy sheriff who has accumulated more than hours of vacation time may defer the hours in excess of to the following year.if the excess hours are not used by the end of that year,in reliance on the los angeles county code county code the county pays the deputy for the hours.if this cash out payment takes place during the deputy final compensation measurement period the period used to determine salary for purposes of retirement benefits,the cash out payment is pensionable income.it is reported to the los angeles county employees retirement association and is part of the calculation of the deputy salary for purposes of retirement benefits.ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th,d.such a cash out payment will effectively increase the deputy retirement benefit for years to come.
however,a deputy who retires in the year following a leave,that is,the year following a injury,is compensated for the excess hours differently the county will not cash out deferred excess hours if the deputy is on leave at any time during the deferral year.the hours remain in the deputy account los angeles county professional peace officers assn th,d,but if the deputy retires in the year following leave,he or she will never have the opportunity to cash out or use the hours.that deputy is compensated for the hours at retirement.under established law,that payment is not pensionable income.in re retirement cases th,d.it is not reported to the los angeles county retirement association and does not become part of the pension calculation.
this means that,for example,a deputy who has accumulated excess vacation hours,but who has never been injured on duty,might collect more in retirement benefits than a deputy who has been injured on duty,even if the two have the same employment history in terms of rank,years of experience,and so on.it also means that a deputy who retires after taking leave due to a injury,perhaps a ski accident,might collect more than a deputy who retires after having suffered an injury in the course of his or her duties,even if the deputies are in other respects identical.
plaintiffs theory is that this different treatment violates section.the trial court agreed,as do we.
facts and trial court proceedings 
the individual plaintiffs in this case are retired deputy sheriffs who were on leave in the year prior to retirement,and who were paid for their deferred excess vacation hours at retirement.as noted,those payments did not become part of calculation of salary for purposes of retirement,and the plaintiffs retirement benefits are thus lower than they would have been if the hours had been cashed out.they and the los angeles county professional peace officers association filed this action for declaratory relief,challenging the county policy which denies employees on leave the cash out option.the complaint sought a declaration that the county policy violated sections and which prohibits discrimination against disabled employees and constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the law,and impaired the employees rights under their employment contract.
the trial court found for the plaintiffs on all theories,declaring that the county policy violated section and the declared policy of the state of california set out in section,denied plaintiffs equal protection of law under the federal constitution,and unconstitutionally impaired plaintiffs vested contractual rights.the court ordered the county to report to the los angeles county employees retirement systems,as pensionable income,the amounts which should have been paid to plaintiffs in a at the end of the deferral year.
we affirm the judgment on the ground that the county policy violated the labor code,and thus need not,and do not,address the county challenges to the trial court findings on equal protection and contract theories.
discussion 
section prohibits discrimination in salary.salary includes sick pay and other fringe benefits which accrue incident to the employee service and to which the employee is entitled.mannetter county of marin d.los angeles county professional peace officers,supra,th at,d.
the county principle argument on appeal is that the right to cash out deferred excess vacation hours does not constitute salary under section.it relies on mannetter county of marin,supra,d.and on professional peace officers,supra,th,d.
in mannetter,a deputy sheriff who could not work an assigned holiday shift due to a injury was paid his regular salary for the day,but not the higher rate applicable if a deputy was required to work on a holiday.he claimed a section violation,but the court found none.the court held that the employee had not been required to work on the holiday,and that to hold otherwise would mean that an employee could argue that during the leave of absence he would have received a promotion and raise and since the industrial accident proximately caused him to lose this employment opportunity,he should also be indemnified for this loss.although there is a strong public policy to indemnify fully an employee for loss resulting from an industrial injury,this policy does not include indemnification for benefits that an employee might have received as a condition of employment during the period of time he was on a leave of absence.id.at.see also fenn workers comp.appeals bd.th,d overtime pay mandated by federal fair labor standards act not salary for purposes of section.
the county argument under mannetter is that plaintiffs case is based upon the assumption that if they were not on pay,they might have worked the entire calendar year before they retired without either using or being ordered to use excess,deferred vacation pay.
first,at trial,the county stipulated that it would not assert that it would have implemented any policy or established practice of forcing all employees in the positions or assignments occupied by the individual plaintiffs to use excess vacation prior to the end of the deferral year.
moreover,mannetter supports plaintiffs position,not the county.the case held that the word salary as used in section includes fringe benefits which accrue incident to the employee service and which require nothing more of the employee than his being or remaining an employee in the service of the employer.mannetter,supra,d at.the overtime or holiday pay at issue in mannetter and fenn required the employees work at specified times or a certain number of hours,that is,to do something more than remain an employee.the right to cash out deferred overtime hours does not.it is available to all employees other than those who retire after leave.under the distinction drawn in mannetter,it is plaintiffs who prevail.
professional peace officers assn also supports plaintiffs position,not the county.that case applied mannetter to the same statutes,county code sections,and county policies at issue here.plaintiffs in that case were investigators for the district attorney office.like these plaintiffs,they took leave and retired in the next year.like these plaintiffs,they claimed that the county policy violated section.
however,the facts of that case were different in one
