debra vester applied for supplemental social security income under title xvi of the social security act on september,claiming that she was unable to work due to her physical and mental impairments.after an initial denial,a hearing was held in,and an adverse decision issued in.in,the appeals council of the social security administration denied her request for review,but when vester sought judicial review,the district court remanded the case for further consideration.in,a second administrative hearing was held,and an administrative law judge alj once again denied her claim.in,a second district court decision remanded her claim for further consideration.a third hearing was held on june,and a third alj decision denying her application was issued on october.on february,the appeals council declined to review the alj decision,and on march,the district court affirmed the commissioner denial of benefits.vester now appeals,and we affirm.
an alj pursues a familiar inquiry in determining whether a claimant is disabled.see.in order to qualify for benefits,the claimant must demonstrate that she suffers from a severe impairment,lasting for at least twelve continuous months,and that the impairment prevents her from performing substantial gainful work.if such an impairment exists,the alj must determine whether the claimant has demonstrated that she is unable to perform either her past relevant work,or any other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.
in the most recent decision denying vester application for benefits,the alj followed this process and determined that vester did suffer from a combination of impairments that was severe for purposes of the social security act.although he found that vester claims regarding her limitations were not totally credible,the alj concluded that when all of her impairments were considered,her limitations significantly compromised her range of work.
however,in vester case,the alj duty was complicated by her long history of drug and alcohol abuse.under amendments to the social security act,if alcohol or drug abuse is a contributing factor material to the commissioner determination of a disability,the claimant is not entitled to benefits.d c.in the determination whether the substance abuse is material,the claimant has the burden of demonstrating that she would still be disabled if she were to stop using drugs or alcohol.b pettit apfel,cir.
in considering vester claimed disability,the alj determined that,absent alcohol abuse,she had the ability to perform light work,except that she was unable to stand or walk for more than four hours out of an work period or more than one hour without interruption,or to sit for more than six hours out of an period or two hours without interruption.the alj also found that,outside of her problems with alcohol,she had a limited but satisfactory ability to deal with the public,use judgment,maintain attention and concentration,relate predictably,behave in an emotionally stable manner,and understand,remember,and carry out detailed job instructions,but a poor ability to understand,remember,and carry out complex job instructions.based on these findings,the alj concluded that vester was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.
on appeal,vester does not take issue with the alj findings with respect to her physical ailments,but argues only that the alj erred in determining that alcohol was a contributing factor material to her disability.we review the district court decision to uphold the denial of social security benefits de novo,and consider,as the district court did,whether the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.harris barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable person would find adequate to support the alj determination.sultan barnhart,cir.in evaluating whether the alj decision meets this standard,we consider all of the evidence that was before the alj,but we do not the evidence,and we defer to the alj determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses so long as such determinations are supported by good reasons and substantial evidence.guilliams barnhart,cir.
vester argues that her alcoholism is not a contributing factor material to her claimed disability.as vester pointed out to the alj and in her argument before this court,there is evidence to support her assertion that she has suffered,at times,from mental illness.as early as,she began seeing penny wenczel,a licensed certified social worker,for therapy to treat recurrent moderate depression.at.in,eliot cole,diagnosed vester with bipolar disorder and major depression,along with a probable personality disorder,placing her global assessment of functioning level at to on a scale of to.the commissioner doctor,gene reid,examined vester on february,and diagnosed her with bipolar disorder although in remission,alcohol dependence,and personality disorder.in,terry sutterfield,treated vester and echoed the diagnoses of depression and probable personality disorder.in addition,at several points between and,vester sought therapy from joan shepard,a licensed professional counselor.
at the same time,much of vester medical history suggests that alcohol has been a substantial barrier to her normal functioning.after showing up intoxicated for an appointment in,she went through a period of sobriety during which she was doing quite well and had no need for medication.at.the sobriety was,however notes from her therapy with joan shepard are replete with references to vester use of alcohol.at.the same doctors who diagnosed her with depression also noted her alcohol dependence at,and at her hearing,vester testified that she had only been sober periodically.at.while vester testified that her last ten years included a streak of sobriety as long as three years at,she also sustained two convictions for driving while intoxicated during that period.at 
in urging that we reverse the commissioner findings,vester points to elements of the record that she says support her claim that she is disabled independent of her alcoholism.a letter from joan shepard,the counselor who treated vester,asserted that alcoholism has been vester way of self medicating her underlying problems and that her need for benefits is based on the mental health issues.at.the alj did not credit this letter.noting that shepard has no medical degree and did not qualify as a medical source under the regulations,he nonetheless considered the opinion and shepard clinical notes,but found the notes to be unsupportive of the letter content.as the alj noted,shepard had seen vester only sporadically and never for more than a year continuously.moreover,notes from another therapist at shepard clinic indicated that vester need ed to be in treatment for alcohol depend ence before any other treatment,at,a conclusion that is consistent with the alj determination that vester alcoholism was a material factor contributing to her disability.
vester counters that shepard letter was by a psychiatrist,pearce,and should therefore be credited as a medical opinion.other than pearce signature on the letter,however,vester points to no medical records or other evidence indicating his involvement in vester treatment,and we find no reason to require that the alj credit the letter as the opinion of a treating psychiatrist.in addition,some of the alj reasons for discrediting the irregularity of her visits with extend to pearce,who was employed by the same clinic as shepard and would not have seen vester any more frequently than shepard.we believe that the alj properly considered the letter and gave good and adequate reasons for his decision not to give the opinion substantial weight.
vester general attacks on the alj findings that she was functioning normally while sober also fail.while it is true that d etermining whether a claimant would still be disabled if he or she stopped drinking is,of course,simpler if the claimant actually has stopped,pettit,at,in this case vester had been sober only five months at the time of her hearing before the alj,and she admitted that her sobriety was periodic.nonetheless,there is some evidence
