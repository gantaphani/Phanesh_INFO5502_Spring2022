we have for review a decision of a district court of appeal on the following question,which the court certified to be of great public importance 
does the exception from medicaid coverage for medically necessary abortions violate the express right of privacy found in article i,section of the florida constitution 
renee state agency for health care administration,so d,dca.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons expressed below,we answer the certified question in the negative.
this case involves a class action suit filed in march of on behalf of 
all women in the state of florida who are,have been,or will be during the pendency of the litigation pregnant and medicaid eligible have decided or will decide,in consultation with their physicians,to have abortions are,have been,or will be denied medicaid coverage for abortions and related procedures.
the plaintiffs are three women,seven reproductive health clinics that provide abortions,two physicians,and a nonprofit organization that provides financial aid to women who can not afford abortions.the petitioners sought declaratory relief based on challenges to three rules of the agency for health care administration ahca rules a a b and.admin.code.the rules exclude medically necessary abortions from medicaid coverage,except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother or is the result of rape or incest.the petitioners argue that the rules violate the privacy clause of the florida constitution.
the petitioners in this case consist of women who allegedly need medically necessary abortions but were denied funding under the current scheme.barbara hunter has grave disease which requires treatment.this treatment,however,would harm the fetus,so hunter had to stop treatment during the duration of her pregnancy.renee pregnancy caused her to hemorrhage and have high blood sugar.diabetes runs in her family.she was advised to confine herself to home,keep off her feet,and change her diet.in addition to these two examples,the petitioners cite to a number of other causes of potential medically necessary abortions which are not covered hiv,aids,diabetes,lupus,renal disease,sickle cell anemia,congenital heart disease,or fetal anomalies.all of the named petitioners in this case ultimately received abortions with funds.
the petitioners originally filed their complaint in the fifteenth circuit court of palm beach county in.the petitioners sought a declaration that the regulations were unconstitutional,a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the regulations,and reimbursement to the women and providers for medically necessary abortions performed during the pendency of this suit.the trial court certified the class in and transferred the case to the second circuit court in leon county in.both the petitioners and ahca filed motions for summary judgment.in,the trial court denied the petitioners motion and granted ahca motion,ruling that the challenged rules did not violate the privacy or equal protection clauses.after receiving the case on appeal,the first district court of appeal certified the case as one of great public importance requiring immediate resolution by this court.however,this court declined jurisdiction and remanded the case back to the district court.on remand,the first district court of appeal affirmed the trial court order and certified the question above.
we begin our analysis by looking at the framework of the medicaid program in this country and in florida.in,congress established the federal medicaid program when it enacted title xix of the social security act.see.medicaid is a joint program designed to provide medical care to the poor.although states develop individual plans for implementing medicaid,the federal government requires that states provide certain mandatory categories of services and permits the states to provide additional optional services.after states have paid for medical services,the federal government reimburses the states for a portion of those costs.
in,congress passed the hyde amendment,which restricts the availability of federal funds for abortions.see,stat.although there have been several variations,some initial versions of the hyde amendment only permitted federal funds to be used for abortions if the procedure was necessary to save a woman life.however,a subsequent version of the hyde amendment expanded federal funding to include abortions for victims of rape and incest.see,stat.in harris mcrae,the united states supreme court concluded that the hyde amendment did not violate either the equal protection clause or the right of privacy found in the due process clause of the federal constitution.
the medicaid program in florida is administered by ahca.see.stat.section provides that state medicaid payments shall be made,subject to any limitations or directions provided for in the general appropriations act,only for services included in the program,shall be made only on behalf of eligible individuals,and shall be made only to qualified providers in accordance with federal requirements for title xix of the social security act and the provisions of state law.sections and only permit payments for services which are either required or optional under the federal program.pursuant to the hyde amendment,the abortions sought by the petitioners in this case are neither required nor optional under the federal program.section gives ahca the authority to establish rules for reimbursement in accordance with state and federal law.
in harris mcrae,the supreme court pointed out that the hyde amendment does not place a limit on state funds and therefore states can choose to fund other procedures,including abortions,beyond those procedures that are funded by the hyde amendment.see at.hence,the focus of the present case is whether ahca rules violate the florida constitution.
the petitioners argue that medicaid generally provides reimbursement for all medical services that are rendered to eligible individuals and medically necessary.they assert that for no other service does florida require that a patient condition be or caused by a crime.in contrast,ahca argues that medicaid does not pay for all medically necessary procedures.ahca points to certain organ transplants as examples.
in winfield division of wagering,so d,this court stated the following regarding florida right of privacy 
the citizens of florida opted for more protection from governmental intrusion when they approved article i,section,of the florida constitution.this amendment is an independent,freestanding constitutional provision which declares the fundamental right to privacy.article i,section,was intentionally phrased in strong terms.the drafters of the amendment rejected the use of the words unreasonable or unwarranted before the phrase governmental intrusion in order to make the privacy right as strong as possible.since the people of this state exercised their prerogative and enacted an amendment to the florida constitution which expressly and succinctly provides for a strong right of privacy not found in the united states constitution,it can only be concluded that the right is much broader in scope than that of the federal constitution.
id.at.we proceeded to state that the right of privacy is a fundamental right which demands the compelling state interest standard of scrutiny.that test shifts the burden of proof to the state to justify an intrusion on privacy,a burden which can only be met by demonstrating that the challenged regulation serves a compelling state interest and accomplishes its goal through the use of the least intrusive means.id.at.
the strict scrutiny standard,however,would only be necessary in the instant case if it is first determined that the challenged rules violate the petitioners right of privacy.in the order below,the trial court found no violation 
there is a big difference between a government making a decision not to fund the exercise of a constitutional right and doing something affirmatively to prohibit,restrict,or interfere with it.in both in re,so d,and state presidential women center,so d dca,the government affirmatively imposed some barrier or obstacle between a
