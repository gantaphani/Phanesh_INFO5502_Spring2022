plaintiffs lidia sneed and cheryl bell appeal a judgment in favor of defendants california department of social services and its director,rita saenz,together department after the court denied sneed and bell petitions for ordinary and administrative mandamus and request for declaratory relief.in those proceedings,sneed and bell challenged department interpretation and implementation of the maximum family grant mfg statute welf,as applied to their families ability to receive welfare cash assistance under the california work opportunity and responsibility to kids act calworks program stats ch.
in essence,the mfg statute denies an increase in the maximum aid cash payment,a dollar amount that ordinarily correlates with family size,if additional children are born to a family that has been on welfare for the previous months,subd.a.sneed and bell contend the court should have granted mandamus and declaratory relief because department regulations interpreting the mfg statute sanction families like theirs,who have additional children while on welfare but who also have nonwelfare income to support these additional children.specifically,they assert department flawed interpretation of the mfg statute is inconsistent with the statute plain language,statutory context and the stated purpose of california welfare program greatly expands the scope of the penalty of the mfg statute and incorrectly reduces the cash grant for many poor families with their own nonwelfare income.
the mfg statute also provides that child support must be paid to the family and is not considered deductible income in calculating the amount of the cash grant,subd.e.department regulations include as child support a noncustodial parent social security benefits paid on behalf of a child.bell contends department violated federal law by deducting her children social security benefits from the family cash grant without considering the children needs.bell and sneed further contend department interpretation of child support as support only from a noncustodial parent violates their constitutional rights to privacy and equal protection.
we conclude department correctly interpreted and implemented the mfg statute with respect to the welfare cash assistance to which sneed and bell were entitled.adequate support for all of the needy children of california working poor is a matter of priority indeed,california spent most of the last decade experimenting with welfare reform under a series of federal aid to families with dependent children afdc program waivers to try to break the cycle of welfare dependency and ensure economic security and for california families.the culmination of california efforts was the passage in of comprehensive welfare reform,including the creation and implementation of the calworks program.we find nothing in the language of the applicable statutes,properly interpreted,nor any indicia of legislative intent,suggesting cash aid grants to families with mfg children are to be calculated under calworks using the methodology employed under the repealed afdc program.the california legislature has addressed the cash assistance needs of california working poor done so in the context of welfare reform designed to insure the long term economic viability of the family unit.any claim that the calculation of the cash aid component of public assistance denies california mfg children adequate support must be directed to that body,not this court.accordingly,we affirm the judgment 
background of calworks and mfg rule 
for many years,the federal afdc program provided cash assistance to poor families,as in effect before,see california homeless housing coalition anderson th,d.states could not impose eligibility requirements or calculate welfare grants in a manner inconsistent with afdc without risking loss of federal funding.to implement experimental provisions,states were required to seek federal waivers.a.
when california began welfare reform efforts in,the afdc grant structure arguably was a disincentive to increasing the amount of a welfare recipient income from activities.the grant calculation methodology required subtracting the maximum aid payment map,as provided in section,subdivision a,from the minimum basic standard of adequate care mbsac,an amount used to establish a family eligibility for welfare benefits.under afdc,the mbsac and map amounts were federally mandated and were the same dollar amount for families composed of an equal number of needy individuals.under the afdc cash grant calculation methodology,as family income increased,the welfare cash grant decreased dollar for dollar 
in california created a work incentive for welfare recipients of afdc,under federal waiver,by increasing the difference between the mbsac and map each year between and.this allowed families to keep more of their earnings before their welfare cash grant declined.under the federal waiver,still in effect in when the mfg statute was enacted,the grant was the difference between the map and the mbsac minus nonexempt or disregarded income 
in the legislature enacted section,the mfg statute,which was intended to promote personal responsibility of welfare recipients by discouraging growth in family size while they received public assistance and by encouraging them,through work incentives,to support their families and thereby eliminate their dependence on welfare.the mfg statute freezes a family maximum welfare cash benefit at the same level if additional children referred to as mfg children are born to a family that has been on welfare for the previous months thus,under the mfg statute,the map,a dollar amount that ordinarily increases with family size,does not increase when an mfg child is born,subd.a.although mfg children are not included in the assistance unit for purposes of determining the map,they are aid recipients for all other purposes the mfg statute refers to the map dollar amounts as set forth in section,subdivision a.
the mfg statute further provides that percent of any child support payment received for an mfg child shall be paid to the assistance unit.the child support payment is not considered deductible income to the family for purposes of calculating the amount of cash aid for which the family is eligible,subd.e.
in congress enacted the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act,commonly known as the welfare reform act,stat.see also arenas san diego county bd.of supervisors th,d arenas.under the welfare reform act,a program entitled temporary aid to needy families tanf provided states with block funding to distribute to needy families as each state saw fit.arenas,at,d et tanf replaced the federally funded afdc program.arenas,at,d.under tanf,eligible state plans must limit the receipt of aid to a specified number of months and must include certain elements such as requiring aid recipients to engage in specified work activities.additionally,tanf requires the state to provide services relating to establishing or enforcing child support obligations with respect to each child receiving assistance.
in,as part of a comprehensive review and overhaul of its welfare system,california created calworks through which it administers tanf block grants.stats,ch,legis.counsel,assem.bill reg.sess.welf,et arenas,supra,th at,d.department is charged with administering calworks.see also fry saenz th,d.like the former afdc program,calworks provides cash grants to families with minor children who meet certain requirements,including limited income and resources,and are deprived of the support of one or both parents due to factors such as absence,disability or unemployment,subds.a c sheyko saenz th,d.the legislature stated the purposes of calworks as follows 
the legislature finds and declares that the family unit is of fundamental importance to society in nurturing its members,passing on values,averting potential social problems,and providing the secure structure in which citizens live out their lives.each family unit has the right and responsibility to provide for its own economic security by full participation in the work force to the extent possible.each family has the right and responsibility to provide sufficient support and protection of its children,to raise them according to its values and to provide every opportunity for educational and social progress.
accordingly,e very county shall administer this chapter in such a manner as to achieve the greatest possible reduction of dependency and to promote the rehabilitation of recipients,italics added.
as part of calworks welfare reform,the legislature abandoned the mbsac as an element of the cash aid grant calculation.instead,a new grant calculation methodology was created,designed to motivate welfare recipients to increase their work efforts.under the new system,enacted in and still in effect,aid recipients who increase their work efforts and obtain greater employment income may retain more of the increased income before cash aid is affected consistent with this new methodology,certain language in section,subdivision a was amended to reflect that the mbsac would no longer be used to determine the amount of cash aid paid.in all other respects,the map language in section,subdivision a remained the same.as in the version,the map is used in the current cash aid calculation method,setting forth the maximum cash aid payment a family assistance unit can receive,subd.a.department implemented this legislation by adopting regulations in its manual of policy and procedures regs.see sheyko saenz,supra,th at,d.
factual and procedural background 
sneed has two children living with her,each of whom has a different father.when the second child was born in april,sneed had been on public assistance continuously for the previous months.thus,the second child was considered an mfg child under section.at the time,sneed was receiving a month in calworks benefits for herself and her first child,but was later removed from the grant because of ineligibility not relevant here.
in august,the father of the second child moved in with sneed and her two children,and he was added to the assistance unit.department included his estimated income unemployment insurance benefits in the computation of the grant amount payable to the sneed family.in calculating the grant amount,department used the map amount for a family,consisting of the second child father and sneed other child.
in an administrative proceeding,sneed challenged department computation of the grant amount,claiming department should have used the family map for a family,consisting of the second child,that child father and sneed other child,to calculate the grant amount,with the map serving only as a cap on the actual grant.under this calculation,an additional per month would have been allocated to this family.the administrative law judge proposed decision found in favor of sneed,but department declined to adopt that decision and issued an alternate decision denying sneed claim.
bell,who is employed,is married to the father of her three children.bell had been on public assistance continuously for months when her two youngest children,twins,were born in september.thus,they are mfg children.because bell husband is disabled and receives social security benefits,he is not included in the assistance unit for calworks.the mfg twins and bell other child receive social security benefits based on their father disability.
in calculating bell benefits,department treated the mfg twins social security disability income as nonexempt income to the assistance unit.accordingly,it made certain deductions from earned income,not relevant here,and then added the three children social security benefits to determine total income counted against the cash aid payment.department then subtracted this amount from the map for a family of two,consisting of bell and her first child.the map was initially per month and later increased to per month.
in an administrative hearing,bell challenged department calculations,arguing the needs of the mfg twins should be considered in the family map calculation the mfg twins social security disability benefits are not available income to the assistance unit because those benefits must be used exclusively for the mfg twins and the mfg twins social security benefits are in the nature of child support and should be exempt income.under bell calculation,the family would have received an additional per month had the mfg twins been included in the family map.had the mfg twins social security benefits of been considered,the grant amount would have increased to per month.
the administrative law judge upheld department calculation.in reviewing the administrative proceeding,department concluded bell benefits were properly calculated and denied her claim 
sneed and bell petitioned the superior court for writs of ordinary mandamus under code of civil procedure section and administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section,and further sought declaratory relief.after finding review was appropriate only by administrative mandamus,the court denied the petition and entered judgment in favor of department.

the mfg statute 
sneed and bell contend department erroneous interpretation of the mfg statute,sanctioned by the trial court,ignores the needs of the mfg child while taking full advantage of the family nonwelfare income to reduce the cash aid payment to the family.they argue that under a proper interpretation of the mfg statute,the map set forth in section,subdivision a provides only a cap on a potential grant amount,not the actual grant amount.they seek a calculation methodology similar but not identical to the one used under the map statute former,subd.a that included the mfg child in the assistance unit when determining the dollar starting point for calculating the cash grant.using this methodology would result in a greater cash grant because the mfg child would be counted in the assistance unit.
the mfg statute refers to the map,not to the methodology of grant calculation 
before resorting to extrinsic sources for construing the mfg statute,we examine the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.day,supra,cal th at,d.the mfg statute,unchanged since its enactment in,provides for purposes of determining the maximum aid payment map specified in subdivision a of section and for no other purpose,the number of needy persons in the same family shall not be increased for any mfg child,subd.a,italics added.the mfg statute refers only to the maximum aid payment a family assistance unit can receive,a dollar amount that varies according to the number of needy persons in the home,as set forth in the table in section,subdivision a the mfg statute does not refer to the actual amount of aid paid or to any particular methodology for computing grant amounts,subd.a.nothing in the mfg statute limits,controls or directs the manner in which the map dollar amount is to be used to calculate the family calworks grant.thus,contrary to sneed and bell position,the mfg statute reference to subdivision a of section does not require any particular cash aid calculation methodology,including one that is a starting point or that sets only a cap on a potential grant amount.
consistent with the language of the mfg statute and its reference to section,subdivision a,department regulations provide that an mfg child shall not be included in the assistance unit size for the purpose of determining the map.just as in the mfg statute,the regulations exclude an mfg child from the number of needy persons in the map table of section,subdivision a,and the mfg child family is not entitled to a higher map nor to a greater cash payment after that child birth.
sneed and bell argue this interpretation is inconsistent with the statutory language and for no other purpose,subd.a.they suggest this limiting language means the mfg child is a needy person in the family for every purpose other than computing the map,including the mbsac cash aid calculation referred to in the version of section,subdivision a.however,giving the words of the statute their usual and ordinary meaning in the context of the mfg statute,the limiting language and for no other purpose excludes the mfg child from the number of needy persons only when determining the map as set forth in section,subdivision a.having been excluded for that purpose only,the mfg child remains in the assistance unit and receives other calworks aid,including food stamps and benefits.similarly,department regulations clarify an mfg child is eligible for and a recipient of aid including special needs.in this regard,the mfg statute does not deny benefits to an mfg child.
although we agree with sneed and bell that an mfg child is added to the assistance unit for purposes other than determining the map,we disagree that the language and for no other purpose means the mfg child is included in the calculation of the actual cash aid payment.such an interpretation would nullify the mfg statute by increasing cash benefits for families with mfg children by including the mfg children in the cash aid calculation when the mfg statute expressly excludes them for this purpose.moreover,the interpretation sneed and bell urge is inconsistent with the manifest purpose of the mfg statute under calworks to promote personal responsibility and encourage increased work efforts with a goal of eliminating a family dependence on public assistance.
the palermo rule of statutory construction 
citing a rule of statutory construction applied in palermo stockton theatres,cal d,palermo,sneed and bell contend the mfg statute must be interpreted to incorporate the map statute,subd.a as the map statute read in when the mfg statute was enacted,rather than as the map statute currently reads.they assert that under the prior version of the map statute,the mfg child must be added to the assistance unit for purposes of calculating the grant amount based on the difference between the mbsac and the map.
as we previously discussed,the mfg statute does not refer to or control the methodology of grant calculations,but instead refers only to the dollar amount of the map as set forth in section,subdivision a.the map table of dollar amounts is the same in both the and versions of the statute.thus,applying the version of section,subdivision a does not advance sneed and bell argument.even were we to construe the statute in the manner suggested by sneed and bell,the rule of statutory construction in palermo does not entitle them to the calculation they seek.
in palermo,supra,cal d at pages,the plaintiff entered into a lease agreement,signed under the alien land act the act,with a japanese national.the act allowed such leases if they were made in accordance with any treaty now existing between the united states and japan.id.at.the plaintiff sought to invalidate the lease when the treaty with japan was abrogated.id.at.the issue before the court was whether the act should be interpreted as referring to the treaty as it existed when the act was adopted,or as referring to later modifications or repeals.the court held the lease was still valid because the act referred to the treaty as it existed when the act was passed,now existing,not as it was later modified or repealed.id.at.in so concluding,the court stated the following rule of statutory construction w here a statute adopts by specific reference the provisions of another statute,such provisions are incorporated in the form in which they exist at the time of the reference and not as subsequently modified,and the repeal of the provisions referred to does not affect the adopting statute,in the absence of a clearly expressed intention to the contrary.id.at,italics added.the supreme court later clarified the palermo rule by explaining moreover,where the words of an incorporating statute do not make clear whether it contemplates only a incorporation,the determining factor will be legislative intent citation.in re jovan cal th,d,see also people frawley th,d people pecci th,d people domagalski d.
here,unlike palermo,the mfg statute did not specifically adopt the map statute in a way.even were we to conclude the mfg statute is unclear in this regard,the historical context of welfare reform generally and the legislative intent behind the amendment to section,subdivision a show the legislature could not have reasonably intended to freeze the law regarding the calculation methodology for calworks cash aid payments by reference to the calculation methodology under a welfare program afdc no longer in existence.
in section,subdivision a provided in part aid shall be paid for each needy family in determining the amount of aid paid,the family income,exclusive of any amounts considered exempt shall be deducted from the sum specified in section section set forth a schedule for determining the mbsac based on the number of persons in the assistance unit,which then included the mfg child,subd.a.the mbsac was used at that time as the starting point for computing the actual cash grant for families with nonwelfare income.ibid.qualifying families would start with the mbsac amount set forth in section,subdivision a and exempt the amount of nonwelfare income that was the difference between the mbsac and the map,as well as other income disregards not relevant here,before the family income was counted against the cash grant.if the mbsac minus any nonwelfare income still exceeded the map,the map would be a cap on the grant amount,subd.a.
the version of section,subdivision a that sneed and bell seek to apply was in effect under the former afdc program when states were required to impose eligibility requirements and calculate welfare grants in a manner consistent with afdc in order to maintain federal funding.during this time,california was required to seek federal waivers to implement its experimental welfare reform provisions.the afdc program contained a complex calculation for determining the amount of earned income a parent on aid could disregard,such that those earnings would not be counted against the aid payment.health human serv,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.the primary intent of the former calculation method was to provide an incentive for adult recipients to obtain employment by allowing this disregard of a portion of their earnings.ibid.
in the california senate health and human services committee analyzed several amendments implementing tanf,the federal law that replaced afdc.the stated purpose of the amendments was welfare reform.health human serv,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.one such amendment was to the methodology for calculating the amount of cash aid paid as set forth in section,subdivision a as a means of encouraging calworks recipients to increase their work efforts and thereby increase the amount of income available to their families.health human serv,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
as amended,section,subdivision a provides in part in determining the amount of aid paid,and notwithstanding the minimum basic standards of adequate care mbsac specified in section,the family income,exclusive of any amounts considered exempt shall be deducted from the sum specified in the following table in no case shall the amount of aid paid for each month exceed the sum specified in the following table,as adjusted for increases plus any special needs italics added.
the italicized language reflects the legislative changes to section,subdivision a that establish a simplified income disregard.the intent of this change was to provide a greater,more advantageous work incentive,one that rewards additional work efforts and gives welfare recipients a better understanding of the impact that increased earnings have on the income of the family and the amount of the grant payment.assem.floor,conc.in,assem.bill reg.sess,as amended.whereas the former afdc program included smaller income disregards and a complex grant calculation method that allowed families to keep income up to the mbsac standard the new program method provides a direct correlation between a family increased work efforts and the ability to retain more of the increase in its income.this simplified grant calculation method was designed to create a greater incentive for welfare recipients to earn additional income and thus to assist families in becoming more quickly.in this regard,the amendment to section,subdivision a eliminating the reference to the mbsac and instead providing a different calculation methodology within the framework of calworks was a deliberate policy choice about how work affects the family unit financial viability.
we further note that at the time of california comprehensive welfare reform,the legislature reviewed various statutes adopted during the time the afdc program was in effect and either repealed,amended or continued those laws as part of the new calworks program.had the legislature intended to amend the mfg statute to specify a particular grant calculation methodology,it could have done so.
applying palermo rule of statutory construction,we conclude the legislature,by its use of the language notwithstanding the minimum basic standards of adequate care mbsac specified in section,clearly expressed its intent that the mfg statute incorporates the provisions of section,subdivision a in the form in which they were subsequently modified.the legislature is presumed to have meant what it said and the plain meaning of the language governs.people pecci,supra,th at,d.in the context of the overall legislative scheme of welfare reform to encourage increased work efforts and eventual,this clear language eliminates a calculation methodology based on the difference between the mbsac and the map that was appropriate only under the former afdc program when federal waivers were required to implement experimental programs for welfare reform.sneed and bell are not entitled to a lesser of the map and mbsac minus nonexempt or disregarded a program that no longer exists rather,mfg families like those of sneed and bell are subject to current grant calculation methods.
family map 
sneed and bell contend department regulations provide a framework for properly calculating their cash payments under a correct interpretation of the mfg statute by using a family map.they suggest department can use this process for calculating grants to mfg families by slightly modifying its regulations.
the concept of family map is not found in any statute and is separate and distinct from the map set forth in section,subdivision a.department regulations apply a family map in limited circumstances where the income of an individual not in the assistance unit is considered income to the assistance unit.the individual who is not in the assistance unit is deemed part of the assistance unit for determining the family map,usually because that individual has income that can be applied by law to the support of the aided person.family map was developed as part of calworks to simplify the way deeming had been used under afdc.
this limited application of a family map does not include mfg children.in deeming situations,the individual with income is not in the assistance unit.the mfg child is in the assistance unit for all purposes except the map.thus,no statutory or regulatory basis exists for using a family map in calculating grants for mfg families.
mfg rule applies to all welfare recipients 
sneed and bell contend the legislature did not intend the mfg statute to apply to families like theirs who have nonwelfare income to support their mfg children.they assert the purpose of the mfg rule was to sanction welfare recipients with no ties to the work force.
the mfg statute,by its terms,applies to all welfare recipients regardless of their employment or income status,when that family has received aid under calworks for the required number of months,subd.a.all applicants for assistance under calworks must be notified in writing of the provisions of the mfg rule,subd.f.as reflected in the history of california welfare reform and the legislature intent to promote personal responsibility and encourage families with an mfg child to increase their work effort to support that child,the mfg rule affects all aid recipients with earned income and those with no earned income.indeed,one of the stated goals of calworks was to encourage parents who do work to increase their work efforts to the point of.nothing in the statutory scheme supports the argument that only welfare beneficiaries with no earned income were the intended targets of the mfg statute.
conclusion 
the intent of the mfg statute and the broader calworks welfare reform provisions is the same to increase personal responsibility and encourage financial for families.the mfg statute furthers this purpose by not increasing the cash grant for an additional child born to a family on welfare for the previous months.at the same time,calworks provides increased education and training,greater work incentives and time limits on aid.calworks allows more generous income disregards for all calworks recipients,including mfg families,and replaced the mbsac work incentive with a more advantageous one that encourages mfg families to work by allowing them to retain more of their increased income to support the mfg child.this increased work incentive,unlike the former one based on the difference between the mbsac and the map,is more appropriate in a environment where achieving is imperative.
nothing in the statutory scheme or the legislative history of welfare reform shows the cash grants of mfg families must be calculated using the methodology under a welfare program afdc no longer in effect.at the time of the comprehensive calworks amendments,including the amendment to section,subdivision a,the legislature could have revised the mfg statute to specify a particular grant calculation methodology.because the legislature did not do so,the mfg statute must be read as freezing the map dollar amount at the level before the mfg child was born.
the legislative reform of the welfare system and the resulting implementation of the calworks program make clear the legislature intended the current version of section,subdivision a to apply to all grant calculations,including those for mfg families.this interpretation is consistent with the legislative goals of gradually reducing the cash grant,while allowing a family income to increase without being discounted,as the family works toward becoming.in this regard,the mfg child benefits by the total increase in family income.we conclude department properly calculated sneed and bell benefits under the mfg statute.
deducting bell mfg twins social security benefits from the family calworks grant 
bell contends department violated federal law by deducting the mfg twins social security benefits from the family calworks grant without considering the mfg twins needs.she asserts that department interpretation of the mfg statute prevents her,as the representative payee,from spending her mfg twins social security payments for their use and benefit as required by federal statute.
social security income 
under title ii of the social security act et,benefits are paid on behalf of a wage earner who pays into the social security system.such benefits are also paid on behalf of the wage earner dependents for purposes of providing support.jimenez weinberger,d.minor dependents receive their benefits through a representative payee,who by statute must spend the funds for the use and benefit of the child and in the child best interests.j a.use and benefit means for the current maintenance of the child.see washington state of social and health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,d a.
federal law under tanf authorizes each state to determine how the welfare benefit is calculated and what income to include in that calculation.california law requires social security benefits to be included in determining the calworks grant amount.nothing in calworks,or the mfg statute,conflicts with the federal requirement that social security payments be spent for the use and benefit of the beneficiary.further,including social security payments in the grant calculation does not deprive mfg children of the use and benefit of those payments.department does not mandate how the benefits must be spent and bell must still use them for the current maintenance of the mfg twins.
social security must be included in grant calculation 
bell asserts federal law prohibits using social security payments in the grant calculation because congress intended to protect such government benefits from being diluted by offsetting them against benefits from other sources.in support of this assertion,bell cites rose arkansas state police,d and raskin moran cir.however,in those cases,a federal statute expressly provided that the government benefits at issue could not be used to reduce other benefit payments.here,in contrast,there is no federal statute showing congress intended social security benefits to be protected from a welfare grant calculation offset california law requires that income of all members of the assistance unit be included in determining the welfare benefit amount and mfg children are included in the assistance unit other than for purposes of map.thus,contrary to bell position,department interpretation of the mfg statute does not conflict with the fundamental purpose of the social security law to provide for workers dependents.
social security dependents benefits are not exempt as child support 
the mfg statute provides that child support paid for an mfg child must be paid to the family and is not considered deductible income in calculating the grant,subd.e.department regulations define title ii social security benefits as child support when the wage is absent from the home.bell contends the mfg twins social security benefits should be exempt from consideration as child support under the mfg statute,even when the disabled parent is not absent from the home.
definition of child support 
the mfg statute does not define child support.in the absence of a specific statutory definition,we look to other relevant sources and give the term its ordinary,generally accepted,usual and common sense meaning.fenn sherriff th,d schnyder state bd.of equalization th,d.when the technical legal meaning and the common meaning of the term coincide,we adhere to the common meaning unless there is some indication the legislature intended otherwise.sousa first california d.
child support,as used in a custody or marital dissolution action,is money legally owed by one parent to the other for the expenses incurred for children of the marriage.black law dict.ed.child support is defined in title of the california code of regulations as including payments by a noncustodial parent for a child maintenance by the custodial parent,tit.
the family code contains numerous references,including those in the calworks context,to child support as payments by a noncustodial parent to the custodial parent for the child support and maintenance.noncustodial parents are obligated to make payments to the local child support agency for children receiving aid under calworks.courts must order noncustodial parents to pay child support when custody is granted to a parent who is receiving or likely to receive public assistance.certain government benefits,including social security benefits,paid because of a noncustodial parent retirement or disability,are counted as child support,subd.b.
the mfg statute does not exempt the income of parents living with an mfg child.section expressly provides the income of parents living in the same home with an eligible child shall be considered available for purposes of eligibility determination and grant computation.had the legislature intended to exempt the income of an mfg child custodial parent for the purpose of calculating the grant payment,it would not have limited the income exemption in the mfg statute to child support where the and common meaning of that term is support by a noncustodial parent.
department definition of child support is consistent with the statutory,dictionary and common definition of that term requiring payment of support by a noncustodial parent.because the mfg twins social security income was paid on behalf of a custodial parent,not one absent from the home,that income could not be excluded as child support under the mfg statute.
definition of child support is consistent with legislative intent 
department definition of child support is also consistent with legislative intent.federal laws condition a state participation in the tanf program on the establishment and operation of child support enforcement systems.kansas cir.thus,in order to retain eligibility for federal funding of public assistance and child support enforcement programs,california is required to adhere to the statewide uniform child support guidelines,et in re marriage of laudeman th,d.the family code implements federal law requiring california to provide services for enforcing child support obligations with respect to each child for whom assistance is provided under calworks.
to receive calworks,a child must be deprived of a parent support.indeed,a noncustodial parent is one whose absence triggers a child eligibility for welfare benefits.see county of yolo worrell d.see also county of san diego lamb th,d section authorizes county to seek reimbursement from noncustodial or absent parent for welfare benefits paid on behalf of needy child.the custodial parent must assign child support payments to the county and state,up to the amount of welfare paid.child support collected from the noncustodial parent is then paid to the county welfare department,not to the custodial parent,to reimburse the governmental entity for welfare payments made to the family.the basis for child support assignment to the county welfare department is the receipt of aid by the custodial parent for the child for whom the support was paid.that basis does not exist for the mfg child because the assistance unit map does not increase for the mfg child.consequently,the mfg statute requires child support to be paid to the assistance unit without being considered as deductible income to the family for purposes of calculating the amount of cash aid payable to the family,subd.e.without this child support exemption,a parent receivin
