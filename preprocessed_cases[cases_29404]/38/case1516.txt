the court of federal claims held that the proceedings by which an army board recommended the involuntary retirement of certain army officers were constitutionally invalid because of instructions by the secretary of the army that the board give minority and female officers preferential treatment.the court further held that the harmless error concept was inapplicable in this case.the result of the latter ruling was that many white male officers who would not have been retained even if the board had not given preferential treatment to minority and female officers,nevertheless would be reinstated as of the date of their involuntary retirement and receive back pay to that date.the government here challenges only the court harmless error ruling.we reverse that ruling.
a.the facts forming the background of this suit,as found by the court of federal claims,christian united states,fed.cl,and as supplemented by the record,are undisputed.
in,the secretary of the army secretary convened a selective early retirement board retirement board,pursuant to,to recommend army lieutenant colonels for involuntary early retirement.the secretary issued lengthy detailed instructions to the board,which was told to select for early retirement a minimum of officers and an optimum of.the board reported that it recommended officers for early retirement.b ased on the guidance in the instructions,the retirement board was directed to determine which officers to recommend for selective early retirement by first determining an order of merit list of the officers considered.
one section of the instructions,captioned minority and female officers,included the following provisions 
a.the army is firmly committed to providing equal opportunity for minority and female officers in all facets of their career development,utilization,and progression.the goal for this board is to achieve a percent of minority and female officers recommended for early retirement not greater than the rate for all officers in the zone of consideration.this goal is important because,to the extent that each board achieves it,the army at large will have a clear perception of equal opportunity and the officers not recommended for early retirement will enjoy the opportunity for continued career progression to the benefit of the army.this goal is not intended as guidance for you to meet any quota.
b.in evaluating the records of minority and female officers,the board should consider that past personal and institutional discrimination may have disadvantaged minority and female officers.such discrimination may include,but certainly is not limited to,disproportionately lower evaluation reports,assignments of lesser importance or responsibility,and lack of opportunity to attend military schools.take these factors into consideration in evaluating these officers potential to make continued significant contributions to the army.
prior to recess,the board in the report of officers recommended for early retirement must review and report the extent to which minority and female officers were recommended at a rate greater than males and officers.
the instructions specified four phases of deliberation through which the retirement board should proceed.for phase two,in which it was to evaluate minority and female goal attainment,the following directive was included 
if there are adverse deviations in the minority or female selection rates overall or within a specific career field,the board will reevaluate and may revote the files of the minority and female officers keeping in mind the factors contained in paragraph of enclosure.after revoting an officer record,the relative standing will be adjusted.
the retirement board proceedings for early retirement involved lieutenant colonels.in making its recommendations,the retirement board followed the procedure,only the first two steps of which are relevant here.
in phase one,the retirement board reviewed and evaluated the officers records and based thereon established the comprehensive order of merit,as directed by the secretary instructions.in phase two,the retirement board determined the optimum number of officers to be recommended for early retirement and then applied that number to determine the dividing line on the order of merit list between those to be retained and those to be retired.
at the conclusion of the phase two determinations,the percentage of minority officers to be retired was greater than the overall retirement rate for all officers.the retirement board then reevaluated the records of the minority officers,and selected a number of them for retention.it recommended white male lieutenant colonels for early retirement,with retained and minority and female officers for early retirement,with retained.there may be some overlap within these categories.
in its report,the retirement board stated that in its initial determinations in phase one 
the board did not meet its minority selection goal.minority officers were selected for early retirement at a rate of percent in comparison to the overall selection rate of percent.upon completion of the board initial deliberations,it reevaluated minority officer files.the board identified some minority officers whose records warranted reconsideration to ensure they had not been disadvantaged by past personal or institutional bias.a revote was conducted resulting in a number of minority officers being selected for retention on active duty.
b.the appellee christian,a white lieutenant colonel who was involuntarily retired as a result of the retirement board proceedings,filed in the court of federal claims a class action complaint,seeking retroactive reinstatement and back pay.count iv of his first amended complaint alleged that,by imposing unlawful gender and racially classified retention goals and selection consideration factors,and unlawful,gender and racially classified remedies for the possible disadvantages of societal discrimination,the secretary and the retirement board violated plaintiff constitutional right to equal protection guaranteed under the due process clause of the fifth amendment of the united states constitution.
in its first opinion,the court of federal claims granted summary judgment for christian on his constitutional due process claim in count iv.christian,fed.cl.at.the court held that the secretary instruction to the retirement board created a race and goal and that it required consideration of different factors in evaluating minority and female officers than when evaluating white male officers,and that it therefore was subject to strict scrutiny,must serve a compelling governmental interest,and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.id.at citation omitted.the court concluded that the instructions did not meet those requirements,and that the army affirmative action program for the retirement board violates the due process clause of the fifth amendment.id.at.
the court also certified as the class for the action the male nonminority officers selected by the retirement board for retirement.id.at.
after further proceedings,the court issued a second opinion dealing with the remedy.christian united states,fed.cl.it ruled that all members of the class were entitled to reinstatement as of the date of their initial illegal discharge and back pay and other remedies from that date to the date of their proper discharge.id.at.the court rejected the government proposed harmless error analysis,under which the government proposed to establish a new selection board to determine which retired officers were harmed by the instructions,who would have been retained had the instructions not been given.id.at.instead,the court applied the constructive service doctrine,under which members of the military who have been improperly discharged are treated as having continued to serve until they are properly discharged they are therefore entitled to back pay and allowances for that period of constructive service.id.at.see,tippett united states.the court held that christian retirement was both involuntary and also legally improper,because the revote and the evaluation criteria in the instructions violated the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause.fed.cl.at.
the court certified the case for interlocutory appeal under d and this court authorized the government appeal.
a.the doctrine of harmless error is a settled principle of federal law.in the recent case of texas lesage,d,lesage contended that the university of texas,in denying him admission to a program,used a admissions program in violation of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.in seeking summary judgment,texas offer ed evidence that,even if the school admissions process had been completely colorblind,lesage would not have been admitted.id.at.the district court granted summary judgment for texas on this issue,but the fifth circuit reversed,viewing the question as whether the state violated lesage constitutional rights by rejecting his application in the course of operating a racially discriminatory admissions program.id.at.quoting lesage texas,cir.the supreme court summarily reversed.it stated 
insofar as the court of appeals held that summary judgment was inappropriate on lesage action seeking damages for the school rejection of his application for the academic year even if petitioners conclusively established that lesage would have been rejected under a policy,its decision is inconsistent with this court framework for analyzing such claims.under healthy city bd.of ed.doyle,d,even if the government has considered an impermissible criterion in making a decision adverse to the plaintiff,it can nonetheless defeat liability by demonstrating that it would have made the same decision absent the forbidden consideration.our previous decisions on this point have typically involved alleged retaliation for protected first amendment activity rather than racial discrimination,but that distinction is immaterial.the underlying principle is the same the government can avoid liability by proving that it would have made the same decision without the impermissible motive.
simply put,where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would have made the same decision regardless,there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under.
but where there is no allegation of an ongoing or imminent constitutional violation to support a claim for relief,the government conclusive demonstration that it would have made the same decision absent the alleged discrimination precludes any finding of liability.

initially,in this case,the burden was properly placed upon respondent to show that his conduct was constitutionally protected,and that this conduct was a substantial factor or to put it in other words,that it was a motivating factor in the board decision not to rehire him.respondent having carried that burden,however,the district court should have gone on to determine whether the board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent even in the absence of the protected conduct.

as these cases indicate,the supreme court has recognized that a harmless error analysis is appropriate even for constitutional claims.t he court has applied analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.arizona fulminante,d citations omitted.
indeed,the harmless error principle has been given statutory recognition in,which provides 
harmless error 
on the hearing of any appeal or writ of certiorari in any case,the court shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.
it also has been recognized in rule of the federal rules of civil procedure,and in rule a of the federal rules of criminal procedure.
this court and its predecessor court have applied the harmless error analysis to military back pay cases.see lindsay united states,sanders united states,skinner united states.to recover back pay,it is not enough for the plaintiff to show merely that an error or injustice was committed in the administrative process he must go further and either make a showing that the defect substantially affected the decision to separate him or relieve him from active duty,or at least he must set forth enough material to impel the court to direct a further inquiry into the nexus between the error or injustice and the adverse action.hary united states.if this burden is met,the of persuasion falls to the government to show,despite the plaintiff prima facie case,there was no substantial nexus or connection.engels united states.but see the discussion in part ii d,below.
under this authority,an officer can not prevail in a challenge to a discharge after if the government can demonstrate that,notwithstanding the error in the promotion proceedings,the officer still would not have been promoted.t he quintessential military promotion question is whether it is unlikely that he would have been promoted in any event.porter united states,citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
the present case is a classic instance for applying harmless error.the constitutional claim is that the white officers who were retired as a result of the retirement board proceedings were denied equal protection because of the instructions to the board to give minority and female officers preferential treatment.the total number of minority and female officers retained was.even if one were to assume that every one of those officers was retained solely because of an impermissible preference accorded minorities and most unlikely most that would mean that white officers who were retired should have been retained.
the total number of white officers actually retired,however,who comprise the plaintiff class,was more than.thus,even under the most extreme assumption only about of the white officers should have been retained.the court of federal claims,however,would treat the entire group as having been improperly retired and give all of them reinstatement and back pay.
the present case fits comfortably within the lesage standard.in lesage the court stated that even if the government has considered an impermissible criterion in making a decision adverse to the plaintiff,it can nonetheless defeat liability by demonstrating that it would have made the same decision absent the forbidden consideration.at.citation omitted.in the present case the government has demonstrated with respect to at least of the involuntarily retired male officers that it would have retired that number even without the impermissible instruction that favored minority and female officers.
the general rule is that damages for breach of contract shall place the wronged party in as good a position as it would have been in,had the breaching party fully performed its obligation.bay transp.auth.united states,citations omitted.a corollary of that principle is that the party is not entitled to be put in a better position by the recovery than if the other party had fully performed the contract.white delta constr.int l,citation omitted.applying those general rules of damages to the back pay claims in the present case,the applicable principle is that the retired white officers are entitled to be placed in the same position they would have been in if the retirement board had not considered the impermissible factors of race and gender in determining whom to recommend for involuntary early retirement,but not in a better position.healthy,at.e ven if the same decision would have been reached had the incident not occurred,t he constitutional principle at stake
