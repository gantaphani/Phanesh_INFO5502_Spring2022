background 
for years,cross worked as one of two high school guidance counselors at monett high school.at the beginning of the school year,the board hired debra williams as the other high school guidance counselor.williams and cross did not get along.their confrontations eventually turned physical,and each complained to the principal.
after serving as the assistant principal for years,david steward became the principal of monett high school in.on august,steward witnessed williams and cross engaged in a shouting match in the counselor office.steward had a meeting with each counselor individually.in the meetings,each counselor blamed the other for the altercation.steward scheduled four mediation sessions for each counselor.williams and cross attended three of the sessions together.after witnessing the ineffectiveness of the mediation and after being told by the mediator that cross had not demonstrated a willingness to cooperate,steward cancelled the fourth mediation session.
because mediation did not solve the problems between cross and williams,steward attempted to limit direct contact between them by ordering a division of the counseling duties.steward assigned students in grades and to williams and students in grades and to cross.because the confrontations continued,steward asked cross and williams to prepare time logs in increments for each day they were at school.again,the tension between the counselors persisted,culminating in another physical altercation on january.
based on his observations and the mediator comments,steward believed cross was at greater fault.on february,he issued cross a job target,a form of disciplinary action that in this case required cross to demonstrate positive interpersonal relations with educational staff and to be a cooperative partner in resolving the conflict between herself and miss williams.on that day cross became ill.she missed work on february and obtained a doctor release from work for february through february.on february,steward sent cross a letter concerning proper notification of medical absences.
sometime between february and february,cross contacted jeff stacy,a missouri state teachers association representative,to discuss the job target and the february letter.cross authorized stacy to inform the school district that she was considering retiring at the end of the school year,which he did during a telephone conversation with monett school district superintendent,charles cudney.on february,stacy and cross met with steward and cudney to discuss cross work situation.
before the february meeting,cross drafted an agenda for the meeting including such items as insurance coverage and procedure for informing office staff of the newly developed plan.cross wrote notes on this agenda during the meeting.below the title,she wrote plan is to retire at the end of this school.under insurance coverage,she wrote cobra law months coverage even if i leave the state under procedure for informing office staff of the newly developed plan,she wrote the end of the year communication and how i leave them is important.health reasons.during the meeting cudney told her notice of retirement,we drop the job target and the time log.before the meeting ended,cross agreed to submit a retirement letter to steward.after the meeting,cross did not prepare time logs and the job target was taken away.
between november,and march,cross received a considerable amount of information from the public school retirement system of missouri.this information included a calculation of her full retirement benefits,a calculation of her early retirement benefits,which indicated the cost to purchase credit to qualify for a modified benefit and documents concerning the possibility of disability retirement.between february and april,steward asked cross on two occasions whether she had prepared her letter of retirement.
on march,cudney sent the teaching staff contracts for the next school year and instructed the staff to return signed contracts by april.the contract contained provisions regarding pay rates,the first day of the school year,and the length of the school year.the board has long followed the practice of providing contracts early and setting an early deadline for their return.
by letter dated april,and addressed to the board,cross wrote the following 
this letter is to inform you that i will not be signing my contract for the school year.as of july,i plan to retire from the monett school system.
i have been in education for years,as counselor at monett high school.i regret that negative work conditions beyond my control have caused undue stress and affected my health to the point where i have had to come to the decision of early retirement.
it has been a pleasure to work with the students,faculty,staff,and parents of this community.i have thoroughly enjoyed my time here.i thank all of those who have touched my life while here in monett.i truly feel that my dedication and devotion to the district was.
shortly after cross submitted the above letter,steward met with her to thank her for her years of service and to tell her that he would delay posting the vacancy for the position of counselor until april,to give her time to tell her friends and family about her retirement.cross did not indicate during that meeting that her decision to retire was not final.
cudney told cross that her letter would be submitted to the board at the next meeting.the board held a meeting on april,in which it voted to approve two retirements,including cross retirement,two resignations,and several new hires.soon thereafter,steward advertised a position for high school guidance counselor.
by letter dated april,cross attempted to rescind her letter of retirement.on april,cross met with steward and cudney to discuss her attempted recision letter.cudney informed cross that her resignation had been accepted by the board at the april meeting and as a result it was a sealed deal.cudney told cross that she could apply for the position made available by her vacancy.cross applied for the position,but was not selected.
on may,cross counsel wrote the board demanding a hearing on the record with the monett school board regarding the basis for cudney and steward having terminated her indefinite contract.cross never received a hearing.instead,by letter dated may,the board denied her request,stating that i n reality,cross resigned her employment and the board had accepted her resignation.on june,after borrowing money to purchase a year of retirement eligibility,cross took early retirement.
cross filed suit in state court alleging constructive discharge,breach of contract under mtta,and violations of her right to a hearing under mapa and federal due process.the board removed the case to federal district court.cross moved for partial summary judgment on the breach of contract,mapa,and due process claims,and the board moved for summary judgment on all claims,asserting that cross voluntarily retired.
the district court granted the board motion for summary judgment.as to the breach of contract claim,the district court held that cross april,letter constituted an unambiguous notice of retirement that terminated her contract under,which provides that retirement terminates a tenured teacher indefinite contract.alternatively,the district court held that the board april,acceptance of the letter terminated her contract under,which provides that a tenured teacher contract may be terminated upon mutual consent of the parties.as to the constructive discharge claim,the district court held that cross had not alleged facts sufficient to show that her working conditions were so intolerable that she was forced to quit.finally,the district court held that because cross decision to retire was voluntary,the board did not need to afford her
