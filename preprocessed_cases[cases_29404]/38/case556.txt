clint smith,a year old man with an education,applied for disability insurance benefits,alleging that he can not work because he suffers from arthritis,back pain,an ulcer,liver cirrhosis,and hypertension.an administrative law judge alj concluded that smith did not have a disability as defined under the social security act,and that his skills and residual functional capacity allowed him to perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy,including that of a forklift operator.the appeals council denied smith request for review,and the district court affirmed.on appeal,smith now limiting his claim primarily to arthritis and hypertension argues that the alj made flawed credibility determinations,ignored evidence of his arthritis,and improperly credited the opinion of a consulting physician over that of his own treating physician.because the alj decision is not supported by substantial evidence,we reverse.
smith worked for years as a supervisor at a plating company,where he operated a conveyor belt,ran a forklift and completed reports.after he was laid off in,smith worked for the city of chicago for about three months in or while on public aid,and in he was awarded disability insurance benefits due to alcoholism.
after a amendment to the social security act eliminated alcoholism as a basis for obtaining disability insurance,see,the social security administration ssa notified smith that his benefits would cease in january unless he could show that he continued to be disabled and that his alcoholism was not a contributing factor to his disability.smith requested a review of the notification,claiming that he was unable to work because of arthritis throughout his body,a bad back,an ulcer,and cirrhosis of the liver.
according to the treatment notes of james baraglia,smith treating physician since,smith began in to complain of pain in his right ankle,left knee,shoulders and back.baraglia diagnosed arthritis.taken in indicated early degenerative disease and loose calcification in smith left knee and possible calcification or old trauma in his right ankle.a revealed no arthritic changes in smith left shoulder.no references to pain or arthritis appear to have been recorded between and,but in,osteoarthritis was noted under the problem list portion of baraglia progress notes for smith.baraglia prescribed for smith pain,noting that smith should avoid prescription nsaid nonsteroidal drugs used to relieve pain,stiffness,and inflammation because of previous gastrointestinal bleeding.most recently in november,the doctor prescribed medication for hypertension.
after smith requested a review of ssa notification that his benefits would cease,he was examined by sanjay bharti,a consultative physician,in august.bharti observed that smith had no limitation of movement except in his right ankle,which was slightly everted turned out.the doctor noted that smith walked on only half of his right foot,but he had a normal gait and could walk on his heels and toes.an revealed mild to moderate degenerative changes in his right ankle.the rest of smith joint movements,bharti observed,were normal,and he was able to do his daily living without much of a problem.bharti noted that smith could squat and touch his toes,and was able to put on his clothes relatively quickly.although smith indicated that he had back pain if he bent over,lifted anything over pounds,or if he sat or stood too long,bharti observed that smith had full range of motion in his back.he likewise noted normal strength and no sensory deficit to pinprick or touch.
also in august,state agency physician victoria dow assessed smith residual functional capacity based on bharti examination.dow opined that smith had mild degenerative joint disease osteoarthritis in his ankle and his range of motion was reduced in that area,but that his daily activities were not significantly restricted.she also opined that smith had probable degenerative joint disease in the lumbar area,but that he had a normal range of motion in his lower back.dow concluded that smith could occasionally lift carry up to pounds and frequently lift carry up to pounds,and that he could stand walk and sit with normal breaks about six hours in an workday.
four months later in december,baraglia completed an assessment of smith physical ability to do activities.baraglia estimated smith capabilities more conservatively than dow,opining that smith could occasionally lift only pounds because of arthritis in his shoulders and left elbow.further,baraglia opined that smith could not stand or walk at all in an eight hour workday,and only occasionally could climb,balance or stoop due to arthritis in his knees.baraglia also determined that smith had no sitting limitation,but limited smith abilities to reach,handle,push,and pull because of his arthritis.
two months later in february,baraglia completed another questionnaire as to smith physical residual functional capacity,this one opining that smith could not walk even one block without rest or severe pain.baraglia february assessment also opined that smith could occasionally lift and carry no more than pounds,and indicated that he could stand,walk and sit about four of eight hours intermittently,but no more than one hour at a time.baraglia also opined that smith could bend and twist only percent of the day,a significant decline from bharti observation that he had full range of motion in his back.
at a hearing before the alj in april,smith testified that he was unable to work because of arthritis,particularly in his shoulders and neck,and that his knee was shot.he told the alj that he has had an everted right ankle all his life.according to smith,he had severe pain or times a week at night when he was laying down,and took six a day to lessen the pain.he testified that he was taking medication for hypertension that controlled his high blood pressure most of the time,but he still became woozy about or times a week when he bent over.
smith told the alj that he could stand for to minutes at a time,and walk to blocks when he felt like it.he also was able to sit for to minutes before standing up to avoid getting stiff.smith testified that he could regularly lift to pounds with one hand and to pounds with both,but had problems lifting anything heavier than pounds.he told the alj that he lived alone in a apartment,and could bathe,feed and dress himself,do his own grocery shopping,do his laundry,cook and clean his apartment.
also at the hearing,a vocational expert ve testified about the number of jobs available for someone with smith skills and limitations.the ve testified that smith past work was heavy in physical demand and.in response to a hypothetical question posed by the alj,the ve explained that if smith had the limitations set forth in either of baraglia december or february assessments,he would be limited to sedentary work,and in view of his age,education,and past relevant work,there would be no transferability of his skills.the ve testified,however,that although dow assessment would not allow for past relevant work,it would allow for medium exertional work,and that smith had skills readily transferable to the position of forklift operator.
after applying the sequential process for evaluating if a claimant has met the burden of establishing disability,see,the alj concluded that smith was not disabled as defined in the social security act.the alj found that smith had not been gainfully employed since january.the alj next determined that smith had a severe inverted right foot,hypertension without evidence of damage,and mild hearing loss in the left ear however,he did not have an impairment or combination of impairments listed in or medically equal to one listed in pt,subpt.p,app.the alj further concluded that smith was unable to perform his past relevant work as a planing factory supervisor,but his residual functional capacity allowed him to perform medium work,except for lifting in excess of pounds occasionally and pounds frequently,or working in environments where he would be exposed to more than mild noise levels.the alj found that although his additional nonexertional limitations precluded smith from performing the full range of medium work,there were a significant number of jobs in the national economy that he could perform,notably that of a forklift operator.
in analyzing smith capacity to work,the alj discredited smith complaints of pain.the alj observed,for instance,that his claimed levels of pain and functional limitation were not borne out by the clinical signs and findings.the alj also noted inconsistencies within smith testimony as well as inconsistencies between his testimony and statements he made to bharti.the alj also discounted smith treating physician baraglia two assessments of smith capacity to work because they were mutually inconsistent and unsupported by the clinical signs and findings,and concluded that the doctor was leaning over backwards to favor his patient.
smith appealed the alj adverse decision.the appeals council denied smith request for review.smith then filed a complaint in the district court.after the parties filed for summary judgment,a magistrate judge,presiding with the parties consent,granted the commissioner motion and denied smith.the magistrate judge concluded that substantial evidence in the record supported the alj findings.
on appeal,smith confines his claimed disability to pain in his right ankle,knees,shoulders and elbow,as well as dizziness caused by hypertension.he argues that the alj decision is not supported by substantial evidence because the alj made flawed credibility determinations,erroneously made an independent medical determination that he did not suffer from arthritis,and failed to properly weigh the medical opinions pursuant to d.we agree.
because the appeals council found no basis for further review,the alj findings constitute the final decision of the commissioner of the ssa.see luna shalala,cir.we will affirm an alj decision only if it is supported by substantial evidence,which is evidence a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.see powers apfel,cir quoting diaz chater,cir.
we are troubled by the alj credibility findings in this case.the alj discounted the functional limitations set forth by smith treating physician,baraglia,because they were not based on persuasive or even reasonable evidence.in particular,the alj pointed out that baraglia failed to order to confirm the presence of arthritis.the failure to order,however,is not an appropriate basis to wholly discredit baraglia opinion.the alj disregarded evidence that as early as,had revealed that smith was experiencing the onset of degenerative disease in his knee.over the course of nearly ten years,this early degeneration would presumably have advanced,as of smith ankle taken in and had indicated.if the alj was concerned that the medical evidence was insufficient to determine whether smith was disabled,he should have ordered more recent.see.
although a claimant has the burden to prove disability,the alj has a duty to develop a full and fair record.see thompson sullivan,cir.failure to fulfill this obligation is good cause to remand for gathering of additional evidence.id.at.we fail to see how the alj could have properly assessed the extent of smith arthritis without more updated.given that the most current of smith knee were taken nearly ten years before the hearing and revealed the early stages of degenerative disease,it was incumbent upon the alj to order additional to ascertain the extent of the degeneration of smith knee.see id.at g iven that the last of the claimant spine were taken in december of,the alj duty to sufficiently develop the record by would suggest the need to order additional or other imaging tests to ascertain the extent of degeneration of the claimant back and neck.for the same reason,we disagree with the alj that the absence of objective clinical findings was a sufficient basis not to afford baraglia opinion controlling weight.see d.
smith also argues that the alj failed to explicitly consider the effect of his dizziness on his ability to work.by november,smith blood pressure had risen to such a degree that his doctor had prescribed medication.the alj found that smith suffered from hypertension without evidence of damage,yet never commented as to any less damaging but nonetheless significant effects of hypertension,if any,on smith suitability as a forklift operator.indeed,there is no indication that the ve ever considered dizziness as a possible impediment to safe operation of a forklift the alj inquired only as to smith employability in view of the functional limitation assessments provided by baraglia and dow.the alj failure to consider the evidence of dizziness alone precludes us from evaluat ing whether substantial evidence existed to support the alj finding,see herron shalala,cir remanding case where alj failed to consider evidence relating to claimant hand impairment,but we are also troubled by the alj failure to address the ve testimony that a forklift required frequent to constant use of his right ankle to operate the foot controls,in view of smith most recent indicating mild to moderate degeneration in that precise area.see defrancesco bowen,cir remand warranted where alj deemed claimant occasional confusion of brake with gas pedals due to numb feet only slight restriction on ability to work.an alj may not simply select and discuss only that evidence which favors his ultimate conclusion.see herron,at.rather,an alj decision must be based upon consideration of all the relevant evidence.id.accordingly,we reverse the district court decision granting summary judgment in favor of the commissioner and remand the case for further consideration consistent with this opinion.
in this appeal,we must consider whether the alj reasonably found smith capable of performing a significant number of jobs in the national economy at the medium exertional level and therefore not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.smith contends that the alj made flawed credibility determinations and improperly credited the opinion of a consulting physician over that of his treating physician.the majority agrees with smith and therefore reverses the decision to deny him benefits.because i believe that the alj decision is supported by substantial evidence,i respectfully dissent.
in my view,the majority opinion fails to give sufficient deference to the findings of the alj it is axiomatic that we will affirm the alj decision as long as it is supported by substantial evidence.see herron shalala,cir jones shalala,cir see also g requiring that t he findings of the commissioner of social security as to any fact,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.therefore,the question before this court is whether the alj findings were supported by substantial evidence.see books chater,cir diaz chater,cir.substantial evidence is defined as no more than such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.books,at quoting richardson perales,d.given the deferential standard of review,smith faces an uphill battle in his attempt to overturn an alj finding that he is not disabled.see defrancesco bowen,cir.although we review the entire record,we may not decide the facts anew,reweigh the evidence,or substitute our own judgment for that of the alj.herron,at.
substantial evidence supports the alj finding that smith was not credible in his pain complaints.at the beginning of the discussion,we must recall that the alj credibility determination is entitled to special deference because the alj is in the best position to see and hear the witnesses and assess their forthrightness.powers apfel,cir.accordingly,an alj credibility determination will not be disturbed unless the claimant can show that it was patently wrong.see diaz chater,cir.in this case,the alj based his credibility determination on a number of facts and observations.first,the alj concluded that the level of pain and functional limitations that smith complained of were not supported by the clinical signs and findings.see.although baraglia noted smith subjective complaints of pain since,his treatment notes did not contain objective medical data or record any functional limitations.moreover,bharti observed that smith had no limitation of strength or motion anywhere except his right ankle.although bharti noted that smith ankle was slightly everted and there was a restriction in flexion and extension at that joint,he also found that smith was still able to squat,touch his toes,walk normally and to perform his daily activities.see.
it is true that,under the regulatory scheme,an alj may not reject a claimant statements concerning the intensity or persistence of his symptoms solely because they are not fully supported by medical evidence.see c see also knight chater,cir.however,it is also true that an alj may consider the lack of medical evidence as probative of the claimant credibility.see powers,at the discrepancy between the degree of pain attested to by the witness and that suggested by the medical evidence is probative that the witness may be exaggerating her condition.clinical signs and laboratory findings are useful indicators of disability and can assist the alj in making reasonable conclusions about the intensity and persistence of the claimant symptoms and the effect those symptoms may have on the claimant ability to work.see c.
more importantly,the alj in this case did not base its decision on the absence of objective medical evidence alone.the alj also found numerous inconsistencies within smith testimony and inconsistencies between his testimony and the statements he made to bharti.for example,the alj noted that while the claimant first said that he can lift only pounds,he then admitted that he told the consulting physician that his symptoms only worsen when he lifts up to pounds.see.similarly,the alj was troubled by smith inconsistent testimony regarding his ability to stand and walk.see id.the alj was also disturbed by smith conflicting explanations for leaving his job.the alj noted that smith testified that he was laid off,but that he told the consulting physician he quit working because of problems associated with his arthritis.see id.in addition to these inconsistencies,the alj also observed that smith pain complaints were inconsistent with his minimal,treatment a day,his ability to perform his daily activities without much difficulty,and his appearance and demeanor at the hearing.see.based on the evidence of record,the alj determination that smith subjective complaints were less than credible was not patently wrong.see knight,at an alj may discount subjective complaints of pain that are inconsistent with the evidence as a whole.
likewise,the alj decision to credit the opinion of bharti over that of baraglia was supported by substantial evidence.title of the code of federal regulations,d,sets forth how an alj should weigh various medical opinions.under the regulation,opinions from treating sources are generally given great weight.see d.this policy is based upon the agency belief that treating physicians are likely to be the medical professionals most able to provide a detailed,longitudinal picture of the claimant medical impairment s.see id.accordingly,if the alj finds that the opinion of a treating physician is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the claimant case record,it will be given controlling weight.see id.but when the opinion of a treating physician is not supported by medical evidence and is inconsistent with the substantial evidence in the claimant record,the alj will not give the opinion controlling weight.see id.instead,the alj will determine independently the weight to give the opinion on the basis of the following factors the length,frequency,nature and extent of the treatment relationship the degree to which the medical signs and laboratory findings support the opinion the consistency of the opinion with the record as a whole and the specialization of the physician.see d.
in this case,the alj was not persuaded by smith description of his symptoms and limitations and found that baraglia opinion,which was largely based upon smith subjective complaints,was entitled to little weight.upon review of all the evidence in the record,the alj decided to credit the opinion of bharti,the consulting physician,over that of baraglia.the alj was entitled to make this determination.see reynolds bowen,cir w hile the treating physician opinion is important,it is not the final word on a claimant disability.accord chamberlain shalala,cir a treating physician opinion is not conclusive in determining disability status and must be supported by medically acceptable clinical or diagnostic data.quotations and citations omitted.nothing in the regulatory scheme or the precedent of this court mandates that the opinion of a treating physician always be accepted over that of a consulting physician,only that the relative merits of both be duly considered.books,at.in this case,the alj took into account the relevant criteria in determining the weight to give baraglia opinion and provided sufficient explanation for his decision.see d requiring the alj to provide good reasons for the weight given to the claimant treating physician.
the alj recognized that baraglia was able to observe the claimant over a prolonged period,see stephens heckler,cir,and noted that the opinion of a treating physician is normally given great weight.see.nevertheless,the alj concluded that there was substantial reason to believe that baraglia opinion was not credible.id.specifically,the alj rejected baraglia assessment of smith capacity to work because it was not supported by clinical signs and findings,it was internally inconsistent,and it was inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in smith record.see id.
first,the alj found that baraglia opinion was not based on objective medical evidence.see stating that baraglia assessment of smith residual functional capacity shows no objective medical basis in clinical signs,findings or abnormalities by which to substantiate the indicated restrictions.a thorough review of smith case record reveals that this finding is essentially correct.although baraglia diagnosed severe arthritis,his treatment notes contain little more than smith subjective complaints of pain.the only contained in baraglia reports were from and,and they revealed only minimal or degenerative changes with the exception of smith right ankle,and baraglia treatment notes did not indicate any restrictions on smith functional capacity due to his condition.at minimum,the absence of laboratory findings from baraglia reports is a factor that the alj could consider in determining the weight to give baraglia opinion.see d the more a medical source presents relevant evidence to support an opinion,particularly medical signs and laboratory findings,the more weight the alj will give that opinion.see also henderson apfel,cir an alj need not give controlling weight to a treating physician opinion if it is not supported by objective clinical findings.nelson apfel,cir the alj should consider and discuss all medical evidence that is credible,supported by clinical findings,and relevant to the question at hand.whitney schweiker,cir the weight given a physician statement depends upon the extent to which it is supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.quotations and citations omitted accord cutlip secretary of health human,cir per curiam the treating physician opinions are only accorded great weight when they are supported by sufficient clinical findings.
second,the alj found baraglia opinion to be internally inconsistent.within a two month period,baraglia completed two written assessments of smith functional capacity.curiously,the latter assessment suggested that smith condition had worsened dramatically in some ways,but improved almost miraculously in others.for example,in the december assessment,baraglia indicated that there was no limitation in the claimant ability to sit for prolonged periods,see,but in the february assessment,baraglia indicated that smith could only sit for about four hours,see.additionally,baraglia february assessment noted that smith could occasionally lift and carry no more than pounds,see,an assessment less than the he mad
