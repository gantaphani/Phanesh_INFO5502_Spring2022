writ of review 
john duncan,administrator of the subsequent injuries benefit trust fund of the state of california sibtf petitions this court for review of a decision of the workers compensation appeals board,which construed labor code section,subdivision c to mean that the cost of living adjustment to total permanent disability payments and life pensions are retroactive to the date of injury,no matter when the first payment is actually received.we granted two requests for leave to file briefs as amici curiae 
in this case of first impression,we hold that the cost of living adjustments pursuant to labor code section,subdivision c,for life pensions and total permanent disability indemnity,are added to those payments,per the words of the statute,starting january,and every january thereafter.accordingly,we annul the decision of the workers compensation appeals board.
background 
on or about june,an injured worker the worker and his employer insurance company settled the worker claim for an industrial injury that occurred on january.the parties stipulated that the worker injury became permanent and stationary on october,and that the industrial injuries caused permanent disability of percent for which permanent disability indemnity was payable at the rate of per week beginning october,for a period of weeks.the worker had received temporary disability benefits from to however,because the worker had a disability caused by hepatitis b and his hiv positive status,the worker submitted a claim to the sibtf about a month after he settled with his employer.
on or about march,sibtf and the worker stipulated that the worker january,injury resulted in a percent industrial permanent disability,which became permanent and stationary on october,that october,was the date of his first payment for permanent disability and that the worker previous permanent disability combined with his industrial disability resulted in a combined total permanent disability of percent.accordingly,the worker would receive weekly payments for total permanent disability as of october,less paid by the insurance company for worker employer,for weeks,and thereafter weekly for life.
subsequently,it appears that a dispute arose after the worker claimed the initial weekly rate that started october,had to be increased by annual changes in the state average weekly wage starting from the date of his,the date payments became.
on july,the workers compensation administrative law judge wcj issued a findings and award against the sibtf.specifically,the wcj found that by failing to implement labor code section,subdivision c in a timely fashion,the sibtf delayed payments to the worker in the sum of and that increased payments to the worker should have begun on january.the wcj based these findings on an interpretation of labor code section,the application of which to the facts of the case the wcj found somewhat puzzling.
after the sibtf appealed to the workers compensation appeals board wcab,the wcab issued its opinion and decision.the wcab held that labor code section,subdivision c provides that for injuries on or after january,where an employee becomes entitled to total permanent disability indemnity or a life pension,that payment shall be increased annually commencing on january.we construe this to mean that each payment of total permanent disability indemnity or life pension that is received on or after january following the date of injury shall be increased,no matter when the first such payment is received.this ensures that severely injured workers are protected from inflation,no matter when they receive their first payment.in some cases there may be years of litigation before there is a determination that an employee is entitled to receive a life pension or total permanent disability indemnity award.in the case of a life pension,the first payment will ordinarily be made years after the date of injury.nonetheless,the injured worker will have been protected against any inflation that may have ensued between the date of injury and the date of first payment of the life pension or total permanent disability indemnity.
following the wcab decision,the sibtf petitioned this court for a writ of review,which this court granted on june,

background on workers compensation 
as our sister court in the fourth appellate district explained,workers compensation is not an area of the law that routinely gives rise to california appellate court decisions.gamble workers comp.appeals bd.th,d gamble.
as did the gamble court,we believe that a brief synopsis of this state workers compensation scheme and its development,an overview of the common terminology,and a discussion of the relevant legal provisions are necessary prerequisites to the resolution of this case.
more than years ago,our legislature was directed to create and enforce a liability on the part of all employers to compensate their employees for any injury incurred by the said employees in the course of their employment irrespective of the fault of either party.citation.the legislature complied with this directive by enacting various provisions of the labor code.citation.gamble,supra,th at,d.
this system attempts to assure employees of an expeditious remedy both adequate and certain,independent of any fault on the part of employees and employers.at the same time,it provides the employer with a liability which is determinable within defined limits.it represents a philosophy that industry,as a cost of doing business,should provide for the care and rehabilitation of workers disabled by work injuries.in this way,society supports the program as a n integral element of commerce and industry,rather than through plans.citation.citation.gamble,supra,at,d.
in creating and maintaining a system of workers compensation,the people of this state made an important public policy decision and transformed how we address workplace injuries.it should be remembered,however,that the purpose of an award under the workers compensation scheme is not to make the employee whole for the loss which he has suffered but to prevent him and his dependents from becoming public charges during the period of his disability in short the award transfers a portion of the loss suffered by the disabled employee from him and his dependents to the consuming public complete protection is not afforded the employee from disability because this would constitute an invitation to malinger or to be careless on the job as he would then lose nothing in assuming a disabled status.citation.citation.gamble,supra,at,d.
the workers compensation system provides separate classes of indemnity for temporary and permanent disabilities.citations.a disability can not be both permanent and temporary at the same time.citation.kopitske workers comp.appeals board th,d.
temporary disability is the immediate incapacity to work due to an industrial injury that is reasonably expected to be cured or materially improved with proper medical treatment.western growers ins.workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.the class of temporary disability serves only as wage replacement during the injured worker healing period.it is payable at of the worker average weekly earnings.edgar workers comp.appeals bd.th,d 
when the employee condition has reached maximum improvement or it has become stationary for a reasonable period of time,and the worker retains some residual disability from the injury,the worker is considered to be permanent and stationary.edgar workers comp.appeals,supra,th at,d.thereafter,the worker is considered to have a permanent disability.id.at,d.when a worker is deemed permanent and stationary,he or she is entitled to permanent disability and temporary disability payments cease.kopitske workers comp.appeals board,supra,th at,d.
permanent disability indemnity benefits are intended as reimbursement for the employee impaired future earning capacity or decreased ability to compete in the open labor market.citation.ritchie workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.permanent disability is expressed in percentages,and if a disability is deemed less than percent,it is referred to as a permanent partial disability.the amount of compensation payable for a given percentage of permanent disability varies according to the date of injury.gamble,supra,th at,d.payments continue for a set number of weeks,as determined by the permanent disability schedule in section.
injured employees with permanent disabilities of at least percent but less than percent are entitled to life pension payments,which commence when the employee permanent disability payments end.an injured worker who is percent permanently disabled is entitled to permanent disability payments for life,subds.a b.relevant here,section,subdivisions b and c provide,if the permanent disability is total,the indemnity based upon the average weekly earnings determined under section shall be paid during the remainder of life.c for injuries occurring on or after january,an employee who becomes entitled to receive a life pension or total permanent disability indemnity as set forth in subdivision b shall have that payment increased annually commencing on january,and each january thereafter,by an amount equal to the percentage increase in the state average weekly wage as compared to the prior year.for purposes of this subdivision,state average weekly wage means the average weekly wage paid by employers to employees covered by unemployment insurance as reported by the united states department of labor for california for the months ending march of the calendar year preceding the year in which the injury occurred.
in the case of total permanent disability,pertinent to this case,section provides,a in computing average annual earnings for the purposes of temporary disability indemnity and permanent total disability indemnity only,the average weekly earnings shall be taken at not less than one hundred dollars,nor more than one thousand dollars,for injuries occurring on or after january.subdivision c of section provides,between the limits specified in subdivision a,the average weekly earnings,except as provided in sections to shall be arrived at as follows where the employment is for or more hours a week and for five or more working days a week,the average weekly earnings shall be the number of working days a week times the daily earnings at the time of the injury.
discussion 
the sibtf argues that the wcab was incorrect when it determined that the payment amount of permanent disability indemnity that is set once a worker disability is considered permanent and stationary must be increased by cost of living adjustments starting from the january after the date of injury.
the sibtf contends that subdivision c of section provides for annual increases in weekly benefit payments only after an injured employee is entitled to such benefits the subdivision does not provide for increases prior to the entitlement to benefits.furthermore,a worker does not have a right to receive total disability indemnity until he or she is permanent and stationary.
real party in interest,the worker,contends that the cost of living adjustments should take place per the very words of the statute,on january following date of injury,which is the only interpretation that will allow the injured workers benefit level to keep pace with inflation over time.
accordingly,the resolution of this case depends on this court interpretation of subdivision c of section.the crux of this case is when does the state average weekly wage cost of living adjustment cola begin for a worker who is totally permanently disabled or starts receiving a life pension.
when interpreting a statute,our purpose is to effectuate the legislature intent.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th,d.in construing a statute,our first task is to look to the language of the statute itself.citation.when the language is clear and there is no uncertainty as to the legislative intent,we look no further and simply enforce the statute according to its terms.citations.id.at,d.if possible,significance should be given to every word,phrase,sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.citation.when used in a statute words must be construed in context,keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute where they appear.citations.moreover,the various parts of a statutory enactment must be harmonized by considering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.citations.id.at,d.if the statutory language is susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citations.people woodhead cal d.
a statute plain language is a dispositive indicator of its meaning unless a literal reading would lead to absurd consequences the legislature did not intend.there is a well settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the legislature did not intend.younger superior court cal d.
thus,our goal is to divine and give effect to the legislature intent.elsner uveges cal th,d.furthermore,w e do not presume that the legislature intends,when it enacts a statute,to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied.people superior court zamudio cal th,d.
with this background in mind we turn to the words of the statute.as noted,subdivision c of section provides that when a worker permanent disability is total,as in this case,for injuries occurring on or after january,again as in this case,an employee who becomes entitled to receive a life pension or total permanent disability indemnity shall have that payment increased annually commencing on january,and each january thereafter,by an amount equal to the percentage increase in the state average weekly wage as compared to the prior year.for purposes of this subdivision,state average weekly wage means the average weekly wage paid by employers to employees covered by unemployment insurance as reported by the united states department of labor for california for the months ending march of the calendar year preceding the year in which the injury occurred.
at the outset,we must disagree with the worker that the very words of the statute require that a cola to the total permanent disability payment should take place on january following the date of injury.the only time that the date of injury is mentioned is with regard to the definition of the state average weekly wage.we agree with the wcj that for injuries occurring after january,the plain language of the statute requires that total permanent disability payments and life pensions be increased annually commencing january.however,as the wcj noted,w hile the language is clear enough,such a plain reading would require increases to begin some days prior to t
