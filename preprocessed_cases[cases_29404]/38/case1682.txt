the legislature,in welfare and institutions code section,requires that e very county and every city and county shall relieve and support all incompetent,poor,indigent persons,and those incapacitated by age,disease,or accident,lawfully resident therein,when such persons are not supported and relieved by their relatives or friends,by their own means,or by state hospitals or other state or private institutions.italics added.
the california supreme count has interpreted this statute as imposing a mandatory duty to provide a system of last resort subsistence medical care,a level of care which does not lead to unnecessary suffering or endanger life and health,to all medically indigent residents who do not have the financial ability to pay all or some of the costs of such treatment and are not eligible for other state or federal most cases,the working poor.hunt superior court cal th,d,hunt.
in this case,the trial court approved san diego county the county financial eligibility standard for such medical care,which denies any services for individuals who earn more than per month.the eligibility standard also limits the provision of subsistence medical care to residents who have assets of or less.the plaintiffs in this action the plaintiffs,a group of county residents who were denied care for their serious injuries and illnesses because their incomes were slightly above the county eligibility cap,and were uninsured and either had limited or no ability to pay for medical treatment,assert that the court erred in approving the county financial eligibility cap because in approving that cap it did not consider individual residents ability to pay all or part of the actual cost of such care and the cap was based upon legally flawed assumptions and was not supported by substantial evidence.
we conclude that because the county eligibility standard is based upon an inflexible income cap that denies any medical care to indigent residents,in particular the working poor,whose monthly salary exceeds that cap by even,without consideration of their ability to pay for some or all of their medical care,the eligibility standard is void and the judgment is reversed.based upon this holding,we need not decide whether any or all of the challenged monthly expenditures that comprised the monthly income eligibility cap are supported by substantial evidence.
factual and procedural background 
county indigent health care program 
pursuant to section,the county provides medical care to poor persons,aged to,through the county medical services program cms.cms delivers care to the indigent through contracts with private hospitals clinics and health centers.to qualify for cms,a person must have serious health problems,must be residents of the county,and must have countable income and resources within cms limits.as the county program overview states,cms is the county safety net program covering adults who are not eligible for.
prior to,an individual whose income exceeded the applicable cms limit would still be eligible for medical treatment as long as the individual paid for a portion of the cost of that care.in,however,the county eliminated this provision and imposed an income cap of a month for an individual and a month for a family of two.when an applicant income exceeded this set amount,he or she was ineligible for medical care under cms,regardless of the individual ability to pay for such care.
at the time this action was filed in,the eligibility limit was for an individual and for a family of two.the resource assets limit was for an individual and for a family of two.
b.the plaintiffs 
in january plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit to challenge the cms eligibility cap.the complaint alleged that the lead plaintiff,dorothea renee alford,was employed as a maintenance worker for a church camp,where she earned per month and received free room and board.her employer indicated on her paycheck that the value of her room and board was per month.
in february alford,experiencing pain and bleeding,was admitted by a hospital emergency room,where she was diagnosed with lymphoma.unable to afford further treatment,she applied for cms medical care but was denied care because her salary,combined with the value of her room and board,exceeded the cap.alford asked whether she would be eligible if she paid a part of the cost of the treatment.she was told no.
at the time alford applied for cms benefits,her doctors told her that her tumors were percent treatable.eight months later,her untreated tumors had become inoperable.
the other named plaintiffs also suffered from serious medical conditions,but because their income exceeded the cap they were rejected by cms for coverage.eric bromberg bromberg suffers from diabetes and valley fever,a fungal infection that usually spreads to the lungs.he suffered a viral infection in a lung that required surgery to remove percent of that lung.however,because his income exceeded the cap by,he was denied cms care.as a result,he has incurred medical bills totaling more than that he is unable to pay.
brian byrnes is disabled and can not work due to injuries suffered in an accident.he was hospitalized for a staph infection and had emergency rotator cuff surgery.he was denied cms benefits because his monthly disability benefits exceeded that income cap by.as a result,he has incurred in medical bills.
eric pate was admitted to the emergency room after suffering a stroke and lying alone and immobile in his apartment for over a day.he was denied cms benefits because his income from unemployment insurance was over the income eligibility cap.as a result,pate has incurred approximately in medical bills.
richard edmiston,a dump truck driver,was admitted to a hospital emergency room with heart failure.he was denied cms because his income exceeded the cap by.as a result,he has incurred in medical bills that he can not pay,and he has no means to meet his health care needs.additional named plaintiffs were added to the complaint so that by the time of the proceedings below there were named plaintiffs.
administrative hearings and lawsuit 
the plaintiffs challenged their denial of cms benefits by requesting and receiving administrative hearings.the hearing officer ruled against them,upholding the income eligibility limit.
the plaintiffs then filed a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief in the superior court,seeking to invalidate the income cap.in april bromberg moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the county from denying him medically necessary care based on a standard that did not consider his ability to pay.
injunction 
the court granted the injunction,finding that bromberg suffered from acute threatening conditions diabetes and valley fever,a fungal infection that usually spreads to the lungs.the court found that the county clinics that were open to individuals such as bromberg are inadequate for patients who require specialty care.as a result,bromberg was not receiving all the medical care he needs.
the court found that the county use of a income cap was improper without considering the individuals ability to pay the costs of necessary care.because the county had not considered bromberg ability to pay before denying him cms care,the court found that he had established a probability of prevailing on the merits and granted the injunction.thereafter,on instructions from the court,the parties negotiated an agreement under which the county agreed to provide cms coverage for bromberg,and in return he would pay per month as his share of the cost of his treatment.
class certification 
the plaintiffs filed motions seeking to certify a class.the court granted class certification as to the causes of action seeking a writ of mandate,declaratory relief and injunctive relief.the class consisted of all county residents who,since january,have been or will be denied cms because of current income caps or because of any other policy that does not consider the applicants ability to pay for subsistence medical services.
court grant of writ of mandate 
in november the court granted plaintiffs a peremptory writ of mandate invalidating the county individual and income caps.citing the california supreme court decision in hunt,supra,cal th at page,d,the court noted that section requires the county to take into account the financial ability of residents to obtain subsistence medical care and that a county may not condition the receipt of health care upon a financial eligibility standard that fails to consider individual residents ability to obtain necessary care.the court found that the county current program of limiting county medical services to those with a certain income level,without taking into account the factors enumerated in section,does not satisfy the county duty to provide subsistence medical care.the court stated it would issue a writ directing the county board of supervisors to adopt eligibility standards that consider the individual residents ability to obtain necessary care.italics added.
in december judgment was entered in plaintiffs favor and a writ of mandate was issued.consistent with its november order granting plaintiffs writ,the writ of mandate commanded the county to submit to the court new income eligibility standards that comply with sections and,and that base eligibility for indigent health care on the individuals ability to pay for such care.italics added.the county did not appeal from the judgment.
county efforts to comply with judgment 
in response to the court writ of mandate the county chief administrative officer submitted to the county board of supervisors a proposal to raise the maintenance need level to percent of the federal poverty level or for a single individual to arrive at this amount,county staff prepared a study of subsistence costs of living in the county.in determining the local cost of living,the county included housing including utilities,food,transportation,health care costs,clothing,personal care,and household supplies.
as to housing,the county surveyed studio and apartments that rent for less than per month.the study determined that the average rent for the housing units,including utilities,was approximately per month.
for food,the county utilized a food plan level under united states department of agriculture statistics.based upon their calculations,the county arrived at a number of per month as the cost of food for an individual in the county.
for transportation,the county found that because it concluded that percent of the targeted population lived within two miles of public transportation,it was reasonable to use the monthly metropolitan transit system pass as the monthly transportation cost.the county allocated per month for clothing and personal care items,and per month for household expenses.
the county allocated per month for health care costs,which consisted of health insurance,medical supplies,medications and unreimbursed costs for medical care.the health insurance component of that amount was.
based upon these numbers,county staff submitted to the board a proposal to raise the maintenance need level to for a single individual.residents whose income was above the cap,as before,would be denied any medical care from cms.as to those whose income exceeded the cap,the proposal stated that it assumed that any excess income could be used to pay for basic health insurance or medically necessary health care.the county maintained its property ownership cap.
plaintiffs opposition to proposed cap 
plaintiffs opposed the new proposed limits.they argued that the county should not adopt an inflexible cap that did not consider those with a limited ability to pay and also that the cap was not an accurate measurement of residents ability to pay.
plaintiffs disputed the assumptions the county used to come up with the monthly rent amount,submitting a declaration from their expert who opined that there are,at most,a few hundred housing units available in the county at to cms applicants at any given time,if they can find them.he also disputed the county assumption that chronically ill low income adults could find roommates from an online classified advertising service that specialized in serving college students.
as to the transportation allowance for a bus pass,plaintiffs transportation expert stated that it was unreasonable to use a standard of two miles from public transportation to measure availability of public transit.rather,transportation planners use to of a mile as the standard for a reasonable walking distance.he opined that low income residents in poor health,such as cms applicants,are unlikely to walk up to four miles each day to get to work or health clinics.he also stated only percent of low income residents of the county use public transportation.therefore,a more reasonable allowance based upon what low income residents actually spend for transportation would be per month,the average lowest income percent as reported by the consumer expenditure survey ces,adjusted for higher living costs in san diego 
plaintiffs contested the monthly allocation for health care.they questioned the county reliance on a ces study that averaged in costs of people whose health insurance was paid by their employers or the government,and therefore have little or no health care expenses.the survey did not measure what health care would cost the plaintiffs class,which was uninsured.plaintiffs experts testified that health care costs for the least expensive policy would be well over a month,and for those who can not afford insurance or are denied coverage,monthly expenses could be to per month.
plaintiffs contested the county assumption that those with income above the cap,who therefore would be ineligible for medical care,could use any excess income to pay for basic health insurance or medically necessary health care.they submitted declarations from class members who were denied cms care,but who also could not afford insurance or medical care.they also submitted evidence from their experts who stated that insurance is usually unavailable for many cms applicants,who have preexisting conditions.when available,it is financially out of reach for such persons.
plaintiffs presented evidence that without insurance,class members could only afford a small portion of the health care they needed.for example,bromberg was forced to skip necessary doctor visits,test his blood less often than recommended,and could not afford,which cost to,or medication to treat his valley fever,which cost per month.class member steven moskowitz,who already owed over in medical bills,could not get followup treatment for a spot on his lung that his doctor thought might be cancerous.
board of supervisors adopts cap 
the county board of supervisors adopted the proposed cap.this left in place the policy of denying care to anyone exceeding the cap,regardless of their ability to pay for a portion of that care.
court approval of cap 
the county filed a return to the writ seeking court approval of its income cap.plaintiffs moved to enforce the judgment,contending the new cap was invalid and illegal because the county could not deny care to persons whose incomes exceeded the cap without considering their ability to pay some or all of their care and the number was based upon flawed assumptions,was unsupported by the evidence,and was too low given the costs of the necessities of life.
plaintiffs relied upon the administrative record and a declaration from class member maria penney,who suffered from diabetes,thyroid disease,high blood pressure and rotten teeth.the county objected to the penney declaration as outside the administrative record,but the court agreed to consider it for the purpose of illustrating the problem with the cap.
penney declared that she originally applied for and was approved for cms after she went into a diabetic coma because she could not afford insulin.however,when her health improved and she regained her job as a cashier in a gas station,she was denied cms care because she was one dollar over the cms income limit.as a result,she was forced to charge her medical visits,insulin and other medical supplies on her credit card.she stopped going to her doctor and receiving blood work as often as her doctor required and experienced headaches from pain in her mouth because she could not afford dental care.
the court approved the income cap and discharged the writ.in doing so,the court first rejected plaintiffs argument that the applicable law specifically and categorically precludes a standard based on a flat amount of income.the court also found that the factual premises relied upon by the board in setting the caps are reasonably supported by the evidence before the board.
the court also rejected plaintiffs contention that the county must provide subsistence medical care to indigent persons who are able to pay only some of their medical costs.however,in doing so,the court noted that such a policy would be consistent with the policies behind section however,absent a specific directive from either the legislature or a higher court,this court lacks the authority to accomplish this worthwhile goal.at oral argument,the court stated,i think it a great case for an appeal and i can see an appellate court siding with you on this,but as a trial judge,i think i have to go with what the courts have done.
this appeal follows.
discussion 
the plaintiffs assert that the court erred in approving the county monthly income cap because in approving that cap it did not consider individual residents ability to pay all or part of the actual cost of such care and the cap was based upon legally flawed assumptions and was not supported by substantial evidence.we conclude that because the county eligibility standard is based upon an inflexible income cap that denies any medical care to indigent residents,in particular the working poor,whose monthly salary exceeds that cap by even,without consideration of their ability to pay for some or all of their medical care,the eligibility standard is void and the judgment is reversed.based upon this holding,we need not decide whether any or all of the challenged monthly expenditures that comprised the monthly income eligibility cap were supported by substantial evidence.

moreover,as the california supreme observed in county of san diego,supra,cal th at pages,d,section imposes a mandatory duty upon all counties to provide medically necessary care,not just emergency care,to county indigents who have no other means to care for themselves.in tailfeather board of supervisors th,d tailfeather,the court of appeal observed that section requires provision of medical services to the poor at a level which does not lead to unnecessary suffering or endanger life and health.

indigents with limited ability to pay for medical services working poor 
as will be explained in this section,courts have long concluded,under both the common law and section,that a county obligation to provide subsistence medical care to the poor includes not only those with no ability to pay,but also those with a limited ability to pay,sometimes referred to as the working poor.
in goodall brite d,goodall,a taxpayer sought to enjoin the board of supervisors from admitting certain classes of patients to the county hospital,those patients who could pay for only part of the cost of their hospitalization.the goodall court concluded that it was a proper exercise of the county police powers to admit and treat such patients.in goodall,the court held that a county hospital may not limit admission to only the pauper class id.at,it must also accept those who can not pay for hospitalization in private institutions but who can pay something towards their care and treatment,the medically indigent.id.at.as the goodall court stated we can visualize the head of a family who has employment and can keep honest worker,frugal and thrifty,who supports his family,educates his children and has perhaps acquired an equity in a modest home.if he is injured,not in the course of his employment,the family income stops and he may require hospitalization and may lack the funds with which to enter a private institution.must it be said that he should be refused admission to the county hospital because he is not a pauper when if he were a pauper he would be admitted without question this would amount to the penalizing of honest industry,thrift and independence and would place a premium on indolence and shiftlessness.under the principles of humanitarianism,and in the interest of a sound policy,we are compelled to hold that a patient in need of hospitalization,who can not himself,or through legally liable relatives,pay the charges of a private institution,should be admitted to the county hospital because the care of such sick or injured promotes the public health and general welfare of the community in which he lives.id.at.
in san diego county viloria d.viloria,a case involving the issue of whether the sponsor of a legal immigrant was responsible to the county for the cost of medical services provided to the immigrant,we stated that section requires the county of san diego to furnish hospitalization to an indigent person.citations.in the event the indigent person is able to pay a part of although not the total charge for hospital services rendered him by the county,he is obligated accordingly.citation.the county is authorized to fix the rate to be charged the indigent and to direct its collection.citation.nevertheless,the obligation is limited in amount to the extent of the indigent person ability to pay.citation.italics added.in reaching this conclusion,we relied upon and cited goodall with approval.viloria,supra,d at.
in county of san diego,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court discussed the fact that,pursuant to legislation,the state withdrew from counties funding for medically indigent persons.id.at,d,fn.omitted.to offset this change in coverage,the state set up an account as a mechanism to transfer state funds to counties to pay for expenses,and sufficient funds had been available in this account to enable the state to fully fund the county costs.id.at,d.however,in fiscal year,insufficient funds were available.ibid.the state argued that no mandate for reimbursement existed because the counties had always borne the responsibility of paying for indigent medical care under section.county of san diego,supra,at,d.the supreme court rejected this contention,finding reimbursement was mandated because in enacting the legislature had shifted the cost of indigent medical care from the counties to the state.id.at,d.given this background,the legislature excluded medically indigent persons from,knowing that it would trigger the counties obligation to pay for medical care as providers of last resort.id.at,d.therefore,the legislation mandated a new program on counties by compelling them to accept financial responsibility in whole or in part for a program,medical care for adult medically indigent persons ibid.
the state argued that because san diego had statutory discretion to set eligibility and service standards under section,there was no reimbursable mandate.county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d.in rejecting this argument the court stated that the state exaggerated the scope of a county discretion,concluding that it must provide subsistence medical care to all medically indigent persons.id.at,d.the high court also expressly disapproved bay general community hospital county of san diego d.bay general insofar as it states that a county responsibility under section extends only to indigents as defined by the county board of supervisors,and suggests that a county may refuse to provide medical care to persons who are indigent within the meaning of section but do not qualify for.in reaching this conclusion the high court also pointed to the legislature rejection of an amendment limiting the scope of section s coverage,in particular the assembly committee on health statement that the amendment can not remove the fact that counties are,by definition,a last resort for any person,with or without the means to pay,who does not qualify for federal or state aid.county of san diego,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
in hunt,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court rejected sacramento county flat income eligibility cap for providing subsistence medical care to the medically indigent.sacramento county originally provided free health care to individuals with income up to per month.individuals with income exceeding that amount also were eligible to receive health care,but they were required to pay a share of the cost.id.at,d.because sacramento county faced budget shortfalls in,it amended its financial eligibility standard to be the same as the eligibility standard for general assistance ga under section under the amended standard,sacramento county provided no medical care to residents who did not meet the financial eligibility requirements for general assistance,subject to limited exceptions.at that time,an individual living alone was eligible for general assistance if his or her income did not exceed per amount equal to percent of the federal official poverty line.ibid.
a class action was filed seeking to halt sacramento county amended standard.hunt,supra,cal th at,d.the plaintiffs were identified as county residents who rely upon the county for vital health care,such as treatment for cancer,epilepsy,and hypertension,but who are ineligible for health care under the amended standard.ibid.the trial court granted a preliminary injunction in the plaintiffs favor precluding sacramento county from denying their medical services solely because they do not meet the general assistance financial eligibility standard,or any other eligibility standard that failed to consider plaintiffs financial ability to meet their subsistence medical needs.ibid.
sacramento county later requested that the court dissolve the injunction,based upon its decision to provide all subsistence needs to indigents,including medical care,solely by providing ga cash grants calculated under section.hunt,supra,cal th at,d.it also had adopted an alternative,contingent plan,should its new plan not be judicially approved,that would make an individual eligible for medical care if his or her monthly income was or less per month.id.at,d.the trial court denied sacramento county motion to dissolve the injunction and on appeal that decision was reversed.id.at,d.
the plaintiffs petitioned for review and the california supreme court reversed the court of appeal decision.in doing so,the high court rejected sacramento county contingent eligibility standard that barred medical care for individuals whose income exceeded a month,regardless of whether the resident would be able to obtain subsistence medical care.hunt,supra,cal th at,d.the supreme court also noted that,in county of san diego,supra,cal th,d,it had overruled bay general,supra,d,insofar as it states that a county responsibility under section extends only to indigents as defined by the county board of supervisors,and suggests that a county may refuse to provide medical care to persons who are indigent within the meaning of section but do not qualify for.hunt,supra,cal th at,d.the california supreme court struck down the eligibility standard because it fails to take into account the financial ability of residents to obtain subsistence medical care.ibid.because counties are,by definition,a last resort for any person with or without the means to pay,who does not qualify for federal or state aid,in determining a financial eligibility standard for county health services pursuant to section,the county must consider whether implementation of the standard would leave some residents who are incapacitated by age,disease,or accident,and whose condition is not relieved through other means,without subsistence medical care.hunt,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.as the high court concluded,after citing viloria,supra,d.with approval,counties may not deny subsistence medical care to residents based upon criteria unrelated to individual residents financial ability to pay all or part of the actual cost of such care.hunt,supra,cal th at,d,italics added.
the above authorities compel the conclusion that a eligibility standard that does not consider an individual ability to pay all or a part of his or her subsistence medical care is not permitted.
the county asserts that adoption of such a rule would require the county to satisfy all unmet health care needs or provide universal health insurance.just such an argument was rejected by the supreme court in hunt,supra,cal th at page,d,contrary to sacramento county assertion,recognizing such an obligation neither requires the county to satisfy all unmet needs,nor mandates universal health care the legislature has eliminated any requirement that counties provide the same quality of health care to residents who can not afford to pay as that available to nonindigent individuals receiving health care services in private facilities section imposes a minimum standard of requiring that subsistence medical services be provided promptly and humanely.as stated
