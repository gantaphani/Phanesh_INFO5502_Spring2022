jean byam appeals from the judgment of the united states district court for the district of vermont jerome niedermeier,magistrate judge granting the motion for summary judgment by the commissioner of the social security administration the commissioner and denying the for summary judgment by the byam.the administrative law judge alj granted supplemental security income ssi disability benefits dating back to june,but refused to reopen three previous applications filed in,and that had been denied and for which no hearing had been requested.the district court ruled that it lacked the jurisdiction to review the decision to deny byam request to reopen her earlier applications for ssi disability benefits,because neither did the alj constructively reopen the appellant previous applications nor did the alj decision not to reopen the appellant previous applications violate due process.
we conclude that the district court erred in certain respects it failed to recognize and apply the burdens against the moving party in summary judgment proceedings it misapplied stieberger apfel,cir,by focusing solely on whether byam could comprehend notice of denial of disability benefits,and not whether she could act upon notice,id.at and it misconstrued the administrative law judge findings of facts in ruling that there was no violation of due process.because there are material issues of fact in dispute,we vacate the district court grant of summary judgment and remand for further proceedings on the question of whether byam was denied due process in her previous applications for ssi benefits.
background 
we first briefly describe the administrative scheme for ssi applications,and then turn to byam medical and psychiatric evaluations as they developed over the course of her four applications.
procedures for ssi applications 
the social security act entitles disabled individuals to receive ssi benefits.see.the act defines disability as an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d.
a claimant whose application has been denied may request reconsideration within sixty days of receiving the denial.a.if the claim has been denied on reconsideration,the claimant may request a hearing before an alj within sixty days.b.following the alj decision,the claimant may request review by the appeals council within sixty days.a.the appeals council renders the agency determination final,and it is subject to judicial review within sixty days.the claimant may request that her application be reopened within twelve months of notice of the initial determination for any reason,and within two years of the initial determination for good cause.a b.an applicant establishes good cause by furnishing new and material evidence demonstrating a clerical error or offering evidence in the administrative record that clearly shows on its face that an error was made.a.an application can be reopened at any time if the determination was obtained by fraud or similar fault tak ing into account any physical,mental,educational,or linguistic limitations which the applicant may have had at the time.c.when a claimant has failed to request reconsideration,an alj hearing,appeals council review,or review by a federal district court,social security ruling requires the agency to extend the deadlines for such requests if the claimant had good cause for missing the deadline,such as if he or she lacked the mental capacity to understand the procedures for requesting review or had any mental or physical condition which limit ed the claimant ability to do things for.social security ruling ssr,wl,at july,see also stieberger,at.
byam psychiatric background and previous applications 
byam,who was born in,has been unable to work since june,which she attributes to depression,headaches,and arthritis.according to her psychiatric records,byam has been hospitalized three times after suicide attempts in,and.
byam,unassisted by counsel,first applied for ssi benefits on september.the application included a mental residual functional capacity assessment mrfca and a psychiatric review technique by gayle frommelt.the mrfca form begins by explaining,each mental activity is to be evaluated within the context of the individual capacity to sustain that activity over a normal workday and workweek,on an on going basis.similarly,the psyschiatric review technique uses categories established by and,subpt.p,appendix,which are so constructed that an individual with an impairment s that meets or is equivalent in severity to the criteria of a listing could not reasonably be expected to do any gainful activity,subpt.p,appendix,mental disorders,introduction.thus,these evaluations focus specifically on employment.
frommelt noted that byam had an affective disorder,which the regulations characterize as a disturbance of mood,accompanied by a full or partial manic or depressive syndrome,and a personality disorder,defined as typical of the individual functioning,subpt.p,appendix,listings and.frommelt checked boxes indicating that byam had i nflexible and maladaptive personality traits which cause either significant impairment in social or occupational functioning or subjective distress,including p ersistent disturbances of mood or affect,p athological dependence and aggressivity,and i ntense and unstable interpersonal relationships and impulsive and damaging behavior.frommelt also checked boxes indicating that byam was moderately limited in her ability to understand,remember,and carry out detailed instructions,her ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,and her ability to set realistic goals or make plans on her own,in addition to other moderate limitations.clifford rivers,in a separate psychological assessment,also noted that her mood disorder affects her concentration and attention,that she may be becoming more dependant and coping increasingly poorly,and that she lacks judgment and insight into many of her problems.on november,the social security administration ssa denied her application initially and denied it again upon reconsideration on april.
byam denial notice informed her of a right to a hearing,and explained that some benefits might be lost if,instead of requesting a hearing,she filed a new application.byam did not request a hearing and instead,again without counsel,she filed a second claim for benefits on september.five days later,she reported to the washington county mental health hospital,so that she would not act on suicidal thoughts.byam began treatment there,although the record is unclear whether she was ever hospitalized.the staff at the hospital noted memory loss and vagueness and dissociative presentation,which is a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness,memory,identity,or perception of the environment.rafael garcia observed depression,suicidal ruminations,impaired concentration,and social phobia.in november,the hospital staff noted the same disorders,and also ptsd posttraumatic stress disorder with suicidal ideation.edward hurley,completing byam mrfca for her application,found mental conditions similar to the ones in frommelt evaluation she was moderately limited in her ability to understand and carry out detailed instructions,but not significantly limited in following simple instructions and she had slight restriction in daily living activities,moderate difficulty in social functioning,and often had deficiencies in concentration.the regional commissioner of the ssa denied her application on january,and she did not request reconsideration or a hearing.
byam,again unaided by counsel,filed a third application on july.her evaluations indicate that her depression and poor concentration continued.hurley completed her mrfca for the application and found some improvement over the past year,but continued to observe moderate limitations in her ability to carry out detailed instructions.the acting regional commissioner denied her application initially on september,and on reconsideration on november.as with her previous applications,she did not request a hearing.even though at any time within a year of the denials of her,and applications she could have requested that her applications be reopened,she never did so,despite the denial notices warnings that she may lose benefits by filing a new application.
procedural history of byam application 
on june,byam filed her fourth application.her evaluations for this application noted clarity,coherence,and no delusions,but also suicidal ideation,depression,auditory hallucinations,and social phobia.they also mention that she suffered severe childhood physical and sexual abuse.the acting regional commissioner of the social security administration again denied her application initially and on reconsideration.this time,she requested a hearing,but she submitted the request almost a month past the request period,which she attributed to illness.the alj found no good cause for her untimeliness and dismissed the request.
in,at about the time of her fourth application,byam began to see judy nepveu for evaluation and treatment.based upon previous evaluations and her own observations,nepveu found that byam suffers from lifelong dysfunction and is of borderline retarded intellect,although nepveu had not measured her iq.nepveu concluded that byam suffers from ptsd probably as a result of family violence.two years later,in,nepveu observed that byam coping style is fixed and stonewalls.when she does understand what to do,she does nothing.she have great difficulty following advice about paperwork and meetings.she also commented,she can not advocate for herself,even when her own survival is at stake.
on january,byam counsel wrote to the ssa office of hearings and appeals,enclosing a letter from nepveu stating that byam has a borderline retarded intellect and that she is too disabled to do what it takes to get disability benefits.after receiving this letter,the alj found good cause for her untimely request for a hearing,and scheduled a hearing for august.after missing this hearing,byam appeared with counsel and testified at a rescheduled hearing on march.byam counsel requested reopening of previous applications,because byam mental impairments have prevented her from following through.
on april,the alj granted byam ssi disability benefits dating back to june,the day she filed the fourth application.he found that she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since,that her depression and disorders of the back cause significant vocationally relevant limitations and are severe within the meaning of the regulations,imposing significant restrictions in the ability to perform basic work activities,and that her impairments fit the criteria of an affective disorder under the federal regulations,subpt.p,appendix,section.the alj described her psychiatric condition as follows 
the claimant suffers from depression.she has difficulty keeping appointments and is lethargic.she is unable to advocate for herself,even when her own survival is at stake.she is upset,cries and is angry.she has hurt herself in the past.she has no energy,sleeps poorly and has nightmares.she has difficulty concentrating.she has dysphoria anxiety and depression,anhedonia the inability to experience pleasure,decreased appetite,hears voices and has anxiety and feelings of rage.she also has feelings of worthlessness and dissociative symptoms.she has suicidal ideation and describes fearfulness.
she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder secondary to abuse in her childhood.she is borderline retarded intellectually.her coping style is fixed and dysfunctional.she stonewalls,when she does understand what to do,she does nothing.she is unable to follow instructions or advice.
the alj recognized that the claimant has suffered from depression,post traumatic stress disorder,and borderline retarded intellect,but found that her condition worsened after june,and that she was disabled beginning on june,but not prior there to sic.
on the question of reopening her earlier applications,the alj concluded that t here is no medical evidence which can establish disability prior to june.therefore,i find that there is no new and material evidence or error on the face of the evidence that would establish good cause for reopening under b.however,the alj did not inquire whether her applications were denied as the result of fault,mental incapacity in byam case under c,and he did not inquire whether she had any mental or physical conditions that limited her ability to do things for her self,in accordance with ssr,wl,at.
byam requested review of the alj decision before the appeals council,which summarily denied her request by a final order on march,rendering the agency decision final and subject to judicial review.within the period for filing a civil action,she then filed suit in the district of vermont,pursuant to g,seeking to have the earlier applications reopened.byam claimed first that the alj in constructively reopened the earlier applications by reviewing their merits.she also argued that the alj decision not to reopen her previous applications denied her due process because she had been incompetent to advocate for herself and had been unrepresented by counsel,and thus,administrative notice was constitutionally deficient.
magistrate judge jerome niedermeier,sitting as the district court by consent of the parties pursuant to c,granted the commissioner motion for summary judgment against byam claims.the district court ruled,first,that the alj had not constructively reopened the applications,and,second,that the denial notices were not constitutionally deficient.despite noting that nepveu evaluation makes a strong case for establishing that byam was so severely disabled that she could not comprehend the administrative process,he concluded that her medical history before falls short of establishing sufficient severity to impair comprehension of the administrative process.byam massanari,at.july,citing stieberger,at.byam appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment for the commissioner.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
summary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.c.the moving party bears the burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.see celotex catrett,d.when ruling on a summary judgment motion,a court must construe the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and must resolve all ambiguities and draw all reasonable inferences against the movant.see anderson liberty lobby,d.unfortunately,in this case the magistrate judge did not discuss the standard of review for summary judgment and did not consider the evidence in the light most favorable to byam.
jurisdiction 
as a general rule,federal courts lack jurisdiction to review an administrative decision not to reopen a previous claim for benefits.see califano sanders,d.the supreme court explained the purpose underlying the of decisions not to reopen 
a n interpretation that would allow a claimant judicial review simply by being petition to reopen his claim would frustrate the congressional purpose,plainly evidenced in g,to impose a limitation upon judicial review of the secretary final decision on the initial claim for benefits.congress determination so to limit judicial review to the original decision denying benefits is a policy choice obviously designed to forestall repetitive or belated litigation of stale eligibility claims.our duty,of course,is to respect that choice.
id.at.internal citations omitted.the commissioner decision not to reopen a prior determination is not a final decision for the purposes of g,and thus is generally unreviewable even if there was a hearing in the case.see latona schweiker,cir.nevertheless,federal courts may review the commissioner decision not to reopen a disability application in two circumstances where the commissioner has constructively reopened the case and where the claimant has been denied due process.
if the commissioner reviews the entire record and renders a decision on the merits,the earlier decision will be deemed to have been reopened,and any claim of administr
