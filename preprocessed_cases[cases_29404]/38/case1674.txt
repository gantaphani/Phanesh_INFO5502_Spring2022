factual background and procedural history 
dobos began working for the county on december,as a temporary student nurse.she was hired by the county as a temporary staff nurse on october,and was promoted to a permanent staff nurse on january.dobos worked at the university of southern california medical center,women hospital.
on march,dobos allegedly incurred a disabling injury at work.on that same date,the county suspended dobos pending an investigation into allegations of misconduct.dobos did not return to work for the county at any time after march.following its investigation,the county terminated dobos employment effective april.
on october,approximately five months after her employment with the county ended,dobos filed an application for disability benefits under the county disability and survivor benefit plan the plan.in her application,dobos alleged that she first became disabled on march.voluntary plan administrators,vpa,the third party administrator for the county plan,denied dobos application for benefits on the grounds that there was insufficient medical information to support her alleged disability.dobos filed an appeal with vpa on june,and vpa upheld its decision on november.
on november,dobos applied for supplemental security income ssi disability benefits through the social security administration.on october,following several additional applications and appeals,an administrative law judge found that dobos was totally disabled and entitled to ssi disability benefits.in his decision,the administrative law judge also found that dobos had been disabled since at least november.
on february,approximately years after her employment with the county ended,dobos filed a second application for disability benefits under the county plan.in her second application,dobos alleged that her disability was the direct result of an injury that arose out of the performance of her duties for the county.she also alleged that her first day of absence from work as a result of her disability was march,and that she had not attempted to return to work since that date.because dobos had not returned to work following the denial of her first application for benefits,vpa agreed to review her original claim again,taking into account that dobos subsequently had been approved for disability benefits by the social security administration.on or about july,vpa denied dobos second application on the grounds that she failed to satisfy the plan eligibility requirements for disability benefits.specifically,vpa found that dobos did not complete the qualifying period during which an eligible employee must be totally and continuously disabled because her employment with the county terminated before the expiration of her qualifying period.
dobos appealed the denial of her second application.the appeal was heard on april,before a hearing officer acting on behalf of the los angeles county chief administrative office.on may,the hearing officer issued his findings and decision and upheld the denial.in his written decision,the hearing officer noted that the appeal was not about dobos medical eligibility or the reasons for her discharge,but was solely about whether an individual is covered under the ltd program if they sic are no longer employed by the county at the end of the six month qualifying period.based on his reading of the county plan as codified in the los angeles county code,the hearing officer concluded that dobos was not eligible for disability benefits because she was not employed by the county at the expiration of the qualifying period.
on november,dobos filed an amended petition for writ of administrative mandate in los angeles county superior court.in her petition,dobos sought to challenge the administrative decision upholding vpa denial of her application for benefits.she argued that the hearing officer erroneously interpreted the los angeles county code provisions regarding benefit eligibility,asserting that the code merely required that she be employed by the county when she first became disabled rather than for the full duration of the qualifying period.she also contended that any contrary reading would violate public policy because it would allow an employer to unilaterally control the payment of benefits by terminating disabled employees before their qualifying period ended.
on april,the trial court denied dobos writ petition.in its statement of decision,the court concluded that the relevant provisions of the los angeles county code required that,to be eligible for disability benefits,dobos had to be an employee when she became totally disabled,had to remain an employee absent from work due to a total disability for a period of six months,and had to be an employee on the first day following the expiration of the qualifying period.the court further concluded that dobos was not eligible for such benefits because she did not remain an employee for six months after march,and she was not an employee on the first day following the expiration of that period.the trial court entered judgment in favor of respondents on may.on may,dobos filed a timely notice of appeal.

the county plan for disability benefits is codified at los angeles county code title section sets forth,in pertinent part,the following definitions 
eligible employee means an employee who becomes totally disabled.as a direct consequence and result of injury or disease arising out of and in the course of the performance of his or her assigned duties or.after five years of continuous service with the county.
employee means an employee of the county of los angeles who is a general member of the los angeles county employees retirement association.general member does not include a safety member.
qualifying period means that a qualifying period shall be required with respect to any one period of disability and shall be a continuous period equal to the six months,commencing with the first day on which an eligible employee is absent from work due to a total disability,and during which he or she remains totally disabled except as provided below however,this period shall not include any time prior to the operative date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.if the eligible employee ceases to be totally disabled and returns to work for less than an aggregate of days during a qualifying period,any such cessation of total disability shall not interrupt continuity or extend the duration of the qualifying period used to determine the first day on which benefits commence,provided that the successive absences during the qualifying period are due to the same cause.in addition,the continuity of the qualifying period shall not be interrupted,nor shall the qualifying period be extended,merely because an eligible employee incurs a disability during such period that arises from a different and unrelated cause than that which initially caused the eligible employee to be absent from work as long as the eligible employee does not return to active employment at any time during the six months commencing with the first day on which the eligible employee was first absent from work due to a total disability.
title,subds.f,g,k.section further provides that a n eligible employee shall begin accruing a basic monthly benefit on the first day following the expiration of the qualifying period.title,subd.
relying on the definitions of employee and qualifying period contained in section,respondents contend that the code requires that an applicant for disability benefits be employed by the county at the expiration of the qualifying period.they assert that,because dobos employment with the county ended on april,approximately one month after she was first absent from work due to a disability,she did not satisfy the qualifying period requirement and was thus ineligible for benefits.focusing on the definition of eligible employee,dobos argues that the code merely requires that an applicant for disability benefits be an employee of the county at the time he or she first becomes totally disabled,either as the result of an injury arising out of employment or after five years of continuous service.she claims that,because she was employed by the county on march,the date she first became totally disabled and unable to work,she was eligible for benefits irrespective of her employment status at the end of the qualifying period.
based on the plain language of the enactment,we conclude that an applicant for disability benefits under the county plan must be an employee of the county at the expiration of the qualifying period to be eligible for benefits.we begin with the definition of qualifying period.the term qualifying period,as set forth in section,subdivision k,requires that an eligible employee be totally disabled for a continuous period of six months,commencing with the first day on which the eligible employee is absent from work due to a total disability.title,subd.an eligible employee is not entitled to any disability benefits unless and until that employee has satisfied the qualifying period.title,subd.the reference to an eligible employee being absent from work during the qualifying period supports the inference that,but for a total disability,the employee would otherwise be at work during that period.title,subd.this suggests that continuous employment with the county throughout the qualifying period is required to be eligible for benefits.
we next turn to the definition of eligible employee.the definition of eligible employee is contained in section,subdivision f and consists of three requirements.to qualify as an eligible employee,an applicant for disability benefits must be an employee,be totally disabled,and have either five continuous years of service with the county or a disability that is the direct result of an injury or disease arising out of and in the course of employment.title,subd.accordingly,the class of eligible employees is a subset of the larger class of employees.
employee in turn is defined in section,subdivision g as an employee of the county of los angeles who is a general member of the los angeles county employees retirement association.title,subd.giving this definition its usual and ordinary meaning,an employee is a person who is employed by the county.it does not include persons who once were,but are no longer,county employees.therefore,construing these definitions in context with each other,an applicant for disability benefits must not only be an employee of the county at the time he or she becomes totally disabled and unable to work,but also must remain an employee of the county for the duration of the qualifying period to be eligible for benefits.
dobos argues that the definition of disability beneficiary set forth in section,subdivision e supports the reading that an eligible employee is not limited to current employees of the county.disability beneficiary is defined by the code as a former employee who has not retired from service under retirement plan e,and who either is receiving disability benefits or is eligible to receive disability benefits.title,subd.focusing on the phrase eligible to receive disability benefits,dobos contends that a former employee would never be eligible to receive such benefits if the definition of eligible employee only applied to current county employees.we disagree with dobos reading.a former employee who was employed by the county for the duration of the qualifying period and only thereafter discharged could be eligible to receive disability benefits.such a former employee would still qualify as a disability beneficiary under the code,but like any other applicant for benefits,he or she would have been subject to the same eligibility requirement of continuous employment with the county throughout the qualifying period.furthermore,the fact that a disability beneficiary is defined specifically as a former employee reflects that the drafters distinguished between employees and former employees in defining the plan requirements,and further supports that the term employee,as used in the code,does not encompass both current and former employees of the county.
dobos also asserts that the written policy provid
