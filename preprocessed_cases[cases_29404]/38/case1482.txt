ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the scope of this court review of a decision of the veterans court is governed by d.in accordance with the statute,this court shall decide all relevant questions of law,including interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions.d.this court reviews an interpretation of eaja by the veterans court de novo.jones brown.however,we may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.d.
law of the case 
the government argues that we are barred by law of the case from considering whether halpern is a prevailing party within the meaning of eaja.before we can consider the merits of halpern argument with respect to whether he is a prevailing party under eaja,we must first consider whether the government is correct that we are barred by law of the case from considering this issue.the government quotes from halpern iv,where we stated 
although our review of the prevailing party issue is de novo,the ultimate conclusion of whether a party prevailed in an action is one of law based on findings of fact,notably whether the party has receive d at least some relief on the merits of his claim.our jurisdiction over appeals from the veterans court is narrowly defined,and we are precluded from reviewing the application of law to fact.under these circumstances,it is beyond the scope of our jurisdiction to address the question of whether halpern is a prevailing party within the meaning of eaja.
at citations omitted.the government argues that in declining to decide the prevailing party issue,we adopted halpern argument that we did not have jurisdiction to review prevailing party determinations of the veterans court.thus,according to the government,we are bound to abide by this rule under the law of the case doctrine.
under the law of the case doctrine,a court will generally refuse to reopen or reconsider what has already been decided at an earlier stage of the litigation.suel sec y of health human.however,t he law of the case doctrine is not applicable to issues neither presented nor decided in a former proceeding in the case.stearns beckman instruments.the law of the case doctrine,then,does not apply in this case because the issue presented in the present appeal is not the same as that presented in the previous appeal.in the previous appeal,the government requested that we hold in the first instance that halpern was not a prevailing party.we refused the government invitation and instead,remanded the case for the veterans court to decide that issue.halpern iv,at.the veterans court has now made that determination,and the case returns to us in a different posture.in our previous decision,we did not hold that we are powerless to review decisions of the veterans court on prevailing party issues.rather,we simply said,under these circumstances,it is beyond the scope of our jurisdiction to address the question of whether halpern is a prevailing party within the meaning of eaja.id.now that the question has been decided in the first instance by the veterans court,we have jurisdiction over and are required by statute to review all relevant questions of law.see vaughn principi,affirming judgments denying prevailing party status because the veterans court applied the correct legal standard.
the government also argues that halpern should be precluded from relying on an argument in the present appeal that is contrary to his position in the previous appeal under the doctrine of judicial estoppel.the government argument is misplaced because halpern is not relying upon a contradictory argument.the argument that a determination in the first instance of prevailing party status in a particular case may require application of law to fact is different from an argument as to the correct legal standard applicable in such cases.
prevailing party 
the veterans court concluded that halpern was not a prevailing party under its rule of retroactive application as applied in both flemming principi,and sachs principi.halpern v.at.specifically,the veterans court held that the sole basis for the remand was due to the change in case law in scates,which was issued during the pendency of the appeal.id.halpern disputes the veterans court application of its rule of retroactive application in this case.he argues that the veterans court interpretation of the statute in scates simply proclaimed what the statute had always meant and did not effect a change in law warranting application of the rule of retroactive application.halpern further argues that the remand by the veterans court was based on the board lack of jurisdiction to address his eligibility for withheld fees.halpern asserts that dismissal by the board con
