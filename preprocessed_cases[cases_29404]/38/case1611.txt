under california law,when a child has been adjudged to be a dependent of the juvenile court,the court shall terminate its dependency jurisdiction if a relative of the child is appointed the child legal guardian and the child has been placed with the relative for at least months,unless the relative guardian objects or upon a finding of exceptional circumstances.welf,subd.a.the court of appeal found that exceptional circumstances may exist in this case because the children,who were living with a relative guardian in canada,would be eligible for aid under california aid to families with dependent care program et were the juvenile court to change the guardianship to foster care.we granted review to consider the court of appeal conclusion.for reasons set forth below,we reverse the court of appeal judgment.
factual background 
the long and tortured history of this case began more than years ago,in july,when joshua was born with a positive toxicology for barbiturates.the next day,the los angeles county department of children and family services department took him into custody,and in october,the juvenile court adjudged him to be a dependent of the court under section.joshua brother,alexander,was born in july.three months later,in october,the juvenile court adjudged him also to be a dependent of the court.
at the same time,the court ordered that both children be placed in saskatchewan,canada,with their maternal grandmother grandmother,who was already caring for another child of the boys mother.grandmother is a member of the ahtahkakoop first nation and lives on the ahtahkakoop reserve.before making the placement order,the court received a home study prepared by the saskatchewan social services department which is now called the community resources department.the home study reported that grandmother and her common law husband had a c ombined family income of approximately net,and stated a child placed in their care would not cause major financial stress,however,financial assistance is required.in announcing its order,the court noted t hey are requesting financing,and i do not believe that i can authorize funds to go out of the united states,and they are recommending alternative financial assistance.that would have to be up to the canadian government.i do not know.the court also ordered that the boys parents receive reunification services.the boys began living with grandmother in canada in december 
in april,the court held a status review hearing pursuant to section.before the hearing,the department submitted a report recommending that the court terminate the parents reunification services and select adoption as the permanent placement plan.the report explained that although grandmother had initially expressed a desire to adopt,she had recently changed her mind and now wanted foster care,because she did not want to terminate her daughter parental rights or take away her daughter incentive to get herself together.accompanying the report was a letter from the ahtahkakoop child family services agency agency stating that the boys were now members of the ahtahkakoop reserve,that the agency was opposed to adoption of any of our band member children,and that the agency and the band supported foster care with grandmother.at the hearing,counsel for the boys stated that the tribe is sort of stating that they are not financially able to help this family out and understand that if we drop our jurisdiction,grandmother will not get assistance.the court continued the matter and appointed an expert to,among other things,inquire of the tribes as to any funding issues.three months later,in july,it terminated the parents reunification services and scheduled a permanency planning hearing under section.
arriving at a permanent placement plan proved difficult.initially,the department favored adoption and told grandmother that the boys would be eligible for both aid under the adoption assistance program aap and services until they reached the age of eighteen.however,grandmother wanted foster care instead,but was willing to consider adoption if she would otherwise lose the boys.the boys counsel advocated for a third to the court that this is not an adoption case and that an adoption just does make sense.by january,the department had changed its recommendation to foster care,citing funding issues and grandmother continuing opposition to adoption.regarding the former,the department reported that according to caseworkers in canada,the boys were receiving monthly funding from the canadian department of social services,that grandmother would lose her funding for the boys,as well as free medical care,if she took legal guardianship,and that the only way she could retain her funding and medical was to maintain the boys under foster care.
the court found the recommendation absolutely not acceptable,stating foster care means years of hearings every six months,years of funding,and grandmother quite clear that that why she wants foster care because of the funding.seventeen years the state of california pays for these two children in canada when mother is up there also.the court also found nothing in the department report indicat ing that these children were not adoptable.it therefore continued the matter for further study.
over the next months,the parties continued to explore various placement options.in july,the department reported that grandmother still wanted foster care,would consider legal guardianship if she would otherwise lose the boys,and needed funding and medical coverage in order to care for her grandsons.the department also reported that,according to canadian caseworkers,grandmother would continue to receive canadian funding but might lose medical care under foster care,and would lose funding but retain medical care under legal guardianship.finally,the department reported that,according to a representative of the revenue enhancement,special payments division,the department could fund the children in canada as long as they are title iv eli g ible and the court orders the department to fund the canada placement on a minute order.the court stated that it was simply not comfortable with foster care under the circumstances,and directed the boys counsel to prepare,and get grandmother to sign,paperwork for legal guardianship.
in october,the department reported that grandmother now was committed to legal guardianship and it recommended that the court appoint her as legal guardian.after noting it had explained,and grandmother understood,the legal and financial rights and responsibilities associated with legal guardianship,the department stated grandmother understands that with a court order,los angeles county will fund the boys at the rate of per month,as court jurisdiction will not terminate,and that canada department of social services will provide medical insurance upon receipt of legal guardianship papers from this court.on october,the court appointed grandmother as legal guardian,retained its dependency jurisdiction,and ordered the department to,among other things,ensure that youkim sic funding continues to go to the legal guardian in canada.
despite the caseworker efforts,financial aid from california did not materialize.in december,the technical assistance unit at the adoptions division stated that it was against department policy to send monthly funding out of the country.in february,the special payments division advised that although the department could send funding out of the country with a court order indicating to do so,this specific case may be a problem as the caregiver is now the legal guardian and was no longer considered a relative.in march,a regional administrator stated that under section of the california department of social services manual of policies and procedures mpp,we can not pay out of the country.
the possibility of adoption began to be explored,based on information that california funding might be available if grandmother adopted the boys.however,in november,the department reported that grandmother was receiv ing monthly funding and medical care from sources in canada and did not want to adopt the boys,that she might consider that option if her funding were permanently terminated,but that even if she permanently lost all funding,she might try to make things work out without the money.grandmother later changed her mind,and in june,she agreed to adopt the children if her attorney recommended she do so.grandmother attorney was demanding written assurance that grandmother would receive aap funds if she adopted the children.
no such assurances were provided.instead,in december,the department told the court that aap funds would not be available were grandmother to adopt the boys while they all still lived in canada.it also told the court that f oster caretakers and legal guardians are only eligible to receive funding for children in their home if the family resides in the united states.it recommended that the court leave the legal guardianship in place and terminate its dependency jurisdiction.the court followed the recommendation,and on january,terminated its dependency jurisdiction.
the boys appealed,and the court of appeal reversed.in re joshua th,d joshua i.the court first reasoned that under section,subdivision a,a juvenile court may elect to retain dependency jurisdiction where it finds exceptional circumstances,and that under california rules of court,former rule a now rule exceptional circumstances may be established by a finding that the best interests of the child would be served by continued jurisdiction.joshua i,supra,at,d.the court then found that the juvenile court had abused its discretion by failing to consider the best interests of the children and focusing instead on the financial and administrative burdens that foster care would impose on california.id.at,d.the court remanded the case for consideration of whether continued jurisdiction would be in the children best interest,including consideration of whether grandmother can provide for the children needs without financial assistance and whether financial assistance is available from california.id.at,d.regarding the latter consideration,although noting that the children had not requested a determination that funding from california is available or required,the court nevertheless noted that the children may have been eligible for financial assistance under the program.id.at,d.it stated t here appears no statutory bar to a child receiving where that child has been adjudicated a person described by section,removed from the home of his or her parents,and placed outside of the united states,where the child would otherwise be eligible for payments based on established need.joshua i,supra,at,d.
in august,after the case was remanded and the juvenile court retook dependency jurisdiction,the department filed a progress report stating that grandmother was receiving per month from canadian social services to support the children,additional money to support their older brother,and a monthly tax incentive.the report also stated that,according to grandmother,the indian tribe was assuring yearly medical and dental exams and school attendance,and was assist ing her in meeting all of the children needs.finally,the report conveyed grandmother position that the children were doing fine,that she did not want anything from the court in california and did not want anyone calling and asking questions about the children,including social workers,or the courts,and that her family want ed to be left alone.the report recommended that the juvenile court terminate its dependency jurisdiction.
on august,after a hearing,the juvenile court followed the recommendation and again terminated its dependency jurisdiction.the juvenile court found that the boys apparently were thriving with their grandmother in a safe,loving,and stable home,and that it was in their best interest to remain in that home.regarding funding,the court first stated that w hen a child in the state of california leaves the state of california for a legal guardianship in another state,we can not provide funds to that state.after the children counsel asserted that legal guardianship,rather than foster care,had been chosen only because grandmother was told by the department she could get the funding otherwise,the court replied i not aware that children in another country can get funding if they are in foster care.the court later declared i do not believe this court has the authority to provide funds for the grandmother in canada,under any theory of law.
the boys again appealed,and the court of appeal again reversed.it first found that the children,notwithstanding their placement outside of the united states,would be eligible for assistance were they placed in foster care.it further found that because section,subdivision a,gives a juvenile court authority to make any and all reasonable orders for the maintenance and support of a child who has been adjudged a dependent child under section,the juvenile court would have the authority to order the department to make payments were the court to place the boys in foster care with g randmother in canada.in reaching this conclusion,the court of appeal also found that the children were not required to exhaust administrative remedies before obtaining judicial relief,reasoning that pursuing such remedies would be futile in light of the department manual of policy and procedures section,which states that foster care payments may not be made outside of the country.the court of appeal next reasoned that because the juvenile court was unaware of its authority to order funding were it to place the boys in foster care,on this record it abused its discretion in terminating its dependency jurisdiction.in the court of appeal view,because the evidence of the children was far from convincing,a t a minimum,the juvenile court should have asked whether the children counsel intended to file a section petition to modify the legal guardianship to foster care in order to possibly avail the children of the additional funding.after vacating the order terminating jurisdiction,the court of appeal stated on remand,the children should be permitted a reasonable opportunity to file a section petition.if the children do not file such a petition,the juvenile court may reinstate the order terminating jurisdiction.if the children file a section petition,we express no opinion as to how the juvenile court should rule,other than to observe that the children best interests are paramount to the decision.citation.although we have held that funding is not unavailable simply because the children live in canada,the juvenile court may be called upon to consider any number of factors in deciding whether to grant section relief.
we granted the department petition for review.
discussion 
in its briefs,the department launches a attack on the court of appeal decision.the department challenges both the substance of the court of appeal determination that the boys would be eligible for payments were the guardianship changed to foster care,and the court very power to make that determination.before addressing the former,we consider arguments that implicate the court power.
i.the children eligibility for was before the court of appeal 
on several grounds,the department argues that the question of the children eligibility for was not properly before the court of appeal.none of these arguments has merit.
the department first asserts that because the juvenile court made no judgment or order determining that the children were not eligible for,there was nothing for the court of appeal to review.in making this assertion,the department argues that the juvenile court found only that it did not have the authority to determine if the children were entitled to benefits.thus,the department argues,the court of appeal lacked jurisdiction to make an eligibility determination.
the record does not support the department argument.just before the juvenile court announced its ruling,the department argued that the children lost their eligibility for benefits when they moved to canada and lost their residency in the state of california.the juvenile court then stated that it was terminating its dependency jurisdiction,explaining in relevant part these children are permanent residents of canada w hen a child in the state of california leaves the state of california for a legal guardianship in another state,we can not provide funds to that state i f we do foster care in another state,we can provide benefits i am not aware that children in another country can get funding if they are in foster care i do not believe that this court is empowered to grant funding to a relative in another country with children in a legal guardianship who are permanent residents of that country and i do not believe this court has the authority to provide funds for the grandmother in canada,under any theory of law.fairly read,these comments support the court of appeal view that the juvenile court found the children were not eligible for public assistance from california under any theory of law because they had become residents of canada.indeed,contrary to its current position,in the court of appeal the department similarly described the juvenile court decision,stating the juvenile court found that the children were not eligible for funding from california because they were residing in canada.on this record,the department argument fails.
the department next argues that the children notice of appeal was insufficient to put their eligibility at issue.in making this argument,the department cites the language of the notice,which stated that the children were appealing from the o rders of the juvenile court issued august,terminating jurisdiction in this matter without first resolving whether the children will continue to receive funding.italics added.based on the italicized language in the notice,the department asserts that the children did not even attempt to appeal from an order actually mak ing an eligibility determination.thus,the department argues,the court of appeal had no jurisdiction to address or decide the eligibility issue.
the department overly technical attempt to parse the notice of appeal language is unmeritorious.i t is,and has been,the law of this state that notices of appeal are to be liberally construed so as to protect the right of appeal if it is reasonably clear what the appellant was trying to appeal from,and where the respondent could not possibly have been misled or prejudiced.luz lopes cal d,see also rule a notice of appeal must be liberally construed.a notice of appeal is sufficient if it identifies the particular judgment or order being appealed.rule a.the notice in this case clearly met this requirement by identifying the juvenile court order of august,terminating jurisdiction in this matter.to the extent,if any,the phrase without first resolving whether the children will continue to receive funding created ambiguity,there is no showing that the department was or could have been misled or prejudiced because of the arguably ambiguous language.luz,supra,at.thus,the department is incorrect in asserting that the notice of appeal was insufficient to give the court of appeal jurisdiction to review the juvenile court eligibility determination.
the department also argues that because the children never applied for,the issue of whether they were eligible for benefits was not ripe for review by any court.according to the department,u ntil the children apply for and are denied benefits,the laws and regulations governing their eligibility generate no more than a difference of opinion.
for several reasons,we reject the department ripeness argument.first,the department did not make the argument in the court of appeal.as a policy matter,we normally will not consider an issue that the petitioner failed to timely raise in the court of appeal.rule c.second,the argument fails on its merits.the issue before the juvenile court was whether exceptional circumstances existed such that it should not terminate its dependency jurisdiction notwithstanding the children placement for at least months with a relative whom the court had appointed their legal guardian,subd.a.under joshua i,to answer that question,the court had to determine,among other things,whether the children would be eligible for benefits were it to retain jurisdiction and change the guardianship to foster care.thus,contrary to the department assertion,the ripeness requirement,which prevents courts from issuing purely advisory opinions,or considering a hypothetical state of facts in order to give general guidance rather than to resolve a specific legal dispute hunt superior court cal th,d,was satisfied in this case.
ii.exhaustion of administrative remedies 
in the court of appeal,the department argued that a judicial determination of the children eligibility for benefits was unavailable until the children invoked and exhausted the administrative process for obtaining benefits by filing an application for benefits and requesting a hearing were the application denied.in rejecting this claim,the court of appeal first found that because section,subdivision a,gives a juvenile court authority to make any and all reasonable orders for the maintenance and support of a child who has been adjudged a dependent child under section,a juvenile court has the authority to order the department to make payments were the boys placed in foster care with g randmother in canada.it then found that the children did not have to pursue administrative remedies before obtaining judicial relief,reasoning that resort to the administrative process would be futile because it is clear what the agency decision would be.the court explained t he department manual of policy and procedures section states that foster care payments may not be made outside of the country.thus,it seems clear that the this case the on its own manual of policy and procedures,would decide that foster care payments could not be made to the children because they have been placed with grandmother in canada.since the result of the administrative process is obvious,there would be no benefit to requiring the administrative proceedings to take their course.
the court of appeal analysis is flawed in several respects.first,the court erred in finding that section,subdivision a,gives the juvenile court authority to order the department to make payments without an administrative determination of the children eligibility for those payments.section,subdivision a,provides in part that a juvenile court may make any and all reasonable orders for the care,maintenance,and support of a child who has been adjudged a dependent child under section,and may,after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard,join in the juvenile court proceedings any agency that the court determines has failed to meet a legal obligation to provide services to the child.however,this section also provides that a juvenile court has no authority to order services unless it has been determined through the administrative process of an agency that has been joined as a party,that the child is eligible for those services,subd.a,italics added.the plain language of this provision establishes that a juvenile court may not order the department actually to make,to provide the administrative process is invoked and it is determined through that process that the children are eligible for payments.the court of appeal erred insofar as it held otherwise 
second,the court of appeal justification for applying the futility assumption that the department would follow section of the inconsistent with our case law.in lindeleaf agricultural labor relations bd.cal d,the petitioner sought to challenge an agency regulations in court without first raising his objection in the administrative process.in finding that the petitioner had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies,we first explained that courts ordinarily accord administrative agencies the initial opportunity to address claims involving interpretation of their own regulations ibid.we then rejected the petitioner reliance on the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement,explaining the futility exception demands that the petitioner state with assurance that the agency would rule adversely in the petitioner own particular case.citations.because the issue had never been presented to the agency,its probable decision could not be forecast.to permit the petitioner retroactively to the agen
