following the accident,complained of pain,headaches,and photophobia an abnormal intolerance of light,and saw a number of doctors.in august,saw arnold schoolman,a neurosurgeon.despite her complaints,the neurological exam was normal.the doctor diagnosed a mild cerebral concussion,neck and spine injuries,and carpal tunnel disease and prescribed physical therapy.attended several therapy sessions and had trigger point injections and epidural nerve blocks.in february,schoolman opined that pain had an emotional overlay.in march,she was hospitalized overnight for a probable adverse reaction to zoloft,an.
in september,saw ian belson,an osteopath,who suggested that her complaints were out of proportion to her injury and might have had a psychogenic overlay.belson recommended a comprehensive pain management approach.in november,saw robert takacs,who was associated with a spine clinic.takacs diagnosed chronic cervical strain with bulging discs and syndrome and suggested that was magnifying her symptoms.he referred her to melvin karges,a physiatrist in november,karges diagnosed cervical strain and referred her to bernard abrams,a neurologist.
from december through april,was treated by abrams.the doctor treatment notes show over office visits and telephone calls for complaints of pain in her back,legs,shoulders,hands,severe headaches,and photophobia.among other things,abrams prescribed pain medications,including tylox,skelaxin,and oxycontin.in february,abrams discussed with the possibility that her condition might be psychogenic in origin.in july,he recommended an antidepressant,which she refused to take because of her previous adverse reaction to zoloft.abrams also referred to a pain and headache clinic,where she received physical therapy,cervical epidural nerve blocks,and trigger point injections.in october,abrams wrote that was suffering from the effects of the car accident,including severe photophobia,and neck and shoulder pain,and that she could not return to work.
in march,abrams referred to the mayo clinic.she traveled by airplane from kansas city,missouri,to rochester,minnesota.from march to her discharge on april,had numerous evaluations for her complaints of severe headaches face,neck,and back pain dizziness photophobia left leg and arm weakness,pain,and numbness hoarseness and ringing in her ears.sherwin goldman,who was with the mayo impairment evaluation center,noted that most of her examinations were essentially normal,but that an mri examination showed advanced degenerative spondylitic changes in the cervical spine,with impingement on the spinal cord.the doctor diagnosed chronic pain syndrome and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.two neurologists who examined also diagnosed chronic pain syndrome,with one suggesting a strong functional overlay.at the conclusion of her stay,goldman recommended a pain management program,noting surgery was not indicated.told the doctor that she could not enroll in such a program because her insurance was running out.
after reviewing the mayo clinic findings,abrams recommended a pain management program,but declined at that time.abrams continued to prescribe medications for pain,including tylox and oxycontin.at the request of her attorney,in june,abrams wrote that had a closed head injury resulting in photophobia and severe headache and chronic cervical and neck pain related to disc disease and could not return to work because of the impairments.in december,abrams referred to loeb,a chiropractor.from december to january,she saw loeb two to three times a week for physical therapy,acupuncture,massage,and electrical stimulation.
in february,appeared before an administrative law judge alj,seated in a wheelchair and wearing a hat and sun glasses,testified that since the accident in she had had constant pain in her back,neck,and shoulders light sensitivity headaches numbness in her arms,fingers,and left leg and problems with her knees and ankles.she claimed that if she took off her hat,she would lose her voice.stated that she had not had surgery,but noted the only recommended surgery was for her carpal tunnel syndrome and she was planning on having that surgery.stated that she could only sit for about one and a half hours and did not cook,drive,do housework,laundry,or grocery shop,noting her daughter did many of the household chores.stated that she had no outside activities and spent most of her day lying down.although she said she had concentration problems,denied being depressed or having any other psychiatric problems,admitting she did not keep an appointment for a consultative psychiatric examination.a friend submitted a statement corroborating testimony concerning her limited daily activities.
the alj asked a vocational expert to assume that could alternately sit and stand,could not grip or do more than minimal writing,had slight restrictions on daily activities,and few problems with concentration.the expert responded that although could not return to her former job,there were a number of jobs in the national economy she could do,such as information clerk,phone solicitor,and security monitor.however,the expert stated that if had deficiencies in concentration that would prevent her from completing work tasks,there would be no jobs.
at the end of the hearing,the alj told that in order for him to fairly evaluate her condition,she needed to undergo the consultative psychiatric evaluation.pursuant to the alj request,in march,saw scott morrison,a psychiatrist.appeared at the examination wearing a hat and sunglasses,which she did not remove.in reviewing her history,morrison noted that medical examinations showed that she had damage to her spine resulting in a pain syndrome involving severe headaches,photophobia,and back pain,and that she had had extensive medical treatment,but with no improvement.morrison noted that appeared to be in acute distress and did not seem to be exaggerating for effect.morrison found little to suggest malingering or symptom magnification,and no evidence of thought disorder or anything to suggest a psychiatric diagnosis.
in addition to receiving morrison report,the alj received abrams treatment notes from december to april.in december,the alj denied benefits,finding that her allegations of pain were not credible.citing polaski heckler,cir polaski subsequent history omitted,the alj noted that work history and persistence in seeking medical treatment reflected favorably on her credibility.however,the alj found that several factors undermined her credibility,noting there was no objective medical evidence that she needed to use a wheelchair or wear a hat and sunglasses that she might have had a financial motivation in obtaining benefits that she had not complied with prescribed treatment and that some doctors had suggested she had magnified her symptoms.the alj gave no weight to abrams opinions,finding them conclusory.relying on the vocational expert testimony,the alj found that although could not return to her previous job as computer repair technician,she could perform a number of sedentary,unskilled jobs.
sought review in the appeals council,submitting additional evidence,including treatment notes from abrams.a september note indicated that had taken wellbutrin,an,but stopped taking it because it made her sleepy.an october note indicated that she was
