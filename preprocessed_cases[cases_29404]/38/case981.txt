charles frost frost applied for supplemental security income benefits pursuant to title xvi of the social security act the act.an administrative law judge alj concluded that frost was disabled between may,and october,but was not disabled thereafter and could perform simple,unskilled work tasks.
using the guidelines,pt,subpt.p,app,the alj determined that simple,unskilled work suitable for frost is widely available in the national economy and that,accordingly,frost disability does not entitle him to benefits under the act after october.frost argues that the decision of the commissioner to deny him benefits for the period after october,was not supported by substantial evidence,as is required for affirmance.see pagter massanari,cir.
frost sought to be classified as disabled on the ground that he is impaired by paranoid schizophrenia and disorder.frost psychiatrist,richard price price,diagnosed him with both disorders in july,but,according to price notes,frost condition had improved during the year and a half preceding his december,hearing.a course of medication had virtually eliminated his paranoid schizophrenic symptoms and had modified his behavior,although some symptoms remained.
frost challenges this conclusion by pointing first to two statements made by price.on december,price in his medical file noted that frost continued to worry obsessively that his niece might be killed in an automobile accident while sleepwalking.on december,price noted that frost remained quite symptomatic with his disorder and added,i believe that it would be fair to give frost a chance to succeed in the workplace but i would not be surprised if his condition interfered with his ability to be a fully productive employee.these statements do not indicate that frost is disabled instead,the latter statement suggests that frost should be given a chance to work.frost also points to a statement by other therapists who evaluated him in july,whose medical file stated that it would help frost if he obtained a job however,judging from his history,it is questionable whether he could maintain it.although skeptical,this statement also does not specify that frost is too disabled to attempt simple work.
frost also argues that the district court did not properly consider the testimony that he and his sister provided at the hearing before the alj.frost and his sister testified that he obsesses over his niece sleepwalking that he worries about the safety of both of his nieces every night when he goes to bed that he must ask the same question repeatedly because of his poor memory and that he does not drive by himself because he gets lost easily.but there is no reason to assume that these symptoms would interfere with his ability to do the kind of simple work that the alj suggested.
frost also testified that he sleeps from to every day,because his medication makes him drowsy.however,frost stated on july,months before the he was sleeping eight hours nightly.the record suggests that his sleep patterns may have changed because his doctors modified his medications.but as the alj said,there was no showing frost had to stay up late and sleep late,and these purported symptoms do not negate the conclusion that there was substantial evidence for the commissioner decision on frost ability to do simple work.
although frost argues that the alj improperly rejected his testimony as not credible,it rather appears that the alj accepted frost testimony as credible but found that it was not sufficient to demonstrate that he is disabled.however,if the alj finds on remand that frost testimony concerning his impairments is incredible or unreliable,the alj must make a credibility determination with findings sufficiently specific to permit the court to conclude that the alj did not arbitrarily discredit frost testimony.thomas barnhart,cir.
frost correctly notes that while the alj evaluated his disorder under section of the listing of impairments in pt,subpt.p,app.the listings,she did not evaluate his paranoid schizophrenic disorder under section of the listings,which covers schizophrenic,paranoid,and other psychotic disorders.we conclude this omission warrants a remand.
when frost applied for ssi in,section provided as follows 
the required level of severity for these disorders is met when the requirements in both a and b are satisfied,or when the requirements in c are satisfied.
medically documented persistence,either continuous or intermittent,of one or more of the following 
delusions or hallucinations or 
catatonic or other grossly disorganized behavior or 
incoherence,loosening of associations,illogical thinking,or poverty of content of speech if associated with one of the following 
blunt affect or 
flat affect or 
inappropriate affect 
emotional withdrawal isolation.
resulting in at least two of the following 
marked restriction on activities of daily living or 
marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning or 
deficiencies of concentration,persistence or pace resulting in frequent failure to complete tasks in a timely fashion in work settings or elsewhere or 
repeated episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or settings which cause the individual to withdraw from that situation or to experience exacerbation of signs or symptoms which may include deterioration of adaptive behaviors.
medically documented history of one or more episodes of acute symptoms,signs and functional limitations which at the time met the requirements in a and b of this listing,although these symptoms or signs are currently attenuated by medication or psychosocial support,and one of the following 
repeated episodes of deterioration or decompensation in situations which cause the individual to withdraw from that situation or to experience exacerbation of signs or symptoms which may include deterioration of adaptive behaviors or 
documented current history of two or more years of inability to function outside of a highly supportive living situation.
pt,subpt.p,app.
section,which the alj did not review,and section,which the alj did review,have the same structure.in both,the requirements in a involve symptoms that are specific to the disorder under disorders in section,and psychotic disorders such as paranoid schizophrenia in section.in both,the requirements in b involve the effects of those symptoms.the requirements in b are identical in sections and.the magistrate judge,in reviewing the alj decision,reasoned that although section had been ignored,it mattered not because the alj determination that section b was not satisfied meant necessarily that b could not have been satisfied had it been considered.
this reasoning is correct,so far as it goes.but the magistrate judge overlooked an important point,namely,that in both sections part c provides an alternative means of demonstrating disability for those claimants who previously met the section standards and whose symptoms have been treated by medication but who still could not function alone in a work environment.
here,the alj found that frost was disabled from may,to october,because he then met the requirements of sections a and b.she found that during that period he met the requirements in section and.the alj found that after october,frost satisfied only the requirement in.because a claimant must satisfy two of the b criteria,she found that he was no longer disabled.
since the alj did not evaluate frost at all under section,she did not discuss the requirements of section a,nor did she consider the possible application of b or c.it is possible,however,that frost satisfied the requirements of a and b during the period in which she held he was disabled under section.if so,he satisfied the threshold requirements for consideration under consequently,it is possible that he could have been classified as disabled on that basis even after october,if he was able to show that at some point he had met the requirements of a and b,and that currently he was subject to repeated episodes of deterioration or had a documented current history of two or more years of inability to function outside of a highly supportive living situation 
for the above reasons,we conclude that frost may have met the requirements of section under the regulations applicable at the time of his hearing,but the alj failed to address section.the government argues that frost has waived any argument concerning the applicability of section c on the asserted ground that he did not raise it below.however,the record indicates quite clearly that in his opening brief in district court,frost argued that his impairment met or equaled the requirements of section.if he met its requirements,he was entitled to relief.because this issue was properly raised below,and because the district court did not consider the applicability of section c,we reverse and remand the case to the district court with instructions for it to remand to the commissioner for further evaluation of frost disability under section,including 
frost in his appellate brief asserts that if successful he intends to seek attorney fees under the equal access to justice act.the right to attorney fees depends on whether frost is the prevailing party and whether the commissioner position was substantially justified.d.under shalala schaefer,d,frost is the prevailing party because we have remanded his case for further administrative proceedings under sentence four of g.see flores shalala,cir.whether or not the commissioner position was substantially justified,however,should await the making of a timely motion for fees and briefing on that motion.
in light of our disposition of the various issues,we conclude that each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.
affirmed in part,reversed in part,and remanded.
charles frost appeals the district court judgment affirming the decision of the commissioner of social security.the decision denies an award of supplemental security income ssi disability benefits to frost after october,because frost was no longer disabled after that date.we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to.
i would affirm the commissioner decision that frost did not meet the requirements under listing after october.i would also reverse and remand for further proceedings which would ascertain whether frost met the requirements under listing.i write separately because the correct standard of law to be applied on remand is the standard that was in effect at the time of frost original hearing.
in october,frost filed an application for ssi disability benefits asserting that he had been unable to work since may.this application was denied both initially and upon reconsideration.frost then requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.
a hearing before an alj was held in december.frost,his sister,and a vocational expert testified at the hearing in addition,the alj examined medical and mental health records from various mental health practitioners who evaluated frost.
based on the evidence presented,the alj concluded that frost was disabled from may to october.the alj found that frost suffered from a compulsive disorder.the alj also indicated that frost probably suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.because medication had dramatically improved frost medical condition after october,the alj found that even though some of frost symptoms remained,he no longer met the statutory definition of disabled under the social security regulations.the alj then concluded that frost was ineligible for ssi benefits after october.in making her decision,the alj also found that frost had the ability to perform certain types of work,such as that of a kitchen helper or janitor.
frost appealed the alj decision to the appeals council,which denied his request for review.as a result,the alj decision became the commissioner final decision.see.frost sought judicial review of the final decision.the report and recommendation of magistrate judge john weinberg urged affirmance of the commissioner final decision.the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation by an order and judgment entered april.frost petitions for review of the commissioner final decision.
title xvi of the social security act provides ssi disability benefits for persons who are disabled.in order to qualify for ssi disability benefits,a claimant must satisfy both the medical and the vocational components to the statutory definition of disabled.see.
to satisfy the medical component,a claimant must prove an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.a a.
to satisfy the vocational component,a claimant must prove that his or her impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.a b.
the ssi regulations apply a sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is statutorily disabled.see.
at step one,the claimant is required to prove that he is not performing substantial gainful employment.see b.if the claimant fails to meet his burden of proof at step one,the claimant is not statutorily disabled and can not qualify for ssi disability benefits.if the claimant meets his burden of proof at step one,then the claimant can proceed to step two.id.
at step two,the claimant must prove that he has at least one severe impairment.see c.a severe impairment is one that limits the claimant ability to do work.see c.like step one,if the claimant can not meet his burden of proof,the analysis stops but if the claimant meets his burden,then the claimant can proceed to the next step.see c.
at step three,the claimant must prove that his impairment meets or equals an impairment on the listing of impairments listing set forth in pt,subpt.p,app.if the alj finds that the claimant impairment meets or equals an impairment on the listing,then the alj can award ssi disability benefits.see d.
if,at step three,the claimant can not prove that his impairment meets the listing,then at step four the claimant may alternatively prove that he can not perform his past relevant work.if the claimant can perform past relevant work,the claimant will not qualify as statutorily disabled.see e.
if the claimant proves he can not perform his past relevant work,the alj will determine the claimant residual functional capacity.see e.a residual functional capacity is a measure of the physical ability the claimant possesses despite his limitations.see.
taking into consideration a claimant residual functional capacity,the alj at step five then considers whether the claimant can do other work.see f.the alj considers whether there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can perform.in considering whether there are a significant number of jobs that the claimant can do,the alj reviews vocational expert testimony or references the guidelines at pt,subpt.p,app.if the alj finds that there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can do,the alj concludes the claimant is not statutorily disabled and is not entitled to ssi disability benefits if the alj finds that there are not a significant number of jobs in the national economy that the claimant can do,the alj concludes the claimant is disabled and entitled to ssi disability benefits.see f.
frost disputes the alj findings and conclusions at step three and step five only.frost claims that the alj decision that frost did not meet the listings and that frost could perform other work was not based on substantial evidence and contained legal error.
we review de novo the district court judgment affirming a denial of social security benefits.moore commissioner of the soc.sec,cir.we may set aside a denial of disability benefits when an alj findings are not supported by substantial evidence.see g tackett apfel,cir.
substantial evidence means more than a scintilla,but less than a preponderance.richardson perales,d sorenson weinberger,cir.to find substantial evidence,t he court must consider both evidence that supports and evidence that detracts from the alj conclusion it may not affirm simpl
