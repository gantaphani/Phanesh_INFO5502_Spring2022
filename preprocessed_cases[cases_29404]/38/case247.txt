prevailing social security benefits claimants petitioned for attorney fees pursuant to the equal access to justice act,west eaja.in response,the social security commissioner,michael astrue,the commissioner,agreed that a fee award was proper but argued that the fees should be paid to the claimants themselves and not their attorneys.after consolidating the petitions,a federal magistrate judge concluded that attorney fees awarded to a prevailing party under the eaja are directly payable to the corresponding attorney and gave an additional award of fees to the lead plaintiff for litigating the issue.the commissioner appeals,by the plain language of the conclude that attorney fees are payable directly to each claimant and reverse the magistrate judge contrary conclusion.
two sources provide for attorney fees for claimants seeking social security benefits.first,the social security act itself provides that w henever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant who was represented before the court by an attorney,the court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation,not in excess of percent of the total of the benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment b a west supp.further,the commissioner may certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of,and not in addition to,the amount of such benefits.id.emphasis added.
second,social security benefits claimants can receive a fee award under the eaja.congress enacted the eaja in in response to concerns that individuals would be deterred from seeking relief from unreasonable government action because of the expenses incurred in pursuing such relief.see,at.the eaja provides as follows 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action other than cases sounding in tort,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action 
before awarding attorney fees,the eaja requires the party seeking an award of fees to submit to the court an application,which must include an itemized statement from any attorney stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed.id.d b.the eaja defines party,as relevant here,as an individual whose net worth did not exceed at the time the civil action was filed.id.d b.
in,congress harmonized fees payable by the government under eaja with fees payable under b out of the claimant social security benefits by enacting a savings provision.gisbrecht barnhart,d.the savings provision provides 
section b of the social security act shall not prevent an award of fees and other expenses under section d of title,united states code section b of the social security act shall not apply with respect to any such award but only if,where the claimant attorney receives fees for the same work under both section b of that act and section d of title,united states code,the claimant attorney refunds to the claimant the amount of the smaller fee.
note savings provisons.accordingly,while attorney fees may be awarded under both the eaja and b,the savings provision clarifies that the attorney must refund to the claimant the smaller fee.thus,an eaja award offsets an award under section b,so that the amount of the total benefits the claimant actually receives will be increased by the eaja award up to the point the claimant receives percent of the benefits.gisbrecht,at.internal quotation marks,citations,and alterations omitted.
since the enactment of the eaja in,the commissioner has consistently paid attorney fees directly to the attorneys,not the claimants.in fact,the commissioner created a direct deposit system for attorneys and issued forms directly to the attorneys who received awards,noting the awards as taxable attorney income.
recently,however,the commissioner altered this practice and took the position that attorney fees under the eaja were the property of prevailing claimants and not their attorneys.this change was driven,in part,by the debt collection improvement act of.under c west,the federal government collects debts through the means of administrative offset,thus 
any federal agency that is owed by a person a past due,legally enforceable nontax debt that is over days delinquent shall notify the secretary of the treasury of all such nontax debts for purposes of administrative offset under this subsection.
the debt collection improvement act required the department of the treasury,through its financial management service bureau,to create a centralized program for withholding and reducing federal payments pursuant to this administrative offset provision.the program,called the treasury offset program top,provides for collection of obligations including child support,state income taxes,and various federal debts.in,the financial management service began the collection of what the commissioner terms miscellaneous payments,which include payments for attorney fees pursuant to the eaja.appellant br.at.these payments are eligible for offset under e,which provides 
a ll federal payments are eligible for offset under this section.eligible federal payments include,but are not limited to,federal wage,salary,and retirement payments,vendor and expense reimbursement payments,certain benefit payments,travel advances and reimbursements,grants,fees,refunds,judgments,tax refunds,and other payments made by federal agencies.
e emphasis added.
pursuant to these regulations,however,the top may perform an administrative offset only w hen a match occurs,and all other requirements for offset have been met.c.a match occurs when the taxpayer identifying number and name of the payee on a payment record are the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name of the debtor on a delinquent debt record.id.b.
thus,fees,including attorney fees,are a payment eligible to be offset if there is a match.under the commissioner former policy,because the attorneys were paid their fees directly,there would be no match if the claimant that the attorney represented owed a debt to the government.now,however,the commissioner takes the position that fees belong to the claimant and not the attorney.using the top,the commissioner can thus ascertain if the claimant owes a debt to the federal government and,if he or she does,offset the attorney fee payment to cover that debt.
this case arises from attorney fee petitions filed in the united states district court for the district of maryland by individuals who prevailed in their claims for social security benefits.after the commissioner asserted that the fees were payable to the claimants and thus subject to administrative offset,the petitions were consolidated and the parties agreed to proceed before a magistrate judge.following a hearing,the magistrate judge ruled in a thorough written decision on march,that the attorney fees were payable to the attorney,not the claimants,and thus not subject to administrative offset.in addition,the magistrate judge awarded the lead plaintiff,natalie stephens,attorney fees for litigating the issue.the commissioner stipulated to payment in twelve of the cases without waiving its legal position and filed a timely appeal on may.we possess jurisdiction under west and c west.
the commissioner appeal raises a question of statutory interpretation,a quintessential question of law,which we review de novo.united states abuagla,cir.on appeal,the commissioner argues that attorney fees under the eaja,which are available to prevailing part ies,are payable directly to the claimants and not their attorneys.in contrast,stephens contends that fees under the eaja are best understood as payable directly to the attorneys themselves.both sides agree that this issue has engendered a circuit split,with several circuits adopting both positions.compare reeves astrue,cir concluding,in a case involving social security benefits,that fees are payable to the claimant,not attorney manning astrue,cir cert.denied,d same fdl techs.united states,co
