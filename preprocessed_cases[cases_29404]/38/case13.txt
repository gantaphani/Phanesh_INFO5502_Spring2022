the department of veterans affairs va has a process for adjudicating veterans benefits claims for disabilities a va regional office makes an initial decision on the claim and a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek de novo review in the board of veterans appeals.before,a veteran whose claim was denied by the board generally could not obtain further review,but the veterans judicial review act vjra created the court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court,an article i tribunal,to review board decisions adverse to veterans.a veteran must file a notice of appeal with that court within days of the date when the board final decision is properly mailed.a.
after the va denied david henderson claim for supplemental disability benefits,he filed a notice of appeal in the veterans court,missing the filing deadline by days.henderson argued that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable tolling principles.while his appeal was pending,this court decided bowles russell,which held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case is jurisdictional,so that a party failure to file within that period could not be excused.the veterans court concluded that bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the deadline and dismissed henderson untimely appeal.the federal circuit affirmed.
held the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the veterans court does not have jurisdictional consequences.
a branding a procedural rule as going to a court jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction and thus must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.jurisdictional rules may also cause a waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants,since objections may be raised at any time,even after trial.because of these drastic consequences,this court has urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court adjudicatory capacity,its or personal jurisdiction,reed elsevier,muchnick.among the rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are rules,which seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring parties to take certain procedural steps at specified times.although filing deadlines are quintessential rules,congress is free to attach jurisdictional consequences to such rules.arbaugh y h,applied a readily administrable bright line rule to determine whether congress has done so there must be a clear indication that congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional.at.c ontext,including this court interpretation of similar provisions in many years past,is relevant,reed elsevier,supra,at,to whether congress has spoken clearly on this point.
b congress did not clearly prescribe that the deadline here be jurisdictional.
none of the precedents cited by the parties controls here.all of the cases they cite,bowles,supra stone ins,and bowen city of new york,involved review by article iii courts.this case,by contrast,involves review by an article i tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme.instead of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative decisions,this court attempts to ascertain congress intent regarding the particular type of review at issue.
several factors indicate that deadline was not meant to be jurisdictional.the terms of a,which sets the deadline,provide no clear indication that the provision was meant to carry jurisdictional consequences.it neither speaks in jurisdictional terms nor refers in any way to the jurisdiction of the veterans court,zipes trans world airlines.nor does placement within the vjra provide such an indication.its placement in a subchapter entitled procedure,and not in the subchapter entitled organization and jurisdiction,suggests that congress regarded the limit as a rule.most telling,however,are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that congress created for adjudicating veterans benefits claims.congress longstanding solicitude for veterans,united states oregon,is plainly reflected in the vjra and in subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of va decisions.the contrast between ordinary civil litigation which provided the context in bowles and the system congress created for veterans is dramatic.in ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be commenced within a specified limitations period the litigation is adversarial plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion both parties may appeal an adverse decision and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.by contrast,a veteran need not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period the va proceedings are informal and nonadversarial and the va assists veterans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence.a veteran who loses before the board may obtain review in the veterans court,but a board decision in the veteran favor is final.and a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence.rigid jurisdictional treatment of the period would clash sharply with this scheme.particularly in light of the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the armed services are to be construed in the beneficiaries favor,king vincent hospital,this court sees no clear indication that the limit was intended to carry the harsh consequences that accompany the jurisdiction tag.contrary to the government argument,the lack of review opportunities for veterans before is of little help in interpreting a.section a was enacted as part of the vjra,and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.

justice alito delivered the opinion of the court.
a veteran whose claim for federal benefits is denied by the board of veterans appeals may appeal to the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court.to do so,the veteran must file a notice of appeal with the veterans court within days after the date when the board final decision is properly mailed.a.this case presents the question whether a veteran failure to file a notice of appeal within the period should be regarded as having jurisdictional consequences.we hold that it should not.
the department of veterans affairs va administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with disabilities.the va has a process for the adjudication of these claims.first,a va regional office receives and processes veterans claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.second,if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office decision,the veteran may obtain de novo review by the board of veterans appeals.the board is a body within the va that makes the agency final decision in cases appealed to it,a.
the va adjudicatory process is designed to function throughout with a high degree of informality and solicitude for the claimant.walters national of radiation survivors.a veteran faces no time limit for filing a claim,and once a claim is filed,the va process for adjudicating it at the regional office and the board is ex parte and nonadversarial,cfr a,c.the va has a statutory duty to assist veterans in developing the evidence necessary to substantiate their claims.a,supp.iii,ed.and when evaluating claims,the va must give veterans the benefit of the doubt whenever positive and negative evidence on a material issue is roughly equal.b.if a regional office denies a claim,the veteran has a generous time limit to initiate an appeal to the board.b cfr a.a veteran may also reopen a previously denied claim at any time by presenting new and material evidence,and decisions by a regional office or the board are subject to challenge at any time based on clear and unmistakable error,
before,a veteran whose claim was rejected by the va was generally unable to obtain further review.a ed.but the veterans judicial review act vjra,stat.codified,as amended,in various sections of ed.and supp.iii,created the veterans court,an article i tribunal,and authorized that court to review board decisions adverse to veterans,a ed.while proceedings before the veterans court are adversarial,see,veterans have a remarkable record of success before that tribunal.statistics compiled by the veterans court show that in the last decade,the court ordered some form of relief in around percent of its merits decisions.
review of veterans court decisions on certain issues of law is available in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.federal circuit decisions may in turn be reviewed by this court by writ of certiorari.
david henderson served in the military during the korean war.in,the va gave henderson a disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia,and in,he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for care.after a va regional office and the board denied his claim,he filed a notice of appeal with the veterans court,but he missed the filing deadline by days.see a.
the veterans court initially dismissed henderson appeal as untimely.it concluded that henderson was not entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had not shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing.later,the court granted henderson motion for reconsideration,revoked the dismissal,and set the case for argument.while henderson appeal was pending,however,we decided bowles russell.in bowles,we held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of the time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case,c,supp.iii,is jurisdictional,and we therefore held that a party failure to file a notice of appeal within that period could not be excused based on equitable factors,or on the opposing party forfeiture or waiver of any objection to the late filing.bowles,supra,at.
after we announced our decision in bowles,the veterans court directed the parties to brief that decision effect on prior federal circuit precedent that allowed the equitable tolling of the deadline for filing a notice of appeal in the veterans court.a divided panel of the veterans court concluded that bowles compelled jurisdictional treatment of the deadline and dismissed henderson untimely appeal for lack of jurisdiction.henderson peake,vet.app.
henderson then appealed to the federal circuit,and a divided en banc court affirmed.we granted certiorari.
in this case,as in others that have come before us in recent years,we must decide whether a procedural rule is jurisdictional.see reed elsevier,muchnick,union pacific locomotive engineers and trainmen comm.of adjustment,central region,bowles,supra arbaugh y h,eberhart united states,per curiam scarborough principi,kontrick ryan.this question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.branding a rule as going to a court jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.under that system,courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.see oregon.courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.but federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction,and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.see arbaugh,supra,at.
jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.for purposes of efficiency and fairness,our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.see,supra,at.objections to jurisdiction,however,may be raised at any time.thus,a party,after losing at trial,may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked jurisdiction.arbaugh,at.indeed,a party may raise such an objection even if the party had previously acknowledged the trial court jurisdiction.ibid.and if the trial court lacked jurisdiction,many months of work on the part of the attorneys and the court may be wasted.
because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic,we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.we have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court adjudicatory capacity,that is,its or personal jurisdiction.reed elsevier,supra,at slip,at kontrick,supra,at.other rules,even if important and mandatory,we have said,should not be given the jurisdictional brand.see union pacific,at slip,at.
among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called rules.these are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times,at slip,at eberhart,supra,at scarborough,supra,at kontrick,supra,at.filing deadlines,such as the filing deadline at issue here,are quintessential rules.accordingly,if we were simply to apply the strict definition of jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent cases,we would reverse the decision of the federal circuit,and this opinion could end at this point.
unfortunately,the question before us is not quite that simple because congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a rule.see bowles,supra,at.the question here,therefore,is whether congress mandated that the deadline be jurisdictional.in arbaugh,we applied a readily administrable bright line rule for deciding such questions,at.under arbaugh,we look to see if there is any clear indication that congress wanted the rule to be jurisdictional.ibid.this approach is suited to capture congress likely intent and also provides helpful guidance for courts and litigants,who will be duly instructed regarding a rule nature.see,at,and.
congress,of course,need not use magic words in order to speak clearly on this point.c ontext,including this court interpretation of similar provisions in many years past,is relevant.reed elsevier,supra,at slip,at.when a long line of this court decisions left undisturbed by congress,union pacific,supra,at slip,at,has treated a similar requirement as jurisdictional,we will presume that congress intended to follow that course.see john sand gravel united states.
with these principles in mind,we consider whether congress clearly prescribed that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the veterans court should be jurisdictional.
contending that the filing deadline was meant to be jurisdictional,the government maintains that bowles is controlling.the government reads bowles to mean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in civil cases are jurisdictional.since a establishes a statutory deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case,the government reasons,that deadline is jurisdictional.
we reject the major premise of this syllogism.bowles did not hold categorically that every deadline for seeking judicial review in civil litigation is jurisdictional.instead,bowles concerned an appeal from one court to another court.the century worth of precedent and practice in american courts on which bowles relied involved appeals of that type.see,at,and.
contending that bowles reasoning extends to the judicial review of administrative decisions,the government relies on stone ins.there,without elaboration,we described as mandatory and jurisdictional the deadline for seeking review in the courts of appeals of final removal orders of the board of immigration appeals,at quoting missouri jenkins.the government also notes that lower court decisions have uniformly held that the hobbs act time limit for filing a p
