shirley bledsoe bledsoe appeals from a final decision of the merit systems protection board the board dismissing her appeal,which alleged,pursuant to c,that the u.postal service the postal service wrongly denied her restoration following her partial recovery from a compensable injury.see bledsoe postal,no.ch i.for the reasons discussed below,this court affirms.
background 
bledsoe was a level automation mail processing clerk at the south suburban processing and distribution center in bedford park illinois.bledsoe was injured on february,and filed a claim that was accepted by the office of workers compensation programs.bledsoe partially recovered and,beginning in april,the postal service provided her with a modified light duty assignment.in june,pursuant to the national reassessment process,the postal service informed bledsoe that work within her medical restrictions was no longer available within her local commuting area.bledsoe appealed to the board,and the postal service moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
in its initial acknowledgment order of august,the board explained that bledsoe bore the burden of establishing jurisdiction,which required her to provide an evidentiary basis to show that the postal service arbitrarily and capriciously denied her restoration.the board stated,in the same order,that the record on jurisdiction would close calendar days following the date of the order,and that n o evidence or argument on the jurisdictional issue filed after the close of record will be accepted unless you show that it is new and material evidence that was unavailable before the record closed.bledsoe postal,no.ch i,acknowledgment order.bledsoe did not respond,and the postal service response included a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
rather than dismiss bledsoe appeal,the board,on october,conducted a telephone status conference.on october,the board issued an order summarizing the telephone status conference.in that order,the board reiterated that,to establish jurisdiction,bledsoe ultimately had to prove by preponderant evidence that the postal service arbitrarily and capriciously denied her request for restoration.the board further explained that this required bledsoe to identify a vacant position,or positions,within miles of the south suburban processing and distribution center that bledsoe could perform with her medical restrictions.bledsoe postal,no.ch i,order and summary of status conference.
in the same order,the board stated that a hearing will be scheduled only if the appellant establishes a allegation of jurisdiction over her restoration appeal.id.at.the board gave bledsoe until october,to respond,thus extending the close of record by one month,and admonished bledsoe that n o evidence or argument filed after that date will be accepted into the record absent a showing of good cause for such untimely filing and that u nless the appellant provides a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction by no later than the close of record date,the board will dismiss her appeal without holding a hearing.id.at.
on october,bledsoe responded without identifying any vacant position.on november,the board issued its initial decision dismissing her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.there the board found that bledsoe did not make a allegation that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious because she did not identify a vacant position within her local commuting area that she can perform within her medical restrictions.initial decision.in its decision,the board explained that a lthough the appellant requested a hearing,she is not entitled to one because she failed to make a allegation the board has jurisdiction over her appeal.id.at.the board therefore stated that t he appeal is adjudicated on the written record.id.
on november,after the close of record,and after the initial decision dismissing her appeal,bledsoe filed an amended jurisdictional order,making reference to three door monitor positions which the postal service declared necessary work.respondent app.bledsoe did not,however,file a petition for review before the board.
bledsoe appeal to the board also included a pendent discrimination claim,which the board also dismissed for lack of jurisdiction due to the absence of an appealable adverse action.
the board decision dismissing bledsoe appeal became final on december.bledsoe timely appealed,and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the board determination that it lacked jurisdiction to hear bledsoe appeal is a legal issue which this court reviews de novo.forest merit.prot.findings of fact underlying the board jurisdictional decision are reviewed for substantial evidence.parrott merit.prot,citing bolton merit.prot.
the board jurisdiction is limited and must be proven by petitioner 
as this court has previously explained,t he board is an independent,federal administrative agency with the responsibility,inter alia,to adjudicate appeals of adverse personnel actions taken by a federal agency against its employees.garcia of homeland,en banc citations omitted.
the board jurisdiction is established by statute.a provides 
an employee,or applicant for employment,may submit an appeal to the merit systems protection board from any action which is appealable to the board under any law,rule,or regulation appeals shall be processed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board.
this court has interpreted this statute to mean that t he jurisdiction of the board is not plenary,but is limited to those areas specifically granted by statute or regulation in other words,jurisdiction for the b oard to hear a particular type of action must be granted by some law,rule or regulation.garcia,at citations omitted see also monasteri merit.prot,this court has repeatedly recognized that the board jurisdiction is not plenary rather,it is limited to actions designated as appealable to the board under any law,rule or regulation.quotation omitted maddox merit.prot,same serrao merit.prot,the jurisdiction of the board is not plenary.rather,it is limited to those matters specifically entrusted to it by statute or regulation.emphasis added.
as this court has explained,congress has not directly spoken to an employee burden of proof for establishing the board jurisdiction.garcia,at quoting chevron natural res.def.council,d.but k provides that the board may prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of this section and,as this court noted in garcia,p ursuant to this statutory authority,the board has promulgated regulations to carry out.at.a states that the appellant has the burden of proof,by a preponderance of the evidence,with respect to i ssues of jurisdiction.in garcia,this court held that this regulation is neither arbitrary,capricious,or manifestly contrary to the statute,and is therefore entitled to deference and is lawful.at.as this court explained,the regulation clearly requires that the claimant establish jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence,independent of whether facts relevant to deciding the merits overlap with the facts relevant to deciding jurisdiction.id.at.
in garcia,this court distinguished numerous cases regarding article iii jurisdiction as inapposite in rejecting the view that board jurisdiction attaches when an employee makes claims.id.at citing duke power carolina envtl.study,d montana dakota utils.nw.pub.serv.bell hood.the fair kohler die specialty.arbaugh y h,d.
rather,in garcia,this court explained that t here is nothing in the plain language of the statute requiring or even suggesting a standard nor that congress intended that,in cases in which jurisdictional issues and merits issues overlap,the board is required to follow the standards for jurisdiction applicable to article iii courts.at.i nasmuch as the board is not an article iii court,we fail to see how the backdrop of standards applicable to article iii court jurisdiction suggests that congress intended those standards to apply to this administrative agency.id.at also finding suggestions that congress specifically did not intend concepts from article iii courts to be used by the board.
as this court further explained in garcia,establishing jurisdiction at the board is a process.first,a petitioner must meet the threshold requirement of making allegations of fact which,if true,would be sufficient to establish the board jurisdiction.id.at.if the petitioner makes allegations to support jurisdiction,then and only then will the petitioner be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which the petitioner must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence.see id.at o nce a claimant makes nonfrivolous claims of board jurisdiction,namely claims that,if proven,establish the board jurisdiction,then the claimant has a right to a hearing.at the hearing,the claimant must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.after the petitioner has proven jurisdiction by preponderant evidence,then and only then is the board free to reach the merits of the petitioner appeal.if the board determines that the claimant fails to prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence,then the board does not have jurisdiction and the case is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.id.when the board lacks jurisdiction,it can not decide the merits of the case.id.at.
because the board jurisdiction is limited rather than plenary,and because the petitioner must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence,including on issues that overlap with the merits,it is crucial to identify at the outset the jurisdictional requirements of any given appeal.
jurisdiction in partial recovery restoration appeals 
entitled appellate jurisdiction,states,in relevant part,that the board has jurisdiction over appeals from agency actions when the appeals are authorized by law,rule,or regulation including f ailure to restore following partial or full recovery from a compensable injury.thus,the board jurisdiction over appeals from certain denials of restoration is established by,which provides emphasis added 
a except as provided in paragraphs b and c of this section,an injured employee or former employee of an agency in the executive branch including the postal service and the postal rate commission may appeal to the mspb an agency failure to restore,improper restoration,or failure to return an employee following a leave of absence.all appeals must be submitted in accordance with mspb regulations.
b an individual who fully recovers from a compensable injury more than year after compensation begins may appeal to mspb as provided for in parts and of this chapter for excepted and competitive service employees,respectively.
c an individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to mspb for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration.upon reemployment,a partially recovered employee may also appeal the agency failure to credit time spent on compensation for purposes of rights and benefits based on length of service.
thus,subsection c limits the otherwise broad jurisdiction established by subsection a in the case of an employee who is only partially recovered from a compensable injury.the board has held that in order to establish jurisdiction under c,a petitioner must prove that 
s he was absent from her position due to a compensable injury she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a basis,or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her the agency denied her request for restoration and the denial was arbitrary and capricious.
chen postal,quotation omitted.
the basis for jurisdiction established by c reflects the limited substantive right enjoyed by partially recovered employees.employees who recover fully within a year have the unconditional right to restoration under a and b.see gallo united states,explaining that section provides an absolute right to an employee who is injured and who recovers within one year to return to his old job or an equivalent position.emphasis added quoting,as reprinted in.by contrast,partially recovered employees only enjoy a right to have the agency make every effort to restore them in the local commuting area and according to the circumstances in each case.d.in other words,partially recovered employees do not have an absolute or unconditional right to restoration and a partially recovered petitioner alleging nothing more than that she has been denied restoration,has not invoked a legally protected interest before the board.
because partially recovered employees do not have an unconditional right to restoration,they do not have the right to appeal every denial of restoration.the arbitrarily and capriciously requirement of section c limits jurisdiction to appeals where the substantive rights of partially recovered petitioners under section d are actually alleged to have been violated.see,palmer merit.prot,the word except,as used in section a,simply alludes to the fact that not all employees to whom sections b and c apply have restoration rights in all circumstances and the board has jurisdiction over a restoration appeal by an employee who has partially recovered from an injury only in the situations enumerated in c.quotations and citations omitted emphasis added sanchez postal,finding jurisdiction because e vidence that the agency failed to search the commuting area as required by d constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration.
while it might seem natural,at first blush,to view subsection c inclusion of the term arbitrarily and capriciously to be nothing more than a standard of review,rather than a jurisdictional requirement,to do so would be to ignore the text of sections d and a and c and would foist jurisdiction upon the board over appeals brought by partially recovered petitioners who do not even allege that they did not receive the requisite effort to restore.the board would then have jurisdiction to decide the merits of a claim that does not actually exist.not even the article iii jurisdiction cases,cited above,support such a result.reed elsevier,muchnick,d holding,in article iii context,that copyright registration requirement imposes a precondition to filing a claim that is not clearly labeled jurisdictional,is not located in a provision,and admits of congressionally authorized exceptions and thus imposes a type of precondition to suit that supports nonjurisdictional treatment.arbaugh,at also in article iii context,holding statutory element that appears in a separate statutory provision that does not speak in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts to be nonjurisdictional quotation omitted.
accordingly,we hold that to establish jurisdiction under c the petitioner must prove by preponderant evidence absence due to a compensable injury sufficient recovery from the injury to return to duty on a part time basis or in a less physically demanding position agency denial of a request for restoration and denial of restoration rendered arbitrary and capricious by agency failure to perform its obligations under d.
bledsoe failure to establish jurisdiction 
in the present case,the board found that bledsoe had carried her burden as to the first three jurisdictional elements,but had not carried it as to the fourth.specifically,the board acknowledged that the postal service had fulfilled its duty to conduct a search for vacant positions in bledsoe local commuting area that she would be able to perform and found none.bledsoe failed to allege any facts to refute that showing.the board thus concluded that bledsoe had failed to make a allegation of fact showing the postal service action to be arbitrary and capricious and determined that it lacked jurisdiction over bledsoe appeal.
on appeal to this court,bledsoe argues only that the board erred because the postal service did not offer her a light duty assignment and because there was work available in the facility.petitioner br.the only factual averment potentially bearing on that argument is bledsoe supplemental jurisdictional statement contending that three door monitor positions were necessary work.respondent app.as noted above,this statement was filed not only after the close of record d
