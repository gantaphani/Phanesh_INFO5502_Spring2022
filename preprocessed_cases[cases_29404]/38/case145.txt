plaintiffs raymond feifer,nicholas pocchia,and edwin molina,former employees of the defendant daily news,dnlp,appeal from a judgment of the united states district court for the eastern district of new york leo glasser,judge denying their motions for summary judgment,granting the defendants motions for summary judgment on their counterclaims,and granting the motion of defendant prudential insurance company of america prudential for a declaratory judgment.the plaintiffs seek enforcement under the employee retirement income security act of,as amended,et.erisa,of the terms of a document that dnlp distributed to its employees but now claims does not constitute an employee benefits plan pursuant to erisa.we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
the facts underlying this appeal,largely undisputed,are set forth in detail by the district court in its thoughtful opinion disposing of the motions for summary judgment.see pocchia prudential ins,d.they are rehearsed here only insofar as is necessary to explain our resolution of this appeal.
in,after a strike by its delivery drivers,the new york daily news and its associated businesses the daily news were acquired by maxwell newspapers,maxwell.by late,the newspaper was foundering.at that time,mortimer zuckerman,then a principal of news world report,caused dnlp to be formed for the purpose of buying the daily news.zuckerman also became a dnlp principal.in late or early,dnlp bought the daily news from maxwell.
one task confronting dnlp in the course of this acquisition was instituting a benefit plan to cover former maxwell employees whose services were sought for the continued publication of the newspaper.the plaintiffs were among those employees.
dnlp written agreement to purchase the daily news expressed dnlp intention to institute benefit plans for exempt daily news workers similar to those provided by news world report,to its employees.but on january,dnlp issued a memorandum to its new employees announcing that a new benefits plan would be in effect as of february,without reference to the news world report plan.attached to that memorandum was a booklet entitled daily news,benefits program summary the program summary,which summarized dnlp benefits,including medical insurance,life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance,in addition to vacation and holiday policies.two pages of the program summary described disability benefits.one of the five paragraphs in the section entitled disability read disability benefits will be offset by any payments for which you are eligible under the state disability benefits law or the workers compensation law.the section entitled long term disability,which immediately followed,contained no analogous provision.both the and disability benefits were stated to be of weekly base salary,a reduction from the of weekly salary that had been provided by the maxwell plan.
several of the program summary pages,but not the two discussing disability benefits,contained the following disclaimer,printed in small,bold type 
this summary is for informational purposes only and is not intended to cover all details of the plan.the actual provisions of the plan will govern in settling any questions that may arise.
there is no indication in the record,however,that,at that time,dnlp or its employees possessed a written document describing benefits under the plan other than the program summary and the accompanying memorandum and although the plaintiffs continued to work for dnlp after the acquisition,they received no further written communications from dnlp regarding disability benefits during the course of their employment.
at or before the time dnlp distributed the program summary to its employees,it began making premium payments to prudential to cover benefits for its employees.nothing in the record suggests,however,that it informed its employees in general,or the plaintiffs in particular,of that fact.
on september,dnlp insurance broker sent dnlp a draft benefit booklet describing in detail benefits for dnlp employees.unlike the program summary,the draft benefit booklet specified that disability benefits were subject to an offset for social security disability and workers compensation payments received by employees.neither dnlp nor prudential distributed the draft benefit booklet to dnlp employees in general,or to the plaintiffs in particular.dnlp and prudential exchanged several revised versions of the benefit booklet over the next few years.they did not,however,execute a benefits plan they were to call the group contract until july,some four and years after the dnlp acquisition.the group contract incorporated a version of the benefit booklet,which,like previous versions but unlike the program summary,specified that disability benefits are subject to social security and workers compensation offsets.
in august,some seven months after the program summary had been distributed and about one month before dnlp first received a draft benefit booklet,plaintiff nicholas pocchia became disabled as a result of a accident.he promptly applied for and began to receive disability benefits that were reduced by the amount of his workers compensation payments in accordance with the terms of the program summary.after six months,pocchia also applied for and began to receive disability benefits.at the same time,pocchia applied for and began to receive social security disability insurance payments.in october,more than two and years after the program summary had been distributed and more than two years after he had become disabled,pocchia received a letter from prudential indicating that his benefits were subject to a social security offset.the letter included a form,a reimbursement agreement,for pocchia signature.although the reimbursement agreement does not appear in the record,the parties agree that it was similar if not identical to the reimbursement agreement received by plaintiff raymond feifer,which contained the following language 
i understand that the policy requires that my disability benefits for any month or partial month as sic reduced by workers compensation and any benefits received under the social security act that i or members of my family receive,or would be entitled to receive as a result of my disability,for that same monthly period.
the agreement also provided that the disabled employee promised to reimburse prudential if his social security benefits were awarded retroactively for a period during which the employee was receiving benefits without offsets.pocchia did not sign the agreement.prudential therefore reduced pocchia disability benefits by prudential estimate of pocchia monthly social security payments.
feifer also took disability leave in august.he too applied for and obtained,and then,disability benefits.feifer also received a letter and reimbursement agreement like those received by pocchia and containing the language.feifer asserts that,in response,he telephoned prudential,and was told that he was required to sign the reimbursement agreement to receive benefits.the defendants aver that feifer would have been told only that if he did not sign the reimbursement agreement,social security offsets would have been made on the basis of estimates,as they were in pocchia case.feifer executed the agreement and returned it to prudential.he thereafter received disability benefits from prudential offset by the amount of the actual social security payments made to him.
at some point in or,plaintiff edwin molina also became injured and also progressed from to disability.in may,prudential sent molina a letter and reimbursement agreement like those it sent feifer and pocchia.molina asserts that upon receiving the reimbursement agreement he telephoned prudential and was told that his disability benefits would be reduced by any social security payments he received.molina further asserts that the representative also told him that he would receive no benefits if he did not sign the reimbursement agreement.like feifer,but unlike pocchia,molina signed and submitted the reimbursement agreement,and subsequently received disability benefits reduced by the amount of his actual social security payments rather than the estimated payments.
the litigation 
in,pocchia and molina filed a action relating to these events,which the defendants removed to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york.feifer similar action,filed against the same defendants in the district court in january,was consolidated with that of pocchia and molina.the three plaintiffs alleged that their rights under erisa were violated when the defendants reduced,or sought to reduce,the plaintiffs disability benefits by the amounts of their social security payments,and,in pocchia case,his workers compensation payments.the defendants asserted in their answers that the social security and workers compensation offsets were binding on the plaintiffs under the terms of the group contract,executed in by dnlp and prudential.the defendants also counterclaimed against molina and pocchia for alleged overpayments of disability benefits disbursed before their offsets were calculated in support of their counterclaims against molina,the defendants argued that he was obligated,under the terms of the reimbursement agreement he signed,to return disability overpayments.no such argument was made with regard to pocchia,who had declined to execute a reimbursement agreement.all parties then moved for summary judgment,and prudential moved for a declaratory judgment to the effect that its reduction of the plaintiffs benefits was proper,and for an award of costs and attorney fees pursuant to g.
on november,the district court issued a decision denying the plaintiffs motions for summary judgment granting the defendants motions for summary judgment granting prudential motion for a declaratory judgment to the extent of the district court holdings in its memorandum opinion and denying prudential motion for an award of costs and fees.pocchia,d at.the district court held that the terms of the program summary and the group contract regarding disability benefits did not conflict,and thus that the plaintiffs were bound by the offset provision in the group contract.id.at.in the alternative,the district court rejected the plaintiffs claims because they were unable to show detrimental reliance upon,or prejudice resulting from the existence of,the program summary.id.at.the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim against pocchia because it concluded that prudential had underestimated the amount of pocchia social security payments and thus overpaid him.id.at.the district court also granted summary judgment to the defendants on their counterclaim against molina based on his failure to abide by the terms of the reimbursement agreement,in which he promised to return to prudential any overpayment of benefits resulting from a miscalculation of his social security payments.id.at.in so holding,the district court rejected molina argument that he had signed the reimbursement agreement under economic duress and thus is not bound by its terms.id.at.finally,the district court denied prudential motion for an award of costs and attorneys fees,finding that the plaintiffs did not bring their actions in bad faith.id.at.

standard of review 
we review a district court grant of summary judgment de novo,construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.tenenbaum williams,cir,cert.denied,d.a district court must grant a motion for summary judgment if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c,w here the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the party.matsushita indus.zenith radio,d.a fact is material for these purposes if it might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law.anderson liberty lobby,d.an issue of fact is genuine if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.id.
ii.identifying the plan 
the plaintiffs pled their claims under a b,which provides a right of action for employees to recover benefits to which they are entitled under the terms of an employee benefits plan to adjudicate such a claim,a court necessarily must identify the terms of the plan.a b.
the plaintiffs seek enforcement of the terms of the program summary,which does not explicitly provide for social security or workers compensation offsets for disability benefits.for purposes of analysis,the district court treated the program summary,distributed in january,as a flawed summary plan description,or spd,see a,and treated the group contract,executed in,as the plan that the program summary described.pocchia,d at.
we conclude that,at least with respect to the period between january and late september,the district court analysis is foreclosed by the language of erisa.in a section of the statute entitled establishment of plan,erisa provides that e very employee benefit plan shall be established and maintained pursuant to a written instrument.a.we have interpreted this section as establishing that erisa was designed to ensure that plans be governed by written documents.schonholz long island jewish med,cir quoting moore metro.life ins,cir.this written instrument requirement is central to our analysis of erisa plans because it serves two of the primary goals of erisa informing employees of the benefits to which they are entitled,and providing some degree of certainty in the administration of benefits.wentworth digital equip.as we have noted,the program summary is the only document in the record that existed between january and september,and that described employee benefits.we do not think that an employer can avoid the written instrument requirement by treating this written document describing employee benefits as merely a summary of a plan that is nowhere else in writing.
besides meeting the written instrument requirement,the program summary plainly meets the definition of a plan under erisa.the statute defines employee welfare benefit plan as 
any plan,fund,or program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer to the extent that such plan,fund,or program was established or is maintained for the purpose of providing for its participants or their beneficiaries inter alia disability benefits.
the supreme court has indicated that the term plan in the statute means nothing more than a scheme decided upon in advance.pegram herdrich,d.and we have held that a plan,fund,or program under erisa is established if from the surrounding circumstances a reasonable person can ascertain the intended benefits,a class of beneficiaries,the source of financing,and procedures for receiving benefits.grimo blue shield of,cir citation omitted alteration in original accord pegram,at.rules governing collection of premiums,definition of benefits,submission of claims,and resolution of disagreements over entitlement to services are the sorts of provisions that constitute a plan.
however,the program summary and the accompanying memorandum fulfill these requirements.they describe a scheme decided upon in advance to provide employee benefits.they set forth,albeit in outline form,the benefits to be provided.the memorandum states the class of beneficiaries all exempt,employees.both the memorandum and the program summary identify the ultimate source of financing for the plan benefits dnlp.the documents are replete with instructions for obtaining benefits.for instance,one of the pages of the program summary is given over entirely to procedures for sick term disability.and the documents existed during a time when dnlp was paying premiums to prudential to cover employee benefits,which establishes dnlp intent to provid e,for participants or their beneficiaries,benefits.
although the program summary contains the disclaimer that it was not intended to cover all details of the plan and that the actual provisions of the plan will govern,we reject the notion that this disclaimer renders the program summary a during the period when it was the only written document describing benefits.we held in heidgerd olin that i t is of no effect to publish and distribute a plan summary booklet and then proclaim that any inconsistencies will be governed by the plan,cir quoting mcknight southern life health ins,cir.this is especially true where the plan allegedly summarized by the document distributed to employees does not otherwise exist in written form at the time of distribution.crediting such a disclaimer in this situation would allow an employer effectively to opt out of erisa requirements despite its establishment of an employee benefits scheme that meets erisa definition of a plan.but erisa requirements are not optional congress intended through erisa to establish a comprehensive system for the federal regulation of private employee benefit plans.dist.of columbia greater.bd.of trade,d emphasis added.also,because an employer could always produce a subsequent document without such a disclaimer,crediting the disclaimer in this situation would allow an employer effectively to use such a subsequent document to make changes in plan terms without complying with the plan amendment procedures that employers must specify under b 
we conclude that,at least during the period between january and september,when the first draft benefit booklet was received by dnlp,the program summary and its accompanying memorandum were the plan for purposes of the plaintiffs actions under a b.
iii.interpreting the plan 
a claim under a b,in essence,is the assertion of a contractual right.strom goldman,sachs,cir accord devlin empire blue cross blue shield,cir.in interpreting plan terms for purposes of claims under a b,we apply a federal common law of contract,informed both by general principles of contract law and by erisa purposes as manifested in its specific provisions.see devlin,at i n erisa cases,state law does not control.instead,general common law principles apply.schonholz,at erisa is a federal law regime for regulating employee benefits designed to eliminate the threat of conflicting state and local regulation of benefit plans.
a.the initial promised benefits 
with these considerations in mind,we turn to the language of the program summary.it is axiomatic that where the language of a contract is unambiguous,the parties intent is determined within the four corners of the contract,without reference to external evidence.united states liranzo,cir.and the language of the program summary manifests a plain and unambiguous intent to provide disability benefits without offsets for social security or workers compensation payment.not only does the document describe disability benefits without mentioning such offsets,its explicit mention of offsets for benefits creates the impression that this silence was intentional.therefore,at least for the period between january and september,we decline to look for outside evidence of plan terms.see,giancontieri,evidence outside the four corners of the document as to what was really intended but unstated or misstated is generally inadmissible to add to or vary the writing.
although the program summary contains the disclaimer set forth above,we reject the notion that such disclaimers introduce ambiguity into otherwise unambiguous plan documents requiring reference to extrinsic evidence.having promulgated such a document,while it is in effect,defendants can not avoid their responsibilities under it.we thus agree with the third circuit that a,which contains erisa written instrument requirement,essentially operates as a strong integration clause,statutorily inserted in every plan document,senior executive benefit plan participants new valley,cir,cert.denied,d.and we decline to allow an employer to override this implicit integration clause with a reference to terms that do not then exist in written form.
we conclude that,for at least the period between the circulation of the program summary in early and september,the terms of the plan for purposes of the plaintiffs claims provided for disability benefits without social security or workers compensation payment offsets.
b.the question of vesting 
because the draft benefit booklet contains terms that potentially conflict with those of the program summary,we must address the additional question of vesting.under the principle that an employee benefit plan is effectively a unilateral contract,a benefit becomes vested if the employer has promised not to amend or terminate it,and the employee has accepted this offer by beginning or continuing in employment.
where the offeror does not explicitly reserve the power to revoke,such an offer can not be revoked once the offeree has begun to perform.the beginning of performance completes the manifestation of mutual assent and furnishes consideration.
devlin,at quoting restatement second of contracts cmt.d internal citation and punctuation omitted alteration in original accord kemmerer ici americas,cir holding that s ubsequent unilateral adoption of an amendment which is then used to defeat or diminish the employee fully vested rights under the governing plan document is ineffective internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted alteration in original,cert.denied,d.thus,if the program summary promised rights that would vest before the introduction of later documents purporting to describe different plan terms,then these later documents can not diminish those rights with regard to these plaintiffs,who accepted the dnlp offer contained in the plan by continuing in the employ of dnlp after it was promulgated.
the questions whether and when benefits vest are matters of contractual interpretation.devlin,at schonholz,at.if a plan is unambiguous regarding the employer intent to promise a vested benefit,that promise is enforced.am.fed of grain millers int l multifoods,cir.our review of the program summary and its accompanying memorandum,however,reveals no explicit language that either promises vested disability benefits or reserves dnlp right to amend or revoke such benefits.
other circuits are divided on the question whether silence in a plan document regarding vesting should be interpreted as implying a promise to provide vested benefits.see id.collecting cases.we have not yet confronted this issue with regard to a plan document promising disability benefits.for plans promising other types of benefits,however,we have held that the vesting question can not be determined as a matter of law where a plan is not explicit one way or the other.for example,in the case of severance benefits,we have held that the question of vesting is for the trier of fact,so long as the plaintiff can point to written language capable of reasonably being interpreted as creating a promise on the part of the employer to vest benefits.schonholz,at.and we have held that this same standard applies in the context of retiree health insurance benefits,see joyce,cir,and life insurance benefits,see devlin,at.
when,on september,prudential sent dnlp a draft benefit booklet that,unlike the program summary,explicitly provided for social security and workers compensation offsets for disability benefits,pocchia and feifer had already become disabled.the vesting question with regard to these plaintiffs,then,is whether dnlp promised disability benefits that it would not be able to alter or revoke after an employee became disabled.because of the particular circumstances regarding disability benefits,and in light of the rule in this circuit that an otherwise ambiguous plan should be construed against the interests of the party that drafted the language,perreca gluck,cir,we conclude as a matter of law that,absent explicit language to the contrary,a plan document providing for disability benefits promises that these benefits vest with respect to an employee no later than the time that the employee becomes disabled.
as indicated above,the theory of a unilateral contract of the sort represented by the program summary is that the document containing the contract terms is an offer that is accepted by the employee commencing or continuing to work for the offeror.if the employee does not like the terms,he or she can decline and seek better terms elsewhere.but this choice is one that an employee,once disabled,can not make.nor d
