this social security appeal presents the novel question whether the proceeds of the sale of a marital in escrow by divorcing a countable resource for purposes of assessing eligibility to receive supplemental security income ssi benefits.the commissioner of social security denied marguerite kelley application for ssi benefits on the ground that these proceeds were a countable resource rendering her ineligible for ssi benefits.the district court upheld this decision.we agree and affirm.
marguerite kelley suffers from chronic pain and fatigue secondary to crohn disease.on march,kelley applied for disability insurance benefits dib under title ii of the social security act.this claim was denied on may,and kelley then requested an administrative hearing.on august,kelley filed an application for ssi under title xvi of the social security act.on february,an administrative law judge alj held a hearing to review both her dib and ssi claims.
at the time of the hearing,kelley was involved in divorce proceedings.she and her husband had sold their marital home approximately two years earlier,and by agreement they placed the proceeds of the sale in an escrow account until they could reach a further agreement on distribution during the hearing,the alj indicated that he would leave the record open for two weeks during which time kelley could submit any additional materials.kelley counsel submitted a brief,attached to which was an affidavit from the attorney who represented kelley in her divorce yet,it is unclear from the record whether the affidavit was submitted within the allotted two weeks and,according to the commissioner,the alj excluded it as untimely 
on march,the alj issued a decision denying kelley claim for dib and ssi the alj determined,in pertinent part,that kelley share of the proceeds from the sale of the marital home are a countable resource notwithstanding the fact that the proceeds are presently being held in an escrow account and accordingly concluded that kelley was not eligible for ssi.at.kelley requested review by the appeals council and submitted to the appeals council the same affidavit she had sent to the alj following the hearing.on march,the appeals council denied kelley request,making the alj decision the commissioner final decision.see stating that the alj decision is binding if the appeals council denies a claimant request for review see also welch heckler,cir noting that the alj decision becomes final and eligible for judicial review when approved by the appeals council.in the course of denying kelley request for review,the appeals council noted that the additional evidence kelley submitted provided no basis for reversing the alj decision.
kelley then filed this civil action pursuant to g.in support of her request for review,kelley submitted three additional documents i a copy of her divorce decree,which shows that she and her husband signed a property settlement agreement on november,and that their divorce was finalized on december,ii a letter dated june,from her divorce attorney to her mother indicating that kelley portion of the escrowed funds had been used to repay her mother,who had paid for most of kelley legal fees,and to pay for other fee balances,medical insurance and other bills associated with the children appellee.at and iii a july,notice of award letter from the social security administration indicating that kelley was eligible to receive ssi as of july,the matter was then referred to a magistrate judge,pursuant to b b,who issued a report and recommendation concluding i that the alj correctly determined that the escrowed proceeds from the sale of kelley marital home constituted a countable resource and ii that none of the materials submitted by kelley after the administrative hearing warranted a different conclusion.on january,after considering kelley request for review and the commissioner response and reviewing the report and recommendation,the district court denied kelley request for review and entered judgment in favor of the commissioner.kelley timely appealed,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
the sole issue on appeal is whether the proceeds from the sale of kelley marital home,placed in an escrow account by kelley and her pending equitable distribution,were properly deemed to be a resource for the purpose of determining kelley eligibility for ssi.this issue,for which there is no directly apposite authority in this circuit or elsewhere,is a legal question,and our review is accordingly plenary.schaudeck comm r of social sec,cir.
under the social security act,an individual is eligible for ssi benefits if i she is aged,blind,or disabled and ii her countable income and resources fall below certain statutory limits.a since,individuals not residing with a spouse have been obliged to show that their countable resources do not exceed as part of establishing their eligibility for ssi benefits.id.the social security administration has defined resources as cash or other liquid assets or any real or personal property that an individual or spouse,if any owns and could convert to cash to be used for his or her support and maintenance.a.significantly,another regulation provides that 
i f an individual and spouse,if any moves out of his or her home without the intent to return,the home becomes a countable resource because it is no longer the individual principal place of residence the individual equity in the former home becomes a countable resource effective with the first day of the month following the month it is no longer his or her principal place of residence.
id.c.the regulation further states that proceeds from the sale of a home may only be excluded from an individual countable resources to the extent the proceeds are intended to be used and are,in fact,used to purchase another home within months of the date of receipt of the proceeds.id.d.thus,under this regulation,it is clear the alj properly considered the proceeds from the sale of kelley marital home to be a countable resource for the purpose of calculating her ssi eligibility.
nor is this conclusion altered because kelley agreed to place the proceeds from the sale of her former home in an escrow account pending equitable distribution in her divorce.the social security act addresses the treatment of trusts in e,which defines the term trust as including any legal instrument or device that is similar to a trust.e a.because an escrow account is similar to a trust,the escrow account kelley created with her husband is appropriately treated as a trust under e that subsection,enacted in as part of the foster care independence act,stat,separately addresses revocable and irrevocable trusts.first,it provides that if an individual has established a revocable trust,the corpus of the trust shall be considered a resource available to the individual.id.e a in the case of an irrevocable trust,the statute further provides that 
if there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual or of the individual spouse,the portion of the corpus from which payment to or for the benefit of the individual or of the individual spouse could be made shall be considered a resource available to the individual.
the social security act treatment of trusts and instruments compels the conclusion that the escrowed funds were appropriately deemed to be one of kelley resources because the terms of the escrow agreement are not in the record,it is impossible to determine definitively whether the escrow account should be deemed more akin to a revocable or irrevocable trust.yet,the conclusion that the proceeds held in escrow were properly counted holds regardless of whether the escrow account is treated as a revocable or irrevocable trust.if kelley escrow account was more similar to a revocable trust,the statute unqualified command that i n the case of a revocable trust established by an individual,the corpus of the trust shall be considered a resource available to the individual applies.id.e a.even assuming the escrow account is properly considered an irrevocable trust,it is clear that the escrowed funds were corr
