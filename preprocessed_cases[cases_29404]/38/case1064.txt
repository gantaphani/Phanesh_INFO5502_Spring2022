i background 
the commissioner is required to follow a sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled.williams bowen,cir.the claimant bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of disability at steps one through four.see id.at.if the claimant successfully meets this burden,the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner at step five to show that the claimant retains sufficient rfc to perform work in the national economy,given her age,education,and work experience.see id.at.
the alj determined that plaintiff was not disabled.he found that she could perform a wide range of sedentary work compromised only by certain physical and mental limitations to be discussed below.after deciding at step one that plaintiff had not engaged in significant gainful activity since her alleged disability onset date,the alj found at step two that,individually or in combination,plaintiff alleged impairments were severe.at step three,however,the alj found that plaintiff impairments were not severe enough to meet or to equal any of the listed impairments in the social security regulations that would require a finding that she was disabled.
at step four the alj found that plaintiff retained the rfc to perform sedentary work that involves maximum lifting of ten pounds and no prolonged walking or standing activities,vol.ii at.according to the alj,plaintiff could sit continuously for minutes six hours out of an day and stand and walk continuously for minutes four hours out of an day.the alj also found that plaintiff rfc is diminished by restrictions in that she can engage in only occasional crawling,reaching above shoulder level,pushing and pulling,fingering and grasping.although plaintiff can frequently stoop,crouch,squat,and climb stairs,she can not climb ladders,balance and work around dangerous machinery,or do a job where driving is a major job requirement.the alj further found that plaintiff should avoid exposure to temperature extremes,vibration,and concentration of dust,fumes and chemicals.id.
with regard to her mental limitations,the alj found that plaintiff retains the attention,concentration,persistence and pace levels required for simple and routine work tasks.id.she can perform work under general supervision,but needs to work in a low stress environment and avoid direct contact with the general public and have only occasional interaction with.id.plaintiff is moderately restricted in following work rules and responding to supervision.id.
at step four the alj also determined that plaintiff could not return to her past relevant work as a,wedding coordinator,adult health aide,occupational therapist,or director of occupational therapy.but at step five the alj,using the guidelines as a framework,see and pt,subpart p,app,table,rule,and also relying on the testimony of a ve,concluded that plaintiff was not disabled because she could perform work as a operator and a monitor,both jobs existing in significant numbers.
the appeals council denied plaintiff request for review,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.doyal barnhart,cir.
ii standard of review 
we review the commissioner decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.andrade sec y of health human,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.fowler bowen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we consider whether the alj followed the specific rules of law that must be followed in weighing particular types of evidence in disability cases,reyes bowen,cir,but we will not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the commissioner,see qualls apfel,cir.
iii discussion 
workers compensation finding 
plaintiff first argues that the appeals council erred in failing to give proper consideration to a decision rendered by the colorado executive department finding plaintiff permanently and totally disabled for workers compensation purposes.because the state agency decision did not become available until after the hearing before the alj,plaintiff submitted the evidence to the appeals council,which made it a part of the record.see shalala,cir new evidence submitted to the appeals council becomes part of the administrative record for purposes of judicial review.
we have held that a lthough findings by other agencies are not binding on the commissioner,they are entitled to weight and must be considered.baca dep t of health human,cir internal quotation marks omitted.assuming,without deciding,that the holding in baca applies to findings by state agencies,we agree with the district court that the appeals council fulfilled its obligation to consider the workers compensation decision.
plaintiff has not pointed to any specific factual finding or evidence in the state disability determination that should have changed the appeals council decision.to the extent that the state agency differed from the alj in assessing credibility,there is of course no reason why the appeals council must always adopt the state agency view over that of the alj.plaintiff complains that the appeals council reference to the state proceeding was appeals council wrote only that it had considered the additional evidence submitted but concluded that neither the contentions nor the additional evidence provides a basis for changing the administrative law judge decision,vol.ii at.yet,our general practice,which we see no reason to depart from here,is to take a lower tribunal at its word when it declares that it has considered a matter.see united states kelley,cir district court must consider certain factors before imposing prison time for probation violation,but court need only say that it has done so andrews deland,cir refusing to look behind a district court express statement that it engaged in a de novo review of the record.we reject this claim of error.
rfc findings 
plaintiff next argues that the alj findings regarding her rfc are not based on substantial evidence because he did not cite any factors contradicting her credibility and failed to give controlling weight to the opinions of her treating physicians.
credibility 
the alj found that claimant testimony is not fully credible to the extent she alleges total disability and a total inability to sustain work activity,vol.ii at.as support for this conclusion,the alj pointed to plaintiff daily activities and contradictions in her various reports regarding them.he also cited medical evidence showing that her lef
