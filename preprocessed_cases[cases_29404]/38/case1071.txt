background 
our discussion of the historical background can be brief because of the thorough treatment in davis i and davis ii.the seminole nation was formed after the european conquest of america.in addition to members of native american ancestry,it also includes members of african ancestry,descendants of escaped slaves who began living among native american groups in the territory that became florida.in the seminole nation florida lands were ceded to the united states by the treaty of camp moultrie.thereafter,most of the seminole nation people,including those of african ancestry,were forcibly removed to what is now oklahoma.
after removal the tribe entered into a treaty with the united states addressing the rights of its members of african descent,the estelusti.that treaty,which we will refer to as the treaty of,contains the following language 
i nasmuch as there are among the seminoles many persons of african descent and blood,who have no interest or property in the soil,and no recognized civil rights,it is stipulated that hereafter these persons and their descendants,and such other of the same race as shall be permitted by said nation to settle there,shall have and enjoy all the rights of native citizens,and the laws of said nation shall be equally binding upon all persons of whatever race or color who may be adopted as citizens or members of said tribe.
treaty with the seminole indians,nation of indians,art.ii,stat.notwithstanding this sweeping language,the united states itself continued to distinguish the estelusti from tribal members of native american ancestry.
for instance,when the dawes commission in created official membership rolls for the seminole nation of oklahoma,it created two rolls,one for those of native american ancestry the seminole blood roll and one for the estelusti the freedmen roll.a member of mixed ancestry was classified in accordance with maternal ancestry.today,these membership rolls,often referred to as the dawes rolls,are authoritative evidence of tribal membership.any person who can show descent from a person listed on either of the two rolls is recognized as a member of the tribe.
the tribe members are divided among bands.the two consist entirely of descendants of those listed on the freedmen roll.even as tribal members,however,the estelusti do not receive full membership benefits.participation in some of the tribe programs requires a cdib card,the bia certification that an individual possesses a specific quantum of indian blood.davis i,at.
a member of the tribe can obtain a cdib card by proving a specified relationship to a person listed on the seminole blood roll.a person who proves the same relationship with respect to a person listed on the seminole freedmen roll,however,is not entitled to a cdib.in a letter dated october,the superintendent of the wewoka agency of the bureau of indian affairs explained this differential treatment 
the certificate of degree of indian blood makes or infers no mention of tribal membership.the policy states that my responsibility is to certify one s indian blood when acceptable proof of relationship to an individual enrolled on specific rolls of particular tribes is presented t here are persons listed on the freedman roll who were part indian.as you know,the seminole nation follows maternal lineage,for example,if the person mother was f reedman and the father was indian by blood,the person was enrolled in the f reedman roll.this person was still part indian and and descendants would be eligible to receive a cdib our policy is not to deny freedmen cdibs,but to state that adequate proof of relationship to a person with indian blood has been provided by them stated simply,if a freedman band member or anyone else applies for a cdib that can not provide acceptable proof of relationship to a seminole indian by blood,they will be denied a cdib.
aple.at.according to plaintiffs,many members of the dosar barkus and bruner bands of the seminole nation of oklahoma have been denied cdibs under the bia policy.consequently,members of the have been excluded from participation in programs for which cdib cards are required.
among the programs to which members of the have been denied access are what the parties refer to as programs.these programs are supported by a million judgment awarded to the seminole nation as it existed in florida on september,davis i,at internal quotation marks omitted emphasis added,as compensation for the taking of its florida lands.before congress released the judgment funds for the use of the tribe,the bia recommended that it exclude the estelusti from participation because the estelusti were not officially recognized as members of the tribe until the treaty of.
congress did not,however,specifically exclude the estelusti it simply allocated the tribe share of the judgment to the seminole nation of oklahoma.act of april,a,stat,distribution act.the remainder of the funds were awarded to the seminole tribe of florida,the miccosukee tribe of indians of florida and the independent seminole indians of florida.distribution act,a,stat.at.instead of creating its own detailed distribution plan for use of the funds,congress allowed the tribe,in conjunction with the secretary of the interior,to propose its own plan so long as that plan provide d that not less than per centum of the tribe judgment fund be set aside and programmed to serve common tribal needs,educational requirements and such other purposes as the circumstances of the seminole nation of oklahoma may determine.distribution act,a a,stat.at.
thereafter,the tribe general council adopted a proposed distribution plan.the plan submitted to congress generally provided that the tribe judgment funds would be used to support programs in such areas as h ealth,education,and social services but it did not describe any programs specifically.plan for the use of the seminole nation of oklahoma indian judgment funds in docket and before the indian claims commission,july.instead,it provided that the tribe would develop specific programs and submit proposals for those programs to the bia for approval.when congress did not reject the tribe plan,it became effective under d of the distribution act.see stat.at a plan for the distribution of the judgment funds referred to in this act shall be implemented immediately at the end of the period beginning on the day such plan is submitted to the congress,unless during such period a joint resolution is enacted disapproving such plan.
thereafter,the tribe general council established specific programs to be funded by the award.it created programs to assist with school clothing,burial expenses,elder care,and educational expenses.many of those programs contained the following eligibility requirement the applicant must be an enrolled member of the seminole nation of oklahoma who has been determined to have descended from a member of the seminole nation as it existed in florida on september,aple.at.because the estelusti were not expressly recognized as members of the tribe until the treaty of,estelusti descent would not satisfy this requirement.although the tribe would accept a person cdib card as proof of descent from a member of the seminole nation as it existed in florida in even though cdib cards are issued with reference to the seminole blood roll created in,most estelusti were unable to obtain cdib cards because of the bia policy.thus,the tribe requirements and the bia policy combined to exclude most estelusti from participation in programs.in an effort to gain access to these programs,plaintiffs initiated this litigation challenging both the requirements and the bia policy.
ii.course of proceedings 
plaintiffs named the united states,the department of the interior,the bureau of indian affairs,and officials of both agencies as defendants in this action.they did not,however,name the tribe or its officials.plaintiffs sought to compel defendants to require the tribe to distribute judgment funds in a nondiscriminatory manner,to condition further release of money on compliance with a nondiscriminatory distribution policy.they also requested an order requiring the bia to issue cdib cards to members of the who applied.
the district court initially dismissed plaintiffs claims because it found the absent tribe to be an indispensable party whose sovereign immunity prevented its joinder.on appeal in davis i we held that with respect to the claims,the tribe was in fact a necessary party but was not necessarily an indispensable one,and with respect to plaintiffs claims,dismissal on the basis of indispensability was inappropriate because the issue was not adequately addressed below.on remand the district court again found the tribe indispensable to litigation of the claims,but dismissed the claims on another to exhaust administrative remedies.plaintiffs challenge both dismissals on appeal.we address each in turn.
iii.claims 
the district court dismissed plaintiffs claims because an indispensable person,the tribe,could not be joined as a party.federal rule of civil procedure requires the district court to perform a analysis before dismissing a claim for failure to join an indispensable person.see rishell jane phillips episcopal mem l med,cir.first,the court must determine whether the absent person is necessary.id.a person is necessary under rule a if 
in the person absence complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,or the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person absence may i as a practical matter impair or impede the person ability to protect that interest or ii leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double,multiple,or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest.
a.a necessary person must be joined as a party if joinder is feasible.id.if a necessary person can not be joined,the court proceeds to the second step,determining whether in equity and good conscience the action should proceed among the parties before it,or should be dismissed,because the absent person is indispensable to the litigation at hand.b.
in davis i we affirmed the district court determination that the tribe was a necessary person.we held that t he tribe claimed interest in determining eligibility requirements and adopting ordinances embodying those requirements is neither fabricated nor frivolous.the disposition of plaintiffs judgment fund award claim in the tribe absence will impair or impede the tribe ability to protect its claimed interest.at.
the tribe sovereign immunity prevented its joinder as a party.thus,the district court task on remand was to determine whether the tribe was indispensable to this litigation or whether the case could proceed without it.in making this determination,the court was to consider,in a practical and equitable manner,rishell,at,the following factors 
f irst,to what extent a judgment rendered in the person absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties second,the extent to which,by protective provisions in the judgment,by the shaping of relief,or other measures,the prejudice can be lessened or avoided third,whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate and fourth,whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder.
b.this list of factors is not,however,exclusive.see wichita affiliated tribes of hodel,the four factors are not rigid,technical tests,but rather guides to the overarching equity and good conscience determination internal quotation marks omitted charles alan wright,arthur miller mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure at ed the list in rule b does not exhaust the possible considerations the court may take into account it simply identifies those that will be most significant in most cases.
a district court indispensability determination under rule will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.see rishell,at.its underlying legal conclusions,however,are reviewed de novo.davis i,at.the court abuses its discretion in making an indispensability determination when it fails to consider a relevant factor,relies on an improper factor,or relies on grounds that do not reasonably support its conclusion.see rishell,at thunder basin coal southwestern pub.serv,cir weight to be accorded each factor is matter for district court discretion.
in provident tradesmens bank and trust patterson,d,the supreme court described the rule b factors as representing four distinct interests the interest of the outsider whom it would have been desirable to join,id.at.the interest of the defendant in avoiding multiple litigation,inconsistent relief,or sole responsibility for a liability he shares with another,the interest of the courts and the public in complete,consistent,and efficient settlement of controversies,settling disputes by wholes,whenever possible id.at.and the plaintiff interest in having a forum in which to present the claims,id.at.
in this case the district court weighed the rule b factors and found that the tribe was an indispensable person with respect to plaintiffs claims.it explained that while the lack of an alternate forum weigh ed heavily in favor of retaining the case,davis ii,d at,the prejudice to the absent tribe,the court inability to lessen the prejudice,and the absence of an adequate remedy without the tribe joinder because of the possibility that defendants would be subjected to repeated litigation and conflicting judgments prevent ed proceeding in equity and good conscience without the tribe,id.in other words,the court found that the first three factors supported dismissal to such an extent that the fourth factor was overcome.
plaintiffs contend that the district court erred in both its analysis of the individual rule b factors and in its weighing of those factors.first,they argue that the district court failed to recognize that the tribe plaintiffs characterize as the right to exclude its black citizens from enjoyment of the judgment fund,aplt.br.at not a legally cognizable interest,id.plaintiffs assert that given the absence of a legally cognizable interest,either the tribe was never a necessary person and consequently can not be regarded as an indispensable one,or in weighing the first rule b prejudice to the absent person or the court should have recognized that an interest that is not legally cognizable can not be legally prejudiced.also with respect to the first factor,they argue that the district court should not have considered potential prejudice to defendants because such prejudice is entirely speculative.regarding the second rule b prejudice can be lessened or avoided plaintiffs claim that the absence of prejudice moots the issue.
in addition,plaintiffs take issue with the district court analysis of the third factor whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate.b.they contend that a judgment in the tribe absence would be adequate because in the event that the bia stopped disbursing the funds to the tribe,one of two things would happen either the tribe would quickly change its requirements,or it would no longer have funds to distribute in a discriminatory manner.in either event,the discriminatory disbursement would cease immediately and unequivocally.as for the fourth adequate relief can be obtained in an alternate assert that while the district court correctly concluded that this factor weighed against dismissal,it placed far too little emphasis on its conclusion.finally,they claim that the district court erroneously failed to consider equitable factors not specifically listed in rule b.we proceed to discuss each challenge.
factor prejudice to the tribe or the parties 
the tribe interest 
plaintiffs challenge the district court conclusion that the tribe interest would be prejudiced if the case were to proceed in its absence.they describe the tribe interest as an interest in excluding the estelusti from the judgment fund,aplt.br.at,and argue that such an interest is legally frivolous when evaluated in light of the district court alleged findings that congress intended the judgment fund to benefit all members of the seminole nation,including the estelusti,and the bia colluded with certain tribal leaders to exclude the estelusti from enjoyment of the judgment fund.aplt.br.at.they assert that the illegitimacy of the interest is significant because without a legitimate interest,the tribe is not a necessary person and thus can not be an indispensable one and an illegitimate interest can not be legally prejudiced under the first rule b factor.
we reject the challenge.plaintiffs argument amounts to asking us to decide that the tribe interest is not worthy of consideration because its position is wrong on the merits.but rule concern is with a claimed interest.a emphasis added.t he underlying merits of the litigation are irrelevant to a rule inquiry,citizen potawatomi nation norton,cir,at least unless the claimed interest is patently frivolous.davis i,at internal quotation marks omitted.in davis i we responded as follows to virtually the same argument that plaintiffs make here 
plaintiffs narrow interpretation of the term legally protected interest inappropriately presupposes plaintiffs success on the merits.under the interpretation advanced by plaintiffs,the tribe would have no legally protected interest in the monies used to fund judgment fund programs that exclude the estelusti seminoles only if plaintiffs prevail on the merits.consequently,if this court adopted plaintiffs interpretation of the term legally protected interest,the district court would be required to determine the merits of plaintiffs judgment fund award claim before ruling on defendants motion to dismiss.such an approach is untenable because it would render the rule analysis an adjudication on the merits.
davis i,at.davis i made this statement in the context of rule a.we are now addressing the issue in the context of rule b.the same reasoning applies here,however,because the prejudice inquiry under rule b is essentially the same as the inquiry under rule a i into whether continuing the action without a person will,as a practical matter,impair that person ability to protect his interest.enter.mgmt.consultants,hodel,cir.even if our prior decision on the rule a issue is not strictly speaking the law of the case with respect to the rule b issue,see weston harmatz,cir,we see no reason to abandon here the cogent reasoning in davis 
we note that in some cases the interests of the absent person are so aligned with those of one or more parties that the absent person interests are,as a practical matter,protected.see,sac fox nation of norton,cir kansas united states,cir.here,however,the district court explicitly found that t he bia is not representing the seminole nation interest in this lawsuit,davis ii,d at,and plaintiffs do not challenge that finding on appeal.
defendants interests 
plaintiffs argue that the district court should not have considered the risk of subjecting defendants to inconsistent legal obligations because such obligations are entirely speculative.specifically,they point out that the bia need not comply with a tribal regulation that might conflict with a ruling in favor of the estelusti.more important,however,is that the tribe would not be bound by the judgment in this case and could initiate litigation against defendants if the bia withheld funds.thus,defendants might well be prejudiced by multiple litigation or even inconsistent judgments if this litigation were to proceed without the tribe.see patterson,at.defendant interest in avoiding multiple litigation is proper consideration under rule b.
this possibility is not speculative.plaintiffs themselves recognize the substantial likelihood of subsequent litigation when they state while addressing another issue t he tribe reacts swiftly when the bia cuts off federal funding the notion that the tribe will not react to losing access to the million judgment fund is absurd.aplt.br.at.
we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that under rule b,both the tribe and defendants have interests that would likely be prejudiced by litigation in the tribe absence.
factor whether potential prejudice can be lessened or avoided.
in their opening brief plaintiffs raise only one challenge to the district court analysis of the second rule b extent to which any prejudice can be lessened or avoided.they argue that the factor is irrelevant because any prejudice to the tribe is not legally cognizable.as previously discussed,this argument goes to the merits of their claim,rather than the potential harm to the tribe if defendants lose.their challenge,therefore,must fail.we find no error in the district court determination that this factor supports treating the tribe as an indispensable party.although plaintiffs in their reply brief also argue that any prejudice could be easily prevented by the fashioning of a decree against the bia only,reply br.at,we do not address that argument because it was not timely raised.see stump gates,cir this court does not ordinarily review issues raised for the first time in a reply brief.
factor whether an adequate judgment can be entered in the tribe absence 
plaintiffs contend that the third rule b factor whether a judgment rendered in the person absence will be adequate did not support dismissal because the court could have afforded them complete relief without joining the tribe.plaintiffs,however,misconstrue the nature of the adequacy inquiry.the supreme court has explained that rule b third factor is not intended to address the adequacy of the judgment from the plaintiff point of view.see patterson,at.t he plaintiff,who himself chose both the forum and the parties defendant,will not be heard to complain about the sufficiency of the relief obtainable against them.rather,the factor is intended to address the adequacy of the dispute resolution.see id.the concern underlying this factor is not the plaintiff interest but that of the courts and the public in complete,consistent,and efficient settlement of controversies,that is,the public stake in settling disputes by wholes,whenever possible.id.as previously discussed,a judgment rendered in the tribe absence could well lead to further litigation and possible inconsistent judgments.that judgment,therefore,would be inadequate.consequently,the district court appropriately found that the third rule b factor favored dismissal.
factor availability of an adequate remedy in another the factors 
in addressing the fourth rule b factor,the district court found that plaintiffs would not have an adequate remedy if this case were dismissed.the court noted that plaintiffs could pursue their claim through the tribe legislative or judicial bodies,but recogniz ing the reality of these options,it will be futile for the estelusti to seek adjudication in these tribal forums.d
