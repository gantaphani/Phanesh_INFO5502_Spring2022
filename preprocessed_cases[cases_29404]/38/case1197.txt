there has been a growing recognition of the pervasive and continuing problem of sexual abuse in the military and the often severe effects it can have numerous steps have been taken to confront the problem,including an increased focus by the department of defense,and increased efforts by the department of veterans affairs to improve its adjudication of disability claims related to military sexual trauma 
in response to what they viewed as the va inadequate response to disability claims,petitioners here the service women action network and the vietnam veterans of america submitted a petition for rulemaking which requested that the va promulgate a new regulation regarding the adjudication of certain disability claims.the secretary of veterans affairs denied the rulemaking petition and this appeal followed.our review in these circumstances is limited.because the secretary decision to deny the rulemaking petition was not arbitrary or capricious,or in violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment,we deny the petition for review.
in,one in five female veterans and one in male veterans reported that they experienced sexual abuse in the military,and an estimated servicemembers experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact.the trauma stemming from sexual abuse in the military is referred to as military sexual trauma mst and it can result in severe chronic medical conditions,including post traumatic stress disorder ptsd,depression,and anxiety 
generally,veterans with disabilities,injuries or diseases contracted or aggravated in military service are entitled to disability benefits.see.veterans are eligible to receive disability benefits for the physical and mental health disabilities caused or aggravated by mst,such as ptsd,depression,or anxiety.
from,veterans filed over claims related to disabilities caused by mst.and from,the overwhelming majority of those claims were for ptsd.id.in at least and,there was a significant disparity in the rates at which ptsd claims were granted,depending on whether the claim was based on mst or some other stressor.for instance,in,of ptsd claims were granted,while only of ptsd claims were granted.and,in,of ptsd claims were granted,while only of ptsd claims were granted.id.
to address this significant disparity,the service women action network and the vietnam veterans of america collectively,petitioners petitioned the secretary for a rulemaking.petitioners claim that this disparity,at least in part,is due to the higher evidentiary burden required to establish for ptsd.
to establish service connection for ptsd,there must be a medical diagnosis of ptsd,a link between the ptsd diagnosis and the stressor,and credible supporting evidence that the claimed stressor occurred.f.the secretary has the authority to prescribe all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate with respect to the nature and extent of proof and evidence in order to establish the right to benefits.a.under this authority,the secretary allows a veteran lay testimony alone to constitute the credible supporting evidence required for stressors related to combat in which the veteran engaged,a veteran fear of hostile military or terrorist activity,or a veteran experience being a prisoner of war.f.specifically,if the evidence establishes that the veteran experienced a specific event that caused the claimed stressor,that the veteran engaged in combat with the enemy,and the claimed stressor is consistent with the circumstances,conditions,or hardships of the veteran service,the va allows the veteran to establish the occurrence of the claimed stressor through the veteran lay testimony alone when there is no clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.id.in contrast,when the stressor is related to an personal assault,which includes mst,the veteran is required to provide corroborating evidence to substantiate the occurrence of the stressor.f.however,evidence from sources other than the veteran service records may constitute credible evidence supporting the occurrence of the,including,but not limited to records from law enforcement authorities,rape crisis centers,mental health counseling centers,hospitals,or physicians pregnancy tests or tests for sexually transmitted diseases and statements from family members,roommates,fellow service members,or clergy.id.moreover,va will not deny a stress disorder claim that is based on personal assault without first advising the claimant that evidence from sources other than the veteran service records or evidence of behavior changes may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor and allowing him or her the opportunity to furnish this type of evidence or advise va of potential sources of such evidence.id.
the petition requests that the va promulgate a new subsection of cfr g to establish a separate evidentiary presumption for ptsd caused by mst.petitioners proposed rule reads 
if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran reported experience of military sexual trauma and a psychiatrist or psychologist confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of a mental health condition and that the veteran symptoms are related to the claimed stressor,in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,the veteran lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed stressor.
the petition contends that this rule is necessary because systemic underreporting deprives survivors of rape,sexual assault,and sexual harassment of the documentation necessary to corroborate their claims va adjudicators often misapply the current evidentiary standard and va current rules for ptsd related to mst allow for biased exercises of adjudicators discretion.
the petition further argues that veterans suffering from ptsd caused by other stressors do not have to present any threshold evidence of the specific stressor,but must simply show that they served in general conditions in which stressors causing ptsd occur.therefore,the proposed evidentiary standard only requires veterans to prove they served in general conditions in which military sexual assault and sexual harassment are known to occur.id.at.however,since sexual harassment and sexual assault are known to occur in all conditions of service,veterans claiming benefits for ptsd would only need to prove that they served in the military.id.
the secretary denied the petition.petitioners appeal on the grounds that the denial is arbitrary and capricious and violates the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment.we have jurisdiction under.preminger sec y of veterans affairs.
as we have previously held,we review the secretary denial of a petition for rulemaking pursuant to a to determine whether the agency decision was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.id.at citing massachusetts epa.when a proposed rulemaking pertains to a matter of policy within the agency expertise and discretion,the scope of review should perforce be a narrow one,limited to ensuring that the agency has adequately explained the facts and policy concerns it relied on and to satisfy ourselves that those facts have some basis in the record.id.at quoting wwht,fcc,internal quotation marks omitted.in other words,a court looks to see whether the agency employed reasoned decisionmaking in rejecting the petition.id.at quoting defs.of wildlife gutierrez,alteration in original omitted.
to determine if the agency employed reasoned decisionmaking,we must examine the petition for rulemaking,comments pro and con and the agency explanation of its decision to reject the petition.gutierrez,at quoting am.horse prot.ass lyng,internal quotation marks omitted.in only the rarest and most compelling of circumstances is it appropriate to overturn an agency judgment not to institute a rulemaking.wwht,at see also customs brokers forwarders ass of,united states,we will overturn an agency decision not to initiate a rulemaking only for compelling cause,such as plain error of law or a fundamental change in the factual premises previously considered by the agency.
applying this extremely limited and highly deferential standard of review,we conclude that the secretary has adequately explained the facts and policy matters underlying the decision to deny the petition,and therefore employed reasoned decisionmaking 
first,the secretary explained that the current regulation specifically addresses petitioners stated concern regarding the difficulty of producing evidence to prove the occurrence of an personal assault.see also preminger,at,finding that the secretary engaged in reasoned decisionmaking when denying a petition for rulemaking,where the secretary determined that the current regulation effectively addressed the petitioner stated reasons for requesting the rulemaking.the secretary acknowledged the sensitive nature of mst stressors and the reluctance on the part of servicemembers to report such events during military service and concluded that the current regulation accommodates those concerns because it relaxes the general rule requiring veterans to solely rely on evidence contained in their service record by allowing veterans to provide corroborating evidence from a variety of sources.at see also post traumatic stress disorder claims based on personal assault,proposed rule many incidents of personal assault are not officially reported,and veterans may find it difficult to produce evidence to prove the occurrence of this type of stressor.this proposed amendment addresses this difficulty by specifying that evidence from sources other than the veteran service records may constitute credible supporting evidence of the stressor,where the alleged stressor is a personal assault.
second,the denial details the va training programs regarding claims.these programs ensure that department employees develop and adjudicate mst claims consistent with va regulation and with sensitivity to the unique circumstances presented by each individual claim.and,as a result of these programs,grant rates for ptsd claims increased significantly.id.at.specifically,in,the veterans benefits administration vba directed regional offices to designate adjudicators with experience in processing complex claims to assist in development of mst claims and adjudications.the vba developed guidance and training for these adjudicators,including vba training letter,a hour webinar on mst claims adjudication a hour training on mst and a hour information session regarding how to conduct medical examinations of veterans claiming disability as a result of mst.as a result,the grant rates for ptsd claims rose from in to in march.moreover,in,the overall grant rate for ptsd claims was comparable to the grant rate for all ptsd claims.
these statistics adequately support the secretary ultimate conclusion that the current regulation and training program provide for the accurate,fair,and sensitive adjudication of claims based on mst.see also,military sexual trauma,gao june,some variation in grant rates is expected due to actual differences among claims and their levels of evidence.
lastly,the denial clarifies that the evidentiary burden for ptsd caused by other stressors does in fact require a veteran to present threshold evidence of the specific stressor,contrary to petitioners belief.the secretary explained that,for example,under f,a veteran has the initial burden of establishing that he or she engaged in combat with the enemy,personally participated in events constituting an actual fight or encounter with a military foe or hostile unit or instrumentality before the veteran testimony,alone,is sufficient to establish the.citing moran peake,stone nicholson,internal quotation marks omitted.
although others may have determined that petitioners requested rule is the best way to ensure the accurate,fair,and sensitive adjudication of ptsd claims,that is not the question before us.ultimately,we are bound by the very limited and highly deferential standard of review,which only allows us to determine if the secretary denial constitutes reasoned decisionmaking.because the secretary adequately explained its reasons for denying the petition and continuing with the status quo,we conclude that the denial was not arbitrary or capricious.
lastly,petitioners claim that by denying the petition,the secretary violated the equal protection component of the due process clause of the fifth amendment because it intentionally discriminates against women without providing an exceedingly persuasive justification and in the alternative,it discriminates against survivors of ptsd without providing a legitimate reason.
the government violates equal protection when it intentionally discriminates against an individual based on race,national origin,or gender.see berkley united states.a facially neutral law or regulation can violate equal protection if it was motivated by discriminatory animus and its application results in discriminatory effect.id.if petitioners establish that the government engaged in intentional discrimination,then the government must demonstrate an exceedingly persuasive justification for the discrimination.united states virginia.
petitioners assert that women experience mst at a greater rate than men,and therefore the denial intentionally discriminates against women because it subjects women to a higher evidentiary burden than men when claiming disability benefits.see pet.br.at.when the government particular course of action disproportionately impacts one gender,an equal protection violation arises only if that impact can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.pers.adm r of feeney.a discriminatory purpose implies that the decisionmaker selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part because of,not merely in spite of,its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.id.at.
the record here establishes that both men and women suffer from ptsd,and therefore,both men and women are subject to a higher evidentiary burden to claim disability benefits for ptsd.see,pet.br.at disparity in grant rates for men suffering from ptsd was especially high id.at disparity between the approval rate for ptsd claims and the overall approval rate for all ptsd claims nationwide results in disparate impact on both men and women.when there is a rational,neutral explanation for the adverse impact and the law or custom disadvantages both men and women,then an inference of discriminatory purpose is not permitted.ricketts city of columbia,cir emphasis added citing feeney,at.
the secretary treats ptsd claims differently from other ptsd claims because mst can occur at any place,at any time,and to anyone and,therefore,raises challenges not applicable to other ptsd claims.see resp.br.at.the va has determined that veterans suffering from ptsd involving stressors that occurred under specific circumstances,while engaged in combat or being held as a prisoner of war,are relieved of the requirement to provide corroborating evidence that the particular stressor occurred,and instead may establish the occurrence of the particular stressor through their lay testimony alone.however,to be relieved of this evidentiary requirement,the veteran is required to first present threshold evidence establishing that,for example,he or she engaged in combat with the enemy or is a former prisoner of war.see id.at.by requiring the veteran to present this threshold evidence,the va is able to consider if the claimed stressor is consistent with the places,types,and circumstances of engaging in combat with the enemy or being held as a prisoner of war.
mst,however,is not limited to a specific experience or circumstance,and can unfortunately occur at any place,at any time,and to anyone.consequently,there is no specific context or circumstance in which the stressor occurred.because claimants generally can not prove that the stressor mst occurred under a specific circumstance,the va does not have an opportunity to consider if the mst is consistent with the places,types,and circumstances of a claimant military service.thus,the va requires veterans seeking benefits for ptsd to provide corroborating evidence establishing the occurrence of the mst so that it may properly consider whether the mst is consistent with the places,types,and circumstanc
