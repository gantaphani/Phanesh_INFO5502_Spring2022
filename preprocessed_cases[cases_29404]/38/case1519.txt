disabled american veterans dav,veterans of foreign wars of the united states vfw,national organization of veterans advocates,nova,and paralyzed veterans of america pva collectively petitioners petition for review of regulations promulgated by the department of veterans affairs va,that permit the board of veterans appeals board to obtain evidence,clarify the evidence,cure a procedural defect,or perform any other action essential for a proper appellate decision in any appeal properly before it without having to remand the appeal to the agency of original jurisdiction aoj for initial consideration and without having to obtain the appellant waiver.petitioners challenge the regulations under as arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,and not in accordance with various statutory provisions,including.
we hold that a is invalid because,in conjunction with the amended rule codified at,it allows the board to consider additional evidence without having to remand the case to the aoj for initial consideration and without having to obtain the appellant waiver.that is contrary to the requirement of a that a ll questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the secretary.moreover,we hold that a ii,which requires the board to provide the notice required by a and not less than days to respond to the notice,is invalid because it is contrary to b,which provides the claimant one year to submit evidence.we hold,however,that the other rules challenged by petitioners are valid because they are not arbitrary,capricious,or contrary to law.thus,we and the petitions for review,and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
a claim for va benefits is initially decided by an aoj,usually a va regional office.see b,d a.a claimant may appeal an adverse aoj decision to the secretary of veterans affairs secretary.a all questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the secretary.a.by statute,final decisions on such appeals are made by the board.
a claimant initiates appellate review by filing a notice of disagreement nod with the aoj.a.the nod is a written communication from the veteran expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative decision of the see collaro west.after a claimant files a nod,the aoj must prepare a statement of the case soc,which includes a summary of pertinent evidence in the case,a citation to pertinent laws and regulations,a discussion of how those laws and regulations affect the decision,and a summary of the reasons for the decision.d see maggitt west.
to complete the appeal to the board,the claimant is required to file a substantive appeal with the aoj within sixty days from the date the soc is mailed.d.the aoj then certifies the appeal to the board and notifies the appellant that the appellate record has been transferred to the board.a claimant appealing to the board,that is,an appellant,id.c,may submit additional evidence to the aoj after initiating the appeal.see id.if the aoj receives additional pertinent evidence or the soc is otherwise inadequate with respect to the statutory requirements,the aoj must prepare a supplemental statement of the case ssoc.id.b,a.an ssoc informs the appellant of any material changes in,or additions to,the information included in the soc or any prior ssoc.id.b.
on august,the va published a notice of proposed rulemaking to permit the board to obtain evidence,clarify the evidence,cure procedural defect,or perform any other action essential for a proper appellate decision in any appeal properly before it without having to remand the appeal to the aoj,and invited public comments on the proposed rules.board of veterans appeals obtaining evidence and curing procedural defects without remanding.on january,the va published the final rules,which were effective february,and applicable to appeals for which the nod was filed on or after february,as well as to appeals pending at the board,the united states court of appeals for veterans claims,or this court on that date.board of veterans appeals obtaining evidence and curing procedural defects without remanding.
before the challenged regulations took effect,if the board accepted evidence not already considered by the aoj,either submitted to the board by the appellant or referred to the board by the aoj,the va regulations required the board to refer such evidence to the aoj for review and preparation of an ssoc unless the appellant or representative waived in writing initial consideration by the aoj or the board could grant the benefits sought.c.the january,final rule eliminated that provision.eliminating waiver requirement.
as a result of the amendments made by the final rule,the board may accept or obtain evidence not considered by the aoj when the aoj decided the claim being appealed and consider that evidence in making its decision without referring that evidence to the aoj for initial consideration or obtaining the appellant waiver.a.the board may also consider law not considered by the aoj when it decided the claim being appealed,without remanding the case to the aoj for initial consideration of the law.id.b.because the board may obtain or accept evidence and consider it without referring it to the aoj for initial consideration,no ssoc relating to such evidence need be issued.id.petitioners timely seek review of the challenged rules,and we have jurisdiction to review the validity of the regulations challenged here pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court directly reviews petitions under in accordance with the standard of review in the administrative procedure act apa.see org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs.the apa requires the reviewing court to decide all relevant questions of law,interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an agency action.liesegang sec y of veterans affairs.where a finding of fact or a discretionary action is involved,the apa requires the reviewing court to set aside agency actions that are 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right or 
d without observance of procedure required by law 
a d.this review is highly deferential to the actions of the agency.see disabled am.veterans gober,quoting lefevre sec y of veterans affairs,quoting ethyl envtl.prot.agency,cert.denied,d.
the first inquiry under,in which we interpret the meaning of relevant statutes,is governed by the standards established by the supreme court in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.in regions hospital shalala,the supreme court explained 
under the formulation now familiar,when we examine the secretary rule interpreting a statute,we ask first whether the intent of congress is clear as to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if,by employing traditional tools of statutory construction,id.at,we determine that congress intent is clear,that is the end of the matter,id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.if the agency reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the legislature design,we give that reading controlling weight,even if it is not the answer the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.id.at.
d citations abbreviated.thus,chevron deference applies if congress is either silent or ambiguous on a particular issue.however,when interpreting statutes relating to veterans,interpretative doubt is to be resolved in the veteran favor.org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs,citing brown gardner,d.
retroactivity 
pva,citing bowen georgetown university hospital,d,contends that the va may not apply the challenged regulations to appeals that were pending on the effective date because that would give them impermissible retroactive effect.we find pva position to be meritless.
the supreme court has held that a statute will not be given retroactive effect unless congress has made its contrary intention clear.landgraf usi film,d bowen,at.a regulation,however,does not operate retroactively simply because it takes into consideration conduct antedating the regulation effective date or upsets expectations based in prior law.see,landgraf,at.citing republic bank of miami united states,d thomas,travenol,united states.rather,a law has an impermissible retroactive effect if,in the absence of congressional intent to the contrary,it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted,increase a party liability for past conduct,or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.landgraf,at.
the supreme court has regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction,whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.id.at.such jurisdictional statutes are generally applied to pending cases because a pplication of a new jurisdictional rule usually takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.id.quoting hallowell commons.in the instant case,by attempting to change whether the board may obtain evidence on behalf of a claimant or adjudicate the effect of a law not previously considered,the va neither altered the parties substantive rights nor created new legal obligations or liabilities it merely changed which office within the va would obtain the evidence or adjudicate the effect of a law not previously considered.present law normally governs in such situations because jurisdictional regulations speak to the power of the court rather than to the rights or obligations of the parties.id.quoting republic bank of miami,at.thus,the challenged regulations,if valid,may be properly applied to appeals that were pending on the effective date.
validity of the challenged regulations 
further development.
section of title,code of federal regulations,states 
a general.if further evidence,clarification of the evidence,correction of a procedural defect,or any other action is essential for a proper appellate decision,a board member or panel of members may 
remand the case to the agency of original jurisdiction,specifying the action to be undertaken or 
direct board personnel to undertake the action essential for a proper appellate decision.
i any such action shall comply with the provisions of a and c f of this chapter relating to va assistance to claimants in developing claims.
ii if the board undertakes to provide the notice required by a b of this chapter,the appellant shall have not less than days to respond to the notice.if,following the notice,the board denies a benefit sought in the pending appeal and the appellant submits relevant evidence after the board decision but before the expiration of one year following the notice,that evidence shall be referred to the agency of original jurisdiction.if any evidence so referred,together with the evidence already of record,is subsequently found to be the basis of an allowance of that benefit,the award effective date will be the same as if the board had granted the benefit in the appeal pending when the notice was provided.
b examples.a remand to the agency of original jurisdiction is not necessary 
to clarify a procedural matter before the board,including the appellant choice of representative before the board,the issues on appeal and requests for a hearing before the board or 
for the board to consider an appeal in light of law,including but not limited to statute,regulation,or court decision,not already considered by the agency of original jurisdiction.
c scope.this section does not apply to 
the board request for an opinion under rule of this chapter 
the board supplementation of the record with a recognized medical treatise and 
matters over which the board has original jurisdiction described in rules and and of this chapter.
emphases added.section,in conjunction with,permits the board to obtain evidence and consider law not previously considered by the aoj without having to remand the appeal to the aoj and without having to obtain the appellant waiver.compare c providing that a ny pertinent evidence accepted by the board must be referred to the aoj for review and preparation of a supplemental statement of the case unless this procedural right is waived by the appellant,with eliminating waiver requirement.section a ii also requires the board to provide the notice required by a and not less than days to respond to the notice.
petitioners argue that the board status as an appellate tribunal prevents the board from developing evidence and that a is contrary to various statutes,including,which requires that decisions by the secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the secretary.nova contends that a ii is inconsistent with the notice and time limitations imposed under.nova and pva also argue that b,which permits the board to consider law not already considered by the aoj,is contrary to.
the va responds that does not deprive appellants of the right to one review on appeal to the secretary because a does not require that all questions decided by the board be the subject of a prior decision of the aoj.the va contends that a ii does not conflict with the time period of b,because if the board denies a benefit and the appellant submits evidence after the board decision,but before expiration of a period following the notice,and that evidence ultimately provides the basis for allowing the benefit,the award effective date will be the same as if the board had granted the benefit in the appeal pending when it provided the notice.finally,the va argues that amended will improve the efficiency of the review on appeal to the secretary by allowing the secretary to avoid unnecessary and time consuming remands for further evidence gathering.at.
first,we find that a is inconsistent with a.the board is primarily an appellate tribunal of the va that decides appeals from denials of claims for veterans benefits.scates principi.section,entitled jurisdiction of the board,provides in pertinent part 
a all questions in a matter which under section a of this title is subject to decision by the secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the secretary.final decisions on such appeals shall be made by the board.decisions of the board shall be based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law and regulation.
b except as provided in section of this title,when a claim is disallowed by the board,the claim may not thereafter be reopened and allowed and a claim based upon the same factual basis may not be considered.
a,b emphasis added see also outlining jurisdiction of the board.section a of title,united states code,states that t he secretary shall decide all questions of law and fact necessary to a decision by the secretary under a law that affects the provision of benefits by the secretary to veterans or the dependents or survivors of veterans.a.the statutory reference to the secretary can not be interpreted to refer only to the aoj.by statute,the board is an agent of the secretary,as are the aojs.see a there is in the department a board of veterans appeals.together,a and a dictate that the board acts on behalf of the secretary in making the ultimate decision on claims and provides one review on appeal to the secretary of a question subject to decision by the secretary under a.id.a.section b establishes a jurisdictional bar to the reconsideration of a claim that has previously been disallowed by the board in the absence of new and material evidence as required by.see barnett brown,stating that decisions of the board may also be revised for clear and unmistakable error.
section a,in conjunction with the amended rule codified at,is inconsistent with a,because a denies appellants one review on appeal to the secretary when the board considers additional evidence without having to remand the case to the aoj for initial consideration and without having to obtain the appellant waiver.indeed,congress unambiguously addressed this issue in a by decreeing that a ll questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the secretary.the va therefore has no choice but to give effect to congress clear intent.see chevron,at.in compliance with that command,the va required the board,when considering additional evidence,to remand the case to the aoj or obtain the appellant waiver.see,ins ventura,d per curiam noting that the decisionmaker can bring its expertise to bear upon the matter it can evaluate the evidence it can make an initial determination and,in doing so,it can,through informed discussion and analysis,help a higher court later determine whether its decision is appropriate.when the board obtains evidence that was not considered by the aoj and does not obtain the appellant waiver,however,an appellant has no means to obtain one review on appeal to the secretary,because the board is the only appellate tribunal under the secretary.
moreover,the veteran is not effectively able to object to any of the additional evidence obtained by the board until after the board weighs the evidence and decides the appeal.although,infra part,requires the board to notify the appellant of evidence it has obtained,this notice does not include a statement of the weight the board intends to assign to new evidence,an assessment of whether the evidence is determinative,significant,or of minimal impact,or a statement whether the new evidence will likely result in the denial of the appeal,and a list of the claimant options.accordingly,a mere statement of additional evidence,without more,does not provide for the veteran to explore effectively a basis for one review on appeal to the secretary with respect to the additional evidence as required by a.
furthermore,we note that when congress intended to authorize the board to obtain additional evidence without one review on appeal to the secretary,it knew how to do so.congress has provided express statutory authority to permit the board to obtain additional evidence,such as expert medical opinions in specific cases.see,a authorizing board to obtain medical opinions from the va under secretary for health formerly the chief medical director authorizing board to obtain independent medical opinions from outside the va a authorizing board to obtain opinions from the veterans health administration b authorizing board to obtain medical opinions from the armed forces institute of pathology.finally,even though the amendments to may further the va stated objective of efficiency,striking the sensible balance between decreasing appeal processing times and the competing public policy of protecting an appellant right to due process is a matter for congress,not this court.accordingly,we find that a,in the manner it operates in tandem with,is contrary to the requirement of a that a ll questions in a matter which is subject to decision by the secretary shall be subject to one review on appeal to the secretary.we therefore hold that,as it operates with,a is invalid.
second,we also agree with petitioners argument that a ii,which provides no less than days to respond to notice,is contrary to b.section,entitled notice to claimants of required information and evidence,provides 
a required information and receipt of a complete or substantially complete application,the secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant representative,if any,of any information,and any medical or lay evidence,not previously provided to the secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.as part of that notice,the secretary shall indicate which portion of that information and evidence,if any is to be provided by the claimant and which portion,if any,the secretary,in accordance with section of this title and any other applicable provisions of law,will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.
b time limitation.in the case of information or evidence that the claimant is notified under subsection a is to be provided by the claimant,if such information or evidence is not received by the secretary within one year from the date of such notification,no benefit may be paid or furnished by reason of the claimant application.
this subsection shall not apply to any application or claim for government life insurance benefits.
emphasis added.under a,when the va receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits,it must notify the claimant of any information,and any medical or lay evidence,not previously provided to the secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.in the case of information or evidence that the va tells the claimant he or she must provide,b provides that,if such information or evidence is not received by the va within one year from the date of the notification,no benefit may be paid or furnished by reason of the claimant application.
under amended a ii,if for some reason an appeal has reached the board without the aoj having provided the notice required by a,a ii permits the board to cure that procedural defect and to require a response period of not less than days.section a ii misleading characterization of the law may lead unsuspecting claimants to believe that they must supply the requested evidence within thirty days.federal law,however,does not so require.the law under a provides the claimant one year to submit evidence.although the response period may well reduce appeal resolution and claim processing time,we doubt that congress authorized the va to accomplish this purpose by misleading claimants.this is especially prejudicial to veterans during the stages of disputes over benefits,when veterans rely on the strongly and uniquely character of the veterans benefits system and pursue their statutory entitlements without the assistance of legal counsel.see c prohibiting fee agreements with an attorney until the board issues a final decision.accordingly,the limitation imposes a misleading hurdle to the claimant by attempting to accelerate the closing of the claim file but not notifying the unsuspecting claimant that he or she has a full year to submit the evidence and still be within the statutory time period.
moreover,if an appeal is lodged more than days after the decision is issued and has become final,a ii does not specify whether any evidence at that point needs to meet the requirements of new and material evidence.see a.although a ii permits the appellant to submit evidence to the aoj after the board denies a benefit,it prejudices claimants by not providing the statutory period to submit evidence before the board denies the claim,because under b,the secretary is authorized to reopen such claims only if new and material evidence is presented or secured.see a spencer brown.accordingly,the unreasonably misleading nature of a ii,coupled with the lack of specification as to whether any evidence after the board issues a final decision needs to meet the requirements of new and material evidence,provides sufficient grounds for us to hold the regulation contrary to b.
third,we do not find b,which permits the board to consider law not considered by the aoj,contrary to nor is it arbitrary or capricious.whenever the board considers whether the proper law was applied by the aoj in a particular claim,the board inherently provides legal questions one review on appeal to the secretary as required by a.in addition,because a requires that d ecisions of the board shall be based upon consideration of all applicable provisions of law and regulation,b is a reasonable exercise of the va rulemaking ability under chevron.moreover,we note that,independent of a,a process of review is available to the veteran if the board considers law not considered by the aoj.the veterans judicial review act of,stat.vjra,established a framework for the adjudication of claims regarding veterans benefits.the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court,an article i court established by congress in the vjra,has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from the final decisions by the board.a.t
