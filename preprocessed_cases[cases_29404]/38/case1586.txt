i f and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of 
a any court decree of divorce,annulment,or legal separation,or the terms of any court order or property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce,annulment,or legal separation.
this provision authorizes opm to comply with an appropriate court decree of divorce or property settlement of an employee who is entitled to payments pursuant to the civil service retirement system.donlan office of pers.
to implement this statute,opm has promulgated regulations that define when an order of divorce or property settlement is a court order acceptable for processing.see b.the pertinent regulations specify that,to qualify for processing by opm,the court order must identify the retirement system under which the annuity exists and expressly state the portion to which the former spouse is entitled under the court order.see see also c.portion must be stated as a fixed amount,percentage,or fraction,or formula calculable solely from face of court order.in the event opm receives an application from a former spouse for benefits pursuant to a divorce decree,and the application fails to comply with the regulations defining an order acceptable for processing,opm notifies the applicant of the specific reasons for disapproving the application.see.the applicant then has an opportunity to cure any error in the application and to reapply for benefits.rosato office of pers.

i n executing court orders under this part,opm must honor the clear instructions of the court.instructions must be specific and unambiguous.opm will not supply missing provisions,interpret ambiguous language,or clarify the court intent by researching individual state laws.in carrying out the court instructions,opm performs purely ministerial actions in accordance with these regulations.disagreement between the parties concerning the validity or the provisions of any court order must be resolved by the court.

the guidelines in the regulations for interpreting state court orders dividing civil service retirement benefits include the following 
orders that award a portion of the value of an annuity as of a specific date before retirement,without specifying what value is,will be interpreted as awarding a portion of the annuity equal to the monthly annuity rate at the time of retirement times a fraction,the numerator of which is the number of months of creditable service or service worked as of the date specified and the denominator of which is the total number of months as of the time of retirement of creditable service or service worked,whichever term is used in the court order.see.of these guidelines.

subparagraph provides for the same formula using creditable service for interpreting o rders that contain general language awarding a specified portion of a federal employee retirement benefits as of a specified date before retirement,but do not specify whether opm should use creditable service or service worked as of the date specified to complete the computation.part,subpart j,app.a.
although perry apparently contends that the divorce decree was not a qualifying court order because it awarded his wife half of the value of his pension without specifying what that value was,subparagraph above specifically deals with that situation and explains how opm will interpret such an order.in calculating linda perry share of perry retirement annuity,opm used that formula.it ruled that linda perry was entitled to of the amount produced by applying to perry annuity a fraction whose numerator was the number of months the perry had been married and whose denominator was the number of months of his federal service,or of his annuity.the use of this formula was an appropriate and reasonable method of implementing the award in the divorce decree.
as noted earlier,the decree awarded linda perry half of the value of the husband pension for the period of time from may,when the parties married through and including the date of this divorce november.in other words,the court awarded her of the value of the pension that had been earned during the marriage.since the amount of the pension directly depended upon the length of his service,basing her award on the comparative time they were married and his total federal service fairly reflected the share of his retirement annuity that the florida court awarded her.
