this case is about the procedures two individuals must follow to become domestic partners under california law.
james burnham burnham and real party in interest kathleen honeyman honeyman wanted to become domestic partners.on a saturday morning,they completed a notarized declaration of domestic partnership.later that afternoon,burnham died.the following monday,honeyman presented the declaration to the office of the secretary of state,and the clerk filed it.
thereafter,honeyman applied for burnham state pension survivor benefits.the administrative board of the state pension system ruled honeyman was entitled to the benefits,but the trial court held she was not because honeyman and burnham were not domestic partners at the time he died.the trial court got it right.
the legislature by statute has enumerated the requirements for establishing a domestic partnership.the statute states in relevant part,a domestic partnership shall be established in california when both persons file a declaration of domestic partnership with the secretary of state,and,at the time of filing b oth persons are capable of consenting to the domestic partnership.
consistent with the language of the statute,we hold that presenting a declaration of domestic partnership for filing with the secretary of state is a necessary prerequisite for a valid domestic partnership,and at the time of presentation,both individuals to the partnership must be capable of consenting.
here,because burnham was deceased when honeyman presented the declaration of domestic partnership for filing with the secretary of state,honeyman and burnham never became domestic partners.therefore,honeyman was not entitled to burnham state pension survivor benefits.
factual and procedural background 
burnham became a member of the california public employees retirement system calpers in.he designated his as his primary beneficiary and his four children,including two of whom are plaintiffs here john burnham and james burnham ii as his secondary beneficiaries.burnham and his wife later divorced.
after the divorce,burnham and honeyman began living together in.nine years later,burnham changed his calpers primary beneficiary designation to honeyman.in the change of beneficiary form,honeyman was listed as burnham friend.
burnham developed prostate cancer in.in may,burnham filed a service retirement election application in which he designated the estate of james burnham as his beneficiary.in july,burnham retired.
burnham became extremely ill by october.honeyman had been caring for him while she was working,but burnham needed full time care due to the severity of his illness.they both realized honeyman could take time off work if the two were spouses or domestic partners.so about a week before burnham ended up dying,honeyman and burnham decided to become domestic partners.burnham and honeyman signed the declaration of domestic partnership in their house at approximately on saturday,october,in front of a notary.at burnham died.he was years old.
the following monday,october,honeyman hand delivered the declaration of domestic partnership to the secretary of state office in fresno.the clerk filed it and the secretary of state issued burnham and honeyman a certificate of registered domestic partnership dated october.
honeyman applied for burnham state pension survivor benefits,which totaled approximately.calpers staff denied her application,reasoning she and burnham were not registered domestic partners at the time burnham died.it determined the benefits were properly payable to burnham surviving children as burnham intestate heirs.honeyman appealed the calpers staff denial,but an administrative law judge alj issued a proposed ruling in favor of the calpers staff determination.the calpers board of administration the calpers board voted not to adopt the alj proposed ruling and instead decided the matter itself.the calpers board decided honeyman was entitled to the benefits under a putative spouse theory,reasoning honeyman had a reasonable good faith belief that registration of the declaration of domestic partnership had validly taken place.
two of burnham children plaintiffs john burnham and james burnham ii filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus challenging the calpers board determination.the trial court granted the writ.in a and thoughtful opinion,the trial court explained honeyman and burnham were not domestic partners because burnham was dead at the time honeyman filed the declaration,the putative spouse doctrine did not apply because that doctrine protects the expectation of parties who accumulate property over time believing they are part of a valid union,which is not what happened here,and the law as applied did not violate equal protection principles.
honeyman appeals from the resulting judgment.she contends the trial court erred in concluding she and burnham were not domestic partners at the time he died,erred in refusing to apply the putative spouse doctrine,and erred in concluding the law as applied here did not violate state equal protection principles.calpers,who appears as respondent,joins in honeyman arguments.we address each of these arguments after pausing for a short history of opposite sex domestic partnerships in california.
discussion 
ia short history of opposite sex domestic partnerships in california 
in,the california legislature enacted and the governor signed into law the state first domestic partnership statutes.stats,ch,adding.as enacted,the legislation allowed two types of couples to become domestic partners one,same sex couples where both individuals were at least years old and two,opposite sex couples where both individuals were over years old and met certain criteria under the social security act.former,subd.b a b,added by stats,ch.as introduced,the bill did not distinguish between same sex or opposite sex couples and allowed either to enter into domestic partnerships if the individuals to the partnership were at least years old and met certain other requirements.assem.bill reg.sess.as introduced.the opposite sex couples were later carved out as a special category in the domestic partnership legislation because many would not,or could not,marry due to restrictions on social security or other pension benefits that would affect their incomes.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended.
in,the legislature expanded the class of individuals who may establish a domestic partnership by providing that persons of opposite sex may establish a domestic partnership if one or both of them were over the age of and one or both of them met certain criteria under the social security act.stats,ch,amending,subd.b b.
with this background of the history of opposite sex domestic partnerships in mind,we turn to the issues raised here.
a valid domestic partnership requires the parties to file a declaration of domestic partnership 
honeyman contends the court erred in concluding she and burnham were not domestic partners at the time he died.she bases her contention on the view that filing the declaration of domestic partnership is a ministerial act akin to filing a marriage certificate,and it is completing the notarized declaration that is the required act,akin to solemnizing a marriage.
