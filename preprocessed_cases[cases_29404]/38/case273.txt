appellant west virginia appeals the district court grant of summary judgment for the united states on its claim that west virginia tax statute is preempted by f,which bars states from taxing insurance carriers with respect to funds they receive from the federal employees health benefits program fehbp.because we conclude that the statutory language of section f does not encompass the tax that imposes,we reverse the district court judgment.
congress has provided for federal employees,their families,and federal retirees the enrollees to gain access to health benefits through a program known as the federal employees health benefits program fehbp.the federal employees health benefits act,whose provisions are now codified in title of the united states code in sections et,sets out the terms of fehbp and provides for the office of personnel management opm,the agency charged with administering fehbp,to contract with various health insurance carriers the carriers to offer the carriers health insurance plans to fehbp enrollees.to purchase insurance under a fehbp plan,enrollees make payments,matched by contributions from the federal government,into a specifically designated account in the united states treasury,entitled the federal employees health benefits fund the fund.the fund in turn disburses payments directly to the carriers,reimbursing them for the health care services they purchase on behalf of the enrollees.
as part of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,congress amended the statutory scheme governing fehbp,including section f,which now reads as follows 
no tax,fee or other monetary payment may be imposed directly or indirectly,on a carrier of an approved health benefits plan by any state,with respect to any payment made from the fund.
f emphasis added.
based on this preemption provision,which,forbids states from taxing health insurance carriers with respect to funds they obtain from fehbp,the united states challenged west virginia enforcement of west virginia code et,a state tax on the gross receipts health care providers receive for various broad categories of services.the tax legal incident falls solely on health care providers,hospitals,who are required to calculate a percentage of their receipts in each taxed category of services,and then to pay that amount to the state tax authority.in stipulations before the court,west virginia admits that the tax cost may be passed through from providers to carriers,and that some providers do in fact pass the tax cost on to carriers,including with respect to fehbp covered patient services.see at.ultimately though,the provider alone bears the tax legal liability.
the district court granted summary judgment to the united states,concluding that,insofar as it taxes health care services provided to fehbp enrollees,is preempted by section f because providers can,and some in fact do,pass the tax cost through to the carriers,thus indirectly taxing the carriers purchase of those services with fund monies.
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment for the united states,viewing the facts and inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to west virginia.anderson liberty lobby,d.because this dispute ultimately turns entirely on a question of statutory interpretation,the district court properly proceeded to resolve the case on summary judgment.
west virginia argues that section f of title can not preempt because is not a tax on the carriers,but on the providers.of critical importance,it reasons that even though providers might be able to pass the economic costs of the tax along to the carriers,that potential economic burden does not constitute a tax imposed indirectly on the carriers.
whether the economic effect with which may burden the carriers constitutes indirect imposition of a tax on the carriers can be resolved only by first determining what an indirect tax is,as that term relates to the relationship between a tax and its payer.as neither section f,nor its accompanying regulation,provides guidance as to that definition,we instead look to the consistent usage of that term,as it stood in when congress amended the provision 
for over two hundred years,a single,consistent usage of the term indirect tax has been employed in reference to the relationship between a tax and its payer.that usage establishes that an indirect tax is one imposed on goods.examples abound since our founding.at that time,taxes were understood to be imposed indirectly on persons when they were imposed in the form of imposts or duties,const.art.i,section,cl,or as excises.see the federalist,at alexander hamilton clinton rossiter,i n america,far the greatest part of the national revenue is derived from taxes of the indirect kind,from imposts,and from excises.duties on imported articles form a large branch of this latter description.the federalist,at alexander hamilton t axes may be subdivided into those of the direct and those of the indirect kind.though objection be made to both,yet the reasoning upon it seems to be confined to the former branch.and indeed,as to the latter,by which must be understood duties and excises on articles of consumption,one is at a loss to conceive what can be the nature of the difficulties apprehended.
and,up to the present time,the supreme court has consistently employed this same usage,saying,for example,that an indirect tax is a tax levied on the goods themselves,and computed as a percentage of the manufacturer sales price rather than the income or wealth of the purchaser or seller.zenith radio united states,d.compare camps,town of harrison,d thomas,dissenting recognizing the distinction between direct and indirect taxes and that indirect taxes are marked by their being taxes on goods,united states ptasynski,d the uniformity clause governing duties,imposts,and excises conditions congress power to impose indirect taxes,michelin tire wages,d citing hamilton definition of an indirect tax from the federalist papers,with hylton united states,dall.the general division of taxes is into direct and indirect.although the latter term is not to be found in the constitution,yet the former necessarily implies it.indirect stands opposed to direct.there may,perhaps,be an indirect tax on a particular article,that can not be comprehended within the description of duties,or imposts,or excises in such case it will be comprised under the general denomination of taxes.for the term tax is the genus,and includes,direct taxes.duties,imposts,and excises.all other classes of indirect kind,and not within any of the classifications enumerated above.as a consequence of this consistent usage,congress reference in section f to a tax being imposed indirectly,without further legislative or agency definition,is best understood to refer to a tax,and the legal incidents thereof,being levied on goods in which taxpayers transact.
that indirect taxes have consistently been defined with respect to the legal incidents of levies,duties,and the like provides strong reason to reject the united states interpretation of section f,asserting that the of tax costs,as an economic matter,equates to the indirect imposition of a tax.but it is not the only reason.also pivotal here is that the supreme court has expressly considered and rejected like economic theories in formulating its understanding of what constitutes indirect taxation in the analogous constitutional field of preemption of state taxation of the federal government.
in united states fresno,d,the court rejected a general economic theory of indirect taxation in deciding whether a state could tax federal employees on their possessory interests in housing owned and supplied to them by the federal government as part of their compensation.the court there noted first that 
s ince mcculloch,the supreme court has adhered to the rule that states may not impose taxes directly on the federal government,nor may they impose taxes the legal incidence of which falls on the federal government.
fresno,at.the cases the court cited to establish the latter proposition involved taxes levied on goods,such as in united states mississippi tax comm n,d,where the government actor was liable for sales taxes on liquor products,and in,scurlock,where the government assumed responsibility by contract for another form of a state excise tax.see fresno,at.these case citations make clear that the court reference to taxes not imposed directly on the federal government but whose legal incidence falls on the federal government was a reference to indirect taxes.
having thus noted that states can enforce neither direct nor indirect taxes against the federal government,the court then acknowledged that 
t he decisions of this court since mcculloch have been less uniform on the question whether taxes,the economic but not legal incidence of which falls in part or in full on the federal government,are invalid.
fresno,at.emphasis added.on this question,the court concluded that its precedent yielded the rule that the economic burden on a federal function of a state tax imposed on those who deal with the federal government does not render the tax unconstitutional so long as the tax is imposed equally on the other similarly situated constituents of the state.id.at.applying this rule,the court concluded that the state tax of the government employees housing benefit,though passing an economic burden through to the federal government by lowering the effective pay rate of its employees,was not a prohibited tax on the federal government because the tax equally applied to other similarly situated constituents of the state 
fresno holding therefore results in the rule that an economic of a generally applicable tax does not constitute a tax,direct or indirect,of the recipient of the.this is the necessary implication of the court statements.for,the court conclusion that states,prohibited from imposing taxes directly or indirectly on the federal government,can yet impose economic burdens on the federal government by broadly taxing parties that contract with the federal government,necessarily implies that such economic impositions are not themselves direct or indirect impositions of tax on the federal government.
fresno rule should apply here by analogy because of the many similarities between section f preemption and the constitution preemption of state taxation of the federal government.section f precludes states from taxing the carriers directly or indirectly.the constitution precludes states from taxing the federal government directly or indirectly.both ensure that state tax laws do not thwart the will of the federal government.both face the economic reality that the states tax regimes would be seriously hampered were all state taxes of tax payers that create economic burdens on protected taxpayers treated as indirect taxes of those protected taxpayers.because of these similarities,we think that like reasoning ought govern analysis of indirect taxation under each.thus,we follow fresno rule and hold that section f prohibits states from placing legal incidents of direct or indirect taxes on carriers with respect to fehbp funds but allows states to tax other parties in ways that may impose economic burdens on carriers with respect to fehbp funds,so long as those taxes are equally applied to the states other similarly situated constituents.
the government suggests that we should not reach this conclusion because other circuits have decided the matter differently,adopting an economic analysis under section f.in particular,it points to the second and third circuits,which in health maint.org.of new jersey whitman,cir,and travelers ins.cuomo,cir,concluded,respectively,that special fixed assessments of insurance carriers and surcharges added to the hospital rates paid by insurance carriers both constitute state action prohibited by section f because they resulted in increased payments from the fund,whitman,at.
neither whitman nor travelers,however,involved a tax that was levied on a party other than the carriers.rather,both cases involved impositions levied on the carriers themselves in whitman,the imposition was levied by the state on the carriers as a direct special assessment in travelers,the imposition was levied by the hospital on the carriers,under the state dictate,as a surcharge added to invoices paid by the carriers.thus,in those cases,there was never a question as to whether the legal incidents of the tax fell on the carriers.
the economic analysis that these courts engaged in was only employed to answer the question of whether the impositions at issue were made with respect to any payment made from the fund.f.on this score,the courts concluded that the imposition on the carriers respected payments made from the fund since the carriers received their payments from the fund based on the costs they accrued in providing care to the enrollees.consequently,the holdings of whitman and travelers are inapposite here,and there is no split between our understanding of section f and theirs.
the dissent,in an attempt to give a broader definition to the term indirect and to argue that the supreme court has adopted the economic pass through theory,asserts that the supreme court has interpreted statutory language nearly identical to f as prohibiting taxes that could be passed through.post at.in particular,the dissent contends that,in northwest airlines,county of kent,michigan,d,the court recognized that fees levied on airlines,such as l anding fees,terminal charges,and other airport user fees,were levied indirectly on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of such persons.post at emphasis added.the court concluded no such thing.
the question presented in northwest airlines was whether the various airport fees were fee s or other charge s directly or indirectly imposed on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce,which are prohibited by the tax act.at.quoting a.in resolving this question,the court did not hold,contrary to judge williams belief,that the airport fees were imposed indirectly on passengers.the court held,rather,and only,that such fees were imposed directly or indirectly on either persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce,on passengers or airlines.id.emphases added.
the sleight of hand employed by judge williams lies in her selective quotation and omission from the actual text of the court opinion,as confirmed by a comparison of the actual text which was nothing more in substance than a quotation from the tax act itself with judge williams selective quotation from that text and therefore also from the statute.it was unnecessary for the supreme court to be more specific than it was.however,if one were forced to say whether the court regarded the imposed fees as direct or as indirect fees on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce,the obvious conclusion would have to be that the court regarded the fees as direct impositions on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce,not as indirect fees imposed on persons traveling in air commerce.after all,the question presented to the court was whether airport fees that were being directly imposed on carriers were prohibited by the tax act.the court did not even have a question before it as to the indirect imposition of fees on passengers 
applying both the consistently employed understanding of an indirect tax and fresno economic analysis,we conclude that section f does not preempt.first,though it is readily apparent that is an indirect tax,it is of equal immediate apparency that it is an indirect tax of the providers,not of the carriers,for the legal incidents of the tax fall on the providers alone.and second,since we decline to imply some novel economic theory to section f s prohibition on indirect taxation,the fact that equally applies to the states other similarly situated constituents,it applies to all providers of the specified categories of health care services,not just to providers of services to enrollees suffices to establish that any economic burden it may pass through to the carriers does not equate to an imposition of an indirect tax on them 
conclusion 
for the reasons given above,the judgment of the district court is reversed.
