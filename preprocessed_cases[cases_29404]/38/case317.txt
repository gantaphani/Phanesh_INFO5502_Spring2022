this consolidated appeal presents the same issue we recently resolved en banc in pace bogalusa city school does a state waive its eleventh amendment immunity from suit in federal court under of the rehabilitation act of when it accepts federal funds that are granted by congress under authority of the constitution spending clause and expressly conditioned on waiver of immunity from for reasons that follow,we find no merit in appellants arguments and reaffirm our conclusions in pace that acceptance of such federal funds operates to waive a state eleventh amendment immunity under the express conditions of 
background 
louisiana department of education ladoe and department of social services dss and texas tech university health sciences center ttuhsc collectively defendants appeal rulings by district courts which held that,by accepting federal funds offered on explicit conditions of waiver,defendants in fact waived their right to eleventh immunity pursuant to and were therefore amenable to suit in federal court for violations.later,a panel of this court in pace bogalusa city school pace i held that,despite the express provision in the grant that entitlement of the grantee to accept the funds was conditioned on such a waiver,a state did not waive eleventh amendment immunity from suit under by accepting federal funds at a time when,based on the state of the pertinent case law,the state had reason to believe that it had no such immunity to waive.two panels of this court,relying on pace i,reversed the district courts denials of eleventh amendment immunity and dismissed the plaintiffs claims under 
we later reheard pace en banc and held that,then as now,a state did waive eleventh amendment immunity from suit under by accepting federal funds under such circumstances pace ii prior to rehearing pace en banc,we had agreed to rehear the instant cases en banc,but postponed rehearing them pending our decision in pace ii.
after pace ii was announced,we asked the parties in these cases to submit supplemental briefs explaining which of their arguments regarding eleventh amendment immunity from suits under remained viable and which had been foreclosed.in response,the defendants conceded that pace ii forecloses all their arguments except three.
first,both ladoe and ttuhsc contend that no valid waiver of eleventh amendment immunity occurred because,even though they received federal funds,none of the state agencies was expressly authorized by state law to waive its respective state immunity from suit under.second,ttuhsc contends that pace ii did not address the issue whether and place conditions on federal funds that are not reasonably related to the purpose of the expenditure,which is part of the test for valid spending clause legislation set forth by the supreme court in south dakota dole third,ladoe asserts that it did not knowingly waive eleventh amendment immunity under by accepting federal funds,contending that this argument,although rejected in pace ii,should be reexamined in light of the supreme court subsequent decision in jackson birmingham board of education 
ii.state immunity under the eleventh amendment 
express authority to waive immunity 
we consider first defendants argument that they did not waive their states eleventh amendment immunity from suit under because they lacked express authorization to do so under state law.defendants do not challenge that they were authorized under state law to accept federal funds or that each received federal funds defendants insist,however,that as state agencies,their authority to accept federal funds is insufficient to waive eleventh amendment immunity,which,they argue,can not be validly waived without express statutory authority.
defendants argument fails to recognize that grant programs based on the spending clause are to be interpreted under ordinary contractual principles in these cases,the defendants were authorized by the state to accept the benefits of substantial sums of federal spending clause money burdened with the clearly stated condition under that acceptance waives immunity from suit in federal court.the statutory powers of attorney provided to defendants by their respective state legislatures to accept,administer,and expend such federal funds necessarily includes the authorization to accept the conditions that come along with those funds.clothed with this authority,the defendants held themselves out to have authority from their states to comply with the conditions imposed by congress in the statute.these conditions are inseparable from the offer of the funds the states or their authorized agencies may reject the condition of waiver of eleventh amendment immunity by rejecting the funds,or they may accept the funds and the conditions they can not,however,accept the benefits of the funds and reject the inextricably intertwined condition of waiver by claiming post hoc that the delegation of authority to accept the funds did not carry with it the authority to waive immunity.this is hornbook contract and agency law.
therefore,we reject defendants argument that they retain eleventh amendment immunity because they lacked express statutory authority to waive their states eleventh amendment immunity 
relatedness 
we next address ttuhsc argument that and are unconstitutional spending clause legislation because they place conditions on federal grants that are not reasonably related to the purpose of the expenditure.this is often referred to as the relatedness prong of the dole test for valid spending clause legislation according to ttuhsc,they are not governed by because none of the federal funds they received were earmarked for goals of preventing disability discrimination or accommodating disability.ttuhsc urges that,if we determine that the immunity waiver condition imposed by is not limited to rehabilitation act funding but that they accompany all federal funding,we should hold that fails the relatedness prong of the dole test.
ttuhsc failed to raise this argument in its briefs before either the district court or the original panel of this court.neither did it argue the point in its original en banc brief.in pace ii,we concluded that the state defendant had waived this relatedness argument because it failed to argue the point before the original panel and did not argue it in its en banc brief beyond a bare assertion the maxim is well established in this circuit that a party who fails to make an argument before either the district court or the original panel waives it for purposes of en banc consideration 
if we are required to address this argument because it relates to eleventh amendment immunity,and as such may be a jurisdictional defense that can not be waived we reject it.we agree with the four circuit courts that have addressed this issue and concluded that,if the involved state agency or department accepts federal financial assistance,it waives its eleventh amendment immunity even though the federal funds are not earmarked for programs that further the and rehabilitation goals of chief judge scirica persuasive opinion for the third circuit in koslow is particularly helpful in explaining this point.
in that case,the state of pennsylvania received federal financial assistance for the state criminal alien assistance program,established to alleviate costs states incur in imprisoning illegal aliens who commit state offenses the state furnished these funds to the pennsylvania department of corrections the plaintiff,koslow,was employed by the department of corrections as a supervisor at the prison water treatment plant and brought a suit against his employer for failing to accommodate his disability following a work related injury 
the state defendants argued that the federal government interest in the federally funded program was too attenuated from the general waiver of immunity set forth in respecting claims under.the koslow court disagreed and concluded that receipt of federal funding by an agency operated as a waiver of that agency eleventh amendment immunity even though the funds are not earmarked for purposes.the court gave three reasons for its conclusion.first,the panel found that
