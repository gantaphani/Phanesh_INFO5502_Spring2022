plaintiff blue cross of california blue cross appeals from a judgment denying a petition for writ of mandate code civ,to set aside the decision of a hearing officer of the defendant department of health services dhs or department that granted the appeal of real party in interest molina healthcare of california molina healthcare and set aside the department notices of intent to award managed care contracts to blue cross for riverside and san bernardino counties.
plaintiff blue cross and real party in interest molina healthcare submitted competing bids to the department to provide managed health care services to the members of california program residing in riverside and san bernardino counties.
the bid process was initiated by the issuance of a request for proposal rfp,soliciting bids for contracts to manage the medical care of members in each county and establishing conditions for the bid.the rfp required a separate bid proposal for each county that contained a list of providers who had contracted with the bidder to render medical services to members residing in the county.the rfp is administered by the dhs office of procurement omcp,which is authorized to reject a proposal.the bids are scored by evaluators within the department.
molina healthcare was the existing contractor for riverside and san bernardino counties and submitted identical lists of providers with each proposal,consisting of the combined lists of providers located in both counties.the omcp rejected the bids as on the ground the rfp required a separate provider network for each county.dhs issued notices of intent to award the contracts to blue cross.before the rejection,evaluators for the department gave molina healthcare the highest technical scores for both counties.
molina healthcare appealed the dhs action to a department hearing officer,who ruled that the rfp did not preclude the submission of identical,provider networks and that omcp was incorrect in finding molina healthcare submissions for that reason.the hearing officer set aside the notices of intent to award the contracts to blue cross and directed that dhs rescore the blue cross and molina healthcare proposals based on the original provider lists.the trial court affirmed the decision of the hearing officer and blue cross appealed the judgment 
blue cross argues that it is the omcp decision we should review and that we should sustain its resolution of any ambiguities in the rfp and conflicts in the evidence.from this vantage point blue cross argues the omcp reading of the rfp was correct and that molina healthcare submissions accordingly were.
blue cross has misunderstood our scope of review of the hearing officer decision.the hearing officer is vested with the department authority to construe the rfp and to determine whether the omcp failed to apply it correctly.for this reason it is the decision of the hearing officer we review.
the dispositive issue is the construction of the rfp.we shall conclude the hearing officer correctly found there is neither an express nor an implied prohibition in the rfp for listing providers that serve more than one county and that it was appropriate to order rescoring the proposals on the basis of the original submissions.
we shall affirm the judgment of the superior court.
facts and procedural background 
the director of the department is mandated to enter into contracts with managed care plans for the provision of services to persons eligible to receive medical benefits pursuant to programs.welf.managed care is the predominate delivery program for the majority of members in california.to implement and maintain the managed care contract,dhs expects the contractor to develop and maintain a network of health care providers capable of providing the full scope of managed care benefits.primary care physicians provide the majority of personal health care and are responsible for initiating and coordinating referrals for necessary specialty and ancillary care.
the bid process for the managed care contract is initiated by the issuance of an rfp,specifying the conditions under which a bid proposal is to be prepared.by notice dated march,dhs,through the omcp,issued rfp number requesting a proposal to provide managed health care services to the beneficiaries of the state program in alameda,contra costa,los angeles,riverside,san bernardino,san francisco,santa clara counties 
the rfp authorized a bidder to compete for more than one county but required that a separate proposal be submitted for each county that included all of the technical proposal requirement tpr categories.the categories of concern on appeal are tpr,that directed a bidder to submit a list of primary care physicians by subspecialty who will provide covered primary care services to members and tpr,that directed the bidder to describe its current accessibility standards for appointments for various kinds of care,including routine and urgent care.
the department received proposals for riverside and san bernardino counties from four bidders,including molina healthcare and blue cross.at the time of submission of its proposals for riverside and san bernardino counties,and for eight years prior thereto,molina healthcare held the contracts for the two counties.it claims the provider networks submitted in response to the current rfp are the approved networks molina has in place to satisfy the identical contract requirements in the existing riverside and san bernardino contract.
for this reason molina healthcare provided two identical lists of providers,one for riverside county and one for san bernardino county.blue cross does not dispute these facts.the omcp rejected molina healthcare proposals as because networks serving more than one county are prohibited by the rfp.
the rfp provides that a contract,if awarded,will be to the responsive and responsible proposer in each county,who earns the highest total score.a score is arrived at by means of evaluation committees consisting of an evaluation scoring committee esc,a rating review committee rrc and the executive review committee erc.
the evaluators who examined the molina healthcare provider networks gave molina healthcare the highest scores for both riverside county and san bernardino county.most of them appeared to understand that molina had submitted a combined network,or had at least successfully evaluated information the hearing officer observed that molina riverside and san bernardino category provider network proposals show why the evaluators were able to identify the extent of service to each county even though it chose to submit a combined network.first,the submissions include and are augmented by a detailed narrative,which is not prohibited by the rfp.second,the individual rfp category responses contain a wealth of information on critical subjects differentiating the application of the combined network to the two counties.
however,the omcp concluded that molina healthcare dual county submissions did not comply with the rfp requirement that a separate provider network be identified for each county.by letter dated may,the omcp notified molina healthcare of its disqualification.it said in molina original submission,lists representing six specific provider network types were identical for both counties signifying a combined network for each provider type.the rfp required for each provider type that a separate network be identified for san bernardino county and that another separate network be identified for riverside county.molina healthcare submissions for riverside county and san bernardino county did not comply with this rfp requirement and were therefore.further,b efore the finding,the esc had given molina the highest technical scores for both riverside county and san bernardino county.dhs did not discover the defect in the submissions until scoring was almost complete.accordingly,the omcp concluded that the scores achieved for molina provider networks are invalid as the scores were based upon an improper submission of a combined two county provider network 
a disappointed bidder may take an administrative appeal pursuant to the procedures of the rfp,if it has submit ted a ti
