the public safety officers benefits act psoba,et,provides benefits to the relatives of public safety officers who are killed as the result of injuries sustained in the line of duty.the statute also provides benefits to public safety officers who are permanently disabled,id.b,and educational benefits to dependents of federal law enforcement officers who are killed or disabled in the line of duty,id.
congress has assigned administration of the benefit program to the bureau of justice assistance bja,an agency within the department of justice.prospective beneficiaries submit claims to the bja,and the bja determines,under regulations issued pursuant to statute,whether the decedent was a public safety officer who died under circumstances that entitle the beneficiaries to an award under the statute.a.judicial review of the bja decisions is available in the court of federal claims.demutiis united states.
this is a consolidated appeal from two decisions of the court of federal claims,groff united states,and labare united states.the two cases both involve challenges to bja determinations denying death benefits to the relatives of pilots who were employed by private contractors and who died while rendering fire suppression assistance to public agencies.the bja denied the claims for benefits.the bja ruled that neither of the pilots was a public safety officer within the meaning of psoba,because both were employees of private companies and therefore were not serving a public agency in an official capacity at the time of their deaths.see a.
the court of federal claims in the groff case overturned the bja decision denying benefits,while the court in the labare case upheld the bja decision denying benefits.we hold that the bja decision should have been sustained in both cases.we therefore reverse the judgment in groff and affirm the judgment in labare.
lawrence groff was employed as a helicopter pilot by san joaquin helicopters,a private company based in california.san joaquin helicopters entered into a contract with the california department of forestry and fire protection to provide piloting services for fire suppression missions.the contract provided that the company employees shall act in an independent capacity and not as officers or employees or agents of the state of california,that the company would indemnify california and maintain liability insurance for activities performed pursuant to the contract,and that the company would pay and provide benefits for the pilots who performed services under the contract.the aviation procedures handbook of the california department of forestry and fire protection states that c ontractors must understand that they are acting in an independent capacity in the performance of their service,and not as an officer,employee,or agent of the state.
while piloting a helicopter pursuant to the contract,groff died as a result of a collision with another aircraft.following his death,groff wife and stepson,christine wells groff and michael wells,applied for psoba benefits.the bja determined that,as the employee of a government contractor,groff did not satisfy the psoba definition of public safety officer,and it denied the claim.the claimants then requested and obtained a hearing at two additional levels of administrative review within the bja,but the claim was denied at both levels.the hearing examiner and the director of the bja both wrote lengthy opinions explaining the reasons for the denial.in essence,both concluded,based on a legal position the bja had adhered to for more than years,that the employee of a private contractor does not qualify as a public safety officer within the meaning of psoba.
the claimants then sought review of the bja decision in the court of federal claims.the court held that the bja decision was erroneous and granted the claimants motion for judgment on the administrative record,awarding them in benefits.
the court noted that psoba defines a public safety officer as an individual serving a public agency in an official capacity,a,and that in a policy directive,the bja stated that in order to be serving a public agency in an official capacity,one must be an officer,employee,volunteer,or in a similar relationship of performing services as part of a public agency,and that to have such a relationship with a public agency,an individual must be officially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of the public agency.measuring groff service against that test,the court found that he was not an employee of the california department of forestry and fire protection,but that he was in a similar relationship of performing services as part of the california agency and that he was officially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of that agency.based on those findings and on the court conclusion that the statute could not properly be construed to exclude all contract employees from coverage,the court held that the claimants were entitled to benefits based on groff death.the court therefore entered judgment for the plaintiffs for the death benefits payable under the psoba statute.the government has taken an appeal from that decision.
craig labare was a pilot employed by hawkins powers aviation,a private aviation service.hawkins powers aviation entered into a contract with the forest service to provide airtankers for the suppression of fires.under the contract,the company was responsible for aircraft equipment,maintenance,safety,and flight crews.the contract also stated that the company was required to obtain liability insurance and would be responsible for all damage to property and to persons.
while labare was piloting an airtanker pursuant to the contract,the wings of his aircraft detached,causing a fatal crash.following his death,his wife laurie labare filed a claim for psoba benefits.the bja denied the claim,on the grounds that labare,as the employee of a government contractor,was not a public safety officer serving a public agency in an official capacity within the meaning of psoba.like the claimants in the groff case,labare obtained a hearing and two levels of review within the bja,but her claim was rejected,first by a hearing examiner and then by the director of the bja.
labare sought review in the court of federal claims.the court,acting through a different judge from the one assigned to the groff case,affirmed the bja decision.
the court in labare looked to whether the decision of the bja denying labare claim was supported by substantial evidence.the court noted that the bja defined the term public safety officer in psoba to exclude employees of private companies,even if they were killed while working with public agencies and engaged in fire suppression.
the court observed that psoba did not define what it means to be serving a public agency in an official capacity.relying on this court decision in chacon united states,the trial court held that the bja interpretation of the statute,as expressed in prior decisions of the agency and summarized in a bja publication,is entitled to deference under the principles of chevron natural resources defense council,d.under the bja interpretation of the statute,in order to qualify as a public safety officer the individual in question must be an officer,employee,volunteer,or similar relationship of performing services as a part of a public agency and must be officially recognized or designated as functionally within or a part of the public agency.in this case,the court concluded,substantial evidence supported the bja conclusion that labare,as an employee of a private contractor,was never officially recognized as a government employee or acknowledged as functionally a part of the forest service.the court therefore denied labare claim for psoba benefits.labare has appealed from that decision.
psoba provides that in any case in which the bja determines,under regulations issued pursuant to the statute,that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,the bja shall pay a benefit of.a.psoba further provides that the bja is authorized to establish such rules,regulations,and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute and that those rules,regulations,and procedures will be determinative of conflict of laws issues arising under the statute.id.
pursuant to that statutory authority,the bja has promulgated regulations implementing the statute.the procedural regulations set up a mechanism for claimants to submit claims to the bja and provide that claimants are entitled to representation in prosecuting their claims.a the regulations prescribe a process for adjudicating claims.first,following the claimant submission of a claim and any evidence pertinent to the claim,the bja makes a finding as to the proper disposition of the claim.id.if the finding is one of ineligibility,the bja is required to make findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the decision.id.
after notice of the bja finding of ineligibility,the claimant is entitled to ask the bja for reconsideration.as part of the reconsideration proceeding,the claimant is entitled to a hearing before a hearing officer at which the claimant may introduce evidence.although the hearing is not governed by formal rules of procedure,the hearing officer is required to conduct the hearing in such manner as to best ascertain the rights of the claimant and is required to receive such relevant evidence as may be introduced by the claimant and shall,in addition,receive such other evidence as the hearing officer may determine to be necessary or useful in evaluating the claim.the hearing is required to be recorded and a transcript prepared.id.c.following the hearing,the hearing officer is required to make a determination of eligibility,setting forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the hearing officer determination.id.g.
following that determination,the claimant may request that the director of the bja review the record and the hearing officer determination the director may also conduct such a review on his or her own motion.at that point,the claimant may comment on the record and offer new evidence or argument.the director is then required to make a final determination of eligibility,setting forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the director determination.h,i.
as noted,the agency final decision is subject to judicial review in the court of federal claims and then in this court.the courts review of the bja denial of a claim for death benefits is limited to three inquiries whether there has been substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved and whether substantial evidence supports the decision denying the claim.united states,chacon,at.in the present cases,our review focuses on the first the bja complied with the statutory requirements and the governing regulations in denying the claims.in particular,we must assess whether the bja acted lawfully when it determined that neither groff nor labare was a public safety officer within the meaning of psoba and therefore that the claimants were not entitled to the statutory benefits.
the government asserts that we are obligated to apply the standard of deference articulated in chevron to the bja determination that a privately employed pilot under contract to render fire suppression assistance to a public agency is not a public safety officer within the meaning of psoba.
the chevron doctrine of judicial deference to an administrative agency interpretation of a statute is based on the observation that the power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.chevron,at,quoting morton ruiz,d.as the supreme court stated recently,when an agency fills such a gap reasonably,and in accordance with other applicable,procedural requirements,the courts accept the result as legally binding.long island care at home,coke,d.in united states mead,the supreme court explained that 
administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.
d.the core issue in deciding whether chevron deference is warranted is whether congress meant to delegate to the agency the authority to make determinations having the force of law.cathedral candle int l trade comm n,see also long island care at home.at mead,at.christensen harris county,d.in mead,the court explained that its cases had recognized that a very good indicator of congressional intent to delegate lawmaking authority and trigger chevron deference could be found in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.at.
in psoba,congress expressly authorized the bja to determine,under regulations issued pursuant to the act,that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,a,and to establish such rules,regulations,and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the act,id.a.we have previously concluded that congress grant of that authority to the bja reflects congress expectation that the bja would be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law,mead,at,and that the bja interpretations of the statutory terms accordingly should receive chevron deference,at chacon,at.
the claimants attempt to distinguish on the grounds that the dispute in that case turned on the interpretation of a regulation promulgated through traditional rulemaking,and that the claimant did not challenge the applicability of chevron.they distinguish chacon on the ground that it was decided before the supreme court interpreted chevron restrictively in mead and christensen.those distinctions are unavailing.and chacon are consistent with the principles of mead and christensen.while christensen held that the procedural safeguards of rulemaking are sufficient to establish that chevron deference is appropriate,the supreme court in later cases has made clear that chevron deference is not limited to formally promulgated regulations.see barnhart walton,d mead,at.moreover,the bja interpretation of psoba that was at issue in bja ruling that the statute definition of firefighter did not include a apprentice firefighter who was prohibited from actively engaging in the suppression of announced for the first time not through rulemaking but in the adjudication of claim.in this case,we make explicit what was implicit in our prior decisions in chacon and that congress intended for the bja statutory interpretations announced through adjudication to have the force of law,and that those interpretations are therefore entitled to deference under chevron 
our conclusion in this regard is consistent with the analysis in pesquera mares australes ltda.united states,a case in which we held that chevron deference is due to the department of commerce interpretation of ambiguous statutory terms articulated in the course of administrative antidumping determinations.in pesquera,we held that an administrative antidumping proceeding is the kind of relatively formal administrative procedure that the supreme court in mead characterized as qualifying for chevron deference.at.in particular,the pesquera court noted that commerce antidumping proceedings were relatively formal,that congress delegated authority to commerce to review and determine the amount of any antidumping duty,that the proceeding before commerce was subject to judicial review based on the administrative record,and tha
