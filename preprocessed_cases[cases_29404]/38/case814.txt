stephanie garcia appeals from the district court order affirming the commissioner of social security the commissioner denial of benefits on the basis that she was not intellectually disabled.garcia argues that the administrative law judge alj who determined that she was not disabled had a duty to develop the record because that record did not include a complete set of valid iq scores.we agree that the alj had a duty to order further iq testing,and we further conclude that the alj failure to do so was an error that can not be considered harmless.we therefore reverse the district court and remand for further proceedings.
as a minor,stephanie garcia received social security benefits because of her intellectual disability.after she reached the age of in,the social security administration ssa or the administration concluded that she no longer qualified as disabled and was therefore not entitled to further benefits.garcia sought review by an alj,before whom she had a hearing on april.at the time of her hearing,garcia lived with her mother and two siblings,as well as her own disabled daughter.although she had learned some skills for caring for herself through an independent living program,garcia was dependent on her mother for her own care and for the care of her child.after taking special education classes,garcia earned a high school diploma,but she was unable to read and did not know the alphabet.
garcia worked at a pizza shop for several months in.she testified to having had difficulty with making pizzas,taking orders,and cashiering as a result,she required constant supervision.she quit because she found the work too hard.garcia was then placed in a clerical job by the california department of rehabilitation her duties included photocopying,alphabetizing files,and removing staples from documents.she worked four or five hours per day,five days per week.she testified at her hearing that she had difficulty understanding how to perform the tasks assigned to her and had to rely on a coworker for help.garcia also quit this job after two months because i t was too hard.vicky medina,garcia counselor at the central valley regional center,testified that,based on her observations,garcia would be unable to do any job eight hours a day,five days a week as it would be performed in the national economy without extra supervision.medina explained that garcia has difficulty remembering how to perform tasks,and that she needs to be on a constant basis.
apart from her intellectual disability,garcia has suffered from depression stemming from having to care for her young daughter,who has down syndrome,asthma,and heart and thyroid problems.garcia has been treated for her depression,and her psychiatric condition has improved.
in evaluating garcia disability claim,the alj considered the reports of three experts psychologist mary mcdonald,psychologist allen middleton,and physician evangeline murillo,
on february,mcdonald evaluated garcia at the request of the california department of social services.mcdonald administered the bender visual motor gestalt test,ii edition the wechsler memory scale,iii edition and the wechsler adult intelligence scale,iii edition waisiii.the wais iii measures an individual intelligence quotient,or iq iq is reported as three scores verbal,performance,and full scale.see,subpt.p,app,listing listing d.garcia scores on the motor gestalt test were average to low average,and her memory scale scores indicated that her v erbal memory is impaired and visual memory is within the low average range.
mcdonald administered only the performance portion of the wais iii d ue to the constraints of time and the slowness with which garcia worked.consequently,mcdonald did not report a verbal or score.garcia performance iq score was,which is in the borderline range for disability.mcdonald concluded that garcia was capable of employment.
after reviewing garcia medical records,including the incomplete iq test results,middleton completed a mental residual functional capacity assessment psychiatric review technique and case analysis he determined that garcia was moderately limited in her ability to understand,remember,and carry out detailed instructions.he concluded that garcia was able to understand and remember work locations and procedures of a simple,routine nature involving step job tasks and instructions.
murillo also reviewed garcia medical records,including the incomplete iq results,and completed a mental residual functioning capacity assessment and case analysis like middleton,murillo concluded that garcia was moderately limited in her ability to understand,remember,and carry out detailed instructions.she determined that garcia could understand and remember work locations and procedures of a simple,routine nature involving step job tasks and instructions and maintain concentration and attention for above in hour increments during hr work schedules.
at the hearing,the alj also heard testimony from vocational expert thomas dachelet.dachelet testified that the ability to read and write at a basic level is a requirement for even those jobs classified by the dictionary of occupational titles dot as needing the lowest general educational development.however,he also acknowledged that garcia had worked at light unskilled jobs at which she did read or write.dachelet testified that in california there were persons employed at the light unskilled level.he identified three light unskilled jobs garcia could perform a bagger,of which were employed in california,a garment sorter,of which were employed in california,and a grader of which were employed in california.
in a may,decision,the alj concluded that garcia was not disabled as of february,consistent with the ssa original determination.the alj determined that garcia had the severe impairment of borderline intellectual functioning but that the impairment was not so severe that it met the requirements for intellectual disability see,subpt.p,app,listing listing.
listing lays out four ways in which an individual may qualify as intellectually disabled without requiring any further inquiry into her ability to work m ental incapacity such that the use of standardized measures of intellectual functioning is precluded a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of or less a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of through and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function and a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of through,resulting in at least two milder impairments.id.each of these alternatives depends on a subject iq test performance,unless she is unable to undergo testing.
based on garcia performance iq score of,the alj concluded that garcia could not meet listing.the alj further concluded that garcia had the rfc to perform a full range of work at all exertional levels but with the following nonexertional limitations garcia can perform simple repetitive tasks where the jobs can be learned mostly by demonstration,but she can not perform reading writing as a job task.based primarily on dachelet testimony,the alj concluded that garcia was capable of making a successful adjustment to other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy,including the jobs of bagger,garment sorter,and grader.for this reason,the alj concluded that garcia was not disabled.
garcia appealed the alj decision to the social security administration appeals council,but her appeal was denied,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.garcia then sought judicial review of the commissioner decision in the district court,arguing in part that the alj erred when she failed to develop the record by ordering a new iq test administration to obtain a complete set of test scores.the district court affirmed the final decision of the commissioner.
we review de novo a district court judgment affirming the denial of social security benefits.bray comm r of soc.sec,cir.we may set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.robbins,at.
it was legal error for the alj not to ensure that the record included a complete set of iq test results that both the alj and the reviewing experts could consider.while it is not certain from the record before us that garcia would have been determined to be disabled if the record had been properly developed,it is also not clear from the record that the alj error was inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.tommasetti astrue,cir quoting robbins soc.sec,cir.therefore we reverse the district court and remand with instructions to reverse the final decision of the commissioner and to order the commissioner to develop the record through further iq testing.
to be eligible for disability benefits,an individual must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.
the evaluation of disability in adults is governed by a process,which the alj followed in assessing garcia.the alj skipped the first and fourth steps,as they were not applicable to garcia situation at the second step,the alj determines whether a claimant has an impairment or combination of impairments that is medically severe if not,the claimant is not disabled.id.a ii,c.the alj concluded that garcia had the severe impairment of borderline intellectual functioning,and so proceeded to the third step.
at the third step,the alj again considers the severity of the impairment or combination of impairments by comparing it to the listings in,subpart p,appendix.id.a iii,d.if the impairment or combination of impairments is at least as severe as the relevant listing,and has lasted at least twelve months,then the claimant is deemed disabled,and the inquiry ends otherwise,the alj proceeds to the next step.id.the alj concluded that garcia did not meet listing and so proceeded to step five.at the fifth step,the alj considers the claimant rfc that is,her ability to work in spite of her limitations along with her age,education,and work experience,to determine whether she can make an adjustment to a new kind of work.id.a v.the alj concluded that garcia could perform jobs requiring the ability to undertake simple,repetitive tasks,and so found that she was not disabled.
garcia argues that the alj erred by failing to order additional iq testing and instead relying on the results of the partial examination performed by mcdonald.we agree.the alj always has a special duty to fully and fairly develop the record and to assure that the claimant interests are considered.celaya halter,cir quoting brown heckler,cir.
the alj is not a mere umpire at such a proceeding it is incumbent upon the alj to scrupulously and conscientiously probe into,inquire of,and explore for all the relevant facts.he must be especially diligent in ensuring that favorable as well as unfavorable facts and circumstances are elicited.
id.quoting higbee sullivan,cir.
in a case,such as this one,that turns on whether a claimant has an intellectual disability and in which iq scores are relied upon for the purpose of assessing that disability,there is no question that a fully and fairly develop ed record,will include a complete set of iq scores that report verbal,and abilities.there are two principal reasons for our conclusion.
first,iq testing plays a particularly important role in assessing the existence of intellectual disability.listing generally lays out the necessary procedures for evaluating mental disorders,including intellectual disability,and for documenting relevant objective findings.in that listing the ssa has recognized that s tandardized intelligence test results are essential to the adjudication of all cases of intellectual disability,except where a claimant is unable to complete such testing.listing d b.at the third step of the ssa process,when a claimant impairment is compared to the criteria in listing,three of the four criteria for intellectual disability rely in whole or in part on iq test scores.the fourth criterion applies when the claimant incapacity precludes iq testing.because meeting the relevant listing conclusively determines that a claimant is indeed disabled,a iii,the claimant iq score can be the deciding factor in a determination of intellectual disability.
further,as was the case with garcia,iq test results can play a role in the development of other evidence in the record.for example,middleton and murillo both reviewed garcia iq results before making their determinations about her ability to work.thus,as a practical matter,the importance of iq scores in this case did not end with step three.the partial test results also affected the alj conclusions about garcia ability to work,even if less directly.
the second reason for our conclusion is that the regulations promulgated by the ssa demonstrate that the administration,based on its considerable expertise,has determined that it is essential for complete rather than partial sets of iq scores to be used in evaluating intellectual disability.as a general principle,all reports of test results must conform to accepted professional standards and practices in the medical field for a complete and competent examination,n b,and an examination is not complete unless it includes all the elements of a standard examination in the applicable medical specialty,id.n c.
the regulations specifically identify the wechsler series of iq tests of which wais iii is a part as customarily including verbal,performance,and full scale iqs.listing d c.this characteristic of the wechsler exam makes it particularly well suited to the assessment of intellectual disability,because g enerally,it is preferable to use iq measures that are wide in scope and include items that test both verbal and performance abilities.listing d d.
the commissioner argues that the regulations themselves suggest it is acceptable for an alj to rely on partial test results in a situation,such as this one,in which only part of an iq test was administered.the commissioner points specifically to a passage in listing providing that i n cases where more than one iq is customarily derived from the test administered,where verbal,performance,and full scale iqs are provided in the wechsler series,we use the lowest of these in conjunction with listing.id.at d c 
however,our reading of this same passage leads us to conclude the opposite listing strongly disfavors reliance on partial test results.the plain text of the regulation clearly suggests that iq tests like those in the wechsler series should be administered and reported in full,because it assumes that the alj will have multiple scores verbal,performance,and full scale from which to use the lowest.we also note that the regulations insistence that the alj look at all three scores in order to identify the lowest among them seems intended to benefit the disability claimant,for whom each test score is an opportunity to demonstrate that she meets one of the criteria specified in listing as well as an opportunity to demonstrate the extent of her impairment to other experts reviewing her iq as part of their own evaluations of her limitations.
because the regulations clearly assert the importance of a complete iq test administration,the alj had a duty to develop the record so that it included a complete set of iq test results.her failure to do so was legal error 
our conclusion that the alj committed legal error is not the end of our inquiry.we will not reverse an alj decision on the basis of a harmless error,which exists when it is clear from the record that the alj error was inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.tommasetti,at quoting robbins,at.while the record here may not definitively demonstrate that garcia would have been adjudicated disabled if the alj had ordered that a complete set of iq tests be administered,it is certainly not clear from the record that garcia was not harmed by the alj error 
again,we recognize that the importance of iq test results in adjudicating intellectual disability is not limited to the claimant ability to meet the listing at step three of the process.both middleton and murillo considered garcia incomplete iq test results in assessing her ability to support herself through gainful employment,and the alj relied on these experts findings in assessing garcia rfc and ultimately in determining that she was not disabled.the commissioner points out that neither middleton nor murillo expressed any concerns about the adequacy of mcdonald psychological testing,but that does not necessarily mean that neither would have reached a different conclusion or offered other findings beneficial to garcia based on a complete set of scores.such an outcome seems particularly plausible where,as here,garcia testing history as a juvenile strongly suggests that her verbal and iq scores would be considerably lower than the performance score of obtained by mcdonald.in a december test administration,garcia was assessed with a verbal score of,a performance score of,and a score of.in june,she received a score of and a verbal score of.further,the testimony of garcia counselor vicky medina also suggests that verbal functioning was a particular weakness for garcia.
in this case,there is a genuine probability that,had a complete set of valid iq test scores been included in the record,the opinions of the reviewing experts might have been different,or garcia might have had an additional factual basis for challenging their opinions.this is especially true when,just three years earlier,garcia test score was dramatically below the threshold for establishing disability even on the basis of just the score by itself.see listing b providing that intellectual disability may be established by a valid verbal,performance,or iq of or less.the fact that iq test results may be considered by multiple reviewing experts,as well as by the alj,makes it particularly difficult to conclude that any error affecting the quality of those results is inconsequential to an ultimate nondisability determination,let alone to conclude that such harmlessness is clear from the record.tommasetti,at.
perhaps even more significantly,garcia may have been able to meet listing b under which she would have been adjudicated disabled if she had scored below on either the verbal,performance,or portion of an iq test.given that garcia had previously received a childhood wechsler score of and a verbal score of,and that she tended to score lower on the verbal component than on the performance component,it appears likely that garcia could have met listing b at step three of the evaluation process.based on that evidence alone,it can not be clear from the record that failure to obtain those two tests was inconsequential.tommasetti,at.
the alj failure to develop the record to include a complete set of iq scores was legal error.because we can not conclude that the error was harmless,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to the commissioner for further proceedings.
the panel majority,eager to reprimand the commissioner of social security for what it deems to be inexcusably sloppy practices,disregards i suggest,respectfully the deference we owe under law to the agency determinations.rather than observing the standard for harmless error that our precedents have previously prescribed,the majority has erroneously presumed that the commissioner ostensible error has prejudiced stephanie garcia,the claimant in this case.i respectfully dissent from this regrettable exaggeration of our court properly limited role in the adjudication of social security disability benefits claims.
congress has carefully prescribed a minimal role for the federal courts in adjudicating claims of disability under the social security act.see g.accordingly,we have only limited authority to nullify the decisions of the agency and its administrative law judges with which we disagree.as the majority opinion correctly notes,we may not disturb an alj denial of benefits unless it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.robbins soc.sec,cir.legal error alone,furthermore,is not sufficient to warrant our interference for example,we generally must stay our hand if it is clear from the record that any ostensible error was inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination.tommasetti astrue,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
indeed,one such error that we have identified in past cases has been an alj failure fully and fairly to develop the record and to assure that the claimant interests are considered.celaya halter,cir.this special and independent duty of the alj exists in all circumstances,although,when the applicant is uncounseled,the responsibility to ensure an adequate record is heightened.see tonapetyan halter,cir smolen chater,cir.despite our solicitude in this regard,we have nevertheless clearly limned the outer boundaries of such responsibility.an alj duty to develop the record further is triggered only when there is ambiguous evidence or when the record is inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.mayes massanari,cir emphasis added.
more recently,we have refined in the context of the alj duty to develop the record the standard by which we appraise whether any such error prejudiced the claimant.in mcleod astrue,the unsuccessful applicant for disability benefits contended that the alj erred by failing to develop the record adequately,specifically by not request ing more explanation from two of his treating physicians and by not obtaining whatever va disability rating he may have had,cir.we determined that the alj had shirked this duty to develop the record,but nevertheless that this dereliction was not alone sufficient warrant for reversal.rather,we explained that the burden is on the party attacking the agency determination to show that prejudice resulted from the error.id.at.but where the circumstances of the case show a substantial likelihood of prejudice,the reviewing court can remand the case so the agency may reconsider the claimant eligibility for benefits.id.at.we emphasized,nevertheless,that a mere probability of prejudice is not enough.id.either the claimant must himself shoulder the burden of demonstrating prejudice,or otherwise such prejudice must be apparent on the face of the record or the circumstances of the case.
the majority opinion turns this doctrine on its head.even assuming,arguendo,that the alj committed legal error by not ordering mcdonald to perform another round of iq tests on miss garcia the majority misstates and misapplies the proper standard for assessing any prejudice such error caused.
in the first place,the majority correctly acknowledges that w e will not reverse an alj decision on the basis of a harmless error,which occurs when it is clear from the record that the alj error was inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination,op.at internal quotation marks omitted.although the majority does not expressly state that such rule is the exclusive standard by which to assess the harm caused by an error,its reasoning assumes so.for the majority detects prejudice in a genuine probability that a complete set of iq test scores may have altered the medical reports or provided another basis for miss garcia to challenge the alj determination.id.at.mcleod,however,specifically forecloses this basis for reversing a denial of benefits a mere probability,no matter how genuine,simply does not suffice.at.the majority articulates an exclusive standard for harmless error that presumes prejudice unless such error appear inconsequential on the face of the record.such may be the ordinary analysis for determining the prejudice caused by legal error.in the special context of the alj duty to develop the record,however,our court has already clearly explained that we can not find prejudice unless and until demonstrated by the claimant or the record and circumstances of the case.
furthermore,the majority offers no basis,either in law or in fact,for simply asserting that the absence of a full set of iq test scores would have had any likely effect on the alj disability determination.the majority first observes that b oth middleton and murillo considered garcia incomplete iq test results in assessing her ability to suppo
