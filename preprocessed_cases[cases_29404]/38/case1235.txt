marva sneed pursued her claim for survivor benefits in the department of veterans affairs va for eight years.after receiving an adverse decision from the board of veterans appeals board,sneed promptly contacted an attorney to represent her in an appeal to the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court.only one day before the deadline to file a notice of appeal,however,sneed received a letter saying the attorney would not represent her in the appeal.after unsuccessfully searching for another attorney,sneed filed a notice of appeal pro se,days after the filing deadline.
the veterans court dismissed sneed appeal for failure to timely file her notice of appeal.sneed appeals the dismissal,arguing the veterans court legally erred in holding that equitable tolling does not apply in cases of attorney abandonment.because attorney abandonment can justify equitably tolling the deadline for filing an appeal to the veterans court,this court vacates and remands for the veterans court to reconsider sneed argument under the correct standard.
background 
sneed is the surviving spouse of veteran reginald sneed,who served on active duty from june to june.sneed suffered from numerous serviceconnected disabilities,including stress syndrome,syndrome,cervical spondylosis degeneration of the vertebrae,spinal stenosis narrowing of the spinal column,tinnitus ringing in the ears,a perforated tympanic membrane,and scarring of the upper extremities.in january,sneed fell and suffered a spinal cord contusion,rendering him a quadriplegic and resulting in confinement to a wheelchair in october,sneed was living in a nursing home for paralyzed veterans.there was a fire in the home,and all of the residents,including sneed,died as a result of smoke inhalation.
following sneed death,sneed filed a claim with the va for dependency and indemnity compensation.see deaths entitling survivors to dependency and indemnity compensation.she alleged her husband death was service connected,because his disabilities were a principal or contributory cause of his death.see.in particular,she argued his spinal disabilities substantially contributed to his paralysis,which made him unable to escape from the burning building.sneed also contended that her husband other disabilities,including stress syndrome and tinnitus,contributed to his death by preventing him from hearing and properly responding to indications of fire.the va denied sneed claim,and the board ultimately affirmed the denial on april.
sneed notice of appeal to the veterans court was due by august.see a a person adversely affected by a board decision shall file a notice of appeal with the veterans court within days after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed.sneed promptly sought an attorney to represent her in the appeal.she contacted katrina eagle,and transmitted her case materials to eagle office.sneed communicated with eagle office for a year or longer and stated that eagle knew that there was a deadline to file the notice of appeal.however,on august,the day before sneed deadline to appeal sneed received a letter from eagle stating that she would not represent sneed in her appeal.eagle explained that she did not believe the va erred in denying sneed claim,and instructed sneed to seek another attorney opinion or to file the notice of appeal herself.eagle also incorrectly advised sneed that the deadline to appeal was august,two days later than the actual august deadline.
sneed then tried to find another attorney in the short time available.when that failed,she filed the notice of appeal on september,days after the deadline six days later,on september,sneed filed a letter with the veterans court explaining her late filing 
i thought i had an attorney,this attorney was sent all of my papers about this appeal in a timely manner,in fact i contact ed the attorney office as soon as i got my decision letter.i even ke pt in contact with the attorney office.
she further stated that she ha d worked on this case for over eight years,and all papers were filed on time,and that she did not think the late filing to the veterans court was her fault.
not long after her appeal was docketed,sneed was able to retain an attorney,who entered his appearance on september.on october,the veterans court stayed several appeals,including sneed,pending the court decision in a separate case regarding whether equitable tolling applied to the day filing deadline in a.the deadline was found subject to equitable tolling in bove shinseki,and on june,the veterans court directed sneed to file a response discussing whether her case warranted equitable tolling of the day filing period.
sneed argued,through counsel,that her reliance on attorney katrina eagle to file her appeal with the court was perfectly reasonable,and that eagle conduct amounted to extraordinary circumstances beyond sneed control.appellant resp.to.order,sneed shinseki.quoting bove.at.sneed asked the court to allow equitable tolling in her case.
the veterans court declined to apply equitable tolling and dismissed sneed appeal.the court held that sneed circumstances did not fit within the parameters of equitable tolling,which 
applied only when circumstances precluded a timely filing despite the exercise of due diligence,such as a mental illness rendering one incapable of handling one own affairs or other extraordinary circumstances beyond one control,reliance on the incorrect statement of a va official,or a misfiling at the regional office or the board.

after the dismissal,sneed counsel withdrew,and sneed filed a pro se motion for reconsideration,which the veterans court denied.sneed,with new counsel,timely appealed to this court.

the secretary argues that sneed is actually challenging the veterans court factual findings,which this court lacks jurisdiction to review.according to the secretary,the veterans court found that sneed did not exercise due diligence,thus precluding equitable tolling under any standard.however,the veterans court factual findings are unclear.on one hand,the court stated that sneed late filing evidence d general negligence or procrastination,but later said that despite her exercise of due diligence,sneed failed to demonstrate that circumstances prevented her from timely filing.veterans court decision at.during oral argument,the secretary seemed to concede that the veterans court made no explicit finding with respect to diligence.oral arg.at,sneed shinseki,available at http.answering that there was no express finding of diligence based on what sneed had done day by day.

the issue in this case is whether the veterans court applied an improperly narrow standard in rejecting sneed equitable tolling argument.the veterans court began its equitable tolling analysis by reciting bove equitable tolling standard whether circumstances precluded a timely filing despite the exercise of due diligence.veterans court decision at quoting bove.at.it recounted three instances in which this court has applied equitable tolling a mental illness rendering one incapable of handling one own affairs or other extraordinary circumstances beyond one control,reliance on the incorrect statement of a va official,or a misfiling at the regional office or the board.veterans court decision at quoting bove.at.the veterans court denied equitable tolling,stating that the circumstances preceding sneed late filing are not extraordinary,but rather evidence general negligence or procrastination.veterans court decision at.however,the veterans court did not consider whether eagle abrupt withdrawal only one day before the filing deadline constituted extraordinary circumstances.rather,it summarily concluded that attorney eagle is not a va official id.at citing bailey west,holding a veteran reliance on the incorrect statement of a va official could justify equitable tolling.
in so reasoning,the veterans court improperly treated the listed examples including reliance on the incorrect statement of a va official as the exclusive parameters of equitable tolling.id.at.equitable tolling is not limited to a small and closed set of factual patterns.mapu nicholson.this court has rejected the approach of looking to whether a particular case falls within the facts specifically identified in irwin or one of our prior cases.id.rather,courts acting in equity have emphasized the need for flexibility and for avoiding mechanical rules,and have proceeded on a basis.holland florida,internal quotation marks and citation omitted.the veterans court analysis focused too narrowly on whether sneed case fell into one of the factual patterns of past cases considering a,and improperly failed to consider whether attorney misconduct as opposed to misconduct by a va official may constitute a basis for equitable tolling 
the supreme court has held that attorney abandonment may constitute a basis for equitable tolling.u nprofessional attorney conduct may,in certain circumstances,prove egregious and can be extraordinary,thus forming a basis for equitable tolling.holland.at citations omitted.in contrast,a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline does not warrant equitable tolling.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.the court later emphasized the difference between mere attorney negligence and attorney abandonment.maples thomas.in the latter,a counsel failure to communicate with petitioner or to respond to the client many inquiries and requests over a period of several years may amount to extraordinary circumstances beyond the client control.id.at internal quotation marks and citation omitted.this differs from the rule applicable to mere attorney negligence which is attributable to the client pursuant to general agency principles because c ommon sense dictates that a litigant can not be held constructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent in any meaningful sense of that word.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
according to the secretary,the veterans court decision did not foreclose attorney abandonment as a basis for equitable tolling,but rather applied the broad standard articulated in bove that equitable tolling is appropriate when circumstances precluded a timely filing despite the exercise of due diligence.veterans court decision at quoting bove.at.the veterans court analysis,which dismissed the significance of eagle conduct because she was not a va official,belies this contention.additionally,other veterans court cases appear to foreclose attorney abandonment as a basis for equitable tolling.for instance,the veterans court addressed attorney abandonment in metras shinseki.vet.claims lexis.june,unpublished.in metras,the veterans court held holland and maples were distinguishable in part because,unlike in maples and holland both habeas corpus cases,neither metras liberty nor his person is at risk.metras.vet.claims lexis,at.this reasoning suggests that attorney abandonment could never justify equitable tolling in veterans benefits cases,where the litigant liberty and person are not at risk 
contrary to this reasoning,the equitable principles invoked in holland and maples apply just as strongly in veterans cases as they do in the habeas corpus context.although benefits cases may not threaten veterans liberty or persons,veterans risked both life and liberty in their military service to this country.the veterans benefits scheme is thus imbued with special beneficence from a grateful sovereign.bailey,at michel,j,concurring.in holding equitable tolling applied to a,the bailey court reasoned that the supreme court had extended a form of equitable tolling to prisoners filing for habeas corpus relief,and this court was loath to treat less worthily those who have served the country.id.at citing houston lack.the special treatment congress reserved for veterans requires that courts lend veterans at least the same degree of solicitude as that bestowed on habeas petitioners.see henderson.at quoting united states oregon,noting congress long standing solicitude for veterans.the supreme court held in maples and holland that habeas petitioners may benefit from equitable tolling in cases of attorney abandonment,and this court concludes that the same protection extends to veterans.
the secretary nevertheless argues that attorney abandonment can not justify equitable tolling in the civil context because litigants in such cases do not enjoy the constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel.appellee br.citing pitts shinseki,holding the right to the effective assistance of counsel does not apply to proceedings before the veterans court.however,a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is itself a civil action,woodford ngo,to which the sixth amendment right to counsel does not apply,const.amend.ensuring the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions see also coleman thompson,there is no constitutional right to an attorney in state proceedings.furthermore,the supreme court did not base its decisions in maples and holland on the right to effective assistance of counsel,but rather on equitable principles in general.see holland.at w e have followed a tradition in which courts of equity have sought to relieve hardships which,from time to time,arise from a hard and fast adherence to more absolute legal rules.internal quotation marks and citation omitted maples.at.
holland and maples averted hardships caused by a hard and fast adherence to general agency principles by holding that a client can not be charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who has abandoned him.maples.at see also holland.at alito,concurring.the hardship of default resulting from attorney abandonment is particularly difficult to bear in the context of an appeal to the veterans court,which is often the veteran first opportunity to be represented by an attorney.see c.accordingly,pursuant to the principles of maples and holland,attorney abandonment may justify equitably tolling the filing deadline in appeals to the veterans court.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the veterans court decision dismissing sneed appeal is vacated,and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
vacated and remanded.
the majority pronouncements on attorney abandonment are pure dicta this appeal is plainly beyond our jurisdiction.i therefore respectfully dissent.
this case is not factually complex.sneed contacted an attorney,katrina eagle,with the intent of retaining her in her appeal to the veterans court.after she contacted eagle office several times,sneed received a formal letter from eagle on august,informing her that eagle could not represent her because her benefits claim was meritless.in the letter,eagle erroneously informed sneed that her notice of appeal noa was due august,instead of august.after receiving eagle letter,sneed did not file her noa by august.nor did she file it by the day eagle told her it was due,august.instead,sneed waited thirty days after receiving eagle letter to finally fax her handwritten noa to the veterans court.thus,sneed noa was filed days late.
the veterans court rejected sneed request to excuse her untimely noa.it found that sneed knew that she did not need an attorney to proceed before the court,and regardless of whether attorney eagle misinformed sneed of the noa due date by two days,sneed filed her noa days after it had been due.those facts,the veterans court concluded,demonstrated that the circumstances leading up to sneed late noa are not extraordinary,but rather evidence general negligence or procrastination.id.
the majority insists,however,that the veterans court committed legal error by not recognizing that attorney abandonment can be a ground for equitable tolling of an noa deadline.but we have jurisdiction when an appellant urges alteration of the standard for equitable tolling only when the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of the equitable tolling claim.mapu nicholson,emphasis added.the attorney abandonment doctrine does not dictate the outcome of the equitable tolling claim here.it was irrelevant to the veterans court disposition of this case and should be to ours 
sneed argued to the veterans court that eagle actions excused two days of the delay in the filing of her noa.the veterans court recognized that equitable tolling was improper here because sneed provided no explanation for the other days of the delay.indeed,diligence or excuse is required for the entire period of delay to justify equitable tolling explaining just two days of a delay in filing an noa is insufficient as a matter of law.see holland florida,see also phillips principi,app x,collecting cases and explaining why a temporary external impediment lasting for a time shorter than the requested tolling period can not justify equitable tolling.and diligence required for equitable tolling is reasonable diligence in the pursuit of an appeal not diligence in pursuit of a new lawyer once abandoned by another.see holland.at see also maples thomas.the veterans court recognized that fact and denied sneed request for equitable tolling because she had no justification for the entire period of delay in the filing of her noa 
even if we were to improperly review the factual findings here,it should be quite clear that eagle actions could not justify tolling sneed noa deadline for days.there is no reason apparent in the record or presented by sneed to explain why she could not have faxed her handwritten noa to the veterans court in any of the thirty days following the receipt of eagle letter.sneed had access to a fax machine during that time,see she knew the veterans court fax number and the noa deadline from the board decision,she was informed by eagle that the noa deadline was no later than august,she was told in writing by eagle that she could file her appeal herself,and the board decision informed her of additional resources she could consult to help in prosecuting her appeal on her own,resources that she apparently waited thirty days to use and eventually lead her to file her noa pro se.
thus,it is quite apparent that,as the veterans court found,the untimeliness of sneed noa was due to her general negligence or procrastination nothing more.sneed had argued to the veterans court that,under the standard enunciated in bove,the circumstances of this case do not indicate general negligence or procrastination.quoting bove.the veterans court simply disagreed with sneed on how to apply the facts to the law she advanced in her briefing a decision over which we have no jurisdiction.d 
nevertheless,the majority insists on interpreting the veterans court opinion in a way that allows it to correct what they see as a persistent yet unspoken policy of the veterans court to not recognize attorney misconduct as a basis for equitable tolling.again,the majority overlooks the facts.
sneed has conceded that the veterans court has at least acknowledge d the possibility that attorney abandonment may be a ground for tolling the deadline to appeal to the veterans court.appellant rule j letter,ecf.and the veterans court has long recognized that egregious attorney misconduct including abandonment can justify equitable tolling of the noa deadline and has applied that principle to equitably toll an noa deadline for a veteran who was effectively abandoned by his counsel.see nelson nicholson,aff,metras shinseki,wl.june,denying equitable tolling after holding that the attorney abandonment standard from maples and holland did not apply to the facts of the case johnson shinseki,unpublished appellee rule j letter attachment,ecf finding attorney abandonment to be egregious misconduct justifying equitable tolling.remarkably,that egregious misconduct standard is the same one recognized by the supreme court in holland and adopted by the majority here.see majority op.at holland.at explaining that equitable tolling may be justified by unprofessional attorney conduct that prov
