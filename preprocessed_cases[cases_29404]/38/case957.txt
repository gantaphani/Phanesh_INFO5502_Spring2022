khamphouck somsamouth and kaykeo somsamouth,husband and wife,appeal their convictions for making false representations of material facts to the social security administration ssa for the purpose of retaining supplemental security income benefits.see a.primarily,they disagree with the conception that their statements about working were,indeed,materially false.somsamouth also claims that she was improperly sentenced.we affirm.
background 
for many years before this proceeding commenced,the somsamouths collected ssi benefits on the theory that they were disabled to the point that they were unable to engage in substantial gainful activity.however,the ssa became suspicious in april of when it received an anonymous letter that accused the somsamouths of fraud because,while receiving ssi benefits,they were working.
prompted by that letter,ann shepard,a claims representative for the ssa,arranged to interview the somsamouths.at shepard request,the couple provided their own interpreter their daughter to translate between english and lao.at the interview,shepard asked the somsamouths questions about any income they had received,employment or work they had done,and resources available to them.the couple stated that they were not doing any work at that time.shepard remained suspicious and,therefore,referred the matter to the ssa office of the inspector general for investigation.
agent scott antolik was assigned to the case and conducted surveillance on the somsamouths,which revealed that they were engaged in a multitude of activities that had all of the earmarks of working.antolik observed the couple bringing food containers out of their garage and loading them onto a truck owned by somsamouth.during his four surveillances of them,antolik saw numerous instances of that activity.he also observed somsamouth drive the loaded truck with his wife as a passenger to a local asian food market.at that market,he saw the couple take the containers from the truck into the market,and return with what looked like food items,which were,in turn,loaded onto the truck.after the somsamouths left the market,antolik followed them to the lao community plaza,where they again unloaded and loaded various containers.antolik then asked shepard to arrange for a second interview with the somsamouths,which was to be videotaped.she did and it was.
at the second interview,the somsamouths brought their as an interpreter.shepard asked them many of the same questions she had asked at the first interview.the somsamouths gave a recitation of the various disabilities from which they suffered,and indicated their belief that they were not able to work.shepard also asked each of them since you became disabled,have you done any work or volunteer work the answers to all of the questions were recorded on a form by shepard,and the somsamouths signed the form.
after the interview,antolik conducted further surveillance of the somsamouths.he found the couple at the lao community plaza again.this time he noticed somsamouth cooking and working at tables set up behind the building.on another day,antolik actually went into the plaza with another agent and ordered food from somsamouth.antolik observed both of the somsamouths bringing packages back and forth to each other in the kitchen,and then somsamouth brought the finished order out.she also took antolik payment for the meal and brought back his change.soon after that,antolik repeated the surveillance with a hidden camera,and observed similar behavior by the somsamouths.
thereafter,the somsamouths were indicted for making a false statement and for misrepresentation of material facts in violation of a after a jury trial,both of the somsamouths were found guilty of the offenses charged.they were each sentenced to five years of probation and each was ordered to pay restitution.these appeals followed.

discussion 
the somsamouths attack their convictions on two major grounds they claim that the district court erred when it declined to define the word work for the jury they go on to claim that the evidence does not support the verdict.somsamouth also launches the subsidiary argument that evidence of the interview containing the somsamouths lies should not have been admitted because of allegedly unreliable interpretation.in addition,somsamouth complains about the district court determination of loss for sentencing purposes.we will discuss each of these issues in turn.
definition of work 
the somsamouths assert that the simple word work had to be defined for the jury because,they say,without further instruction the jury could misunderstand the legal meaning of the word.we disagree.
we start with the obvious,almost banal,proposition that the district court can not be expected to define the common words of everyday life for the jury.were it otherwise,jury instructions would become a dense tangle of definitions that might please a lexicographer or an etymologist,but no one else,and that would,in fact,be disruptive,distracting,disconcerting and dysfunctional.as it is,the district court need not define common terms that are readily understandable to the jury.united states shryock,cir united states hicks,cir.
but,say the somsamouths,the average person might believe that work does not necessarily require substantial gainful activity of the sort that generates wages or other economic benefits.so much is true,and if that is the belief of the average person,it is a correct belief.see,webster third new international dictionary defining work as activity in which one exerts strength or faculties to do or perform sustained physical or mental effort valued as it overcomes obstacles and achieves an objective or result the american heritage dictionary ed defining work as p hysical or mental effort or activity directed toward the production or accomplishment of something.so,for example,people commonly speak about working around the house,although they receive no monetary compensation for that.and one might do work for a charity or a friend,which achieves great objectives,but which generates no income whatsoever for the worker.the latter concept was nicely encompassed in the question to the somsamouths about whether they did volunteer work,to which they,of course,answered no.
nevertheless,argue the somsamouths,for ssi purposes that is not the case.in that they are incorrect,as a review of the regulations will demonstrate.for example,the very regulation that they cite points up the crucial difference when it uses the following words if you are working and the work you are doing is substantial gainful activity,we will find that you are not disabled b.thus,the regulation recognizes the fact that substantial gainful activity is only a subset of work.the regulations thereafter give a more detailed description of the way ssa will evalu
