the railroad retirement board bureau of hearings and appeals upheld the termination of appellant cleto rivera disabled child annuity under the railroad retirement act the act.the railroad retirement board the board dismissed rivera subsequent appeal as untimely.we dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.
the government began providing rivera with a disabled child annuity effective july.the act provides an annuity to a surviving disabled child of a railroad employee covered by the act.d iii.a survivor receives an annuity if he becomes disabled before the age of and is unable to engage in any regular employment.id.at d.rivera,the son of a deceased railroad worker,suffers from multiple medical impairments,including cerebral palsy,which began before he turned years old.
in october,the board bureau of disability and medicare operations director the director informed rivera that,effective january,he no longer was eligible for an annuity because his job with the oxnard school district constituted substantial gainful activity.if the claimant is able to engage in substantial gainful activity,the board will find that the claimant is not disabled for any regular employment under the act.the oxnard school district had hired rivera as a food service worker in.rivera asserts that he was given preferential treatment in the hiring process and is unable to perform many of his job tasks,such as lifting heavy objects and standing for long periods of time.
after the director rejected rivera request for reconsideration,rivera appealed to the board bureau of hearings and appeals.on may,a bureau of hearings and appeals hearings officer the hearings officer held that although oxnard partially subsidized rivera job responsibilities,rivera entitlement to an annuity ended on march.the hearings officer sent copies of her decision and the board appellate procedures to rivera and his attorney,noting that rivera had sixty days from may to file his appeal with the board.
on july,the deadline for filing his appeal,rivera sent the board a letter requesting additional time to file his appeal.rivera claimed that he needed more time because he had problems with his employment,including a sexual harassment claim was unable to concentrate on the appeal process until very recently and lived about thirty miles from his attorney office and was unable to get transportation to her office until july.the board eventually received rivera appeal on july.in his appeal,rivera stated that he intended to file additional evidence with the board concerning t he true percentage of subsidization rivera receives and his actual income.
on october,the secretary to the board sent a letter to rivera,advising him that the board will hold open the appeal for days from the date of this letter for the submission of evidence.in the absence of any such submission,the board will proceed to issue a decision on the record before it.the secretary also quoted d of the board regulations,which relates to the submission of additional evidence,and informed rivera that admission of new evidence on appeal to the board is discretionary with the board,and you should explain why submission of such evidence was not possible at an earlier stage of adjudication.rivera did not supply the board with additional evidence.
on november,the board dismissed rivera appeal as untimely,with one member dissenting.the board noted that its regulations require a claimant filing a late appeal to show that circumstances beyond his control caused the late filing,and concluded that the reasons presented by rivera for late filing do not constitute good cause.see c if in the judgment of the board the reasons given establish that the appellant had good cause for not filing the final appeal form within the time prescribed,the board will consider the appeal to have been filed in a timely manner.id.at d listing circumstances where good cause may exist.the dissent stated 
t he board agreement to hold the record open was an implicit waiver of the late filing.it does not make sense to make an offer to accept additional evidence and then to dismiss the appeal for a procedural deficiency.moreover,the decision of the majority seems particularly unbalanced and unfair,since it refuses to consider the merits of rivera appeal for missing the filing deadline by days in an opinion issued more than months after that filing.
in a december,letter,rivera requested reconsideration of the board decision,stating that his attorney was the cause of his untimely appeal.the board rejected rivera request,and this appeal ensued.
the board argues that we lack jurisdiction to review its november,decision.the supreme court has instructed lower courts to resolve jurisdictional issues before reaching the merits of a case.steel citizens for a better env t,d rejecting the doctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction accord united states sumner,cir.the steel court explained that w ithout jurisdiction the court can not proceed at all in any cause.jurisdiction is power to declare the law,and when it ceases to exist,the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.at.quoting ex parte mccardle,wall.accordingly,we turn to examine whether we have jurisdiction to entertain rivera appeal.
section of the act incorporates the judicial review provisions of the railroad unemployment insurance act,which provides any claimant may,only after all administrative remedies within the board will have been availed of and exhausted,obtain a review of any final decision of the board in the united states court of appeals for the circuit in which the claimant resides f.thus,to qualify for review in this court,rivera must show that the board dismissal of his claim constitutes a final decision of the board.we hold that it does not,because it was not a final decision of the board on the merits of rivera claim.
the board regulations provide for a series of administrative steps a claimant may take to challenge an adverse decision by the director.first,the claimant has sixty days after the date on which notice of the initial decision is mailed to him to request reconsideration.a b.second,if the director affirms his initial decision,then the claimant has sixty days to file an appeal with the bureau of hearings and appeals.id.at a b.finally,a claimant who wishes to challenge an adverse bureau of hearings and appeals decision must file an appeal with the board within days from the date upon which notice of the decision of the hearings officer is mailed to the appellant.id.at b.if the claimant fails to file a timely appeal at any stage of the process,the prior decision becomes final.see id.at b defining final decision to mean any decision of the type listed in of this chapter where the time limits for review as set forth in part of this chapter or in the railroad retirement act have expired.
in this case,the hearings officer issued her decision on may,giving rivera until july to file an appeal with the board.when rivera failed to appeal to the board by july,the hearings officer decision became final and rivera lost his right to further review.see id.at c the right to further review of a decision of a hearings officer shall be forfeited unless formal final appeal is filed in the manner and within the time prescribed in b.thus,the board dismissal of rivera claim is not a final decision on the merits of that claim.
we find support for our conclusion in case law analyzing the ability to appeal an administrative decision not to reopen a final decision.in this case,rivera late appeal requested an extension of time.since the hearings officer decision had become final,rivera request essentially asked the board to reopen a final decision.see matlock sullivan,cir stating that a claimant request to extend the period for filing a claim for judicial review is indistinguishable from a request to reopen a disability claim.
the supreme court,interpreting the social security act,has held that courts do not have jurisdiction to review an agency decision not to reopen a final decision.califano sanders,d in sanders,the court examined a claim for disability benefits.id.at.in,an administrative law judge the alj denied the claimant request for benefits.id.at.the claimant filed essentially the same request in,but the alj refused to reopen the decision.id.at.the claimant then sought review in federal district court.id.at.
the sanders court held that the district court did not have jurisdiction to review the alj decision under the social security act,which provided any individual,after any final decision of the secretary may obtain a review of such decision by a civil action commenced within sixty days id.at.quoting g supp.v.the court pointed out that an interpretation that would allow a claimant judicial review simply by being petition to reopen his claim would frustrate the congressional purpose to impose a limitation upon judicial review of the secretary final decision on the initial claim for benefits.id.
in matlock,we applied sanders in determining whether the district court had jurisdiction to review the social security appeals council the appeals council refusal to consider an untimely request for review.at.this court noted that it previously had held that a claimant request to extend the period for filing a claim for judicial review was indistinguishable from the request to reopen a disability claim at issue in sanders and that the phrase final decision refers to a final decision on the merits.id.at citing peterson califano,cir.accordingly,matlock held that the district court did not have jurisdiction to review the appeals council decision not to review the untimely appeal.accord harper sec y of health human,cir bacon sullivan,cir harper bowen,cir adams heckler,cir smith heckler,cir white schweiker,cir dietsch schweiker,cir watters harris,cir rios sec y of health,educ.welfare,cir.but see bloodsworth heckler,cir.
furthermore,the majority of circuits addressing the issue have held that they do not have jurisdiction to review a board decision not to reopen a claimant application for benefits.see harris united states ret,cir abbruzzese ret,cir gutierrez ret,cir steebe united states ret,cir but see sones united states ret,cir finding steebe factually distinguishable in holding that it had jurisdiction to review the board decision not to reopen for abuse of discretion szostak ret,cir holding that the administrative procedure act or the common law provides jurisdiction to review a board decision not to reopen for abuse of discretion in harris,for instance,the claimant failed to appeal the director denial of his claim to the bureau of hearings and appeals within sixty days.at.the hearings officer dismissed the appeal as untimely without good cause,and the board affirmed.id.the fourth circuit stated that when the claimant failed to file a timely appeal within sixty days of the board decision denying her application on reconsideration,the decision denying benefits became final.id.finding sanders to be applicable to a board decision not to reopen a case,the harris court held that the board decision not to reopen was not a final decision under c.id.at.thus,the court held that it did not have jurisdiction to examine the claimant argument that the board erred in holding that she did not have good cause for filing an untimely appeal.id.at.
in this case,the hearings officer issued her decision on may.rivera did not file his appeal with the board until july,more than sixty days after the hearings officer decision.just as in matlock,the board dismissal of rivera appeal as untimely is not a final decision under c because it did not decide the case on the merits.at.thus,we agree with the fourth circuit view in harris and hold that the board discretionary decision not to extend the period for filing a claim for judicial review was not a final decision of the board and,therefore,is not subject to review by this court.
rivera,however,contends that the board implicitly waived its right to dismiss his appeal as untimely.in his appellate filing with the board,rivera stated that he intended to submit additional evidence concerning t he true percentage of subsidization rivera receives and his actual income.on october,the board advised rivera that it will hold open the appeal for days from the date of this letter for the submission of evidence.in the absence of any such submission,the board will proceed to issue a decision on the record before it.rivera argues that this letter constitutes an implicit waiver of the limitations period.
in arguing that the board october letter implicitly waived the limitations period,rivera relies on funderburk califano,and sipple califano.in funderburk,the district court examined the claimant argument that the secretary of the department of health,education and welfare implicitly waived an administrative regulation that required claimants to file appeals of final administrative decisions in federal district court within sixty days of receipt of the decision.at.on september,the appeals council rejected the claimant appeal.id.the claimant then asked the appeals council to hold his file open for submission of additional evidence.id.the appeals council responded the appeals council exercises the jurisdiction to consider the question of reopening and revision of the administrative law judge decision t he council will carefully consider any additional evidence or information which you may furnish.id.the claimant counsel eventually submitted additional evidence,causing the appeals council to respond in a january,letter the appeals council has carefully considered your additional evidence but has concluded that modification of action previously taken is not warranted accordingly,the administrative law judge decision dated july,stands as the final decision of the secretary in this case.id.the claimant filed suit in district court on february.id.
the issue before the district court was whether the appeals council january letter implicitly waived the limitations period.the court held 
the council january,letter demonstrates that the council did reopen its september,decision when it states that the council carefully considered the additional materials submitted,concluded that modification of the prior decision was not warranted,and held that the administrative law judge decision dated july,stands as the final decision of the secretary in this case rather than simply stating that the council refused to reopen its september,decision.
id.at.alternatively,the court held that even had the appeals council refused to reopen its september decision,the plaintiff still would have been entitled to bring his suit in district court because 
t he secretary should not be entitled to assert the limitations period here where the appeals council invited plaintiff to submit additional evidence three days before the time limit for filing suit expired,forcing plaintiff to choose whether to pursue additional administrative channels or to institute a possibly needless civil action.
in sipple,a west virginia district court addressed a similar issue,where the appeals council sent the claimant a january,letter upholding an alj denial of disability benefits.at.in letters dated january and february,the claimant asked the appeals council to reopen his case and reconsider its previous denial,or extend the time beyond sixty days for instituting suit in district court.id.on april,the appeals council wrote that with respect to your statements relative to the submission of additional documentation,the council will carefully consider any further evidence which you may wish to submit and take such further action as may be warranted.id.the letter also indicated that the appeals council found no basis to modify its january decision,but extended the deadline to file an action in district court to april.id.the claimant,who did not submit new evidence after receiving the appeals council april letter,ultimately filed suit in district court on june.id.at.
similar to funderburk,the issue before the district court was whether the appeals council april letter implicitly waived the limitations period.the court stated as in the funderburk case,the appeals council in this case invited the submission of additional documentation and informed plaintiff that the council would carefully
