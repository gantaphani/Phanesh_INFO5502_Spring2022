jimmy sprinkle appeals a decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims,which denied his claims for entitlement to service connection for mitral valve prolapse and benign familial myoclonus.see sprinkle shinseki.vet.claims lexis.we agree that sprinkle was not denied fair process as it related to responding to a medical exam ordered by the board of veterans appeals board.accordingly,we affirm.
background 
sprinkle served in the army from may,until february.while in the service,sprinkle was diagnosed with schizophrenia and prescribed a high dose of thorazine.in august,almost seventeen years after separating from the military,sprinkle was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and chorea,a movement disorder similar to benign familial myoclonus.after sprinkle succeeded in establishing entitlement to disability compensation before the social security administration,the veteran affairs va regional office awarded sprinkle a pension on april,effective august.on october,sprinkle filed an application with the va for entitlement to a service connection for mitral valve prolapse and myoclonus.sprinkle maintained that he was incorrectly diagnosed with schizophrenia while in the service and that the high doses of thorazine he received worsened his mitral valve prolapse and caused his myoclonus.
following an initial medical exam,the regional office concluded that sprinkle conditions were not due to the gap between service and the onset of his mitral valve prolapse and myoclonus.in a july,decision,the board remanded to the regional office for another medical examination to address a letter from sprinkle private physician that indicated that his conditions were worsened by his inservice ingestion of thorazine.sprinkle received a second va examination on october,but the regional office continued to deny his entitlement to service connection in a october,supplemental statement of the case.the supplemental statement of the case summarized and relied on the medical opinions derived from the october examination neither sprinkle mitral valve prolapse nor his familial myoclonus was caused by or a result of the administration of thorazine while he was on active duty military service.joint app x.furthermore,sprinkle was notified that he had a period of time days to respond with additional comments or evidence before his appeal would be returned to the board alternatively,sprinkle could request that the regional office return his appeal to the board prior to the expiration of the day period.on november,sprinkle pursued the latter course by indicating that he had no other information or evidence to submit and requesting that his case be returned to the board as soon as possible.
on november,the regional office sent sprinkle a letter,notifying him that his appeal had been certified to the board and that the regional office was transferring all his records to the board.the letter also indicated that sprinkle had days,or until the board issued a decision in his case,to send the board additional evidence concerning his appeal.on november,sprinkle,now through counsel,responded to the regional office,disagreeing with the conclusions of its supplemental statement of the case and expressing a desire to have his appeal returned to the board.in doing so,sprinkle also requested that all evidence obtained by the va after december,be sent to him.joint app x.this request was broad enough to include the medical examiner october,opinion.sprinkle reiterated his request to the regional office in february and march.because the record had already been sent to the board,however,each request for evidence was forwarded by the regional office to the board.sprinkle.vet.claims lexis,at.
on may,sprinkle counsel received pages of documents including the medical examiner october,opinion less than thirty days later,on june,the board issued its decision denying sprinkle entitlement to service connection for his mitral valve prolapse and benign familial myoclonus.sprinkle appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims arguing,inter alia,that the board failed to afford him fair process in the adjudication of his claims by not providing him with a copy of the october,medical examiner opinion until fewer than days before the board decision.the appeals court rejected sprinkle fair process arguments and affirmed the board decision denying entitlement to service connection.sprinkle timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,c.
ii.standard of review 
according to a,this court reviews decisions of the court of appeals for veterans claims with respect to the validity of a decision on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof that was relied on in making the decision.a.except to the extent an appeal presents a constitutional issue,this court may not review a challenge to a factual determination or a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.d.accordingly,we review questions of statutory and regulatory interpretation de novo.moody principi.
iii.discussion 
a.the regulations 
claims for veterans benefits are initially developed and adjudicated by a va regional office.see b,d.decisions of the regional office are then reviewed on appeal by the board.see a.to ensure that claimants receive the benefit of this review within the agency,all evidence relevant to a claim generally must be considered by the regional office in the first instance.id.accordingly,the regional office conducts all necessary evidentiary development,including obtaining medical examinations and opinions.d.if the regional office denies a benefit sought,it must provide the claimant notice of the decision and include a summary of the evidence considered by the secretary.b.and if the claimant disagrees with that denial,the regional office must then prepare a statement of the case that includes a summary of the evidence in the case pertinent to the issue or issues with which disagreement has been expressed.d see also requiring that the statement of the case be complete enough to allow the appellant to present written oral arguments before the board.any additional evidence that the claimant presents must be addressed by the regional office in a supplemental statement of the case.b,a.
congress created a narrow exception to this consideration of evidence by the regional office,providing that when,in the judgment of the board,expert medical opinion is warranted by the medical complexity or controversy involved in an appeal case,the board may secure an advisory medical opinion from one or more independent medical experts who are not employees of the va.a see also a.additionally,congress,and the va through the passage of enabling regulations,created a procedural safeguard to this evidence gathering by the board.specifically,the board is required to notify the claimant that it is requesting an advisory medical opinion provide the claimant with a copy of the opinion and allow the claimant days to respond to the opinion with evidence or argument.c a.this case,however,does not implicate this exception.the board did not obtain an advisory opinion pursuant to.gambill shinseki.instead,it remanded the case for a medical examination administered by the regional office.in re sprinkle,slip op.at.
under,the board is required to remand a case to the regional office specifying the action to be taken i f further evidence,clarification of the evidence,correction of a procedural defect,or any other action is essential for a proper appellate decision.following any additional development of the evidence,the regional office decides whether the record as a whole supports allowance of the benefits sought.if any benefit sought remains denied,the regional office must issue a supplemental statement of the case concerning the additional development that informs the claimant of any material changes in,or additions to,the information previously considered by the regional office.the claimant is then given days to respond to the supplemental statement of the case before the appeal is returned to the board.after the appeal is certified to the board,the claimant has an additional days to submit new evidence to the regional office.a.the question presented by this case is whether fair process requires that the board allow the claimant an additional days to respond to evidence obtained on remand after the claimant declines to respond to a summary of that evidence in a supplemental statement of the case.
fair process 
in thurber brown,the court of appeals for veterans claims created what became known as the fair process doctrine,holding that,before the board relies on any evidence developed or obtained subsequent to the issuance of the most recent statement of the case or supplemental statement of the case,the board must provide a claimant with reasonable notice of such evidence and a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to respond to it.id.at.the claimant must be permitted to respond with not only argument and comment,but also provide additional evidence.austin brown.
this court has not explicitly addressed the fair process doctrine.see gambill,at discussing the fair process concerns involved in a denial of the claimant ability to serve interrogatories on a medical examiner,but concluding that the denial was harmless error.when the court of appeals for veteran claims created a procedural right in the name of fair process,the court primarily relied on the underlying va adjudicatory scheme.gambill,at.at the time,neither this court nor the supreme court had ruled on the extent to which applicants for government benefits had a property right in their expectation.thurber.at.instead,the court premised its holding upon the considerations of fair process announced in gonzales united states.in gonzales,the supreme court held that despite silence in the applicable statute and regulations as to a particular procedural requirement,the requirement was implicit in the statute and regulations when viewed against our underlying concepts of procedural regularity and basic fair play.id.at.since that time,this court has held the due process clause of the constitution applies to proceedings in which the va decides whether claimants are eligible for veterans benefits.cushman shinseki.in light of this precedent and thurber,the question becomes whether the fair process doctrine applies in this case.we conclude that it does not.
by its terms,the fair process doctrine is only triggered when evidence is developed or obtained by the board subsequent to the issuance of the most recent statement of the case or supplemental statement of the case with respect to such claim.thurber.at.in this case,while the regional office developed evidence on remand through a medical examination,it issued a supplemental statement of the case that provided a summary of the evidence in the case pertinent to the issue or issues with which disagreement has been expressed,d,and that was complete enough to allow the appellant to present written oral arguments before the board.crucially,sprinkle has not challenged the adequacy of the summary.sprinkle.vet.claims lexis,at.it follows that the board did not develop or obtain any evidence subsequent to the issuance of the most recent supplemental statement of the case.indeed,even though sprinkle had days to respond to the supplemental statement of the case,he expressly notified the va that he had no other information or evidence to submit and requested that his case be returned to the board as soon as possible.supp.app x.because the regional office received and considered the evidence before summarizing it in a supplemental statement of the case,this case does not implicate the statutory exception to the prohibition against board review of evidence that the fair process doctrine is designed to safeguard.
this case is unlike most other cases that implicate the doctrine where the board has obtained an advisory medical opinion or treatise pursuant to and and fails to allow the claimant to respond with additional evidence or interrogatories,gambill,thurber.although this case involves a medical examination conducted by the regional office on remand,sprinkle argues that the fair process doctrine should be extended to cover it.in particular,sprinkle argues that,in young shinseki,the court of appeals for veterans claims has extended the fair process doctrine to cases involving board remands.young is distinguishable from sprinkle case because sprinkle was put on notice about the substance of the medical report through the supplemental statement of the case.also,sprinkle did receive a copy of the medical examination almost a month before the board issued its decision.in young,the veteran did not even receive a copy of the medical opinion until after the board issued its decision.young.at.thus,because the regional office in this case considered the medical examination initially before summarizing it in a supplemental statement of the case and there is nothing undermining that summary,we conclude that the fair process doctrine is not implicated by this case.
sprinkle also argues that the fair process doctrine requires the board to provide him with a copy of the medical examiner opinion and allow him days to respond.sprinkle relies on a to support his argument for incorporating a day response period into the fair process doctrine.that regulation,however,is inapplicable to this case because it only applies to advisory opinions obtained by the board pursuant to.see gambill,at.section provides that t he board may obtain a medical opinion from an appropriate health care professional in the veterans health administration on medical questions involved in the consideration of an appeal when,in its judgment,such medical expertise is needed for equitable disposition of an appeal.a.in this case,the board remanded to the regional office to conduct a medical examination.sprinkle,slip op.at.accordingly,the pertinent regulations controlling actions by the regional office were,and.consistent with those regulations,the regional office issued a supplemental statement of the case summarizing the evidence it obtained on remand and returned the case to the board after sprinkle indicated that he had no additional evidence to submit.
while it is regrettable that there was less than days between when sprinkle counsel received the medical exam he subsequently requested and when the board issued its decision,sprinkle was not prejudiced by any action of the agency.see gambill,at harmless error is fully applicable to veterans claims cases,subject to the same principles that apply generally to harmless error analysis in other civil and administrative cases.citing shinseki sanders,d.had sprinkle not instructed the regional office that he had no additional evidence to submit and not requested that it immediately return his appeal to the board,his record would have remained with the regional office.this would have enabled the regional office to timely process his subsequent requests for documents including the medical examiner opinion rather than having to forward those requests to the board.furthermore,sprinkle had more than seven months to offer additional evidence from the date the regional office issued its supplemental statement of the case to the date when the board issued its decision.this vastly exceeds the four months required by the regulations.days a days.yet sprinkle chose not to respond to the only requirement of the regional office under the regulations a summary complete enough to allow the appellant to present written oral arguments before the board.accordingly,sprinkle can not show prejudice in this case.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we agree with the court of appeals for veterans claims determination that sprinkle was not denied fair process.we have considered sprinkle other arguments and find nothing in them that upsets our conclusions.accordingly,we affirm.
each party shall bear its own costs.

i would vacate the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims and remand the matter for that court to reconsider its ruling on the fair process doctrine.the veterans court discussion leaves uncertain how it interpreted the doctrine.on this rule of law issue,a,it is advisable for the veterans court to pr
