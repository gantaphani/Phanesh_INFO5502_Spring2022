factual and procedural background 
in august,the butte county department of social welfare notified defendant that she had received in benefits between october and june to which she was not entitled in cash aid and in food stamps.initially,those notices explained that the overpayment was caused by the county,or the county welfare department made a mistake.later,the county issued new notices,alleging that the overpayment of cash aid and overissuance of food stamps were caused instead by defendant failure to report material changes in her household.
following a hearing before an administrative law judge in may,at which the parties were represented and testimony was taken dss issued its decision.according to the written decision,at issue were the following questions.whether the boys were members of the assistance unit and household during the periods in question and.whether the overissuance and overpayment were the result of administrative errors or defendant failure to report the boys absence from her home.evidence considered by the administrative law judge included that the county case worker determined that defendant remained eligible to receive benefits for the boys after she reported in september that her two sons were living with their father half of the time now,and evidence the boys lived weekdays with their father during the school year.defendant testified he had primary responsibility for the boys care since well before,and their longest stay with defendant was four weeks in the summer of.
noting that t here are three types of overissuance claims inadvertent household error claims administrative error claims and intentional program violation claims,the administrative law judge concluded the overpayment and overissuance are the result of administrative errors of omission committed by the county welfare department.the county is obliged to conduct periodic reviews and investigations as needed when information indicates the circumstances of eligibility may have changed.in this case,there were no periodic redeterminations as required.furthermore,the report that the children were with their father half of the time needed prompt verification because it was inconsistent with defendant prior reports and the written calendar agreement of the district attorney family support division,which indicated that defendant would have primary care and control responsibility during the summer months only.the administrative law judge order again states all the overpayments and overissuances are determined to have been caused by administrative errors and the decision confirmed defendant obligation to repay the excess benefits she had received.
while the administrative action to recover in welfare benefits was pending,the district attorney filed this action,alleging defendant fraudulently received welfare benefits of welf,subd.c count and committed perjury by false application for aid when she affirmatively omitted that james and jordan had moved out of the defendant home.
after the administrative decision was issued,defendant moved to dismiss this action,on the ground the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars the district attorney from proceeding on criminal charges because an administrative law judgment determined the overpayment and overissuance were the result of administrative errors,and not the result of any intentional misrepresentation by defendant.
the trial court denied her motion and,following a court trial,defendant was convicted on both counts.
discussion 
on appeal,defendant renews her argument that collateral estoppel bars the state from prosecuting her for welfare fraud after dss determined her benefits overpayments were caused by administrative errors.
collateral estoppel,or issue preclusion,precludes relitigation of issues argued and decided in prior proceedings.sims,supra,cal d at,lucido superior court cal d,lucido.the threshold requirements for application of this doctrine are the issue in the subsequent proceeding is identical to that decided in the former proceeding the issue was actually litigated in the former proceeding the issue was necessarily decided in the former proceeding the decision in the former proceeding is final and on the merits and issue preclusion is sought against a person who was a party or in privity with a party to the former proceeding.sims,supra at,lucido,supra at,castillo city of los angeles th,d castillo.the party asserting collateral estoppel bears the burden of establishing these requirements.lucido,supra,at.
if the threshold requirements are met,the propriety of applying collateral estoppel depends upon whether its application will further the public policies of preservation of the integrity of the judicial system,promotion of judicial economy,and protection of litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation.lucido,supra,cal d at,castillo,supra,th at,d.
issue preclusion is not limited to barring relitigation of court findings.it also bars the relitigating of issues which were previously resolved in an administrative hearing by an agency acting in a judicial capacity.citation.castillo,supra,th at,d sims,supra,cal d at.
as she did in the trial court,defendant relies here chiefly upon the california supreme court opinion in sims,supra,cal d,in which the court held that collateral estoppel bars the criminal prosecution of a welfare recipient for welfare fraud after administrative proceedings conducted by dss failed to find fraud by the recipient.id.at.
the facts of sims are startlingly similar to those here.in sims,the welfare recipient received administrative notice claiming she failed to report the composition of her household while receiving aid before the administrative hearing requested by the recipient occurred,criminal charges based on the same allegations of fraud that were the subject of the county notice of action were brought against her.sims,supra,cal d at.while the criminal charges were pending,dss conducted a hearing and determined that the county had failed to meet its burden of proving that respondent had fraudulently obtained welfare benefits id.at,the county did not seek judicial review of the decision.
the state supreme court in sims found that all technical requirements and policy reasons for applying collateral estoppel had been satisfied,despite procedural differences between the two proceedings and notwithstanding any right to a jury trial the prosecution might possess.sims,supra,cal d at,fn,see also lucido,supra,cal d at.it reasoned that the welfare fraud issue was properly raised by respondent request for a fair hearing in the administrative action and identical to that raised in the criminal matter and,when the administrative hearing officer ruled in the recipie
