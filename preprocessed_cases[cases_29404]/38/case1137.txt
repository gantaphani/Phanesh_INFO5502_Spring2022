in these consolidated cases,two hospitals seek mandamus to compel the secretary of health and human services to reopen final medicare reimbursement determinations regarding inpatient services provided by the hospitals.concluding that the secretary had no clear duty to reopen the payment decisions,the district court dismissed both cases for lack of mandamus jurisdiction.we agree with the district court on all counts and therefore affirm.
the central issue presented in these cases has been the focus of extensive litigation culminating in two controlling decisions from this re medicare reimbursement litigation,and monmouth medical center thompson.we therefore provide only the following brief overview of the applicable statutory and regulatory regime.
under the medicare act,the secretary of health and human services hhs reimburses hospitals for covered inpatient services provided to medicare beneficiaries.hhs administers these payments through the centers for medicare and medicaid services,formerly the health care financing administration hcfa.to obtain reimbursement,hospitals submit yearly cost reports to fiscal private insurance companies acting on behalf of the secretary.after auditing the cost report,the intermediary issues a notice of program reimbursement npr,in which it determines the amount owed to the hospital for the cost reporting year at issue.hospitals can appeal that determination to the provider reimbursement review board the board and then to federal district court.a,f.
hospitals serving a disproportionately high number of medicare patients receive increased reimbursements known as disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustments.congress has set forth a formula for determining dsh adjustments based,in part,on the number of days that a hospital treated patients entitled to state medicaid payments.id.d f vi ii.previously,hcfa interpreted this statutory formula to include only those days for which hospitals actually received medicaid interpretation that the fourth,sixth,eighth,and ninth circuits struck down as inconsistent with the medicare act.cabell huntington,shalala,cir legacy emanuel hosp.health ctr.shalala,cir deaconess health servs.shalala,cir per curiam jewish,sec y of health human,cir.in,acknowledging that its prior interpretation was contrary to the applicable law in four judicial circuits,hcfa issued ruling,which instructed intermediaries to include all days in the dsh adjustment calculation,regardless of whether the hospital actually received payments for those days.health care financing administration ruling,ruling or hcfar.
the two cases before us involve the intersection of ruling and hhs regulations authorizing the reopening of intermediary reimbursement determinations.pursuant to a,as that regulation existed at all relevant times,an intermediary reimbursement determination may be reopened if the affected hospital moves to do so within years of the date of the notice of the intermediary determination.unlike npr determinations themselves,an intermediary decision whether to reopen a determination under this provision is both discretionary and unreviewable.your home visiting nurse,shalala.additionally,b the key provision at issue that a determination rendered by the intermediary shall be reopened and revised by the intermediary if,within the aforementioned period,hcfa notifies the intermediary that such determination or decision is inconsistent with the applicable law,regulations,or general instructions issued by hcfa.
in monmouth,the first of our two previous decisions regarding this issue,we concluded that ruling constitutes notice under section b that hcfa former method of calculating dsh adjustments was inconsistent with the applicable law.b.accordingly,we held that because section b speaks in mandatory terms,it imposes a nondiscretionary duty on the secretary,enforceable through mandamus,to reopen nprs decided within the three years before the issuance of ruling the fact that ruling itself states that the agency will not reopen settled cost reports based on this issue.see monmouth,at.then,in in re medicare,we clarified that this clear duty to reopen applies to nprs issued during the three years prior to ruling even for hospitals that had failed to appeal a cost report or request reopening given that section b does not require hospitals to file anything at all to obtain relief,we see no basis for holding that only those hospitals that appealed or sought section a reopening have a personal right to the reopening required by section b.in re medicare,at.
relying on our decisions in monmouth and in re medicare,the two hospitals in these consolidated appeals seek mandamus to compel the secretary through her intermediaries to reopen their cost reports and apply the more favorable dsh calculation adopted in ruling.see.the first hospital,baptist memorial,challenges a npr that determined,pursuant to hcfa former eligible days calculation,that it was ineligible for a dsh adjustment for its fy cost report.in,baptist appealed that decision to the board.while that appeal was still pending,hcfa issued ruling.the board then advised baptist of the filing schedule for the appeal and warned that its case would be dismissed if baptist missed the applicable deadlines.despite this reminder,baptist failed to submit its position papers on time,and the board consequently dismissed its appeal for want of prosecution in.four years later,baptist filed this mandamus action in the district court for the district of columbia,seeking an order compelling the secretary to reopen and correct the reimbursement determination pursuant to the eligible but unpaid days calculation set forth in ruling.
the second hospital before us,agnes medical center,challenges its intermediary npr determination regarding its fy cost report.in,agnes asked the intermediary to reopen the cost report and provide a dsh adjustment,but the intermediary rejected that request.agnes appealed that decision to the board,and on june,after ruling issuance,the parties settled,agreeing that the intermediary would reopen agnes cost report to apply a dsh adjustment.after doing so and applying the former eligible days calculation,however,the intermediary informed agnes that it failed to meet the qualifying threshold for an adjustment.then,in,the board dismissed agnes appeal on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction over that appeal in view of your home visiting nurse services,shalala,at,in which the supreme court held that the board lacks authority to review an intermediary refusal under section a to reopen a reimbursement determination.seven years after the dismissal of its appeal,agnes sought mandamus relief in the district court.
the district court dismissed both mandamus actions for lack of jurisdiction.noting that the two hospitals sought reopening of nprs issued more than three years prior to ruling issuance in,the court concluded that neither hospital could show that it had a clear right to relief or that the secretary had a nondiscretionary duty to act under the for mandamus jurisdiction.see power barnhart,outlining requirements for mandamus relief.in reaching this conclusion,the district court also rejected the hospitals argument that they were entitled to mandamus relief because they had jurisdictionally proper appeals pending when hcfa issued ruling.baptist mem l hosp.johnson,d,agnes med.ctr.sebelius,d.
baptist and agnes appealed the denials of their mandamus petitions.because both cases require us to answer the same principal section b mandates reopening of nprs issued more than three years prior to issuance of ruling where the hospitals had appeals pending at that consolidated the appeals.
the mandamus act grants district courts original jurisdiction over any action in the nature of mandamus to compel an officer or employee of the united states or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.a court may grant mandamus relief only if the plaintiff has a clear right to relief the defendant has a clear duty to act and there is no other adequate remedy available to plaintiff.power,f d at internal quotation marks omitted.we review a district court determination w
