plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut christopher droney,accepting the recommended ruling of magistrate judge william garfinkel to affirm the decision of the administrative law judge alj denying application for social security disability benefits.on appeal,argues that the alj and the district court erred by failing to give controlling weight to the opinion of her treating physician that she suffers from fibromyalgia and can not work because of severe pain.for reasons stated below,we reverse and remand to the district court with instructions to remand the matter to the commissioner of the social security administration ssa for a calculation of disability benefits.
background 
at the time of her ssa hearing,nina was years old,and married with three children.after completing two years of college,worked as a telephone operator for southern new england telephone snet from to.she also worked as a mail sorter from to.from to,took seven disability leaves from her job,which lasted between one month and one year,before being placed on disability in.avers that she became totally disabled in may,when she last worked.
medical history 
according to medical records and her testimony,difficulties began in when she injured her back in a motor vehicle accident in the eighth month of her last pregnancy.to treat her back pain,she tried various and pain medications,physical therapy and chiropractic treatment.in april,consulted an orthopedist who diagnosed degenerative disc disease.a mri showed degeneration in the and regions.a discogram,while normal at,showed that was severely degenerated.
beginning february,began regular treatments with osteopath jeffrey helfand,a rheumatologist.after an initial consultation and examination,helfand reported that complained of 
pain in her right leg and low back which she states goes down into her coccyx area associated with tingling and weakness in her right arm which has been present intermittently since.she states that the pain is always present but can be more severe at sometimes than at others she states she has difficulty sitting or standing for any prolonged time and complains of frequent sleep difficulty.the most recent prolonged episode of low back and leg pain began around october after approximately a period when she was relatively symptom free.
helfand documented that m usculoskeletal and extremity exams reveal multiple tender points in the distribution characteristic of fibromyalgia.he noted the results of a mri showing minimal disc bulging at the and regions,but no disc herniation.helfand found no reflex,sensory,or motor deficits,but he noted the presence of paresthesias significant spasm with limitation of lateral flexion and rotation in the lumbar paravertebral muscles and marked tenderness over the posterior superior iliac spines bilaterally.helfand eventually diagnosed as having fibromyalgia,as well as other as degenerative disc disease,chronic low back syndrome,and peroneal neuropathy associated with her back pain.
who had taken a disability leave in january,tried unsuccessfully to return to work after beginning treatment with helfand.in april,helfand reported that she was quite depressed and distraught regarding her condition and her persistent inability to go to work.the pain medications he prescribed,like many others had tried,did not provide her any significant relief although helfand continued to prescribe medication,he noted that there is probably little to suggest she will have any improvement from any further trials with nsaid.in september,helfand informed snet,employer,that her date was indeterminate.
helfand referred to gary dee at norwalk hospital,a specialist in pain management.in october,dee began treating with a series of epidural blocks and steroid trigger point injections.an mri of the lumbar spine performed at this time revealed a mild asymmetrical disc bulge at the and regions.helfand recorded that had some improvement following the trigger point injections and was able to better tolerate massage therapy.helfand later progress notes,however,show that the injections afforded her only relief.he reported that continues to have chronic pain which has been limiting her ability for physical activity and for work and has had no relief with mild narcotic analgesics such as darvocet or vicodin.
and helfand discussed her prognosis and ability to return to work.a snet representative had informed them that job would be terminated in january unless she returned.snet position was clear that they did not want her to work a few weeks and then be out.helfand recorded his view that it is unlikely that she will be able to return to work for any significant duration.rather than recommend applying for disability,however,he suggested that try to go back to work for weeks at four hours daily and see how she does.
returned to work in early december on a basis.a few weeks later,helfand noted that was having somewhat of a difficult time but has decided to continue as long as she can.she continued until early may,at which time she stopped working because of severe low back tenderness and paresthesias in the lower extremities.also complained of pain in her upper back and right arm and hand.a physical exam showed a positive tinel sign indicative of carpal tunnel syndrome.while an emg performed in june did not show evidence of nerve entrapment,a subsequent emg did.
in july,helfand wrote several letters describing current limitations.in one letter requesting a medical exemption from jury service,helfand explained that it was difficult for to sit in any one position for more than minutes without needing to get up and walk around.in other letters,he described her current limitations to include sitting standing for hours or less daily,or continuous or sitting for no more than minutes without a rest period,and no lifting,pulling or pushing.
in august,physical therapist jill tomasello performed a work fitness evaluation of for snet.tomasello found that test results did not meet the criteria for consistent or maximum effort,explaining that t his is not unusual for the initial test and that repeat testing is needed to verify the results.tomasello nevertheless concluded that has demonstrated the ability to work at a sedentary work level,and recommended a work hardening program if she is unable to tolerate a return to work.however,a subsequent evaluation performed in july suggested that was able to tolerate seated activity at a work site for a maximum of minutes before she would need to get up and move around freely.
in october,helfand informed snet that could not return to work because of fibromyalgia,peroneal neuropathy,and chronic low back syndrome.helfand explained in his progress notes that he had elected to consider her permanently disabled because she has not had any dramatic improvement with any of the measures we have tried.
helfand referred to a number of other doctors.don goldenberg,chief of rheumatology at the hospital in massachusetts and a fibromyalgia specialist,confirmed helfand diagnosis of fibromyalgia.robert goldring,who was providing chiropractic treatment at this time to alleviate pain and spasms,stated that long term pain was essentially due to her fibromyalgia.also consulted with orthopedist ramon batson.on a physical exam,he found diffuse tenderness to palpation along the axial spine and in the si joints bilaterally and trigger points present in the right trapezius muscles and in the right glutei.batson noted history of disc disease but not disc herniation,and recommended treatment for myofascial pain syndrome if studies proved negative for surgical pathology.
a number of tests were ordered,apparently in part to rule out surgical pathology.plain films did not reveal any abnormal movement or osseous lesions,but an mri of the lumbar spine taken in again revealed bulging at the and regions.underwent a full body scan in july.the scan revealed one significant abnormality there is increased activity in the right sacroiliac joint which may represent sacroiliitis or a consequence of previous trauma.helfand pursued the possibility of implanting a spinal cord stimulator,but abandoned this option after neurosurgeon charles needham excluded any significant nerve compression disease and any surgical approach to management.
in july,helfand again diagnosed with severe fibromyalgia.he explained that fibromyalgia is typically characterized by severe fatigue,diffuse muscular soreness and tenderness which in certain instances can be debilitating.he noted the difficulty of proving disability on this basis because of the absence of objective evidence to quantify the severity of the pain.he reported that her pain is frequently overwhelming and the associated fatigue can cause a significant limitation in her ability to function on a daily basis.helfand opined that her ability to function at a normal level because of the persistent,severe pain is markedly limited.in a december letter to attorney,helfand explained that she continues to experience significant difficulty with her activities of daily living,and noted a relatively acute onset of severe tenderness and stiffness with multiple tender points.he concluded that it should probably be obvious that she continues to have significant disability and at this time will most likely be unable to retain any significant gainful employment.
procedural history 
in august,filed an application for disability benefits the ssa denied her application initially in october and upon reconsideration in december.the ssa consulting physicians disagreed with helfand conclusion that was limited to sitting standing for four hours or less,because e vidence does not show deficits of motor function or significant arthritis to severely limit standing or sitting.sought a review before an alj of the ssa office of hearings and appeals a hearing was conducted in august,who was represented by counsel,testified on her own behalf with regard to her medical history and daily limitations,including her inability to do most housework or to sit or stand comfortably for more than minutes.jeff blanks,a vocational expert,also testified.he identified past work as a telephone operator and mail clerk as semiskilled and unskilled,respectively,and sedentary in nature.the alj asked blanks whether an individual could perform past work if she could sit for six hours a day and stand and walk for a total of two hours a day,or alternatively sit or stand at least every hour.blanks answered that the individual could perform past work as a mail clerk but not as a telephone operator.counsel,in turn,asked him whether an individual who could sustain the sitting position for only about minutes at a time,sit stand for a total of only four hours and tolerate upper body activities for only two minutes at a time would be able to perform past work.blanks answered no and also opined,on counsel inquiry,that there is no other type of job a person with those limitations might be able to perform.
in september,the alj issued a decision denying application.although the alj found that the medical evidence of record documents that the claimant has fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease and that these impairments were severe,the alj also found that retained the residual functional capacity to occasionally lift and carry up to pounds,sit for six hours a day and walk or stand for two hours a day.the alj concluded that could perform her past work as a mail clerk and therefore was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.specifically,the alj found that c ontrary to the claimant persistent complaints of pain,there are no objective medical findings.he noted in this regard that there was no evidence of radiculopathy,signs of sacroilitis,abnormal chest examinations,or abnormal movement or osseous lesions.as a result,the alj found that the opinions of helfand regarding limitations can not be afforded extra weight because they are not by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques,and are inconsistent with the other substantial evidence of record,namely physical therapist tomasello work capacity evaluation and allegations of pain and functional limitations are not entirely credible in light of the minimal objective medical findings.in total,the alj opinion referred five times to a lack of objective evidence.finally,the alj also noted that was currently taking only one medication for her pain,and that the evidence does not show that there have been any changes in her condition from prior to that time when she had worked while also receiving treatment for her alleged impairments.
the ssa appeals council affirmed the alj decision and timely appealed to the united states district court for the district of connecticut,asserting numerous grounds for remand.in august,magistrate judge william garfinkel issued a lengthy ruling recommending affirmance of the alj decision.in march,the district court entered a brief order accepting the recommended ruling in its entirety.
this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
in this court,argues that the alj misapplied ssa regulations by failing to give controlling weight to the opinion of her treating physician that she suffers from fibromyalgia and that the attendant pain and fatigue severely limit her ability to function and work on a daily level.she argues that the alj,as well as the district court,misunderstood the nature of fibromyalgia in requiring objective evidence beyond those clinical signs and symptoms necessary for a diagnosis.the government notes that the alj did credit helfand diagnosis of fibromyalgia,but argues that his conclusion on the ultimate issue of legal disability was not entitled to controlling weight and that substantial evidence supports the alj decision.
standard of review 
when deciding an appeal from a denial of disability benefits,we focus on the administrative ruling rather than the district court opinion.curry apfel.cir citing schaal apfel,cir.we conduct a plenary review of the administrative record to determine whether the commissioner conclusions are supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole or are based on an erroneous legal standard.id.internal citation omitted see also balsamo chater,cir.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.curry,at quoting richardson perales,d.
to be eligible for disability benefits under the social security act,a claimant must establish inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.the ssa has promulgated regulations prescribing a analysis for evaluating disability claims.in essence,if the commissioner determines that the claimant is not working,that he has a severe impairment,that the impairment is not one listed in appendix of the regulations that conclusively requires a determination of disability,and that the claimant is not capable of continuing in his prior type of work,the commissioner must find him disabled if there is not another type of work the claimant can do.draegert barnhart,cir see also shaw chater,cir.the claimant bears the burden of proof on the first four steps,while the ssa bears the burden on the last step.see id.
in this case,as we have indicated,the alj found that has fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease that her impairments were severe but did not equal or exceed a listed impairment and that she had the residual functional capacity to do sedentary work,involving six hours a day of sitting and two hours of standing or walking.the alj rejected the contrary opinion of treating physician,helfand,that her limitations were more severe.
the ssa recognizes a treating physician rule of deference to the views of the physician who has engaged in the primary treatment of the claimant.a treating physician statement that the claimant is disabled can not itself be determinative.snell apfel,cir.however,ssa regulations advise claimants that a treating source opinion on the issue s of the nature and severity of your impairment s will be given controlling weight if the opinion is well supported by medically acceptable clinica
