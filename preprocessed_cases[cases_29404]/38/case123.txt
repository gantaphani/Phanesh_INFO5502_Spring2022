appellee jo anne barnhart,commissioner of social security the commissioner petitions for a rehearing by the merits panel to reconsider its decision in butts barnhart,cir.familiarity with this decision is assumed.
the commissioner argues that the panel imposition of time limits for a decision on the remand of butts disability claim for further proceedings was error for three reasons i ordering a calculation of benefits in the event that the time limits are not met would violate and ordering the payment of benefits where a claimant has not been found disabled,see bush shalala,cir const.art.i,cl.appropriations clause lehman nakshian,d discussing united states sovereign immunity from suit absent consent ii the time limits were inappropriate because the panel did not expressly justify the limits by finding the delay in butts case unreasonable under heckler day,d and iii days is not sufficient time for the social security administration ssa to render a decision while complying with its own rules and regulations.we find all but the last of these arguments lacking in merit.in response to that argument,we extend the time limits to days.
a ordering a benefits calculation after exhaustion of time limits 
bush shalala,the appropriations clause,and the doctrine of sovereign immunity all permit the ordering of a benefits calculation in the present circumstances if the time limits are not met.
bush is clearly distinguishable from the present case.in bush,the disability claim had been pending in various courts for ten years,but the claimant had never proceeded beyond the fourth step of the inquiry followed by administrative law judges alj s,she had not shown that her impairment interfered with her capacity to perform her relevant past work.at.the claimant had thus not carried her burden of showing an inability to perform past relevant work at step four.simply put,she had never shown a disability.nevertheless,the district court,outrage d at the delay,remanded for calculation of benefits.id.at.we reversed,holding that absent a finding that the claimant was actually disabled,delay alone is an insufficient basis on which to remand for benefits.id.
butts case is quite different.here,we are reviewing an alj decision at step five,rather than step four,of the inquiry.at step five,the disability has been shown,and the burden shifts to the commissioner to prove that the claimant is capable of working.perez chater,cir curry apfel,cir.further,we are reviewing a decision in which the existence of appropriate work for the particular claimant in the national economy can not be determined solely from the grids,but must,if the claimant is to be denied benefits,be shown by the testimony of a vocational expert.at.the burden of producing such testimony rests on the commissioner.id.to be sure,our original opinion in this case noted that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that butts could perform sedentary and perhaps some light work,butts,at,but all we meant was that the medical evidence would have been sufficient to support a finding that butts was not disabled,but only if the commissioner had met her burden of presenting a vocational expert to testify that a person with butts attributes and qualifications could find sedentary or some light work.therefore,the opinion could also have we now do so the evidence at the fifth stage would compel a finding that butts was disabled absent the commissioner meeting her burden of making a contrary showing.
on the present record,therefore,butts has made his showing of disability,and the commissioner has failed to meet her burden of rebuttal.we deemed the district court decision to remand for further proceedings rather than a benefits calculation as not constituting an abuse of discretion only because,at her request,we allowed that the commissioner,who was not represented before the alj and to whom the alj owe d a duty to develop the record,a second chance to present evidence.however,on the present record,the ordering of a benefits calculation was hardly out of the question.after all,butts has proven his case,and the commissioner has run out of time to meet her step five burden.moreover,it was well within the power of the commissioner to fashion procedures that would have ensured that she sought to carry her burden on the first occasion that it fell upon her.
we part company with our dissenting colleague in several respects.in particular,our holding is limited to cases where the claimant is entitled to benefits absent the commissioner providing expert vocational testimony about the availability of appropriate jobs.unlike the dissent example of a piano tuner with a trivial hearing loss,butts ability to perform alternative substantial work in the national economy can not be determined solely from the grids,as explained in our first opinion see at.because,as the commissioner agrees,she has the burden of showing through the testimony of a vocational expert the existence of appropriate jobs for butts in the national economy,brief of appellee at,he is entitled to benefits as a matter of law absent such a showing.the problem of awarding benefits without supporting findings that so concerns the dissent is,therefore,illusionary in the present circumstances.
nor are we imposing,as suggested by the dissent,a penalty or sanction for bureaucratic delay,dissent at.the commissioner has asked us to exercise our discretion in her favor as to determining when the evidentiary record is to be deemed closed in this prolonged proceeding and to give her a second chance to offer testimony that she agrees should have been offered earlier and is required to foreclose a disability finding.we do no more than grant her the requested second chance with notice that the record will be deemed closed according to the temporal limits stated in this opinion.if the record is closed without such testimony,butts will then be entitled to benefits.
as noted,the remand gave the commissioner,at her request,a second chance,a generosity that the commissioner petition for rehearing has not allowed to go unpunished.were the option of a time limit not available,we would have deemed the remand to have been an abuse of discretion because of both the commissioner ability to have avoided the delay occasioned by the failure to produce rebuttal evidence and the purpose of congress that disability benefits be provided somewhat near the time they are needed.
for the same reasons that the remand is consistent with bush,it does not violate the appropriations clause or the doctrine of sovereign immunity.these allow,respectively,payment of money by the federal government only where authorized by statute,office of personnel management richmond,d,and suits for money only where the government has consented to such suit,lehman,at.if the commissioner fails to meet her burden within the time limits,butts showing of disability will be unrebutted,benefits are statutorily authorized,and the government has waived its immunity from suit for those benefits.
finally,the commissioner argues in a footnote that.e bars the remand because default judgments against the united states are forbidden except where the claimant establishes a claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court.petition at.again,if the commissioner does not meet the time limits,butts showing of disability will be factually unrebutted under the five step process,and butts will therefore have a right to relief.
b unreasonable delay 
heckler day reversed injunctive relief prescribing deadlines for department of health and human services disability claim adjudications in favor of a class of disability claimants.at.nevertheless,it noted that nothing in this opinion precludes the proper use of injunctive relief to remedy individual violations of b.id.at.emphasis in original.section b provides that after an adverse decision on a disability claim,a claimant is entitled to reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to such decision.b.we have interpreted footnote of day to mean that injunctive relief would still be an appropriate remedy for individual cases involving unreasonable delays.barnett bowen,cir
