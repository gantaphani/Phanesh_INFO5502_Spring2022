theodis nelms,sought social security disability benefits,but an administrative law judge determined that he can perform light work.on appeal nelms,who was without counsel before the alj,contends that the alj did not adequately develop the record in violation of his duty to unrepresented claimants.additionally,nelms argues that the alj ignored certain environmental restrictions when assessing nelms residual functional capacity.we agree with nelms that the record is inadequate and therefore remand for further proceedings before the agency.
background 
nelms applied for supplemental security income benefits in june.he listed as impairments pneumonia,recovery from surgery,and asthma.in his application nelms wrote,if i walk,lift or do anything too strenuous i get out of breath.after the social security administration twice denied his application,nelms requested a hearing.
nelms appeared at his hearing in june without counsel.after a few questions about nelms work history,the alj addressed the possibility of representation,explaining that i do give somebody credit just because they have an attorney still,the alj continued,the social security administration believes that having an attorney is a good idea.the alj explained the role of an attorney but also noted the alj independent duty to create a record 
i think the thinking must be that an attorney can talk to you,keep you company at the hearing,ask additional questions when i done,look over your file,see if it looks reasonably complete and so on.it looks pretty complete.you brought in additional information here and so on.we do much of that anyway.
after the alj described the costs typically associated with an attorney in the social security setting,nelms replied,i rather talk to you.
proceeding with the hearing,the alj asked nelms to rank his medical problems.nelms stated that his heart was the worst,followed by his back,his legs,and his asthma,in that order.regarding his heart nelms explained,i have shortness of the breath and,you know,that also happen s with asthma and plus they cut me open.i got a stent in my heart,you know.nelms described an inability to sleep at night because of severe pain,which he believes to be the onset of arthritis.nelms also reported that his doctor had prescribed methadone to alleviate the pain in his back and in his legs,although the medication was not helping that much.nelms testified,moreover,that he experiences soreness in his lower back a ll day every day,with a brief respite only immediately after taking the medication.as for his respiratory problems,nelms mentioned that his asthma strikes when he is near dust or pollen outside and when he is hot or cold.nevertheless,nelms exercises and walks every day per his doctor instructions,albeit with limitations.i can walk probably about a good two blocks before i really get messed up,nelms testified,but here lately,you know,since i been hurting,you know,i ca walk half a block.furthermore,nelms stated that since surgery he has done little odd jobs,including raking leaves and shoveling snow.nelms described his daily activities in each morning he cooks himself breakfast,cleans up,goes for a walk,does laundry,and,later,perhaps goes to the grocery store with his before cooking himself dinner.although nelms used to party a lot,he testified that his drinking is down to two or three beers each day and he is generally home by 
after approximately twenty minutes of questioning,the alj remarked,i ca think of anything else to ask.anything else i should know nelms clarified a few points about his education and work history,and with that the hearing ended.
medical evidence 
in may nelms was admitted to a hospital in milwaukee,wisconsin,after he was found unresponsive in his home.he was diagnosed with pneumonia,respiratory failure,overheating hyperthermia,inflammation of the heart endocarditis,delirium likely caused by alcohol withdrawal delirium tremens,an abnormally low concentration of sodium in the blood hyponatremia,and low blood pressure hypotension.during his hospital stay,nelms doctors replaced his mitral valve a heart valve with a mechanical substitute,and the surgery was a success.nelms was discharged from the hospital in june.
over the next four months nelms attended cardiopulmonary rehabilitation sessions,where he would walk on a treadmill,lift weights,and ride a stationary bicycle.the parties agree that nelms generally tolerated the exercises well.
in december patricia chan,a physician,assessed nelms residual functional capacity.chan opined that nelms could perform the lifting,sitting,and standing exertions associated with light work.
nelms was hospitalized again in march time for bleeding,and kidney failure renal insufficiency resulting from a mixture of alcohol and prescription anticoagulants.he was discharged one week later with instructions to abstain from alcohol and not to double dose.
five months later robert callear,another physician,assessed nelms residual functional capacity.like chan,callear concluded that nelms could perform the duties associated with light work.callear did note,however,that nelms should avoid concentrated exposure to fumes,odors,dust,gases,and poor ventilation.
from to nelms met with a number of other doctors,often to seek pain relief or for related to his surgery.of those visits,two appear to be significant.in april ijaz malik reported that nelms was not yet ready to return to work following several episodes of internal bleeding.and in may marcin turecki prescribed a stronger prescription pain medication when tylenol proved insufficient to treat nelms back pain.
the record is silent on nelms condition from to his hearing date with one report from nelms physician,pablo bozovich,dated april.bozovich wrote that nelms condition is stable with respect to his mitralvalve replacement.furthermore,bozovich noted,nelms suffers from mild spinal stenosis and chronic back pain,but his pain is controlled w oral medication,and his asthma is stable as well.
alj decision 
the alj began his written decision by acknowledging that nelms had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since his alleged onset date.still,the alj noted that nelms heart surgery went beautifully well,that his rehabilitation indicated a smooth recovery,and that his complaints of debilitating pain were sporadic.according to the alj,the medical record documented steady improvement since nelms hospitalization in 
the record paints a picture of a bad medical episode in the spring of,which lasted much less than a year.it also paints a picture of recovered capacity for work even with the continued substance abuse and paints a picture of a situation well within the scope of the light capacity vocational rules.it also shows strong causal contributions of substance abuse to the claimant reduced condition but not anything like a disabling condition even with the substance abuse.more than that,the record shows that,were the claimant not to drink and not to smoke,to follow a better diet,and to use his medicines as prescribed,his capacity might even approach full medium exertional levels.
the alj compared the favorable reports of chan and callear with the lesser capacity alleged by nelms but discounted nelms testimony because he is not very credible.nelms testimony regarding his symptoms was unconvincing and inconsistent,the alj wrote.according to the alj,nelms resistance to medical advice and his continued undermined his claim.
ultimately the alj agreed with nelms that his heart condition,his asthma,his alcohol abuse,and his back pain are severe these impairments do not,according to the alj,meet or otherwise equal a listed impairment.next the alj found that nelms can not perform any of his past relevant work,which was medium or greater in exertional demands and had other demands.but,the alj continued,nelms retains the residual functional capacity for a full range or nearly full range of light jobs and for some medium jobs at the exertionally lower end of the medium range.
the alj concluded that nelms asthma does not prevent him from light work because it is slight and not a significant environmental impairment.nelms listed his asthma as the
