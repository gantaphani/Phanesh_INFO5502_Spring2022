via christi regional medical center,via christi appeals the decision of the district court,which affirmed the denial of via christi request for reimbursement for medicare depreciation expenses by michael leavitt,the secretary of health and human services the secretary.via christi is the to joseph medical center,and via christi argues that the secretary must reimburse it for a million loss on the assets that it acquired as the surviving entity in a consolidation between joseph and francis regional medical center.the secretary and the district court denied via christi claim for reimbursement on two grounds first,the consolidation was between related parties under,and second,no bona fide sale occurred under f.we exercise jurisdiction under,and although we conclude that the secretary related party interpretation contradicts the plain language of,we affirm the secretary denial of reimbursement based on the bona fide sale requirement.
statutory and regulatory framework 
title xviii of the social security act,et,establishes the federally funded health insurance program for the aged and disabled,commonly known as medicare.the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms administers the medicare program on behalf of the secretary.in addition,the secretary contracts out medicare payment and audit functions to fiscal intermediaries,who initially determine whether and how much to reimburse a provider of services for treatment under medicare.see.if a provider is dissatisfied with the fiscal intermediary decision,then the provider may obtain a hearing with the provider reimbursement review board prrb.id.a.the cms administrator,at his or her discretion,may review any final decision of the prrb,a,and the cms administrator decision becomes the final decision of the secretary,see f.the provider may appeal an adverse decision in district court.see id.
under b a,t he amount paid to any provider of services for treatment under medicare is generally the reasonable cost of such services.the statute defines reasonable cost as 
the cost actually incurred,excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services,and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used,and the items to be included,in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions,agencies,and services 
the secretary has promulgated a number of regulations for determining the reasonable cost of provider services.among these is which addresses costs 
a general rule.costs and an allowance for return on equity are limited to the following 
net depreciation expense as determined under,and,adjusted by gains and losses realized from the disposal of depreciable assets under f.
more specifically,a allows reimbursement for depreciation on buildings and equipment used in the provision of patient care under this reimbursement system,providers determine the historical cost of the asset the cost incurred by the present owner in acquiring the asset,id.b and calculate the depreciation by prorat ing over the estimated useful life of the asset,usually using the method of depreciation.id.a.medicare reimburses the percentage of the depreciation attributable to the service of medicare beneficiaries.see id.a.thus,as the asset depreciates during its estimated useful life,its net book value the depreciable basis used for the medicare program less depreciation recognized under the medicare program,id.b decreases for medicare purposes.
recognizing that the depreciation reimbursements only approximate the actual decline in an asset value,f requires an adjustment for certain disposals of depreciable assets.the regulation provides 
if disposal of a depreciable asset results in a gain or loss,an adjustment is necessary in the provider allowable cost.the amount of a gain included in the determination of allowable cost is limited to the amount of depreciation previously included in medicare allowable costs.the amount of a loss to be included is limited to the undepreciated basis of the asset permitted under the program.the treatment of the gain or loss depends upon the manner of disposition of the asset,as specified in paragraphs f through of this section.
id.section f governs the gains and losses realized from the bona fide sale or scrapping of depreciable assets.if,in a bona fide sale,a provider receives consideration worth less than the asset net book value,the provider may claim a loss and receive reimbursement for medicare share of that loss.see id.f.on the other hand,if the provider receives consideration worth more than the asset net book value,the provider must reimburse medicare for medicare share of that gain.see id.also,if the provider sells multiple assets for a lump sum sale price,then f iv requires the provider to allocat e the lump sum sales price among all the assets sold,in accordance with the fair market value of each asset the ultimate result of f is that,if a gain or loss is realized from the disposition,reimbursement for depreciation is adjusted so that medicare pays the actual cost the provider incurred in using the asset for patient care.principles of reimbursement for provider costs and for services by physicians,
in the merger and consolidation context,l entitled transactions involving a provider capital stock supplies an additional layer of complexity.section l addresses statutory mergers,where two or more corporations combine under the corporation laws of the state,with one of the corporations surviving,and t he surviving corporation acquires the assets and liabilities of the merged corporation s by operation of state law.it provides 
i statutory merger between unrelated parties.if the statutory merger is between two or more corporations that are unrelated as specified in,the assets of the merged corporation s acquired by the surviving corporation may be revalued in accordance with paragraph g of this section.if the merged corporation was a provider before the merger,then it is subject to the provisions of paragraphs d and f of this section concerning recovery of accelerated depreciation and the realization of gains and losses 
ii statutory merger between related parties.if the statutory merger is between two or more related corporations as specified in,no revaluation of assets is permitted for those assets acquired by the surviving corporation 
id.section l addresses consolidations,the type of transaction at issue in the instant case.it defines a consolidation as the combination of two or more corporations resulting in the creation of a new corporate entity.id.in such situations,
i f at least one of the original corporations is a provider,the effect of a consolidation upon medicare reimbursement for the provider is as follows 
i consolidation between unrelated parties.if the consolidation is between two or more corporations that are unrelated as specified in,the assets of the provider corporation s may be revalued in accordance with paragraph g of this section.
ii consolidation between related parties.if the consolidation is between two or more related corporations as specified in,no revaluation of provider assets is permitted.
id.in contrast to l i,l i does not expressly state that the provider is subject to the provisions of paragraphs d and f of this section concerning recovery of accelerated depreciation and the realization of gains and losses.as we discuss below,however,the secretary has interpreted l i to include a similar authorization for consolidations.
both l and l draw a distinction depending upon whether the merger or consolidation,respectively,is between related or unrelated parties.also,both l and l refer to for additional clarification.section b defines related to the provider to mean that the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the organization furnishing the services,facilities,or supplies.in addition,b defines common ownership as exist ing if an individual or individuals possess significant ownership or equity in the provider and the institution or organization serving the provider.finally,under b,c ontrol exists if an individual or an organization has the power,directly or indirectly,significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.
the secretary promulgation and interpretation of 
in,the secretary issued the first regulations allowing for depreciation as an allowable cost and requiring that such calculations include g ains and losses realized from the disposal of depreciable assets.principles for reimbursable costs.in,amendments to those regulations permitted the revaluation of depreciable assets following a statutory merger between unrelated parties.see establishment of cost basis on purchase of facility as an ongoing operation,and transactions involving provider capital stock.those same amendments prohibited revaluation following any consolidation or a statutory merger between related parties.see id.in,further amendments established the consolidation provisions at issue in the instant litigation.principles of reimbursement for provider costs and for services by physicians.the secretary explained this rule also provides that assets may be revalued if two or more unrelated corporations consolidate to form a new corporation,but revaluation is not allowed if related corporations consolidate.id.at.other amendments in specified the treatment for certain types of disposals of depreciable assets,including bona fide sales.see principles of reimbursement for provider costs and for services by physicians.
in,congress added its own twist.in the deficit reduction act of,stat,congress amended v o ii to read such regulations shall provide for recapture of depreciation in the same manner as provided under the regulations in effect on june.
in,the secretary issued two documents interpreting the consolidation provision.first,in the medicare intermediary manual,roa vol.i,at,the secretary explained that medicare program policy permits a revaluation of assets affected by corporate consolidations between unrelated parties.in such situations,a to the seller and a revaluation of assets to the new provider are computed.id.second,in a letter dated may,hcfa director of the division of payment and reporting policy,william goeller,explained 
mergers and consolidations of nonstock,nonprofit providers may give rise to revaluations of assets adjustments to recognize realized gains and losses.notwithstanding the reference to capital stock in the caption of regulations section cfr l,we look to that regulation for authority in addressing mergers and consolidations of nonstock issuing corporations because the principles involved would be the same.if the transaction you have described meets the definition of either a statutory merger or consolidation as set forth in the regulations section,then a revaluation of assets an adjustment to recognize realized gains and losses may occur.
to determine whether a revaluation of assets or a adjustment will occur,we must turn to the question of whether the assets will be donated or whether any consideration will be exchanged for the assets 
i f the assets will be exchanged for consideration,a donation would not occur and the consideration given would be the acquisition cost of the assets to the new owner.in a situation where the corporation assumes liability for outstanding debt of the corporations,the assumed debt would be viewed as consideration given.thus,in a merger or consolidation of nonstock,nonprofit corporations in which the surviving or new corporation assumes debt of the merged or consolidated corporations,an adjustment to recognize any gain or loss to the corporations would be required in accordance with regulations section cfr f 
letter from william goeller,roa,vol.i,at.
a memorandum dated january,from the acting director of the bureau of eligibility,reimbursement and coverage,explained that f bona fide sale requirement means simply that the parties to the sale are not related within the meaning of regulations section cfr and prm section,memorandum,roa,vol.i,at.in a letter dated june,a consultant from coopers lybrand asked bruce oliver,a health insurance specialist with the hcfa,for input as to the proper reimbursement implications regarding a proposed hospital consolidation involving two medicare program participating providers.letter from coopers lybrand,roa,vol.i,at.at the heart of this inquiry was the question of whether the related party determination was based upon the relationship of the parties before or after the consolidation.the letter described the transaction as follows 
the proposed transaction would involve the consolidation of two unrelated hospitals to form a new corporate provider entity.the hospitals are not related parties within the meaning of cfr and.both organizations are private corporations governed by separate boards of directors.there are no common board members between the two organizations,and no common ownership or relationship currently exists.for confidentiality purposes,we will refer to the current organizations as hospital a and hospital b,and the new provider entity to be established as hospital c 
hospital a and hospital b are clearly unrelated parties prior to the proposed consolidation.however,hospital c,the proposed new corporate provider entity,will be governed by a board of directors made up of six members from the existing governing board of hospital a,and six members from the existing governing board of hospital accordingly,hospital c may be considered to be related to hospitals a to answer the question as to whether the related party determination is made based on the relationship of the parties before or after the consolidation,we have referred to the intermediary manual section.the example given states only that the two corporations were unrelated prior to consolidation.the example concludes that the consolidation between parties unrelated prior to the consolidation constituted a change of ownership for medicare reimbursement purposes with a to the original provider corporation s and a revaluation of the acquired assets to the new corporate provider entity computed.
each party to the consolidation prior to the consolidation are unrelated and therefore the consolidation acquisition is bona fide 
id.at.on august,charles booth,the director of the office of payment policy,responded to the inquiry w e agree,based on our understanding of the transaction,that it appears to be a consolidation as defined in l i requiring a determination of gain or loss under f letter from charles booth,roa,vol.i,at.
on april,the same consultant,coopers lybrand,while advising the providers in the instant case met with bruce oliver at the central office of the hcfa.oliver did not agree with the letter from charles booth.rather,oliver believed that the related party determination required comparing hospital c board of directors with the boards of directors of hospitals a and b.if the board of directors of hospital a or b had significant influence or control over hospital c,then he considered hospital a or b to be related to hospital c.he did not quantify what percentage of the board of hospital c would have to come from the board of hospitals a or b before hospitals a or b would be viewed as related to hospital c,but he speculated that if of the board of hospital c had the board of hospital a or b as its source,then that would suffice.
around the same time,the hcfa became increasingly concerned about the rising number of claims for reimbursement following chow transactions.in october,it established a chow workgroup to r eview existing regulations and program manual provisions regarding proper treatment of change of ownership transactions to determine appropriate medicare reimbursement.letter from arlen mieras,roa,vol.i,at.in november,an associate regional administrator in the boston regional office requested advice from hcfa director of the bureau of policy development,regarding whether the agency could deny a claim for reimbursement where the board members of two consolidating hospitals essentially the same as the board members of the new entity,memorandum,roa,vol.i,at.in march,the director of the division of payment and reporting policy responded,agreeing that the facts and circumstances would support a finding of relatedness on the basis that the board of the consolidated entity is comprised of a significant number of members of the boards of the entities,and as a result,medicare would not reimburse the consolidated entity for the alleged loss on the depreciable assets it had acquired.letter from stephanie crowley,roa,vol.i,at.at the end of the correspondence,the director agreed with the recommendation to revise the regulations and manual instructions to include additional instructions regarding consolidations and mergers,but until that could be done,the hcfa was notifying all regions by copy of this memorandum.id.at.
on september,the chow workgroup completed its analysis and recommended several changes to the provider reimbursement manual.specifically,the workgroup recommended adding the following language where a consolidation occurs that involves a continuity of control between the nonsurviving entities and the new,consolidated entity,the consolidation would be deemed to be between related parties.chow workgroup draft,roa,vol.i,at.in addition,it recommended defining bona fide sale in the as follows a bona fide sale contemplates an arm length transaction between a willing and well informed buyer and seller,neither being under coercion,for reasonable consideration.an arm length transaction is a transaction negotiated by unrelated parties,each acting in its own self interest.id.at.
in june,the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services released a report showing that medicare payments for depreciation adjustment losses had increased considerably since.see dep t of health human,oig,medicare losses on hospital sales june,available at.the oig recommended proposing legislation to eliminate the requirement that medicare make adjustments for gains or losses when hospitals undergo changes of ownership,and the hcfa concurred.id.at the oig also noted that the medicare program transition to a depreciation reimbursement system had effectively allowed some providers,after a change of ownership,to obtain duplicate reimbursement for certain depreciation expenses.see id.at 
finally,the hcfa issued program memorandum pm,available at,in october,purporting to clarify the treatment of mergers and consolidations of providers.it explained that the merger or consolidation must occur between or among parties that are not related as described in the regulations at cfr and the transaction must involve one of the events described in cfr f as triggering a gain or loss recognition by medicare id.at.pm then noted that,because of the differences between and providers,certain special considerations must be regarded in applying l to mergers and consolidations.id.at.it explained 
in applying the related organizations principle at cfr,consideration must be given to whether the composition of the new board of directors,or other governing body or management team,includes significant representation from the previous board s or management team s.if that is the case,no real change of control of the assets has occurred and no gain or loss may be recognized as a result of the transaction.the fact that the parties are unrelated before the transaction does not bar a related organizations finding as a result of the transaction.
id.pm also addressed the bona fide sale requirement 
n o gain or loss may be recognized for medicare payment purposes unless the transfer of the assets resulted from a bona fide sale as required by regulation f the regulations at cfr l do not permit recognition of a gain or loss resulting from the mere combining of multiple entities assets and liabilities without regard to whether a bona fide sale occurred 
f or medicare payment purposes,a recognizable gain or loss resulting from a sale of depreciable assets arises after an arm slength business transaction between a willing and buyer and seller.an arm length transaction is a transaction negotiated by unrelated parties,each acting in its own self interest in which objective value is defined after selfish bargaining 
as with entities,in evaluating whether a bona fide sale has occurred in the context of a merger or consolidation between or among entities,a comparison of the sales price with the fair market value of the assets acquired is a required aspect of such analysis.as set forth in prm,reasonable consideration is a required element of a bona fide sale.thus,a large disparity between the sales price consideration and the fair market value of the assets sold indicates the lack of a bona fide sale.
id.at.moreover,b ecause the sales price assumed liabilities is allocated first to the cash,cash equivalents,and other current assets,a transaction where the sale price is less than the value of the current assets is not a bona fide sale.id.at example.because the pm claimed not to include any new policies,it stated that it would apply to all cost reports for which a final notice of program reimbursement has not been issued.id.at.
the consolidation between joseph and francis 
the basic facts of the underlying transaction are not in dispute.prior to the consolidation at issue,joseph was a corporation operating a acute care hospital in wichita,kansas.joseph sole member was csj health system of wichita,csj,and csj appointed the members of the board that governed joseph.csj sole member and religious sponsor was the sisters of joseph of wichita sisters of joseph,a religious order affiliated with the catholic church.
francis was also a,operating an hospital in wichita.its structure was similar to joseph it had a single parent and francis ministry sponsor was the sisters of the sorrowful mother,another religious order affiliated with the catholic church.the only other major hospital in wichita was the hca wesley medical center.
prior to the consolidation,joseph viability was in question.the primary insurer in the area,blue cross blue shield of kansas,blue cross,intended to contract with only two of the three hospitals,and the rise of managed care was creating some financial pressure for joseph.accordingly,joseph decided to attempt a consolidation,and it chose francis as its logical partner because of their shared affiliation with the catholic church,the potential for synergies,and the worry that a merger with the hca wesley medical center could create antitrust problems.at some point prior to the consolidation,joseph became aware that a medicare loss might result,but the potential of showing a medicare loss was not a consideration in the decision to consolidate.the benefit of such a loss,moreover,would go to the new,consolidated entity.joseph was not looking to get the full value for its assets,but rather to make a good decision for the advancement of its ministry.the principals of joseph did not approach any other entity about a consolidation,and they rejected the idea of putting joseph up for sale.they determined that such a sale would not have fulfilled their desire to perpetuate catholic health care ministry in the community.
on september,joseph and francis executed a master plan of consolidation,and the consolidation became effective on october.prior to the consolidation,joseph and francis were not subject to common ownership or common control.after consolidation,the two organizations ceased to exist,and the new entity,via christi,assumed both corporations assets and liabilities.see.stat.ann.in addition,the master plan of consolidation provided that the board of directors of via christi medical center,will include representatives of joseph and francis to insure the continuation of the existing commonalty of interest.master plan of consolidation,roa,vol.i,at.ultimately,seven members of joseph old board became members of via christi new board,as did six members of francis old board.a nominating committee,organized jointly by the sponsors of joseph and francis,nominated the remaining ten members of the board.three officers of joseph continued in their same capacities as officers of via christi.one day after the consolidation,joseph sole with francis sole.francis ministry form via christi health system.the two religious sisters of joseph and the sisters of the sorrowful as joint sponsors of via christi health system.
procedural background 
via christi submitted a medicare cost report for the accounting year ending on september.according to the report,joseph possessed assets with a total book value of million,which included million in current assets.via christi assumed joseph liabilities,which totaled million,resulting in a total book loss to joseph of slightly under million.of this million in consideration that joseph received for the consolidation the assumed liabilities,joseph assigned million to its property,plant,and equipment.of the million,joseph assigned million to assets for which medicare recognized depreciation.the medicare book value of those assets was million,resulting in a loss of million on those assets alone.via christi,the to joseph,sought reimbursement for medicare share of the loss,approximately million.this million is the sum at issue in the instant case.
medicare fiscal intermediary,blue cross,denied the claim because the transaction was among related organizations.joseph sought review before the prrb,arguing that blue cross disallowed its claim based upon medicare policies developed after the consolidation.joseph also contended that the alleged continuity of control by joseph of the newly formed via christi was an inappropriate consideration under the medicare regulations and policies in effect at the time,and even if it was an appropriate consideration,joseph did not control via christi.finally,joseph argued that the bona fide sale requirement did not apply to consolidations,and even if it did,the parties to the consolidation had satisfied the requirement.
the prrb concluded that the regulations required recognition of the loss.it held that the plain language of l was crystal clear that the related party concept will be applied to the entities that are consolidating,rather than the resulting entity.prrb decision,roa,vol.ii,at.as additional support,the prrb cited several of the written interpretations detailed supra,including the agency comments in the federal register,interpretive guidelines in the medicare intermediary manual,and written interpretations from agency officials.the prrb also found that the consolidation transaction was bona fide and that any attempt to impose additional requirements is not supported by the plain meaning of the consolidation regulation and the agency own previous interpretation set forth in the manual instructions and informal written advice.id.at.
the cms administrator reversed the prrb.the administrator held that the related organization concept appropriately included an inquiry into continuity of control between the consolidating entities and the new entity,and as support,the administrator cited hcfa ruling,medical center of independence harris,cir,and pm.cms decision,roa,vol.ii,at.the administrator also cited the medicare intermediary manual,as well as gaap accounting principles bulletin,as support for not revaluing assets where a reorganization,or pooling,of assets has occurred,rather than a purchase of those assets by new ownership.id.at.the administrator noted that a similar rule applies under irs rules,where a consolidation that is,in effect,a reorganization results in of gains and losses.id.at.
the administrator then found that the transaction involved a related party transaction because of the relationship between joseph and the consolidated hospital.id.at.as support,the administrator noted sisters of joseph was one of two voting members of the new parent corporation of the hospital sisters of joseph had percent voting powers of the combined assets of two hospital s,which the administrator finds comparable to its powers a significant number of the members of joseph governing board were appointed to the new governing board and joseph and its sponsor retained and continued to have a significant control of its asset.id.at.as a result,the administrator found compelling evidence on the relatedness of joseph and the consolidated hospital,and concluded that the parties were related according to cfr and a loss on the disposal of assets can not be recognized under medicare.id.at.
the administrator also held that,before cms would recognize a loss,the transaction must qualify as a bona fide sale under f.id.at.in this case,the transfer of the assets did not constitute a bona fide sale and joseph failed to met sic any other criteria under which a loss on the disposal of assets will be recognized at f.id.the administrator explained that there is no evidence in the record of arm length bargaining,nor an attempt to maximize any sale price as would be expected in an arms length transaction.id.in addition,the administrator found that the consideration received for the depreciable assets supports a finding that the transaction did not constitute a bona fide sale.id.
the district court agreed with the reasoning of the cms administrator and affirmed the secretary decision.
on appeal,we review the decision of the district court de novo.mark charities liquidating trust shalala,cir.as for the secretary decision,the administrative procedure act apa,et,provides the applicable standard of review.see f under the apa,we may set aside agency action only if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law.mark charities liquidating trust,at quoting a.the apa require s agencies,on pain of being found to have acted arbitrarily and capriciously,to comply with their own regulations.cherokee nation of norton,cir citations,internal quotation marks,and alterations omitted.also,under the apa,e,we will set aside an agency action unless it is supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.pennaco energy,dep t of the interior,cir.in this context,substantial evidence is something more than a mere scintilla but something less than the weight of the evidence.id.citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
different types of agency pronouncements are entitled to different degrees of deference.newton faa,cir.in reviewing the validity of an agency regulation interpreting a statute,courts rely upon the familiar framework announced in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.under this framework,unless a regulation contravenes the unambiguously expressed intent of congress,id.at,we ordinarily defer to an agency interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it implements,newton,at.in contrast,statutory i nterpretations such as those in opinion interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference.christensen harris county,d.such interpretations are entitled to respect,but only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade.id.quoting skidmore swift.
informal interpretations,however,do merit deference where they interpret an ambiguous regulation.id.at.newton,at holding that,insofar as an agency handbook is interpreting the statute it is entitled to deference to the extent it is persuasive,and it is entitled to great deference insofar as it is interpreting the agency own regulations citations omitted.as the supreme court has explained,
w e must give substantial deference to an agency interpretation of its own regulations.our task is not to decide which among several competing interpretations best serves the regulatory purpose.rather,the agency interpretation must be given controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.in other words,we must defer to the secretary interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.this broad deference is all the more warranted when,as here,the regulation concerns a complex and highly technical regulatory program,in which the identification and classification of relevant criteria necessarily require significant expertise and entail the exercise of judgment grounded in policy concerns.
thomas jefferson shalala,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the related parties inquiry 
the first issue is whether the secretary properly applied the continuity of control doctrine to conclude that the parties to the consolidation were related under l although this is a close issue,we conclude that the plain language of the regulations precludes the secretary interpretation.
we must be careful not to disrupt the plain language of the regulation itself.utah envtl.cong.bosworth,cir.generally,w e afford an agency interpretation of its own regulations substantial deference,except in those instances where such interpretation is unreasonable,plainly erroneous,or inconsistent with the regulation plain meaning.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.here,l ii prohibits revaluation of provider assets i f the consolidation is between two or more related corporations as specified in.the plain language of this provision,as well as the plain language of l i,indicates that the related parties inquiry of l focuses solely on whether the parties to the consolidation were related prior to the on whether they were related to the newly created entity.where the plain language of a regulation is clear,w e can not torture the language to reach the result the agency wishes.aspenwood inv.martinez,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the agency,after all,could easily have drafted language to achieve the result which it now advocates but did not do so.id.if the secretary wants to take a position that is inconsistent with existing regulations,then the secretary must promulgate new regulations under the provisions of the apa.shalala guernsey mem l,d.
moreover,l plain language comports with the secretary intent at the time of the section promulgation.for instance,in,when first promulgating the regulation,the secretary explained that assets may be revalued if two or more unrelated corporations consolidate to form a new corporation,but revaluation is not allowed if related corporations consolidate.at.also,the medicare intermediary manual,the letter from william goeller,and the letter from charles booth all contained this same interpretation.as the supreme court explained in thomas jefferson university,at,we must defer to the secretary interpretation unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.here,both the plain language and the indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation preclude the secretary current interpretation of l.francis and joseph were unrelated parties prior to the consolidation,and under the plain language of l,the secretary related party determination was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by substantial evidence.
we recognize that the district court reached the opposite conclusion,as did the eastern district of only other district court to consider this question expressly.see jeanes hosp.leavitt,d,while the plain meaning of,if read in a vacuum,may seemingly limit the analysis to the transacting parties,in fact,is incorporated with,and must be read in conjunction with.thus,the court finds the administrator interpretation of the regulation reasonable.like the prrb,however,we refuse to torture the language to reach the result the agency wishes.aspenwood inv,at.
the secretary can not save his interpretation by reference to.sections l i and l ii do refer to,but only for clarification as to when the two consolidating corporations are related.see l ii if the consolidation is between two or more related corporations as specified in,no revaluation of provider assets is permitted.section is certainly relevant,but under the plain language of l,it does not stretch as far as the secretary contends.
the secretary also cites two sources from the as support for his continuity of control interpretation hcfa ruling and medical center of independence harris,cir.these authorities involved lease and management arrangements between two entities,where the two entities became related after they signed the initial contract.neither of them addressed consolidations,and the secretary reliance upon them appears unfounded.likewise,although monsour medical center heckler,cir provides some support for analyzing control both before and after a transaction,the court in monsour was not addressing a consolidation or the regulations at issue.especially in light of his early interpretive materials,the secretary claim that the agency has consistently addressed consolidations under a continuity of control standard is questionable at if the secretary has arguably applied something similar in other contexts.in any event,the plain language of the regulations,as well as the indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation,thomas jefferson,at,preclude the secretary current continuity of control interpretation.
the bona fide sale requirement 
we agree with the secretary that,in order for consolidating medicare providers to obtain reimbursement for a depreciation adjustment,the consolidation must meet the bona fide sale requirements of f.as with the related parties determination,the secretary interpretation of the regulations here is controlling unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,and we must defer to it unless an alternative reading is compelled by the regulation plain language or by other indications of the secretary intent at the time of the regulation promulgation.thomas jefferson,at.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the bona fide sale requirement is a reasonable construction of l i,supported by the text of the regulations.section f is the only section expressly permitting depreciation adjustments and defining the exact circumstances under which a provider can seek such an adjustment.several other sections refer to it directly for this purpose.for instance,alludes to f for determining any depreciation adjustments under the regulations costs and an allowance for return on equity are limited to the following net depreciation expense as determined under,and,adjusted by gains and losses realized from the disposal of depreciable assets under f.a emphasis added.likewise,l i references f as concerning recovery of accelerated depreciation and the realization of gains and losses in the statutory merger context.if the secretary is going to construe l i as permitting depreciation adjustments for consolidations then the secretary is perfectly reasonable in maintaining consistency and only allowing depreciation adjustments that comply with f.joseph construction,in contrast,would make depreciation adjustments easier for providers attempting consolidations than for providers undergoing asset sales or statutory strange result,to say the least.
compliance with f is also consistent with interpretive materials that the secretary issued both before and after the consolidation in the instant case.for instance,the letter from william goeller stated that,in the nonprofit consolidation context,an adjustment to recognize any gain or loss to the corporations would be required in accordance with regulations section cfr f.letter from william goeller emphasis added.other interpretive materials likewise refer to f explicitly.see letter from charles booth pm.
of the disposals of depreciable assets listed in f,the only one that would apply here is the bona fide sale of f,and the secretary has reasonably interpreted it as applying in this case.the secretary originally provided for depreciation adjustments under f because the yearly reasonable cost depreciation reimbursements only approximated economic reality.see.at.in theory,at least,a bona fide sale under f provided an objective measurement of an asset worth,allowing both the secretary and the provider to calculate the actual depreciation incurred to that meriting an adjustment to previous depreciation payments.see id.even if a consolidation or statutory merger is not a sale per se,treating it as a sale pursuant to f ensures that any depreciation adjustment will represent economic reality,rather than mere paper losses.
additionally,the secretary definition of a bona fide sale in this c
