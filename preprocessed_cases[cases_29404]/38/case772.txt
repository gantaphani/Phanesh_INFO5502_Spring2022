hutsell has been diagnosed with various chronic disorders,including schizoaffective disorder,bipolar type her intellectual functioning is borderline she takes several different medications,including antipsychotic drugs,and frequently reports to her primary treating physician,mark baltz,for medication checks and adjustment.in,psychologist william wilkins concluded that hutsell condition could evolve into a reasonably short term frank psychosis if confronted with stress but that with medication and a environment hutsell would likely continue to do well.in,joseph crupie observed that hutsell prognosis for a recurrent schizophrenic episode is good.no doctors have noted any evidence of malingering or exaggeration.
on a daily basis,with medication,hutsell symptoms include depression,memory loss,and confusion.hutsell suffers from periods of depression and from shaky spells two or three times a week.side effects from her medication include drowsiness and occasional loss of balance.hutsell generally rises early and makes breakfast for herself and her daughter.during the day,hutsell cooks,cleans,does laundry,and sometimes visits friends or socializes at the local senior citizen center.her housework is occasionally unfinished because she forgets what she is doing.she watches a few hours of television,reads the newspaper,and listens to the radio for a few hours.hutsell drives only in town and shops for groceries but she often must make several trips because of her memory problems.her sometimes shops for her.
several consulting doctors have addressed hutsell impairments in the context of her capacity for activities.in,gerald fowler,a psychiatrist,observed that hutsell could not understand and remember simple primarily oral instructions six hours per day five days per week and o nly a blood relative or close family friend could tolerate hutsell episodes of confusion,concluding that r epeat hospitalization would probably be precipitated by the stress of increased expectations of her such as she would experience with any job.also in,consulting psychologist stephen harris diagnosed hutsell borderline intellectual functioning and concluded that hutsell was seriously limited,but not precluded in the majority of skills listed on his assessment form.he rated her ability to deal with work stresses and maintain concentration and attention as both fair and poor to none,which means n o useful ability to function in this area.in september of,paul loop,a psychiatrist,concluded that hutsell is markedly limited in many areas relating to adaptation,and concentration and persistence,and moderately limited in several areas of social interaction,and understanding and memory.loop concluded that w hile she has responded favorably to neuroleptic antipsychotic drug use,she is still significantly impaired and would have great difficulty obtaining and maintaining gainful employment.
hutsell past relevant work experience includes that of a cook and a cook helper.hutsell stated that when she worked,her primary employer let her leave work and take time off when necessary.hutsell work history shows that her income declined in and.she earned in and in,which is about less than the year before.since her discharge from the hospital,hutsell has not engaged in employment.hutsell has,however,worked as a temporary or employee,although the number of hours that she has worked are minimal.she had no reported income in,or,in,and in,when she worked as a temporary fill in dishwasher.
on august,hutsell filed an application for disability benefits,alleging an onset date of october.hutsell asserts that she is unable to work because of a nervous breakdown and mental problems.the social security administration denied hutsell application initially and again on reconsideration.hutsell then requested and received a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the alj denied benefits in,and hutsell appealed the decision to the appeals council,which remanded the case.in,an alj again denied hutsell benefits,and again the appeals council remanded.
after a third hearing,an alj issued an opinion on may,again denying benefits.the alj evaluated hutsell claim according to the sequential analysis prescribed by the social security regulations.see a f see also bowen yuckert,d describing analysis.at the first three steps of the analysis,the alj found that hutsell had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since her onset date that she suffered from chronic schizophrenia disorder,controlled with medication possible bipolar disorder,controlled with medication and borderline intellectual functioning and that she had severe impairments that did not meet or equal a listed impairment.
although the alj completed a psychiatric review technique form prtf,the determination of hutsell residual functional capacity was based not on the updated medical evidence but on the alj decision,which found hutsell to be only slightly impaired because the longitudinal record establishes that the claimant has function ed well despite many types of stresses related to family illness,family death,death of friends,adjudication hearings in this matter,illness of an adult child,and adolescent sic of a dependent child at the fourth step of analysis,the alj determined that hutsell has the capacity for work other than that which involves highly complex tasks requiring abstract thinking or close interpersonal contact.the alj subsequently concluded that hutsell could return to her past work as a cook or cook helper and denied her claim for benefits.
hutsell again appealed.this time,the appeals council denied her request for further review.accordingly,the alj judgment became the final decision of the commissioner.hutsell then sought review in the district court,which granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner.hutsell now appeals,arguing that the alj functional capacity determination is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.she also contends that the alj erred in determining that she could return to her past relevant work.at oral argument,hutsell counsel added that the case should be remanded pursuant to our recently issued opinion in lauer apfel,cir.
our role is to determine whether the commissioner findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.prosch apfel,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but is enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the commissioner conclusion.id.in determining whether existing evidence is substantial,we consider evidence that detracts from the commissioner decision as well as evidence that supports it.craig apfel,cir.as long as there is substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the commissioner decision,we may not reverse it because substantial evidence exists in the record that would have supported a contrary outcome,or because we would have decided the case differently,browning sullivan,cir.
