opinion of the court 
on august,geoffrey walton filed an application for child disability insurance benefits under the social security act based on his deceased father employment record.walton alleged an onset date of disability of june,the day before his birthday.appellee kenneth apfel,commissioner of social security the commissioner,denied the application.walton then filed the present action in the district court which granted the commissioner motion for summary judgment.walton appeals.
section g of title of the united states code authorizes appeals from final decisions rendered by the commissioner within sixty days after the mailing to the applicant of notice of such decision or within such further time as the commissioner of social security may allow.shortly before oral argument the commissioner moved to dismiss this appeal on the ground that walton resort to the district court was untimely,and it,therefore,lacked jurisdiction.t he requirement is not jurisdictional,however,and constitutes only a period of limitations.bowen city of new york,d.defenses based on limitations can be waived.because the commissioner failed to brief this issue on appeal,the issue is waived.see id.
walton claims that he is entitled to benefits based on his mental illness,bipolar depression.in order to receive benefits,walton must show,among other things,that he has a disability which began prior to his birthday.see.a disability is the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.a.to meet this definition,claimants must have a severe impairment,which makes them unable to do their previous work or any other substantial gainful activity which exists in the national economy.id.
walton,who is presently disabled and receiving supplemental security income disability benefits,has a long history of suicide attempts,hospitalization,and treatments by a series of psychiatrists.he was first diagnosed as having depression in when he was years of age,and the contemporaneous medical records from the period after that date are extensive.while the contemporary medical records from the preceding period are considerably more limited,they do bear evidence that walton mental impairment originated prior to.the alj was thus confronted in with the difficult task of determining whether walton progressive mental impairment rose to the level of a disability prior to his birthday on june.
walton testified that he attended trinity college in connecticut from until june of,when he was asked to leave and withdrew.he returned to trinity in,but again found himself on academic probation in february,when he again withdrew.after dropping out the first time,walton saw a psychiatrist,howard wood,weekly.walton had his first manic experience in the summer of and saw a psychiatrist once a week for six months during that year.his first suicide attempt came in,and he saw wood again that year for approximately six months.
by,wood was no longer in practice and had not retained records relating to his observations of walton.the only contemporaneous written record available from the early sixties is a letter from charles schober,whom walton consulted in for emotional problems.schober wrote to walton draft board on august,in support of an application for a deferment.he there reported that walton has periods of apathy and depression coupled with a tendency to rebel seriously which inhibits his performance and productivity.record.in schober opinion,these problems would hamper his performance in the military service.id.
at the hearing,the alj listened to walton account of the progression of his illness and solicited the reaction to that account of morris rubin,a psychologist and vocational expert the alj recognized that some mental disorders,including the sort from which walton suffers,take time to recognize and diagnose.he also noted that,while it seemed clear that walton suffered from a mental impairment rising to the level of disability at some point in his life,the timing of the disability onset was uncertain 
alj the picture rubin,after gets clear,i think.
morris rubin yes,much clearer.
alj because there a hospitalization which is used.all with clear information.and then six hospitalizations follow.and the period before course,a lot of this is just a problem of documentation that occurs due to passage of time plus as you mentioned to rubin,i believe,or walton did is that there a sort of reluctance of diagnoses in this type of thing until after a period of time has passed.
alj so this is not an unusual pattern we seeing here.
rubin not an unusual pattern.
alj but it still leaves me with the problem of drawing a line at a particular point.it obviously was not before age.
alj u nfortunately,walton has had a problem since a ge,which is very significant and is very clear in the present and we right at that point in time where i have to make a decision as to where to draw the line.somewhere between and,i would think,or,or,or in.and it an unusual case in that the line seems to hover very close around that point in time it a think this is a difficult line for me to draw.
record emphasis added.
the alj personally elicited rubin opinion on the onset issue.rubin opined that walton suicide attempt was an expression of the severity of walton impairment at that time.rubin further regarded it as likely that walton was unable to work on a continuing basis after the age of fourteen 
alj rubin,want sic to volunteer anything here i think it a fuzzy,fuzzy period that year or two in there.
rubin it hard to explain,your honor.but if we liken it,if i may say,expressed in feeling,if i can liken his educational experiences from years of age up,certainly if we turn it into some sort of employment,he would be able to hold positions for any length of time,but we have the mood swings.he would run into difficulty.but it difficult to say whether he would be an employable constantly.
a s it shown here,in my opinion,he would have a lot of difficulty holdings sic jobs for long periods of time or reasonable periods of time for the satisfaction of an employer.probably get fired a lot of times or even quit.got in a mood,he would quit.
in addition to contemporaneous medical records,walton tendered letters authored in the early nineties by doctors who had treated him at various times in the past howard wood henry cornman,iii john goppelt and robert gibbon.wood reported that he treated walton when he dropped out of college but did not remember his diagnosis i do remember exactly what my diagnosis was,but i do believe i recognized him as.he seemed to be a disturbed adolescent.i have had several patients whose bipolar picture only became evident after a period of years.record.cornman reported that during high school walton became withdrawn,isolated and lost interest in everything.record.he also reported that walton parents had provided his support all of his life and that he,cornman,could confirm that walton was disabled before his birthday.id.goppelt opined 
in my opinion the psychiatric diagnosis in geoffrey case is incomplete unless it includes personality disorders,which geoffrey never mentions.he shows elements of the histrionic disorder and the disorder,along with a bipolar disorder which has responded poorly to treatment,in part because geoffrey has often not cooperated with his treatment.
in his report,gibbon states that by virtue of his mental condition,walton has not been sustainably employable in the open job market and that i n the first fifteen years out of high school,he held about half a dozen jobs,typically for three months.record.
in his decision,the alj found wood letter significant only because it reflected,in the alj view,that walton had been seen not for manic depression but for adolescent disturbance.record.the alj dismissed cornman as not a professional treating source and gibbon report as clearly based upon information provided by walton and not upon gibbon own observation of walton prior to his birthday.id.the alj
