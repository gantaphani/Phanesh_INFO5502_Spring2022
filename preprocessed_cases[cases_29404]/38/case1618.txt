appellant california department of justice doj appeals from a judgment in favor of respondents angelita resendez and board of administration of california public employees retirement system calpers in this action concerning reinstatement to a peace officer position following disability retirement on appeal,it is undisputed that resendez is no longer incapacitated for duty based on the orthopedic condition that led to her disability retirement.doj contends in determining whether resendez was still physically or mentally incapacitated for duty,calpers should have verified resendez was not suffering from any other condition that would prevent her from meeting the minimum standards for peace officers set forth in government code section doj does not have a mandatory duty under section to reinstate an employee that calpers determines is no longer incapacitated and doj may condition an offer of reinstatement under section on compliance with the standards of section.we conclude calpers properly made its reinstatement determination based on the condition for which resendez received disability retirement,doj has a mandatory duty to reinstate resendez after calpers concludes she is no longer incapacitated,and doj may not require resendez to comply with conditions prior to reinstatement.we affirm.
