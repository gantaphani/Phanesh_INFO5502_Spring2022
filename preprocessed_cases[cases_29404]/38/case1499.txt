background 
szemraj served in the united states navy from april,to april.in november of szemraj was diagnosed with depression by an examiner at a va medical facility.from december,through january,szemraj was hospitalized at a va medical center where he was treated for disorder and mixed personality disorder.szemraj was again hospitalized and diagnosed as suffering from these disorders and atypical depression in march and april of.in august of a psychology student intern noted that szemraj had exhibited schizophrenic symptoms and suggested evaluation for paranoid schizophrenia.
in january szemraj filed a claim for disability compensation for a nervous compulsive disorder.at.the va regional office ro denied this claim on april,and found no service connection because disorder is considered to be a constitutional or developmental abnormality,rather than a condition resulting from military service.at.subsequently,szemraj filed a notice of disagreement requesting further evaluation by a board of three certified psychiatrists to determine a diagnosis.at.the ro responded by issuing a statement of the case soc dated august.in the soc the ro responded by acknowledging that provides for a presumption of service connection for psychosis diagnosed within one year of leaving the service.however,the ro explained that its decision was proper because there was no evidence of any psychosis diagnosed within the presumptive period following service discharge,and szemraj symptoms were consistent with a preexisting nervous condition not a psychosis that was not aggravated by service.at.
on august,after holding an evidentiary hearing,the bva denied szemraj claim.in re szemraj,the decision.the bva stated that szemraj allegations pertain ed essentially to inservice aggravation of a preexisting disorder and to continuity of a chronic disorder with onset during active duty.at.the bva,however,found no evidence of symptoms or a diagnosis of any psychotic disorder during szemraj service period and noted that the veteran acquired neurosis did not develop until several months after leaving the service.specifically,the bva found that 
t he objective evidence clearly reveals that the onset of the veteran acquired neurosis was several months following service separation.no useful purpose would be served by an examination by a board of three psychiatrists.the available evidence is ample and consistently confirms diagnoses including an disorder and atypical depression.no complaints,findings,or diagnoses pertaining to a psychotic disorder have been reported.mere comment by a student psychology intern during august that,in his opinion,the veteran demonstrated characteristics of paranoid schizophrenia,is insufficient upon which to remand the case for additional verification of existing diagnoses.
approximately ten years later in a letter dated april,szemraj requested that the bva review its august decision for cue.among other things,szemraj argued that the bva in failed to apply the presumption of service connection provided by and.on april,the bva rejected szemraj cue claim.in re szemraj,the decision.the bva noted that this presumption applied only to psychoses and that while the record contained evidence of acquired neuroses,depression and obsessive compulsive disorder,nothing in the record suggested the existence of a psychosis within the first year.at.the bva also rejected szemraj argument that its failure to remand to the ro for further examination by three psychiatrists constituted cue because any such failure in the duty to assist does not constitute cue.at.
szemraj appealed the denial of his cue claim to the court of appeals for veterans claims,which affirmed the bva decision on october.szemraj principi,the decision.on appeal to that court,szemraj argued that the case should be remanded in light of our decision in roberson,which held that the va must fully and sympathetically develop the veteran claim to its optimum before deciding it on the merits.at quoting hodge west.szemraj urged that roberson required the court of appeals for veterans claims to instruct the bva to determine whether the bva in august of correctly applied and as well as and b.at.the court of appeals for veterans claims distinguished roberson,holding that it applies only when the va has failed to consider a pending claim.decision,slip op.at.judgment was entered on november,and szemraj timely filed an appeal.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
the appellant argues that the court of appeals for veterans claims misconstrued our decision in roberson,and that roberson applies to cue claims.we review the appellant claim of legal error in the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims without deference.meeks west.
in roberson,we held that a veteran claim for the highest disability rating possible in a claim for compensation,when combined with evidence of unemployability,was sufficient to raise an informal claim for total disability based upon individual unemployability tdiu.roberson,at.in that case the veteran sought to obtain an earlier effective date for his tdiu award by arguing that he had raised an informal tdiu claim in an earlier application for benefits.id.at.both the bva and the court of appeals for veterans claims rejected the veteran claim,holding that he had failed to allege tdiu in the earlier application.id.at.we disagreed and held that while an informal claim must identify the benefit sought,a,the dva has a duty to fully and sympathetically develop the veteran claim to its optimum in order to determine if an informal claim had been raised.roberson,at quoting hodge,at.we further held that o nce a veteran submits evidence of a medical disability and makes a claim for the highest rating possible,and additionally submits evidence of unemployability,the identification requirement of section a is met and the va must consider the claim for tdiu,regardless of whether the claim is specifically labeled as a claim for tdiu.id.
but our decision in roberson is not limited to its particular facts as the court of appeals for veterans claims appears to have suggested here.roberson requires,with respect to all pro se pleadings,that the va give a sympathetic reading to the veteran filings by determin ing all potential claims raised by the evidence,applying all relevant laws and regulations.roberson,at see also forshey principi,en banc w here a party appeared pro se before the lower court,a court of appeals may appropriately be less stringent in requiring that the issue have been raised explicitly.thus,when determining if cue exists in an earlier decision,the va must give a sympathetic reading to the veteran filings in that earlier proceeding to determine the scope of the claims.see roberson,at.
in cook principi,en banc,we reaffirmed our decision in roberson in this respect,holding that developing a claim to its optimum under roberson and hodge requires the va to determine all potential claims raised by the evidence,regardless of the specific labels those claims are given in the veteran pleadings.id.at quoting roberson,at.
here,the court of appeals for veterans claims apparently misunderstood our decision in roberson.relying on its earlier decision in lane principi,the court of appeals for veterans claims held that our decision in roberson applies only when there is a pending claim before the decision,slip op.at.therefore,the court held that roberson was inapplicable.id.this was error because,as explained in roberson,the va has a
