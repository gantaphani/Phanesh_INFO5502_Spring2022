opinion of the court 
maria diaz diaz appeals from the memorandum and order of the district court concluding that the decision of the administrative law judge alj denying her social security disability insurance benefits was supported by substantial evidence.while the alj gave serious consideration to her claim and issued a thoughtful opinion,we are compelled to vacate the district court order and remand to the district court,directing it to remand this case to the commissioner of social security the commissioner for further consideration.
diaz seeks a finding of disability as of december,when she was years old.she turned in july,and her age category changed to closely approaching advanced age,so that she became disabled under section a a of the social security act as of july.it is the period between and that thus concerns us.
diaz was last employed in as a babysitter.she stopped working on december,because she could not keep bending down and assisting the children needs.administrative record ar.diaz urges that several medical,diabetes,cholesterol,asthma,high arterial blood pressure,and her from standing for a long period of time and contribute to headaches,asthma attacks,and chest pains.in addition,she is tall,weighs,and has been diagnosed as morbidly obese.diaz has been under the care of diptika patel,who prescribed several medications for her ailments.
at the hearing before the alj,diaz testified that she was unable to work at a job that requires her to stand,and that she could walk only half a block,due to back and leg pain.she testified that her pain was most acute in the region between her hip and left knee,and described frequent swelling in her knees and ankles.further,she indicated that she could sit for about half an hour,and that she needs to take shifts between sitting and standing.ar.
the alj considered evidence presented by numerous doctors concerning diaz physical and mental limitations.he also considered vocational evidence provided by rocco meola,a vocational rehabilitation counselor.meola indicated that a person like diaz who is between and years of age with limited education and unable to speak english could perform certain sedentary occupations,including small parts assembler,parts sorter,parts inspector,inspector,and weight tester,if provided periodic breaks,and that approximately jobs of this type existed in the region.
the alj proceeded through the sequential evaluation process for determining whether an individual is disabled under a and a.at step one,the alj concluded that diaz was not engaged in substantial gainful activity.the alj then proceeded to step two.at step two,the alj considered whether diaz had a medically determinable impairment that is severe or a combination of impairments that is severe.he listed her severe impairments as follows diabetes,hypertension,asthma,back disorder,degenerative joint disease of the knee,adjustment disorder,and obesity.
the alj then discussed diaz mental impairments,indicating that the opinion of the state agency medical consultant who assessed her as having a severe impairment because she has moderate difficulty maintaining concentration,persistence,and pace did not appear to be supported,because of her activities of daily living and lack of psychiatric treatment.ar.nonetheless,the alj stated that giving the claimant every benefit of the doubt,i find her adjustment disorder t o constitute a severe impairment.ar.the mental condition was the sole impairment discussed by the alj at step two.the alj then proceeded to step three.
at step three,an alj is charged with determining whether a claimant impairment or combination of impairments meets,or medically equals,the criteria of an impairment listed in d and d.if the impairment,or combination of impairments,meets or equals the criteria of the listing and meets the duration requirement,the claimant qualifies as disabled.here,at step three,the alj commented on diaz individual impairments her diabetes,hypertensive cardiovascular disease,chronic pulmonary insufficiency and asthma,disorder of the spine,joint dysfunction,and mental capacity.the alj emphasized that martin fechner,the medical expert,testified that diaz did not meet or equal any listing.
the alj then reviewed the evidence presented,including the testimony of various experts,and concluded that diaz has the residual functional capacity to perform simple,routine sedentary work that does not require concentrated exposure to pulmonary irritants and never requires crawling or the climbing of ropes or ladders.ar.in so concluding,the alj assigned c ontrolling weight to the very detailed reports of the examinations conducted by merlin,potashnik,and tiersten.ar.
the district court affirmed 
congress has provided that our review of the commissioner determination of disability benefits is for substantial evidence.g.if supported by substantial evidence in the record,we are bound by the alj findings of fact.plummer apfel,cir.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.id.citing ventura shalala,cir.
in order to establish a disability under the social security act,diaz must demonstrate some medically determinable basis for an impairment that prevents her from engaging in any substantial gainful activity for a statutory period.burnett comm r of social sec,cir quoting plummer,at see also d.diaz will be considered unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity only if her physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that s he is not only unable to do her previous work but can not,considering her age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.burnett,at quoting plummer,at.
on appeal,diaz urges that the alj ruling is not supported by substantial evidence because,contrary to social security ruling ssr,may,no consideration was given to diaz severe obesity.the alj acknowledged this impairment at step two,but failed to consider its impact,in combination with her other impairments,at step three,as required.in,the commissioner rescinded paragraph of the listing of impairments,which dealt exclusively with obesity however,this did not eliminate obesity as a cause of disability.to the contrary,the commissioner promulgated ssr,indicating how obesity is to be considered.this ssr replaced an automatic designation of obesity as a listed impairment,based on a claimant height and weight,with an individualized inquiry,focused on the combined effect of obesity and other severe impairments afflicting the claimant we will also find equivalence if an individual has multiple impairments,including obesity,no one of which meets or equals the requirements of a listing,but the combination of impairments is equivalent in severity to a listed impairment.although ssr was superseded by ssr,ssr did not materially amend ssr.see rutherford barnhart,cir.ssr instructs that obesity may increase the severity of coexisting or related impairments to the extent that the combination of impairments meets the requirements of a listing.this is especially true of musculoskeletal,respiratory,and cardiovascular impairments.it may also be true for other coexisting or related impairments,including mental disorders.hence,an alj must meaningfully consider the effect of a claimant obesity,individually and in combination with her impairments,on her workplace function at step three and at every subsequent step.
in burnett,we held that an alj must clearly set forth the reasons for his decision.at.conclusory statements that a condition does not constitute the medical equivalent of a listed impairment are insufficient.the alj must provide a discussion of the evidence and an explanation of reasoning for his conclusion sufficient to enable meaningful judicial review.id.at see jones barnhart,cir.the alj,of course,need not employ particular magic words burnett does not require the alj to use particular language or adhere to a particular format in conducting his analysis.jones,at.
citing rutherford barnhart,the government urges that the alj adoption of their merlin,p
