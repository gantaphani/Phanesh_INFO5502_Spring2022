donald dixon appeals the final judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court denying his motion to recall the mandate issued in a decision dismissing his appeal as untimely filed.see dixon shinseki,wl,equitable tolling decision.we reverse and remand.
background 
dixon served in the united states army from july until july.he worked as a chemical operations specialist and served in the persian gulf,where he was exposed to pyridostigmine,a medication administered to troops to protect them from nerve agents.dixon also encountered smoke from oil fires,diesel,and burning trash,and had cutaneous exposure to diesel and petrochemical fuel.
in april,dixon was diagnosed with sarcoid lungs and transverse myelitis,which left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down.four months later,he filed a claim with the department of veterans affairs va seeking disability benefits for sarcoidosis.he alleged that his exposure to oil fires and chemicals in kuwait was a major factor in the development of his illness.
in a september rating decision,a va regional office denied dixon claim.on appeal,the board of veterans appeals board affirmed,concluding that there was no medical evidence relating dixon postservice diagnosis of transverse myelitis and sarcoidosis to service.acting pro se,dixon filed a notice of appeal with the veterans court on may,sixty days beyond the day filing deadline specified in a.on august,the veterans court dismissed dixon appeal,concluding that it was without jurisdiction to consider the appeal because it had not been filed within the day filing period.
in henderson ex rel.henderson shinseki,the supreme court held that the day filing deadline for appealing to the veterans court is not a jurisdictional requirement,d henderson ii.instead,section a time limit is a quintessential rule,id.at,which was not intended by congress to carry the harsh consequences that accompany the jurisdiction tag,id.at.
in the wake of henderson ii,the veterans court issued an order allowing dixon,and other veterans,to file motions to recall the mandates dismissing their appeals based on principles of equitable tolling.see bove shinseki.still acting pro se,dixon filed a motion seeking equitable tolling and explaining that he suffered from physical and psychiatric disabilities which prevented him from filing his notice of appeal in a timely manner 
during the latter part of the year i missed my deadline due to illness and mental stress.i was having continued respiratory episodes,panic attacks,and secluding myself as much as possible due to ptsd.i was so consumed with being ill and believing i was dying.i could not concentrate on myself or issues that needed to be resolved.my records will show that i was having many ptsd,gastrointestinal,respiratory,and gout issues at the time.
on july,dixon filed a supplemental motion stating that during the appeal period he believed that he was on his death bed and was having many panic attacks related to his large lymph nodes which in the next year proved to be a symptom of lymphoma,a form of cancer.dixon also submitted a letter from his va psychiatrist,gary kielpikowski,which stated that he had been treating dixon since and that dixon had severe problems with medical issues and post traumatic stress disorder during the period when he was appealing the board denial of his claim for sarcoidosis.kielpikowski explained that dixon was unable to attend to or focus on the appeal process during the period from november to august.
on august,the veterans court denied dixon motion seeking equitable tolling and dismissed his appeal.although the court acknowledged that kielpikowski had opined that dixon could not attend to,or focus on,the appeal process due to his mental and physical infirmities,it determined that dixon had failed to establish that his untimely filing was the direct result of his illnesses.equitable tolling decision,wl,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
on august,sterling leboeuf and thomas stoever,jr,attorneys with arnold porter llp,agreed to represent dixon pro bono.they promptly moved for an extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration of the decision denying dixon request for equitable tolling.the veterans court granted this motion on august,allowing dixon until october,to file a motion for reconsideration.
on september,leboeuf requested a copy of dixon claims file from the.the va refused,however,to send him a copy of the file.va representatives did offer to make the file available for review at the va denver regional office,but informed leboeuf that the earliest available appointment for reviewing the file was october,three days before dixon motion for reconsideration was due.on october,rebecca golz,a legal assistant who worked with leboeuf,visited the va denver office and reviewed dixon claims file.golz alleges,however,that she was monitored by a va representative during the review process and that she was not allowed enough time to review the documents thoroughly.during her review of dixon file,golz selected twenty to thirty documents that she wished to have copied.although the va agreed to make copies of these documents,it refused to do so contemporaneously.golz attempted to give va officials prepaid federal express and ups shipping labels in order to expedite shipping of the copies she had requested,but they declined to accept them.although golz stressed to va officials that dixon motion for reconsideration was due on october,they declined to provide any assurances that the documents would be sent before that date.as of october,the va had not provided dixon attorneys with any of the documents golz had marked for copying.
the va also hindered leboeuf efforts to obtain a declaration from kielpikowski supporting dixon motion for reconsideration.throughout september,leboeuf worked with dixon and kielpikowski to understand the medical conditions that prevented dixon from timely filing his notice of appeal.on october,leboeuf sent a draft declaration describing these psychiatric and physical conditions to kielpikowski for review.this declaration stated that in the period between november and march dixon suffered from psychiatric conditions that rendered him unable to focus on and complete the process of preparing and filing a notice of appeal and that his psychiatric and physical conditions directly resulted in his inability to timely file a notice of appeal with the veterans court.on the same day that he received the draft declaration,kielpikowski called leboeuf and informed him that he was willing to sign it as soon as counsel for the va authorized him to do so.soon thereafter,however,a va attorney called leboeuf and informed him that kielpikowski would not be permitted to sign the declaration because the va touhy regulations precluded him from doing so 
on october,leboeuf filed a second motion for an extension of time with the veterans court.he explained that extraordinary circumstances justified the granting of additional time given that the va had refused to timely provide him with relevant documents from dixon claims file and had unjustifiably prohibited dixon doctor from providing truthful testimony in support of his motion for reconsideration.
on october,the veterans court denied leboeuf motion for an extension of and entered judgment against dixon.citing to rule e of its rules of practice and procedure,the court stated that a motion for reconsideration or panel review must show that the court has overlooked or misunderstood a point of law or fact.dixon shinseki,slip op.at,order denying an extension of time.in the court view,dixon had no right to augment the record on motion for reconsideration because such a motion must be based on the record at the time of the decision upon which reconsideration or panel review is sought.id.because the court concluded that dixon had no right to submit medical records from his claims file or a declaration from his va physician in support of his motion for reconsideration,it determined that he had failed to establish good cause for granting an extension of time.id.
dixon then filed a timely appeal with this court.we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court authority to review decisions of the veterans court is circumscribed by statute.reeves shinseki.while we have jurisdiction to review the veterans court interpretation of statutory and regulatory provisions,we are prohibited,absent a constitutional issue,from reviewing challenges to factual determinations or the application of a statute or regulation to the facts of a particular case.we have recognized,however,that where adoption of a particular legal standard dictates the outcome of a case based on undisputed facts,we may address that issue as a question of law.halpern principi,see also conley peake.we review de novo the legal determinations made by the veterans court.cushman shinseki.
ii.motions for an extension of time 
dixon argues that the veterans court abused its discretion in denying his motion for an extension of time given that the va actively obstructed his attorney efforts to obtain and review his claims file.in support,he contends that the court refusal to grant leboeuf adequate time to secure copies of relevant medical records is contrary to this court decision in barrett nicholson,barrett ii,and serves to reward delay and obstruction by the va.we agree under the circumstances of this case.
because many veterans lack the knowledge and resources necessary to locate relevant records,congress has appropriately placed the burden on the va to ensure that all relevant service medical records are obtained and fully evaluated.moore shinseki.in barrett ii,we explicitly rejected the government argument that while the va had a duty to produce records related to the merits of a veteran disability claim,it was subject to no such obligation with respect to a veteran motion seeking equitable tolling of the day deadline for appealing to the veterans court.at.we explained that where evidence required to prove a fact is peculiarly within the knowledge and competence of one of the parties,fairness requires that party to bear the burden of coming forward.id.at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.because the va typically has superior access to a veteran claims file and the facts bearing on jurisdiction,it has an affirmative obligation to come forward with evidence relevant to a veteran entitlement to equitable tolling and to develop additional facts uniquely within its competence on that issue id.at.
here,however,the va did not come forward with the evidence in its possession related to dixon claim for equitable tolling,but instead obstructed the diligent efforts by leboeuf to gain access to dixon claims file prior to the october,motion for reconsideration filing deadline set by the veterans court.the va refused to send leboeuf a copy of the file,and while it allowed a legal assistant from leboeuf firm to review the file for a limited period of time at its denver regional office,she was not allowed enough time to review the documents thoroughly.nor was she permitted to make copies of any documents.furthermore,although va representatives agreed to copy twenty to thirty documents from the claims file and send them to leboeuf,he had not received them by the october,filing deadline.
given that the va,despite diligent efforts by leboeuf,failed to timely produce relevant documents from dixon claims file,and,as discussed below,the veterans court was,under the circumstances here,obligated to consider the record,the veterans court erred in refusing to grant an extension of time.although t he veterans court has broad discretion to interpret and apply its rules of practice and procedure,bastien shinseki,we see no reasonable justification for the court refusal to grant an extension of time here.where a litigant is unjustifiably denied timely access to pertinent evidence in the possession of the opposing party,fairness dictates that he be granted an extension of time sufficient to allow him to obtain and review such evidence.see baron,media weather innovations llc,concluding that a district court abused its discretion when it refused to delay proceedings in order to allow a litigant sufficient time to obtain relevant evidence metro.life ins.bancorp,concluding that a district court abused its discretion in refusing to provide a litigant with adequate time to conduct discovery before ruling on the merits of a claim.
veterans not infrequently encounter significant difficulties when attempting to obtain pertinent medical records from the.see,e,moore,at veteran medical records were lost in the bowels of the national personnel records center for several years and were located only after the veteran obtained counsel and appealed to this court washington nicholson,veteran medical records were lost and never located marciniak brown,aff sub nom.marciniak west,the va twice lost the veteran claims file.denying a motion for an extension of time in situations in which the va runs out the clock,refusing to produce relevant medical evidence until after the deadline for filing a motion for reconsideration has passed,serves only to reward delay and obstruction on the agency part.see comer peake,emphasizing that t he va disability compensation system is not meant to be a trap for the unwary,or a stratagem to deny compensation to a veteran who has a valid claim.
iii.the kielpikowski declaration 
under veterans court rule e,a motion for reconsideration is required to state the points of law or fact that the party believes the court has overlooked or misunderstood.e.dixon argues that the veterans court misinterpreted this rule when it concluded that it barred him from introducing a declaration from his va psychiatrist,kielpikowski,supporting reconsideration of the decision denying his equitable tolling claim.according to dixon,introduction of the kielpikowski declaration comports with rule e because it establishes that the veterans court misunderstood the letter kielpikowski submitted when dixon filed his initial motion seeking equitable tolling.specifically,the declaration is intended to clarify that when kielpikowski originally stated that dixon severe psychiatric and physical disabilities rendered him unable to attend to or focus on the filing of his appeal,he meant that those conditions directly resulted in his inability to timely file a notice of appeal with the veterans court.
the veterans court determined,however,that dixon was precluded from introducing kielpikowski declaration,reasoning that he had no right to augment the record when submitting his motion for reconsideration order denying an extension of time,slip op.at.in the court view,rule e requires that a motion for reconsideration be based on the record at the time of the decision upon which reconsideration or panel review is sought.id.
we conclude that the veterans court erred to the extent that it concluded that rule e imposes an absolute prohibition on the submission of clarifying evidence in support of reconsideration of an equitable tolling decision.such an interpretation is contrary to the court own precedent which recognizes that,under certain circumstances,introduction of clarifying evidence is necessary for a full and fair consideration of a veteran equitable tolling request,including assessment of all relevant facts.mccreary nicholson,see also leonard shinseki,wl,at,granting a veteran motion for reconsideration of a decision denying equitable tolling and allowing him to submit information or evidence about the circumstances that prevented his timely filing of a notice of appeal henderson nicholson,wl,at,related proceeding at henderson peake,aff sub nom.henderson shinseki,en banc,rev and remanded henderson ii,d henderson i granting a veteran motion for reconsideration and expressly allowing him to submit additional evidence supporting his equitable tolling claim ashley derwinski,permitting the government to submit additional evidence,in the form of a belated declaration from a va employee,in support of its motion for reconsideration.as dixon correctly notes,an interpretation of rule e which imposes a blanket prohibition on the introduction of clarifying evidence serves to punish some of the most vulnerable litigants in the vetera
