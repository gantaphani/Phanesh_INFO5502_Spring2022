since the civil war era,congress has limited the fees attorneys may charge for representing persons who apply for veterans benefits.see act of july,stat.those limitations were originally implemented to protect the veteran from extortion or improvident bargains with unscrupulous lawyers who overcharged for work that consisted mainly of filing uncomplicated forms for pension benefits on behalf of veterans with limited literacy skills.walters ass of radiation survivors,d stevens,dissenting.
for more than years,attorney fees for assisting veterans and their survivors in prosecuting benefit claims were capped at.see c walters,at.congress purposely limited the role of lawyers in the veterans benefits process in order to protect claimants benefits from being diverted to lawyers and to avoid making the claims process adversarial in nature,particularly in light of the highly effective representation provided for free by veterans service organizations.walters,at,at.
in,as part of the statute that provided for judicial review of administrative decisions on veterans claims,congress repealed the fee cap and allowed attorneys to charge reasonable fees to represent claimants,but only under certain circumstances.see veterans judicial review act,pub,stat.the act permitted attorneys to charge fees for services rendered after a claim was decided by a regional office of the department of veterans affairs dva and the board of veterans appeals bva issued a final decision on the claim.for services rendered prior to that point in the process,the act prohibited attorneys from charging claimants for representation.see c.as was the case before the act,however,the dva continued to permit attorneys and agents to receive fees or salaries from veterans service organizations or other disinterested third parties for prosecuting claims,even in circumstances in which an attorney could not receive a fee from the claimant.see d.the regulation addressing disinterested fee payers provides that a n or agent may receive a fee or salary from an organization,governmental entity,or other disinterested third party for representation of a claimant or appellant even though the conditions set forth in paragraph c regarding fees for services after a final decision by the bva have not been met.id.

carpenter,chartered carpenter,a law firm engaged in representing veterans benefits claimants,has petitioned this court under for judicial review of the new regulation.carpenter asserts that the new regulation is invalid because it is unauthorized by statute,because it is arbitrary and capricious,and because it was issued in violation of the regulatory flexibility act.
congress granted the secretary of veterans affairs authority to prescribe all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the department and are consistent with those laws.a.based on that authority,the dva proposed the challenged amendments to the payer regulation in order to establish safeguards relating to the statutory restriction on the payment of attorney fees for services rendered before the bva first final decision on an issue.see fed.reg.at.
carpenter argues that the statutory prohibition on the payment of fees prior to the first final decision of the bva,c,applies to fees paid by claimants,not by third parties,and that the dva regulation governing fee payments addresses conduct outside the scope of the statute and is thus ultra vires.although the language of section c is broad,it has been construed as applying only to fee payments made by recipients of veteran benefits,and not to payments by disinterested fee payers that are not derived,directly or indirectly,from the claimant or intended beneficiary.see welty united states,cir dep t of justice,office of legal counsel,legality of state payments to attorneys representing veterans,op.off.legal counsel.nonetheless,the fact that section c does not prohibit payments by disinterested fee payers does not mean that the dva may not regulate payments by such fee payers.
the supreme court has held that when congress grants an agency the authority to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of a particular statute,a regulation promulgated pursuant to that authority will be upheld as long as it is reasonably related to the purposes of the enabling legislation.mourning family publ ns,d thorpe hous.auth.of the city of durham,d.moreover,a regulation is reasonably related to the purposes of the legislation to which it relates if the regulation serves to prevent circumvention of the statute and is not inconsistent with the statutory provisions.see thomas int l,united states,upholding a treasury department regulation that guards against evasion of a statutory requirement and is not inconsistent with the statute clifton fed.election comm n,cir normally an agency with rulemaking power has a measure of latitude where it is dealing with the regulated entity and where the rule is reasonably designed to achieve the statute goal agencies often are allowed through rulemaking to regulate beyond the express substantive directives of the statute,so long as the statute is not contradicted.ohio dep t of the interior,agency promulgation of accounting and planning requirements is a perfectly sensible means of ensuring that state trustees obey the statutory command mattes united states,cir upholding agriculture department denial of registration to operate a stockyard where such denial was necessary to prevent circumvention of a statutory suspension order merged area x educ.cleland,cir the regulatory imposition of uniform criteria as to the meaning of semester hour as applied to institutions of higher learning where attending veterans receive educational benefits is necessary to prevent circumvention of the statutory twelve semester hour limit which would occur if each institution could define semester hour as it wished.
in light of those principles,the dva is authorized to issue rules governing attorney fee payments by putatively disinterested payers.in particular,the agency is authorized to issue rules governing the conduct of fee payers where those rules are designed to prevent circumvention of the statutory prohibition against attorney fee payments made by the claimant or from funds intended for the benefit of the claimant.that is precisely the basis that the dva gave for adopting the amendments to its disinterested payer regulation.see fed.reg.at t hese changes are necessary to help enforce statutory limitations on payment that are being violated i t is our experience that agreements are being used to evade those limitations.
carpenter contends that the amendments to the disinterested payer regulation are contrary to the statute they purport to implement,c,and that the amendments are therefore invalid.while it is true th
