the national organization of veterans advocates,paralyzed veterans of america,veterans of modern warfare and national veterans legal services collectively petitioners challenge a rule issued by the secretary of veterans affairs secretary amending f with respect to claims for disability benefits for posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd.petitioners contend that the new rule is contrary to existing statutes and arbitrary and capricious in nature.we conclude that the new rule is a permissible application of the statute by the secretary and not in violation of any law or rule.we therefore deny the petition.
the rule at issue here concerns ptsd.the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,fourth edition dsm iv,classifies ptsd as an anxiety disorder.a person may develop ptsd after exposure to a stress inducing event,such as threatened death or serious injury.persons suffering from ptsd reexperience the traumatic event in several ways,including nightmares,flashbacks,and physiological or psychological reactions to stimuli reminiscent of the damaging experience.as a result,those suffering from ptsd may remove themselves from the world and those around them in an effort to avoid that which could trigger a response.tragically,an estimated ten to thirty percent of united states armed services personnel will develop ptsd within a year of leaving combat.see council on disability,invisible wounds serving service members and veterans with ptsd and tbi,available at invisible wounds.
the united states has deployed over million troops in the recent wars in iraq and afghanistan.id.at.those conflicts have been characterized by guerilla warfare tactics and the inherent uncertainty that comes with it.moreover,many troops have served multiple tours of duty with little respite in between.it is no surprise that these conditions are particularly likely to lead to increased incidences of ptsd.see id.at.
the troops who return home and develop ptsd are often faced with more than reliving the horrors of war.veterans with ptsd suffer from more chronic conditions and have shorter life spans than veterans without ptsd.ptsd has also been linked to higher divorce rates and joblessness.id.at.against this backdrop,the secretary amended the department of veterans affairs va regulations to address the serious problem of troops returning home with ptsd.
like other injuries,veterans who suffer from ptsd are eligible for benefits.the secretary has the authority to issue regulations which establish the requirements for veterans to qualify for ptsd injuries.a.specific rules govern the diagnosis of ptsd and the evidence required to connect a diagnosis to military service.generally,a finding of ptsd requires three components medical evidence diagnosing the condition in accordance with a of this chapter a link,established by medical evidence,between current symptoms and an inservice stressor and credible supporting evidence that the claimed stressor occurred.f.
the va proposed a rule on august,creating an additional situation where a veteran could establish ptsd without supporting evidence regarding the claimed stressor.stressor determinations for posttraumatic stress disorder.that rule,codified at f,is at issue here 
if a stressor claimed by a veteran is related to the veteran fear of hostile military or terrorist activity and a va psychiatrist or psychologist,or a psychiatrist or psychologist with whom va has contracted,confirms that the claimed stressor is adequate to support a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder and that the veteran symptoms are related to the claimed stressor,in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary,and provided the claimed stressor is consistent with the places,types,and circumstances of the veteran service,the veteran lay testimony alone may establish the occurrence of the claimed stressor.for purposes of this paragraph,fear of hostile military or terrorist activity means that a veteran experienced,witnessed,or was confronted with an event or circumstance that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury,or a threat to the physical integrity of the veteran or others,such as from an actual or potential improvised explosive device explosive device incoming artillery,rocket,or mortar fire grenade small arms fire,including suspected sniper fire or attack upon friendly military aircraft,and the veteran response to the event or circumstance involved a psychological or state of fear,helplessness,or horror.
the new rule has three features relevant to this challenge one,it allows a veteran to establish ptsd without supporting evidence two,the lower evidentiary standard only applies if a va psychologist or psychiatrist,or one who has contracted with the va,confirms the supports the diagnosis and three,it defines the veteran fear of hostile military or terrorist activity as involving a response characterized by a psychological or state of fear,helplessness,or horror.id.as explained by the secretary at oral argument,the rule does not require a va practitioner to confirm the diagnosis of ptsd.rather,a va practitioner is only required to confirm that the supports the diagnosis.
the va explained that the rule was intended to acknowledge the inherently stressful nature of serving where hostile military or terrorist activities are ongoing.at.the goal was to facilitate the timely va processing of ptsd claims by simplifying the development and research procedures that apply to these claims.id.pursuant to procedure,the va invited responses to the proposed rule and received comments,including critiques,from various organizations,including petitioners here.
the va responded to the comments but left the rule as proposed.july.the majority of comments were aimed at the rule distinction between private psychologists and psychiatrists and those employed or associated with the.the comments suggested that the new rule should extend to all qualified practitioners.the va declined to extend the rule beyond va practitioners,explaining that ptsd diagnoses are particularly complex.id.at.this complexity was only increased as the new rule added an extra wrinkle the examiner would now also make the forensic determination that the as described by the veteran was sufficient to support a ptsd diagnosis.see id.
va practitioners,the va contended,were particularly able to make this forensic determination for several reasons first,va practitioners are given specific instruction on how to conduct ptsd examinations,including guidance materials and a certification process.id.second,the va reviews the quality of its practitioners examinations,including taking steps to address identifiable problems with feedback and training.id.third,the va provides va associated practitioners with the veterans claims folders in connection with all examinations,including ptsd examinations.id.the practitioners are in turn instructed that a ptsd diagnosis can not occur without a review of the folder.in contrast,private practitioners do not have direct access to a veteran claims folder.id.at.fourth,the va noted that limiting the rule to va associated practitioners would ensure standardization and consistency.id.at.the consistency would be a product of both the large number of ptsd examinations performed by va practitioners and the review of those examinations by the.because the va does not control the quality of private practitioners examinations,it could not ensure,manage,or develop the same level of quality and consistency.for these reasons,the va opted to leave the rule as proposed.id.
petitioners subsequently filed a timely petition to review the final rule.this court has jurisdiction to review the validity of the final rule under.the review is conducted in accordance with of the administrative procedure act apa,et.
we examine the regulation here under the framework provided in chevron natural resources defense council.first,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter id.at.second,if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,we must determine if
