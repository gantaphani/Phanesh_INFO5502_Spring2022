on november,the san francisco voters passed proposition n,the care not cash initiative which,among other things,amended the city general assistance standards of aid and care for homeless indigents.proposition n requires that the city replace the bulk of outright cash grants to homeless recipients with benefits for housing,utilities and meals,to the extent such services are available.
two san francisco recipient and a these provisions.however the challengers did not attack the substance of the care not cash initiative.rather,they successfully asserted that under welfare and institutions code section only the board of the enact the amendments.adhering to our duty to jealously guard the prerogative of initiative,we liberally construe that power,concluding that section does not express a clear or definite intent to restrict that right and therefore the presumption favoring its exercise has not been overcome.see devita county of napa cal th,d,devita.accordingly,we reverse the judgment.
factual background 
statutory scheme 
california law imposes on cities and counties a mandatory duty to relieve and support all incompetent,poor,indigent persons,and those incapacitated by age,disease,or accident,who are not supported or relieved by other means.section provides for a residual fund to sustain indigents who do not qualify for other forms of specialized aid.hunt superior court cal th,d.commonly referred to as general assistance relief,this is a program of last resort.county of san diego state of california cal th,d.counties act as agents of the state in administering relief and are governed by the general law in this role.mooney pickett cal d,san francisco collins cal.
california law further requires that standards of aid and care for the indigent and dependent poor be adopted by each county board of supervisors,or the agency authorized by county charter.
so long as a county establishes a standard of aid,including the value of aid,that is percent of a guideline that is equal to the federal official poverty line with certain adjustments,subd.a,it generally can structure the program to suit local needs.this is because section confers upon counties a broad discretion to determine eligibility for,the type and amount of,and conditions to be attached to indigent relief.citations.mooney pickett,supra,cal d at,see hunt superior court,supra,cal th at,d.and while counties must exercise this discretion in harmony with state law,and in furtherance of its objectives they retain extensive authority to establish standards for general assistance,both as to eligibility and as to amount of aid.mooney pickett,supra,cal d at.
san francisco program 
san francisco has established and operates a program in compliance with section.admin.code,a.the purpose of the program is to provide financial or assistance and other services to indigent residents of the city and county who are unable to support themselves and have exhausted their own means of support,b.
prior to adoption of proposition n,the board of supervisors had enacted eligibility standards that afforded a qualified eligible indigent resident a maximum cash subsistence grant of per month,a,d.with the adoption of proposition n on november,the voters declared a new purpose the goal of the care not cash initiative is to provide all homeless san franciscans without dependents,who qualify for aid through the county assistance programs,food,and health services replacing the majority of existing cash grants with these guaranteed services.this change will allow the city of san francisco to increase mental health treatment services,expand alcohol and substance abuse programs and create more affordable housing.the initiative will bring san francisco in line with almost every other major california county,thereby eliminating the incentive for homeless individuals who want cash rather than services to congregate here.the care not cash initiative will help reduce deaths from drug overdoses by eliminating most cash payments to homeless individuals and replacing them with guaranteed services.text of prop.n,statement of purpose.
the care not cash initiative did not change the maximum monthly amount of aid to which qualified recipients are entitled,a.rather,in keeping with the new goal,the city was directed to provide all s homeless applicants and recipients with benefits for housing,utilities,and meals instead of cash,to the extent such services are available,b and correspondingly reduce cash grants to homeless recipients by the value of services provided,a.additionally,the care not cash initiative guaranteed a special cash allowance per month,regardless of the value of assistance provided,
litigation 
three weeks after the passage of the care not cash initiative,respondents linda pettye and nora roman petitioned for writ of mandate to overturn sections one through seven thereof.their sole challenge was to the power of the people to enact amendatory standards of care and aid for homeless recipients.the trial court granted the writ and directed the city to continue enforcing the standards previously established by the board of supervisors,reasoning that section delegates exclusive authority to the board of supervisors to set such standards.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
a.the local initiative power in general 
the local initiative is guaranteed by article ii,section,subdivision a of the california constitution and generally is coextensive with the local governing body legislative power.devita,supra,cal th at,d.in charter cities the initiative power may be even broader than the constitutional reservation.rossi brown cal th,d.a s between the provisions of the constitution and the provisions of a city charter,those which reserve the greater or more extensive initiative or referendum power in the people will govern.hunt mayor council of riverside cal d.
the reserved initiative power of the san francisco electorate is extremely broad.rossi brown,supra,cal th at,d.the city charter vests in the voters the power to enact any ordinance,act or other measure which is within the powers conferred upon the board of supervisors to enact charter,art.xvii defining initiative and art.xiv,providing that voters of the city and county shall have the power to enact initiatives.
we liberally construe constitutional and charter provisions in favor of the people right to exercise their reserved power of initiative.indeed,it is our duty to jealously guard this power so as not to improperly annul its exercise.devita,supra,cal th at,d,rossi brown,supra,cal th at,d.
judicial limitations qualifications 
historical distinction between administrative and legislative acts 
in california,legislative and executive powers frequently coexist in the local governing body.hopping council of city of richmond cal.historically,courts have restricted the exercise of local initiative powers by drawing a distinction between legislative and administrative acts.hopping was the first case to confine the local initiative process to the legislative orbit.there the issue was whether the city council decision to accept an offer of land which would become the site for city hall was legislative and subject to referendum.the court first addressed the relevant amendment to the constitution,which preserved initiative and referendum powers for the electors of municipalities.it construed the amendment as applying only to acts of the governing body which amounted to an exercise of the legislative power.similarly,the court explained that the city charter provisions reposing referendum powers in the richmond citizenry should be held applicable to all ordinances and resolutions which constitute an exercise of legislative power.the public discussion which led to the adoption of the referendum shows that it was directed at supposed evils of legislation alone in the absence of a very clear declaration to the contrary,it must be presumed that the power of referendum was intended to apply solely to the legislative powers of the city.id.at,italics added.
subsequently,courts have acknowledged that the people through their charter have the right to vest in themselves the power to deal through initiative action with any matter within the realm of local affairs or municipal business,whether strictly legislative or not,as that term is generally used spencer city of alhambra d,see also rossi brown,supra,cal th at,d.
early on,a reviewing court articulated the classic test for distinguishing administrative from legislative action acts constituting a declaration of public purpose,and making provision for ways and means of its accomplishment,may be generally classified as calling for the exercise of legislative power.acts which are to be deemed as acts of administration,and classed among those governmental powers properly assigned to the executive department,are those which are necessary to be done to carry out legislative policies and purposes already declared by the legislative body,or such as are devolved upon it by the organic law of its existence.mckevitt city of sacramento.
administrative characterization given to delegated powers in statewide affairs 
courts have resorted to a second test for differentiating between administrative and legislative acts when the local initiative or referendum speaks to a subject also addressed by state law or policy.this distinction was first articulated as follows if the subject is one of statewide concern in which the legislature has delegated power,not to the local electors,but to the local council or board as the state designated agent for local implementation of state policy,the action receives an administrative characterization,hence is outside the scope of the initiative and referendum.hughes city of lincoln d.see also memorial hospitals randol th,d randol.more recently,our supreme court explained acts of a local governing body which,in a purely local context,would otherwise be legislative may,however,become administrative in a situation in which the state system of regulation over a matter of statewide concern is so pervasive as to convert the local legislative body into an administrative agent of the state citations.yost thomas cal d.
refinements to analysis when delegated powers are at issue 
more recently still,the supreme court has labeled the administrative characterization of delegated powers confusing and an unnecessary fiction.committee of seven thousand superior court cal d,cost.the court stated in matters of statewide concern,the state may if it chooses preempt the entire field to the exclusion of all local control.if the state chooses instead to grant some measure of local control and autonomy,it has authority to impose procedural restrictions on the exercise of the power granted,including the authority to bar the exercise of the initiative and referendum.citations.the state plenary power over matters of statewide concern is sufficient authorization for legislation barring local exercise of initiative and referendum as to matters which have been specifically and exclusively delegated to a local legislative body.id.at.
the statute at issue in cost gave discretionary authority to county boards of supervisors and city councils to impose development fees to finance highway construction.a citizen group proposed an initiative that would prohibit the city council from imposing a new fee without first submitting the fee to a vote of the electorate.the question as framed by the supreme court was whether the legislature intended to delegate authority exclusively to the local governing body,thereby precluding action by the electorate on the same subject.cost emphasized the statutory language,subject matter and history.first,a generic statutory reference to governing body or legislative body gives rise to a weaker inference of such intent than does a specific reference to boards of supervisors and city councils.second,statutes that treat matters of statewide concern as opposed to strictly municipal affairs more readily support an inference of the intent to exclude ballot measures.finally,other indications of legislative intent should also be considered.cost,supra,cal d at.
however,as the state high court subsequently explained,cost itself should not be interpreted as prescribing a set of fixed rules for mechanically construing legislative intent.nor did cost alter the constitutionally based presumption that the local electorate could legislate by initiative on any subject on which the local governing body could also legislate.thus it is still the case that i f doubts can be reasonably resolved in favor of the use of the reserved initiative power,courts will preserve it.citations.devita,supra,cal th at,d.moreover,courts should not automatically infer that a statutory scheme restricts the power of initiative or referendum merely because some elements of statewide concern are present i t is erroneous to assume that a statute or statutory scheme that both asserts certain state interests and defers in other respects to local decisionmaking implies a legislative intent to bar the right of initiative.rather,courts must inquire concretely into the nature of the state regulatory interests to determine if they are fundamentally incompatible with the exercise of the right of initiative or referendum,or otherwise reveal a legislative intent to exclusively delegate authority to the local governing body.id.at,d.
recently in empire waste management town of windsor th,d empire,this court built on the cost and devita rulings.examining section of the public resources code,which empowers the governing body of the local government agency to grant an exclusive franchise for solid waste handling services,and contains further reference to the governing body ibid,we concluded that the terms,taken in context,were generically nonspecific and thus supported only a weak inference that the legislature intended to abrogate the right of local referendum empire,supra,at,d.further we observed that whether the subject was a matter of statewide or merely local concern might depend on how the issue is cut.if the question is whether everyone in california has a stake in the issue of solid waste management,the statewide interest is clear.but if the question is who collects the town garbage and for how long,it becomes difficult to ignore the local flavor of the affair.id.at,d.
the city insists that the trial court was wrong in its conclusion that the legislature intended to annul the voter power to enact standards of aid and care such as those set forth in proposition respondents counter that because counties act as arms of the state in administering aid,the adoption of standards of care is beyond the reach of the local initiative.they further argue that section exclusively delegates authority to adopt such standards to the board of supervisors,thereby annulling action by initiative.from our discussion on the evolution of case precedent concerning limits on the local initiative power,we are satisfied that the line of cases announces the proper test for ascertaining whether that power was available to san francisco voters when they enacted proposition however,first we dispel respondents insistence that irrespective of the issues of delegation and statewide versus local concerns,the enactment of standards is an administrative act beyond the reach of the voters 
the enactment of standards for is a legislative act 
standards of aid and care are in the nature of administrative regulations tailfeather board of supervisors th,d,which establish new rules for application to future cases century ins.garamendi cal th,d.as a general matter legislative action entails formulation of a rule to be applied to all future cases.see also city and county of san francisco superior court d.holding that lower court would be encroaching on legislative territory should it undertake to determine standards of aid and care after mandating that appropriate agency determine facts necessary to establish them.
that cases not involving the availability of local initiative characterized counties as agents of the state in providing benefits,does not change this result.after all,administrative agencies may have executive,administrative,investigative,legislative or adjudicative powers.traub board of retirement cal d,fn,italics added.moreover,by declaring a new goal
