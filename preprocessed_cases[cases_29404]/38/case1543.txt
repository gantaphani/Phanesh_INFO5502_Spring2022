background 
a preliminary discussion of the process for appealing a board decision and for seeking reconsideration of a board decision will assist the reader in understanding graves appeal.
the veterans court has exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the board.a supp.v.pursuant to a supp.v,the time allowed for appealing to the veterans court from a decision of the board is days.section a provides as follows 
in order to obtain review by the court of appeals for veterans claims of a final decision of the board of veterans appeals,a person adversely affected by such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the court within days after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed pursuant to section e of this title.
however,instead of immediately appealing to the veterans court from a final decision of the board,a claimant may ask the board to reconsider its decision.see reconsideration of an appellate decision may be accorded at any time by the board of veterans appeals on motion by the appellant or his or her representative or on the board own motion.the board regulations provide that a motion for reconsideration of a prior board of veterans appeals decision may be filed at any time.b.the chairman of the board reviews motions for reconsideration and decides whether they should be granted or denied.see a c.
in rosler derwinski,the veterans court addressed the effect that the filing of a motion for reconsideration of a board decision has upon the period for appealing to the court.in that case,the veterans court held that a motion for reconsideration tolls the running of the judicial appeal period,if it is filed before the expiration of the period.the appellant then has days from the date that notice of the board reconsideration decision is sent to file a notice of appeal with the veterans court.rosler at.we adopted the rosler rule in linville west.
because an appellant may ask the board to reconsider one of its decisions at any time,it may happen that a motion for reconsideration of a board decision is filed after an appeal has been timely filed with the veterans court.in that situation,jurisdiction over the case already has passed to the veterans court.see griggs provident consumer discount,d the filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.cerullo derwinski,applying the griggs principle in the context of an appeal from the board and concluding that jurisdiction is considered transferred to the veterans court at the time that a notice of appeal is filed.in that event,the veterans court may suspend proceedings in the appeal that is pending before it.rule of the court rules of practice and procedure provides 
the court may suspend proceedings after an appeal has been filed under rule on motion by the appellant seeking reconsideration by the board or by motion of the secretary for reasons of confession of error,by specifying the error below and the proceedings or remedy deemed to be appropriate on remand.the court,on its own initiative,may also suspend appellate proceedings.see also rule b.
however,since the filing of a timely notice of appeal vests jurisdiction in the veterans court,the court has held that any attempt by the board or the board chairman to order reconsideration of a board decision after a notice of appeal has been timely filed with this court is null and void unless the court first orders a remand.cerullo.at.to maintain its exclusive jurisdiction over a case in which a timely notice of appeal has been filed,but at the same time allow the board to address a motion for reconsideration,the veterans court has adopted a procedure for remanding cases to the board.under that procedure,the board chairman may indicate,after a notice of appeal has been filed with this court,that he is inclined to grant reconsideration or the board may indicate a desire to correct an obvious error at that time,a motion for remand must be filed with this court.cerullo at see,stuckey west.describing the granting of an appellant motion to stay proceedings in the veterans court pending board action on a motion for reconsideration and the subsequent renewal of proceedings upon the board denial of the motion sumner principi,describing the granting of an appellant motion to stay proceedings in the veterans court pending board action on a motion for reconsideration and the subsequent remand of the case to the board upon indication that reconsideration would be granted.
