the united states telecom association usta challenges a federal communications commission fcc order finding that the iowa communications network icn is a common carrier.the order makes icn eligible to receive federal subsidies for providing discounted telecommunications services under the telecommunications act of,h.we first consider whether usta has standing to bring this suit,and then whether the fcc reasonably classified icn as a common carrier.we answer both questions in the affirmative and uphold the fcc order.
icn was established by the iowa legislature to provide subsidized telecommunications services throughout iowa,especially in areas inadequately covered by local exchange carriers.the governing statute bars icn from offering services to individuals and to most private businesses.iowa code.instead,icn customers are public and private agencies.under the statute,public agency means a state agency,an institution under the control of the board of regents,the judicial branch,a school corporation,a city library,a regional library,a county library,a judicial district department of correctional services,an agency of the federal government,or a united states post office which receives a federal grant for pilot and demonstration projects.id.a private agency is an accredited nonpublic school,a nonprofit institution of higher education eligible for tuition grants,or a licensed hospital or a physician clinic for specified services.id.
section h of the telecommunications act of requires a telecommunications carrier to provide services at discounted rates to schools,libraries,and rural health care providers.h.such a carrier is entitled to receive from the fcc,in an amount equal to the aggregate discount it gives to those entities,either a reimbursement or an offset against the carrier obligation to participate in or contribute to the universal service fund.id.the act defines a telecommunications carrier as any provider of telecommunications services,id,and defines telecommunications service as the offering of telecommunications for a fee directly to the public,or to such classes of users as to be effectively available directly to the public,regardless of the facilities used,id.
in,icn petitioned the fcc for a declaration that it qualifies as a telecommunications carrier under the act,and hence is eligible to receive direct reimbursement for providing services at discounted rates.in,citing its decision in an earlier case,the commission held that the term telecommunications carrier includes only carriers that offer telecommunications on a common carrier basis.joint bd.on universal,declaratory ruling,wl hereinafter declaratory ruling citing joint bd.on universal,report order,wl.to define common carrier,the fcc turned to the test it had previously applied under the communications act of,et,a test derived from the common law as interpreted in this circuit case law.under that test,common carrier status turns on 
whether the carrier holds himself out to serve indifferently all potential users and whether the carrier allows customers to transmit intelligence of their own design and choosing.
the fcc ruled that icn fails to satisfy the first prong because the network does not hold itself out to serve all potential users,but rather is limited by iowa law to a select clientele.declaratory ruling,at the commission did not reach the second prong of the test.
in iowa fcc,this court granted iowa petition for review and remanded the case to the commission for further consideration.we held that the fcc had failed to consider iowa argument that icn qualifies as a common carrier,even though its user base is legally restricted,because it offers service to all users that it is authorized by law to serve.see id.at.we pointed out that two cases that had considered the meaning of common carrier under the communications act of midwest video,d,and national ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc,naruc i can be read as approving the general rule that a carrier offering its services only to a legally defined class of users may still be a common carrier if it holds itself out indiscriminately to serve all within that class.iowa,at.although we made clear that we were not suggesting that midwest video or naruc require s a decision in iowa favor,we held that the commission failure to address iowa argument requires that we remand this matter for the commission further consideration.id.
on remand,the fcc reversed its ruling.the commission held that icn is a common carrier,and hence a telecommunications carrier for purposes of h.in so holding,the commission concluded that a carrier offering its services only to a legally defined class of users may still be a common carrier if it holds itself out indiscriminately to serve all within that class.joint bd.on universal,order on remand,wl hereinafter order.finding that icn does not discriminate among entities within its legally defined user classes,the fcc held that icn passes the first prong of the common carrier test.see id.at.it also found icn to satisfy the second prong,because it allows customers to transmit intelligence of their own design and choosing.id.at.the commission therefore declared icn eligible to receive direct reimbursement for discounted telecommunications services provided to schools and libraries.id.at.
usta petitions for review of the commission order,contending that icn fails both prongs of the common carrier test.we discuss those contentions in part iii below.in part ii,we first consider whether usta has standing to bring this case.
usta is a trade association representing local exchange carriers.its members provide voice,data,and video services over wireline and wireless networks throughout the united states.although the initial briefs of the fcc and intervenor state of iowa did not dispute usta standing,we have an independent obligation to assure ourselves that the petitioner has constitutional standing to bring this challenge to the fcc decision.see steel citizens for a better env t,d liquid carbonic indus.ferc.accordingly,we directed the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the issue,and,at oral argument,gave usta a further opportunity to submit affidavits in support of its position.thereafter,usta submitted three affidavits,two from individual usta members and one from the association itself.we have reviewed those affidavits and are satisfied that usta has made the requisite showing.
as a trade association,usta has standing to sue on behalf of its members if its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right,the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose,and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.fund democracy,llc sec,citing friends of the earth,laidlaw envtl.servs.toc,d.there is no question that usta satisfies the latter two conditions the only question is whether usta members meet the constitutional requirements for suit in their own right.those irreducible constitutional minimum requirements are 
that the plaintiff have suffered an injury in fact an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is a concrete and particularized and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant,and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court and that it be likely,as opposed to merely speculative,that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
bennett spear,d.
usta contends that the fcc order injures its members by making icn eligible for a subsidy that permits it to offer lower prices for the same telecommunications services we have repeatedly recognized that parties suffer constitutional injury in fact when agencies allow increased competition against them.louisiana energy power auth.ferc,see,wabash valley power ass ferc,md,drug enforcement.and we have likewise recognized that regulatory decisions that permit subsidization of some participants in a market can have the requisite injurious impact on those participants competitors.see exxon,ferc,liquid carbonic,at.
nor is the injury to usta members conjectural or hypothetical.the affidavit of one of usta members,an independent local exchange carrier,avers that the member has tried to sell its services to a school that currently takes similar services from icn,but has been unsuccessful because icn subsidy enables it to charge substantially lower rates.whipple aff.the affidavit of another usta member states that it lost a customer to icn because the subsidy enabled icn to charge lower rates for similar services.kilburg aff.and an affidavit from usta,summarizing information it gathered from a survey of its members,avers that other members have had like losing business to icn or being unable to compete for new customers because of icn subsidy.flerl aff.
these affidavits show that usta members are ready,willing,and able to compete with icn in providing telecommunications to schools and libraries,and that icn subsidy prevents them from doing so on an equal basis.that showing is sufficient to establish that the association members have suffered cognizable injury in fact.see dynalantic department of defense.and it is also sufficient to satisfy the remaining two requirements of constitutional standing the competitive injury suffered by usta members is fairly traceable to the fcc decision to render icn eligible for the subsidy,and that injury would likely be redressed by a favorable decision of this court vacating the fcc order.see high plains wireless,fcc,exxon,at liquid carbonic,at.we therefore conclude that usta has constitutional standing to seek judicial review of the order on behalf of its members.
usta contends that icn can not satisfy either prong of the common carrier test,and that the fcc therefore erred in finding icn eligible for reimbursement from universal service funds.the association also argues that the fcc order is not entitled to a deferential standard of review because it rests on an interpretation of this circuit iowa,naruc,and other decisions,rather than on an interpretation of a statute.we disagree,and conclude that we must review the agency order with deference.
at bottom,the fcc order rests not on judicial precedent but on its interpretation of the term telecommunications carrier in the telecommunications act of.the commission interprets the term as the equivalent of common carrier under the communications act of,a term which was itself previously defined by a test derived from the common law as construed by this circuit.usta does not dispute the fcc decision to interpret telecommunications carrier as common carrier,or its decision to define the latter through the test.indeed,we have previously upheld the fcc approach as a reasonable construction of an ambiguous statutory term.see iowa,at citing chevron,natural res.def.council,d virgin islands.fcc.
in deciding that icn satisfies the requirements of the common carrier test,the fcc further elaborated upon the meaning of common carrier,and then applied its version of the test to the facts of icn situation.where a statute is ambiguous with respect to a specific issue,the only question for this court is whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.at.we also defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of its own rules and precedents.see global crossing,fcc,cassell fcc.and we give deference as well to an agency application of its statutory and administrative interpretations to specific only whether such applications are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see global crossing,at cassell,at huls america browner.finally,where an agency has adopted a judicial test as its own,we likewise review its application of that test only to determine whether it is unreasonable or arbitrary and capricious.see independent petroleum ass of am.babbitt,noting convergence of chevron and arbitrary and capricious review where agency adopts court decision as its rule.
in the following sections,we apply this deferential standard of review to the two challenges that usta levels against the fcc order.
usta first contention is that,because iowa law greatly restricts the universe of the network authorized users,icn fails to satisfy the first prong of the common carrier test that the carrier hold itself out to serve indifferently all potential users.declaratory ruling,at.usta argues that,under our opinion in naruc i,a carrier can not satisfy this prong unless it holds itself out to the public.see naruc i,at.and icn class of legally authorized users,usta maintains,is not broad enough to be considered a portion of the public.pet r br.at.
in response to this argument below,the fcc determined that legal restrictions on eligibility to use a carrier services do not necessarily preclude common carrier status,and that this proposition is consistent with naruc order,at.we agree.as we said in iowa,our decision in naruc i can be read as approving the general rule that a carrier offering its services only to a legally defined class of users may still be a common carrier if it holds itself out indiscriminately to serve all within that class.iowa,at.
in naruc i,this court held that mobile radio operators known as specialized mobile radio systems smrs were not foreclosed from common carrier though smrs offer a service that may be of practical use to only a fraction of the population,and even though an fcc order limit ed possible subscribers to smrs services to eligibles under three specific sections of the fcc regulations.naruc i,at emphasis added.the key factor,we said,is that the operator offer indiscriminate service to whatever public its service may legally and practically be of use.id.emphasis added as the fcc noted,this passage from naruc i directly supports its conclusion in the instant case.order,at.
usta counters,however,that the list of authorized icn users is so much more restricted than was the list of smrs eligibles that icn list can not be considered the public and icn can not qualify as a common carrier.pet r br.at.we do not agree.authorized icn users include state agencies,institutions under the control of the board of regents,the judicial branch,schools,libraries,departments of correctional services,federal agencies,certain post offices,certain nonprofit institutions of higher education,licensed hospitals,and physician clinics for some purposes.see iowa code.together,these amount to at least discrete entities.see order,at.moreover,the network are all those who can access icn at authorized group that includes students,library patrons,and state and federal employees,and that potentially extends to all iowans.see iowa.
like the list of authorized icn users,the list of eligible smrs subscribers in naruc i was legally circumscribed.the fcc limited smrs subscribers to eligibles under sections,and of the regulations.naruc i,at.those included local governments,police and fire departments,motor carriers,taxicab companies,and other specified commercial and noncommercial entities in need primarily of dispatch services.see id.at,although we do not have enough information to count the number of eligible smrs subscribers,the smrs list is not any more readily characterizable as the public than is the list of those eligible to use icn.see naruc i,at characterizing class of eligible smrs subscribers as a limited group of users.in any event,it is certainly not arbitrary for the fcc to regard the two situations as comparable.
usta also argues that icn can not qualify as a common carrier because iowa bars the network use for profitmaking venture s.iowa a.naruc i,however,does not impose a requirement on common carriers.instead,usta points to this court guidance in naruc ii,pet r br.at,an opinion stating that price discrimination by cable system operators in favor of noncommercial users did not necessarily preclude those operators from common carrier status at least if not carried to the point of excluding all commercial users.national ass of regulatory util.comm rs fcc,naruc ii.usta argument rests solely on the quoted phrase,and puts more weight on that phrase
