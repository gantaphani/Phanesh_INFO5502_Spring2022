this case requires us to construe one of the statutes providing benefits for disabled veterans.the issue on appeal is whether the court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court correctly interpreted a statute that provides additional monthly compensation to certain severely disabled veterans.we hold that it did,and we affirm.
pursuant to congressional direction,the department of veterans affairs dva has promulgated a disability ratings schedule that it uses to determine the level of a veteran disability and thus the amount of the veteran monthly disability benefits.the ratings in the table are based on the agency assessment of the reduction in the average veteran earning capacity that results from various injuries,diseases,or conditions.see guillory shinseki.a particular disability can be rated in ten percent increments from to total disability.the rating assigned to a particular disability under the ratings table is referred to as the schedular rating.the veteran schedular rating governs the veteran entitlement to compensation at the statutory levels provided in subsections a j.a veteran rated at has,on average,of the earning capacity of a nondisabled individual and receives compensation at the rate established in subsection a.a veteran who is rated at is deemed to be totally disabled and receives compensation at the rate established in subsection j.
some disabled veterans have multiple disabilities.to determine the veteran overall disability rating in such cases,the dva rates each disabling condition individually unless otherwise provided in the ratings schedule.see amberman shinseki.the dva then combines all the individual ratings,as directed by the combined ratings table,to calculate the veteran combined disability rating.compensation for the combined rating is then calculated according to the statutory schedule in section.
in addition to having a schedular rating of,a veteran can also be rated as totally disabled,and thus entitled to benefits at the statutory level for total disability,if the veteran is unable to maintain gainful employment as a result of disability.in that case,even if the veteran does not qualify for a schedular rating of,the secretary can rate the veteran as totally disabled based on individual unemployability,a rating referred to as tdiu.b.if the veteran claim for a total disability rating predicated on tdiu is based on one disability,that disability must be ratable at or more under the rating schedule.for the purpose of tdiu,one disability includes multiple disabilities resulting from a single accident and multiple disabilities affecting a single bodily system.id.a.
some exceptionally disabled veterans who are rated as totally disabled are entitled to extra monthly compensation over and above the total rate provided in j.this case requires us to construe one of those special monthly compensation provisions,s.that statute provides in additional monthly compensation above the rate for total disability to a veteran with a disability rated as total if the veteran either has another independently rated disability or combination of disabilities rated at,or is permanently housebound by reason of disability.
appellant lionel guerra served on active duty in the united states marine corps from to and suffered injuries.most of his injuries resulted from a single combat incident.the regional office awarded guerra a rating for an gunshot wound,a rating for stress disorder,a rating for injuries to his left leg and thigh,a rating for injuries to his right leg and thigh,and a rating for neuropathy.none of his disabilities is individually rated at,but his individually rated disabilities combine to a rating of,total disability.his rating of total disability is not based on tdiu,however.
the veterans court held that guerra did not meet the threshold requirement for special monthly compensation under subsection s because none of his disabilities is independently rated as total.in construing the statute,the court followed its earlier decision in bradley peake,in which the court held that a veteran with a schedular rating of total disability must have a single disability rated at in order to qualify for benefits under subsection s the court rejected the argument that a veteran is entitled to benefits under subsection s if the veteran suffers from several disabilities,no one of which is rated at,even if the veteran combined disability rating is.
guerra appeals,contending that benefits under subsection s should be available to veterans who are rated as totally disabled,regardless of whether the veteran has a single disability rated at or a combined rating of based on multiple disabilities,no one of which is rated at.
the relevant portion of subsection s states that a veteran is to receive special monthly compensation under the following conditions 
if the veteran has a disability rated as total,and 
has additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at percent or more,or,
by reason of such veteran disability or disabilities,is permanently housebound.
the statute requires a disability rated as total.the use of the term a disability suggests,as the veterans court held,that the veteran must have at least one disability that is rated at.while the use of the singular is not by itself dispositive,the language of subsection s and the other statutory compensation provisions supports the interpretation adopted by the veterans court.
among the seven special monthly compensation provisions in section,the use of the singular indefinite article in referring to a disability a disability is unique to subsection s.the first of the special monthly compensation provisions,subsection k,states that a veteran is entitled to compensation if the veteran,as the result of disability,has suffered the loss of one or more paired organs or has suffered any of several other listed conditions.the next four subsections,l o,contain the same introductory language,as the result of disability.subsection p provides heightened compensation when the veteran disabilities exceed the requirements for any of the rates prescribed in this section.
even within subsection s,the statute distinguishes between a single disability and multiple disabilities.to receive benefits at the subsection s rate,in addition to having a disability rated as total,the veteran must either be housebound by reason of the veteran disability or have additional disability or disabilities independently ratable at percent or more.thus,the same sentence of the statute draws a distinction between a single disability and multiple disabilities.that distinction is a strong indication that congress use of the singular and plural terms was purposeful and that the reference to a disability rated as total was meant to refer to a single disability with a rating.accordingly,the statutory text evidences congress intent to limit the payment of special monthly compensation under subsection s to a veteran who has at least one condition that has been rated as totally disabling.
while the language of subsection s is not entirely free from ambiguity,we are compelled to defer to the dva interpretation of subsection s,and we uphold the decision of the veterans court on that ground.by regulation,the dva has interpreted subsection s to provide that in order to qualify for benefits under that statute,the veteran must have a single disability rated at.that interpretation is entitled to deference under the principles of chevron natural resource defense council,d.as applied in this setting,the rule of chevron provides that when an agency has statutory authority to issue regulations and invokes its authority to issue regulations,which then interpret ambiguous statutory terms,the courts defer to its reasonable interpretations.fed.express holowecki,d see haas peake.
the dva regulation corresponding to subsection s was promulgated under the secretary authority to prescribe all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the department,a.it provides as follows the special monthly compensation provided by s is payable where the veteran has a single disability rated
