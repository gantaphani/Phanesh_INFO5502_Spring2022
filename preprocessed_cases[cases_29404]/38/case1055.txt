colorado has a waiting list of hundreds of developmentally disabled persons who need but do not receive services.six such persons and an association of providers brought this suit under,claiming that the state of colorado has failed to comply with three requirements of the medicaid act,namely reasonable promptness,comparability,and sufficient payments.after a bench trial,the district court entered judgment for the defendants.we hold that the reasonable promptness and comparability requirements do not require the state to provide services,and that neither recipients nor providers have a private right to enforce the sufficient payments requirement through.we therefore affirm.
factual and procedural background 
this suit was brought in august by six persons,through their parents and guardians,against the governor of colorado and two other state officials.the six individual plaintiffs are developmentally disabled persons who are on waiting lists for comprehensive residential services.these services are provided by public and private entities,which are paid by the state,which is in turn reimbursed for about half of the costs by the federal government through medicaid.see.the state offers two kinds of services relevant to this suit.an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded is an institutional setting,usually large,and is generally reserved for persons with extreme needs.appellees answer br.three such facilities exist in colorado,and they serve about persons.two of these facilities are managed by the state,and one is operated by a private organization.the state also provides home and services hcbs.in an hcbs setting,developmentally disabled persons live in either a small host home serving to people or slightly larger group homes serving to people.id.at.over the last the state has shifted its emphasis from to hcbs,which are less expensive and less isolating.
home and services are waiver programs,which means that the state may offer them only after securing a waiver of certain medicaid requirements from the federal government.they are also capped by the state waiver application wherein a state must indicate the maximum number of participants it will accept in its waiver program.at the time of trial nearly persons received hcb services.another persons wished to receive hcb services,but the services were unavailable.roughly half of these persons received no state services of any kind for the developmentally disabled.at the time of trial,only persons were seeking services.the plaintiffs sought services,and each contended that the needed services were unavailable because the state refused to comply with federal law.
in october,the colorado association of community centered boards caccb moved to intervene on the side of the plaintiffs.boards are hcbs providers offering housing and medical care to the developmentally disabled and receiving,in return,medicaid payments from the state.
suing under,the plaintiffs and intervenor alleged violations of the federal medicaid act,specifically that the state failed to provide the developmentally disabled with comprehensive residential services that meet the statutory requirements of reasonable promptness and comparability,which are described below.the individual plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction that would compel the state to meet the statute requirements,but they did not and do not ask the courts to specify the way in which the state should comply with the statute.the individual plaintiffs sought class certification on behalf of all developmentally disabled persons in colorado who remain on waiting lists to receive comprehensive medical services.although opposing class certification,the caccb generally supported the individual plaintiffs claim.the caccb also claimed that the state pays for medicaid services for the developmentally disabled at rates that are too low to meet the statutory requirement of sufficient payments.
the district court denied class certification and,after a trial,entered judgment for the defendants.the plaintiffs now appeal 
ii.reasonable promptness and comparability 
we begin with the claim that the state has failed to comply with the requirements of reasonable promptness and comparability.if a state chooses to participate in medicaid,it must submit a state plan for providing medical assistance.a.the medicaid act imposes a number of conditions on a state plan,two of which are at issue in this case.the first is that medical assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.id.a.the second,the comparability requirement,is that the assistance any patient receives shall not be less in amount,duration,or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other such individual.id.a b i.
in addressing these claims,we assume that the individual plaintiffs may sue to enforce their rights under subsections and.since the supreme court clarified when a statute creates an enforceable private right in gonzaga university doe,d,several circuit courts have considered whether one or both of these subsections creates an enforceable private right.each has concluded that the provision in question does.see,watson weeks,cir following the five federal circuit courts that have found a private right to sue for enforcement of a,two of which did so after gonzaga sabree richman,cir finding that each provision created an enforceable private right.but see sanders ex rel.rayl.dep t of soc.and rehab,d,concluding that subsection does not create an enforceable private right but finding it a closer question than for some medicaid provisions betit,d,concluding that subsection does not create an enforceable private right.in this case,the district court did not clearly decide whether this portion of the statute creates a federal right enforceable under,but the parties have not disputed the point.we therefore assume without deciding that gives the plaintiffs a right of action to enforce subsections and.see burks lasker,d the question whether a cause of action exists is not a question of jurisdiction,and therefore may be assumed without being decided.
on the merits,the plaintiffs reasonable promptness and comparability claims are two ways of characterizing one problem that the individual plaintiffs are not receiving the comprehensive residential services they need.they are thus not receiving them promptly and not receiving them to the extent that others receive them.the outcome of both claims turns on the same question what is the medical assistance that the state must provide promptly and equally 
the medicaid act defines medical assistance as payment of part or all of the cost of the described care and services.a.the statutory definition mentions payment for,but not provision of,services.in other words,the statutory reference to assistance appears to have reference to financial assistance rather than to actual medical services.bruggeman ex rel.bruggeman blagojevich,cir see also westside mothers olszewski,cir concluding that a and do not require the state to provide medical services directly but rather require only financial assistance on its face,then,the medicaid act requires any state participating in medicaid to pay promptly and evenhandedly for medical services when the state is presented with the bill.if that is all the statute requires,then the plaintiffs have no claim they are on a waiting list for services,not a waiting list for payment for services.
the plaintiffs offer two reasons we should reject the natural reading of the statute.the first is that the definition of medical assistance,when read in context,requires the state to provide actual services and not merely to pay for them.the plaintiffs point to five contextual clues that medical assistance means actual services and not just financial payments.none of these clues,however,is sufficiently convincing to depart from the statutory definition of medical assistance.
first,the plaintiffs point to another provision in the medicaid act,a,which requires the state to assure that the lack of adequate funds from local sources will not result in lowering the amount,duration,scope or quality of
