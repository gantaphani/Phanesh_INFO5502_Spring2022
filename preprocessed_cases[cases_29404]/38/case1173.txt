the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act,requires certain coal operators to pay annual premiums for retired coal miners health benefits to the united mine workers of america combined benefit fund fund.a.under the coal act,the commissioner of the social security administration commissioner must calculate,according to a specified formula,the premiums that coal operators must pay.b.calculating the premiums requires the commissioner to interpret the word reimbursements in b a i of the coal act.in,several coal companies filed suit in the district court in the northern district of alabama and successfully challenged the commissioner interpretation of the word reimbursements.see coal ass chater,no,wl.july.the eleventh circuit affirmed the district court judgment enjoining the commissioner to recalculate the premiums according to an interpretation of reimbursements different from the one that the commissioner had been using.coal ass chater,cir.the commissioner recalculated the premiums according to the eleventh circuit interpretation of reimbursements and then applied this revised interpretation and resulting premium recalculation nationwide,including with respect to coal operators who were not parties in the eleventh circuit litigation.
the instant case arose in when the appellees,the trustees of the fund,filed suit in the district court challenging the commissioner nationwide implementation of the revised interpretation of the coal act.the trustees alleged that the commissioner violated the administrative procedure act apa,a,in applying b a of the coal act in a manner not in accordance with law.the district court denied the appellants motions to dismiss,see holland apfel,d,and granted summary judgment in favor of the trustees,see holland apfel,mem.op,mem.op,reprinted in joint appendix at.the district court ordered the commissioner to recalculate the premium in accordance with the commissioner initial,circuit interpretation of reimbursements,but stayed its injunction pending appeals.
appellant commissioner contends that the agency nationwide implementation of the revised interpretation of reimbursements in the coal act is in accordance with law,because the interpretation was mandated by the eleventh circuit injunction.the commissioner also claims that the district court abused its discretion in granting injunctive relief,because the relief is inherently at odds with the judgment of the eleventh circuit.national mining association and various coal companies collectively nma contend that res judicata bars this suit.they also argue that this court should follow the eleventh circuit interpretation of reimbursements,because it comports with the plain meaning of the statute alternatively,nma claimed during oral argument that,if the statute is ambiguous,the agency revised interpretation is entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.the trustees,in turn,argue that the statute unambiguously supports the commissioner original interpretation of reimbursements.
we hold that res judicata does not bar the trustees action in the circuit.the trustees were not a party in the litigation in the eleventh circuit,so they are not bound by that judgment.nor does the eleventh circuit judgment purport to bind the commissioner with respect to coal operators who were not party to that litigation.the trustees action in the circuit can result in a viable remedy covering coal operators who were not covered by the injunctive relief granted in the eleventh circuit.therefore,the commissioner is not potentially subject to two conflicting orders as a result of the instant litigation.
we further hold that the agency nationwide application of the eleventh circuit interpretation of reimbursements is not insulated from apa review by virtue of having been undertaken in response to the eleventh circuit injunction.the commissioner was not in fact bound to recalculate the premium for coal operators who were not party to the eleventh circuit litigation.there is thus no reason why we can not review the agency decision to apply the eleventh circuit interpretation to coal operators who were not party to the litigation.
apa review in this case is ultimately a matter of statutory interpretation of the word reimbursements.however,on the record that is now before the court,it is impossible to determine whether this case falls within the category of cases to which chevron deference applies.in particular,it is unclear whether the agency,in applying the eleventh circuit interpretation of the coal act,believed that it was compelled to implement the interpretation nationwide,or,rather,reasonably and voluntarily acquiesced in the interpretation.if the agency felt effectively coerced into adopting the interpretation nationwide,then the agency would not be entitled to deference under chevron.indeed,chevron would not apply at all,because the adoption would not represent the agency reasoned judgment on statutory meaning.but if the agency voluntarily acquiesced,choosing to implement the eleventh circuit interpretation nationwide based on the agency own reasoning about statutory meaning,then chevron deference might be due.since the answer to the question whether the agency acquiesced or was coerced is not clear from the record before us,we remand this case to the district court with instructions to remand the case to the agency for clarification of the agency position.
background 
a.the coal act 
in,congress enacted the coal act,to ensure adequate funding for the provision of health care benefits to retired coal miners.previously,miners health benefits had been provided through benefit plans established by collective bargaining agreements between the united mine workers of america umwa and the bituminous coal operators association,an association of coal industry employers.the coal act merged two such former benefit plans,the umwa benefit plan and the umwa benefit plan plans,into a new plan called the umwa combined benefit fund fund,which is financed by annual premiums assessed against signatory coal operators.see enters.apfel,d citing a,and b,b,c.the coal act gives the trustees of the fund the authority to collect premiums,spend money for health care,and administer the fund benefit program.see.
one of the responsibilities that the coal act assigns the commissioner is that of calculating the premiums that coal companies are required to pay each year.see b.the coal act provides that the premium for each plan year shall be equal to 
a the amount determined by dividing 
i the aggregate amount of payments from the umwa benefit plan and the umwa benefit plan for health benefits less reimbursements but including administrative costs for the plan year beginning july,for all individuals covered under such plans for such plan year,by 
ii the number of such individuals 
b a.under this detailed formula,signatory coal operators must pay to the fund a premium that equals the average cost to the plans of providing health benefits during the base year beginning july,minus reimbursements by medicare or other federal sources.
prior to,the plans paid health care providers for services directly,and then sought reasonable reimbursement from the health care financing administration hcfa,the agency within the social security administration that administers medicare.this arrangement of negotiating medicare reimbursements led to longstanding disputes between hcfa and the plans.in,hcfa and the plans thus entered a risk capitation agreement,under which hcfa agreed to pay the plans a monthly flat fee rather than the amount to cover medicare responsibilities,based on the plans projected expenditures.however,it turned out that the agreement set the flat fee higher than the costs that the plans actually incurred during,the first year of the agreement hcfa paid the plans a flat fee of million,and the plans spent only million for services,resulting in an overpayment of million for services.hcfa and the plans later renegotiated the capitation agreement to set a substantially lower flat fee for subsequent years.
the first year of the capitation agreement was also coincidentally the base year to which the coal act refers in setting out the calculation formula.in calculating the premium amount that coal operators were required to pay to the fund under the coal act,the commissioner interpreted the term reimbursements in b a i to mean the million that the plans actually incurred in costs that year,rather than the million that hcfa paid to the plans under the capitation agreement.the coal employers thus paid the fund an amount based on the costs to the fund of providing benefits for all services that year,and other services as well,minus the million in medicare reimbursements received from hcfa.in other words,the commissioner assumed that the fund could only be reimbursed in the amount actually spent for services.the excess may have been a temporary windfall to the fund,but it was not viewed as a reimbursement for service.if the commissioner had instead interpreted reimbursements to mean the million that hcfa paid to the plans that year,then the coal employers would have paid the fund million less.
b.the eleventh circuit litigation 
national coal association nca,a trade association,and eight coal companies brought suit under the apa in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama,challenging the commissioner premium calculation and his interpretation of the term reimbursements in the coal act.see coal ass n,wl.the coal companies sought to enjoin the commissioner to recalculate the initial and all subsequent annual premiums consistent with an interpretation of reimbursements that meant the entire amount that hcfa paid the plans,rather than the portion that equaled the plans actual costs.the commissioner initially moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to join the trustees of the fund as a necessary party,but the court denied the motion.the court found that the commissioner interpretation of the statutory term reimbursements contradicted the plain meaning of the term,and enjoined the commissioner to recalculate the premium by deducting from the plans health care costs the entire amount that hcfa paid to the plans.the eleventh circuit affirmed,agreeing that the commissioner interpretation was inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute.see coal ass n,at.the commissioner did not seek certiorari.
the commissioner recalculated the premium to conform to the injunction and notified the trustees of the recalculated amount,which was now reduced by.although the eleventh circuit judgment did not technically bind the commissioner with respect to coal companies who were not plaintiffs in the litigation,the commissioner implemented the new interpretation nationwide.
proceedings below 
the trustees of the fund then filed the instant lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia,claiming that the commissioner nationwide implementation of the revised interpretation of the statute violated the apa.complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief,reprinted in at.the trustees sought declaratory and injunctive relief that would order the commissioner to adopt the initial premium calculation,which the eleventh circuit had invalidated,reprinted in at.nma,a successor to the trade association nca,and several coal companies,who were plaintiffs in the eleventh circuit litigation,intervened as defendants.
the commissioner and nma moved to dismiss on grounds of res judicata,claiming that the trustees were bound by the eleventh circuit litigation.see holland,d at.they also argued that agency action that has been compelled by a court injunctive order can not violate the not in accordance with law standard of the apa a,and thus is not subject to apa review.see id.at.the district court rejected these arguments,and also held that the doctrine of comity did not warrant deference by the district court to the eleventh circuit ruling.see id.at.then,on for summary judgment,the district court granted summary judgment for the trustees.mem.op.at,reprinted in at.it reasoned that the term reimbursements in the coal act was ambiguous under chevron step one.id.at,reprinted in at.but under chevron step two,the district court held that,because the commissioner revised interpretation was the product of a compulsory injunction by the eleventh circuit rather than of reasoned analysis,the revised interpretation did not warrant deference.id.at,reprinted in at.the district court instead appeared to defer to the commissioner interpretation of reimbursements,and issued a declaratory judgment adopting that interpretation.see id.at,reprinted in at.although the district court did not initially order any injunctive relief,it later amended its judgment and ordered the commissioner to recalculate the premium in accordance with the district court interpretation of reimbursements.amended order and judgment,reprinted in at.it stayed the injunction pending appeals,reprinted in at.the commissioner and nma now appeal.
ii.analysis 
res judicata 
the first issue presented in this appeal is whether this case is barred by the doctrine of res judicata,which holds that a judgment on the merits in a prior suit bars a second suit involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.parklane hosiery,shore,d.the trustees of the fund,who brought the instant case,challenge the agency interpretation of the same provision of the coal act that was at issue in the eleventh circuit case.the trustees were not party to the eleventh circuit litigation.the coal companies who brought suit in the eleventh circuit did not attempt to join the trustees and the alabama district court denied the commissioner motion to dismiss for failure to join the trustees as a necessary party.joinder as a party,rather than knowledge of a lawsuit and an opportunity to intervene,is the method by which potential parties are bound by a judgment or decree.martin wilks,d.not having been a party in the eleventh circuit litigation,the trustees can not be bound by the judgment,and thus are entitled to bring their claim.
appellant nma relies on a footnote in wilks,id.at.at,which recognizes an exception to the general rule when,in certain limited circumstances,a person,although not a party,has his interests adequately represented by someone with the same interests who is a party,to argue that,although the trustees were not a party to the prior litigation,they should be bound,because their interests were adequately represented by someone with the same interests,namely the commissioner.this argument is unavailing.as the district court noted,this case does not fit either of the wilks footnote two specified limited circumstances in which a nonparty may be adequately represented by a party to prior litigation class or representative suits,or suits in which the nonparty exercised control of the litigation on behalf of a party.see id.
moreover,as the district court correctly reasoned,see holland,d at,although the trustees in this case advocate the same interpretation of reimbursements as did the commissioner throughout the eleventh circuit litigation,the trustees and the commissioner do not share the same incentives.the trustees of the fund have a monetary incentive to adopt a statutory interpretation that will maximize the fund revenues,to pay for the health care needs of retired mine workers.the commissioner,who has the responsibility of calculating the premium,must act impartially and does not have a monetary incentive to adopt a particular statutory interpretation.this disparity in incentives undermines nma claim that the trustees were adequately represented by the commissioner in the eleventh circuit.see cleveland county ass for gov t by the people cleveland county bd.of comm rs,finding that diverging incentives prevented a party from adequately representing another party interests.these disparate incentives are underscored by the fact that the trustees are now suing the commissioner in this case.
furthermore,the eleventh circuit judgment did not purport to cover all coal companies it covered only the coal companies who were plaintiffs in that case.the injunction bound the commissioner only with respect to the calculation of premiums for the coal operators who were plaintiffs or members of nca,the plaintiff trade association.therefore,the instant suit by the trustees challenging the agency interpretation of the same provision that was at issue in the eleventh circuit is not a collateral attack on the prior judgment.res judicata does not bar this suit.
the trustees action in the circuit can result in a viable remedy in favor of the trustees and against the commissioner,with respect to the coal operators who are not covered by the eleventh circuit injunction.such an injunctive remedy in the circuit would not conflict with,or purport to overturn,the eleventh circuit injunction.to the extent that the district court was unclear or mistaken as to the scope of its injunction,we clarify that an injunction issued in the circuit can bind the commissioner only with respect to coal companies who were not already covered by the eleventh circuit injunction.the instant case thus does not potentially subject the commissioner to two conflicting orders,even if the two injunctions order opposing interpretations of reimbursements.it is altogether possible for the commissioner to calculate the premium twice,according to the two different interpretations of reimbursements,and to apply the appropriate calculation to each coal operator,depending on whether the particular coal operator was or was not party to the eleventh circuit suit.
apa review 
in a case like the instant one,in which the district court reviewed an agency action under the apa,we review the administrative action directly,according no particular deference to the judgment of the district court.troy browner,gas appliance mfrs,dep t of energy.on an independent review of the record,we will uphold the agency action unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a.
appellant commissioner contends that the interpretation of the coal act currently in force must necessarily be deemed in accordance with law under a of the apa,because that interpretation was compelled by a judicial decree the eleventh circuit injunction,the commissioner claims,is law for the purpose of not in accordance with law review.we may assume,arguendo,that this might have been true had this case simply involved the agency interpretation of the coal act with respect to the coal companies who were party to the eleventh circuit litigation.but this case involves the agency separate decision to apply the eleventh circuit interpretation to coal companies who did not have the benefit of the prior judgment.the injunction did not technically require the premium recalculation for all coal companies.the commissioner concedes as much.see br.for appellant commissioner at.in this case,the agency action at issue is the revised interpretation of reimbursements only as it affects those coal companies not covered by the eleventh circuit injunction.
allowing one circuit statutory interpretation to foreclose apa review of the question in another circuit would squelch the circuit disagreements that can lead to supreme court review.in united states mendoza,d,the supreme court rejected nonmutual collateral estoppel against the government in a case in which the government sought to litigate a constitutional issue that had been decided in a prior litigation against a different party.a rule allowing nonmutual collateral estoppel against the government in such cases would substantially thwart the development of important questions of law by freezing the first final decision rendered on a particular legal issue,which would deprive this court of the benefit it receives from permitting several courts of appeals to explore a difficult question before this court grants certiorari.id.at.at.
the commissioner is correct that mendoza principle of does not authorize this court to lift the existing eleventh circuit injunction as to the coal companies who were parties in the prior litigation.circuits may have differing interpretations of the same statutes,but their differing interpretations are developed in different cases,not in the same dispute.this case is not the same dispute as the one litigated in the eleventh circuit.not only is there a different party seeking review,it is a review of a separate agency action regulating coal companies not party to the prior litigation.review in this court under the apa thus does not disturb the finality of the prior judgment.it does,however,vindicate the authority of the circuits to rule on statutory meaning independently of each other.
c.the statutory question 
this case involves the construction of a statutory term implemented by a government agency with authority to administer the statute.at issue is the meaning of the word reimbursements in b a of the coal act.in reviewing an agency statutory interpretation under the apa not in accordance with law standard,we adhere to the familiar test of chevron,provided that the conditions for such review are met.see united states mead,d holding that chevron deference is due only when the agency acts pursuant to delegated authority and the agency action has the force of law.under chevron,if the intent of congress is clear,this court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.at.if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,and the agency has acted pursuant to an express or implied delegation of authority,the agency statutory interpretation is entitled to deference,as long it is reasonable.id.at.at.
in support of the eleventh circuit holding that the plain meaning of reimbursements in b refers to the entire amount that hcfa paid the plans under the capitation agreement,rather than the amount that the plans actually incurred in expenses,the court stated that r eimburse is defined as to pay back an equivalent for something taken,lost,or expended to someone repay.webster third new international dictionary.the ordinary meaning of the term reimbursement is not restricted by any requirement that such payments be what the reimbursed party payed out.coal ass n,at.the eleventh circuit analysis is somewhat perplexing,because it acknowledges that reimburse means to pay back an equivalent for something expended emphasis added,and yet the opinion concludes that reimbursement is not restricted to what the reimbursed party payed out.if anything,the eleventh circuit opinion seems to confirm the statute ambiguity.
in any event,we need not ponder how this case might be decided under chevron until we first decide whether chevron deference even applies.if we could resolve this case on the plain meaning of the statute,we would be obliged to do so.see chevron,at.at the judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.citations omitted.we can discern no plain meaning in this case,however.
the district court accepted the proposition that the statute was ambiguous under chevron first step,see mem.op.at,reprinted in at,but reasoned that the agency revised interpretation was not entitled to deference under chevron second step,because the interpretation was adopted pursuant to the eleventh circuit order,see id.at,reprinted in at.it then appeared to defer to the agency erstwhile,circuit interpretation,finding it to be reasonable.see id.at,reprinted in at.the court seeming deference to an interpretation that was not even in force was incorrect,and amounted to a substitution of the court own judgment for the agency current interpretation.
the district court error was understandable in light of the mixed messages from the agency as to which interpretation of the statute the agency really holds.the agency implemented the eleventh circuit interpretation nationwide,but still seemingly believes that the eleventh circuit misconstrued the coal act.see reply br.for appellant commissioner at.on the one hand,the agency claims that the eleventh circuit injunction compelled it to
