claimant nick blea appeals from a magistrate judge order affirming the commissioner denial of his application for disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act.blea contends that the magistrate judge erred in upholding the administrative law judge alj decision,where the alj failed to utilize social security ruling ssr to determine the onset date of blea disabilities,and confront or address lay witness testimony pursuant to social security rulings and.we hold the onset date of blea disabilities was ambiguous,that the alj erred by failing to utilize ssr to infer an onset date,and that the alj should have addressed lay witness testimony in his written decision.therefore,exercising jurisdiction pursuant to g and,we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
in july,blea brother shot him in the foot.blea endured a series of seven surgeries over the next two months,and numerous visits with doctors thereafter.in january,blea treating physician,william ritchie,provided him with a handicapped parking placard,and wrote in his treatment notes that blea pain is probable sic due to the bony deformities,although there is the possibility that it is due to incomplete fusion of the bone graft.aplt app.vol.i,at.ritchie also noted that despite the pain,blea was able to ambulate with minimal restrictions.id.
in february,ritchie again saw blea,who return ed complaining of continued foot pain.id.at.ritchie prescribed ibuprofen and,advised blea to use a cane,and referred him to laura mitchell,a foot and ankle specialist.after examining him in march,mitchell noted that his revealed a lateral shift of the lesser metatarsals and some shortening of the first ray.id.at.she further explained that blea was doing well and is not interested in further surgery.id.at.blea did not see another physician until june,when he tripped while carrying his child.that doctor diagnosed blea with a broken toe,and noted that h e has no pain proximally where he had the previous bone graft.id.at.although the doctor he saw at this time recommended that blea make an appointment to follow up with ritchie in a few weeks,blea did not seek medical treatment again until january.
at the january visit,ritchie noted that the wounds from surgery and the injury itself were well healed.id.at.the showed some degenerative changes in blea foot however,no acute changes were noted.id.he recommended that blea see mitchell again.but,at his february visit,mitchell diagnosed blea with significant arthritis with constant pain.id.at.she discussed the possibility of a syme amputation of the entire foot at the blea at this visit.further,in february,blea saw robert schenck,who indicated that blea reveal ed fairly significant midfoot and forefoot arthritis.id.at.schenck also recommended that blea apply for social security benefits in my opinion,he is permanently fully disabled and unemployable.id.at.
blea followed schenck advice.in march,he applied for disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act and supplemental social security income under title xvi,alleging he was disabled due to arthritis and depression as of june.while his claim for benefits was pending,blea met with elegio padilla,on august,one of the social security administration consultative psychologists.this was the first time blea received any medical treatment for his depression.during the evaluation,blea revealed his past suicidal thoughts,described his problems with alcohol,and discussed the emotional ramifications of having been shot by his own brother.padilla concluded that blea has been dysthymic for years and may be suffering from a major depression currently.id.at.
the commissioner initially denied blea claims for disability insurance and supplemental income.upon reconsideration in october,however,blea was found to be disabled and entitled to supplemental security income as of march.the decision was made on the basis that at the time the application was protectively filed,march,the claimant post traumatic arthritis and dysthymia were medically determinable impairments that were disabling.id.at.thus,the commissioner determined that,as of at least march,blea was disabled due to both arthritis and dysthymia.nonetheless,the commissioner denied blea application for disability insurance because she determined that any impairments blea had were not disabling on any date through the last day insured status for disability was met.id.at.
after the denial of his claim for disability insurance benefits,blea requested a hearing before an alj,which was held in september.during the hearing,blea testified about the effects of having been shot in the foot.blea also testified.she reported that after the gunshot injury and for months thereafter,her husband talked about suicide.even recently,she testified,he talks about it probably at least two to three times a week he says that the pain is too much to bear.id.at.she also explained that since the gunshot injury,blea has rarely left the house due to pain and anxiety,and has also been unable to sleep comfortably.at the close of the evidence,blea attorney asked that the alj call a medical expert to assist the alj in reviewing the medical evidence.the alj denied this request because he found no no psychiatric evidence relating to the time before,which he feel s warrants that review.id.at.
in november,the alj denied blea claim for disability insurance benefits because he decided that blea had not been disabled as of the date he last was eligible for disability benefits,december.the alj did not,however,determine an exact onset date.rather,the alj applied the sequential analysis mandated by and,and determined that because blea retained the capacity for sedentary work as of december,he could not have been disabled.
with respect to blea depression,the alj found that blea allegations about his physical limitations due to the condition were not well supported by the medical record.additionally,his reports of depression were not credible before december,since there was no evidence of treatment or reports of depression before that date.thus,the alj did not consider blea claim of depression in determining what kind of residual capacity for work blea retained.
with respect to his arthritis,the alj applied the sequential analysis pursuant to and to determine whether blea was disabled as of that date.blea carried the burden of proof with respect to the first four parts of the test.
the first part inquires whether the claimant has performed substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date if he has,he is not disabled.the alj found that blea had not performed substantial gainful activity since the gunshot wound.the second part asks whether the claimant impairments are severe,which they must be if he is to be found disabled.the alj found that blea impairment due to arthritis was severe.
if the claimant has not performed gainful activity and his impairments are severe,then the alj must determine whether his impairments are listed in the regulations.if the impairments are listed,then the alj must find the claimant disabled without further inquiry.at this step,the alj determined that t he claimant musculoskeletal impairments did not approach the severity required to meet listings,prior to december.blea retained the ability to ambulate effectively aplt app.at.thus,the alj proceeded to the fourth step of the inquiry,whether the impairments prevent blea from performing his past relevant work.the alj found that after the gunshot injury,blea could no longer perform his relevant past work,even before december.
once the claimant has carried his burden through the first four parts,the burden shifts to the commissioner for the fifth and final part,to show that other work,which the claimant could perform given his residual functional capacity,existed in significant numbers in the national economy such that the claimant could have been employed.if the commissioner can make this showing,then the alj must find that the claimant is not disabled.the alj found that as of december,blea retained the ability to do sedentary work,relying heavily on the testimony of an impartial vocational expert.the alj additionally noted that,in march,blea and his doctors were satisfied with the results of his surgeries,in june,he walked well enough to carry a baby,and he did not seek medical treatment again until january.based on these factors,the alj decided that it was reasonable to believe that blea did not have severe,debilitating pain during the relevant time period.therefore,the alj concluded that blea allegations of complete disability due to arthritis were not supported by the medical record before his last insured date of december.
blea requested the appeals council to reverse the alj,providing additional evidence from one of his treating orthopedists,schenck.schenck offered the opinion that it is reasonable to assume that blea arthritis with constant pain was present between june and january.see aplt app.at.the appeals council,however,declined review,stating in a form decision that it had considered the additional evidence listed.id.at.when the appeals council declined review,the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner.
blea appealed the alj decision to the federal district court,arguing that the alj erred by not applying ssr to determine the onset date of his disabilities.he also contended that the alj failure to address the evidence provided by lay witnesses constituted reversible error.a magistrate judge issued judgment pursuant to c,holding that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we review the magistrate judge decision de novo and independently determine whether the alj decision is free from legal error and supported by substantial evidence.barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.fowler bowen,cir internal quotation marks omitted.we will not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the commissioner.qualls apfel,cir.because the appeals council denied review,the alj decision is the commissioner final decision for purposes of this appeal.madrid barnhart,cir.we note that any new evidence submitted to the appeals council on review becomes part of the administrative record to be considered when evaluating the secretary decision for substantial evidence.shalala,cir reasoning that because the secretary decision does not become final until after the appeals council denies review or issues its own findings,her final decision necessarily includes the appeals council conclusion that the alj findings remained correct despite the new evidence.
blea presents two main arguments on appeal.first,he contends that the alj should have utilized social security ruling,program policy statement title ii and xvi onset of disability,wl ssr to determine the onset date of his disabilities.second,blea argues that the alj failure to analyze blea lay witness testimony constitutes reversible error,citing tenth circuit precedent,as well as the regulations ssr,and social security ruling,program policy statement titles ii and xvi residual functional capacity for mental impairments,wl ssr,which instruct an alj to consider lay witness testimony.we examine each argument below.
application of ssr 
to qualify for disability benefits,a claimant must establish that he is disabled under the social security act,a e the act.the act states that disability is the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.id.d a.it is not disputed that blea is currently disabled under the act.what is in dispute is when blea became disabled.this is problematic for blea because he only qualifies for disability benefits if he can show that he was disabled prior to his last insured.see id.c.
on appeal,blea presents two arguments regarding why the alj should have applied ssr to determine the onset date of his disabilities.first,blea contends that his arthritis is of traumatic origin under ssr because it was caused by the gunshot wound and presented within twelve months of the gunshot incident,thereby making the onset date of his disability june date of the gunshot injury.alternatively,he argues that even if his arthritis and dysthymia are not of traumatic origin,the alj committed reversible error by failing to follow ssr provisions for calling a medical advisor.before addressing blea arguments,we examine ssr and discuss what it requires of an alj.
ssr is binding on all components of the social security administration,including aljs,b,and sets forth an analytical framework for assessing the date of onset for a disability of traumatic or origin.it provides that a disability is of traumatic origin,where after the date of injury,the individual is thereafter expected to die as a result or expected to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity sga or gainful activity for a continuous period of at least months.ssr,at.where a disability is of traumatic origin,the date of onset is the date of the traumatic injury.id.
additionally,ssr provides a framework for examining injuries that are not considered of traumatic origin under the regulation.ssr states that i n disabilities of nontraumatic origin,the determination of onset involves consideration of the applicant allegations,work history,if any,and the medical and other evidence concerning impairment severity.id.the date alleged by the claimant is the starting point for determining disability onset,and the date the claimant stopped working is also of significance in selecting the onset date.id.medical evidence,however,is the primary element for the onset determination,as the onset date can never be inconsistent with the medical evidence of record.id.at.
ssr also provides that,when medical evidence does not establish the precise onset date,the alj may have to infer the onset date from the medical and other evidence that describe the history and symptomatology of the disease process.id.at.the regulation provides two examples of situations where it may be necessary to infer an onset date in the case of a slowly progressing impairment,when,for example,the alleged onset and the date last worked are far in the past and adequate medical records are not available,and when onset of a disabling impairment s occurred some time prior to the date of the first recorded medical examination.id.at.at the hearing,the alj should call on the services of a medical advisor when onset must be inferred.id.
traumatic origin provisions of ssr 
blea contends that his disabilities are of traumatic origin under ssr,and therefore the onset date should be the date he was shot in the.the alj,without explicit consideration of ssr,did not use this date,finding that blea gunshot wound initially heeled sic well and he displayed minimal pain in the foot.aplt app.vol.i at.
on appeal,blea renews his argument that the alj implicit decision that his disability was not of traumatic origin was unsupported by the medical evidence and contrary to ssr.he states that t he twelve month requirement under ssr was met when,according to the evidence,claimant disabling arthritis had developed as a result of his injury of june and had presented itself by the following year in june.aplt br.at.the government responds that the medical evidence available from june to june shows that blea had been steadily improving and could ambulate effectively thus,the alj correctly decided that the onset date of blea impairments did not correspond to the gunshot injury.
we begin our analysis of blea argument by noting that ssr and our precedent do not require an alj to consult with a medical advisor to determine whether a disability is of traumatic origin.we have previously held that a medical advisor need be called only if the medical evidence of onset is ambiguous.reid chater,cir.if a disability is of traumatic origin,the onset date would not be ambiguous indeed,it would most often be.mason apfel,d.thus,our task at this point is to determine if the alj decision that blea onset date was not the date of the gunshot injury comported with the provisions of ssr and was supported by substantial evidence.
blea asserts that symptoms of his arthritis presented sometime in the twelve months after the gunshot injury,but he does not cite any part of the record that supports this assertion,even though the record contains ample medical evidence for the time period june to june.our review of the record shows that at the time of the gunshot wound,and during the healing process thereafter,there were no indications that blea was expected to be unable to engage in substantial gainful activity for a continuous period of at least months due to arthritis or dysthymia.ssr,at.
although blea still suffered from pain,by january,seven months after the injury,he was able to ambulate with minimal restrictions.aplt app.vol.i at.in march,he sought the advice of a foot and ankle specialist,who prescribed a new orthotic to assist blea in walking.the specialist notes state that,besides some numbness,blea was doing well and is not interested in any further surgery.id.at.finally,a doctor notes from june indicate that blea had no pain proximally where he had the previous bone graft,supporting the alj conclusion that blea was not exhibiting symptoms of arthritis at that visit.id.at.therefore,we conclude that the alj decision not to use the date of the gunshot as the onset date did not conflict with ssr,and that it was supported by substantial evidence.
provisions of ssr relating to slowly progressing impairments 
the issue of whether blea disabilities are slowly progressive impairments,where d etermining the proper onset date is particularly difficult,ssr at,is a much closer question.blea contends that even if the provisions of ssr relating to traumatic origin do not apply to this case,the alj erred by failing to call a medical advisor to assist in setting an onset date.the commissioner replies that the alj was not obligated to consult with a medical advisor because there was substantial evidence to conclude,at step five of the sequential analysis,that blea retained the capacity to perform sedentary work.
we begin by rejecting the commissioner position because it fails to address the crux of the issue.the alj finding of residual functional capacity at step five does not mean that the alj can ignore the clear directives of ssr,which is binding on all components of the social security administration.b.
it is important to understand that the issue of whether a medical advisor is required under ssr does not turn on whether the alj could reasonably have determined that the claimant was not disabled before her last insured date.rather,when there is no contemporaneous medical documentation,we ask whether the evidence is ambiguous regarding the possibility that the onset of her disability occurred before the expiration of her insured status.if the medical evidence is ambiguous and a retroactive inference is necessary,ssr requires the alj to call upon the services of a medical advisor to insure that the determination of onset is based upon a legitimate medical basis.
grebenick chater,cir.additionally,we note that when an onset date is ambiguous,it is not usually possible for an alj to make a decision that is supported by substantial evidence.finally,the commissioner position ignores the possibility that a medical advisor assistance could change the alj determination at step three the listed impairment step of the inquiry,thereby obviating any need to examine residual functional capacity at step five.
in contrast to the commissioner argument,our precedent clearly establishes that where medical evidence of onset is ambiguous,an alj is obligated to call upon the services of a medical advisor.reid chater,cir see also grebenick,at if the medical evidence is ambiguous,and a retroactive inference is necessary,ssr requires the alj to call upon the services of a medical advisor to insure that the determination of onset is based upon a legitimate medical basis.see also bailey chater,cir i f the evidence of onset is ambiguous,the alj must procure the assistance of a medical advisor in order to render the informed judgment that the ruling requires.proceedings before an alj are not inquisitorial rather,a n alj has a duty to develop a full and fair record,and therefore must consult a medical advisor when evidence of onset is ambiguous.see henderson apfel,cir internal quotation marks omitted.in the absence of clear evidence documenting the progression of the claimant condition,the alj does not have the discretion to forgo consultation with a medical advisor.bailey,at.
thus,the issue of whether the alj erred by failing to call a medical advisor turns on whether the evidence concerning the onset of blea disabilities was ambiguous,or alternatively,whether the medical evidence clearly documented the progression of his conditions.below,we examine the medical record with respect to both of blea disabilities.we conclude that blea medical record was ambiguous,did not clearly document the progression of his impairments,and presented a situation where the alj needed to infer an onset date both for blea dysthymia and arthritis.therefore,we remand this case to the alj with instructions to follow the provisions of ssr and call a medical advisor 
the alj found that blea did not prove he suffered from arthritis prior to december,relying primarily on three inferences he made from the medical evidence in the record.first,at a march visit with a specialist,blea indicated that he was not interested in further surgery.it is reasonable to infer then,that he was at least partially satisfied with the result of the surgery he had before.aplt app.vol.i,at.second,with respect to blea june visit to a doctor for treatment after stubbing his toe while carrying his child,the alj determined that it is apparent that at that time,he was able to ambulate effectively enough to feel comfortable carrying his baby.id.third,with respect to the gap in medical evidence from june to january,the alj stated that i t stands to reason that if the claimant pain was so severe as to be completely debilitating as alleged,he would have sought medical attention throughout this period.id.
these inferences are not reasonable because they do not necessarily flow from the facts.first,it is equally reasonable to think that blea declined further surgery because he did not wish to endure another painful eighth it is to think that he was not interested in surgery because he was fully recovered.second,although he carried his child,he may have done so out of because he was fully recovered.third,as other evidence suggested,it is also reasonable to infer that the gap in medical treatment occurred,not because blea felt better,but because he was dysthymic and dependent on alcohol.
thus,we find these inferences insufficient to support the alj decision in light of the requirements of ssr.blea medical record is indisputably incomplete during a pertinent time period,june to december.but,rather than call ing on the services of a medical advisor when onset must be inferred,the alj made negative inferences against blea due to the gap in the medical record.ssr at.an alj may not make negative inferences from an ambiguous record rather,it must call a medical advisor pursuant to ssr.reid,at.the requirement that,in all but the most plain cases,a medical advisor be consulted prior to inferring an onset date is merely a variation on the most pervasive theme in administrative substantial evidence support an agency decisions.bailey,at.
in this regard,we find the fourth circuit opinion in bailey chater,particularly instructive.in bailey,a claimant had a number of ailments that he acquired over a few years,including diabetes,anxiety,high blood pressure,and allergies.the alj had fixed the claimant onset date two years after the date on which she had asserted her disability began.the fourth circuit reversed and remanded with instructions for the alj to call a medical advisor pursuant to ssr because the evidence regarding the onset date is ambiguous in the absence of clear evidence documenting the progression of the claimant condition,the alj did not have the discretion to forgo consultation with a medical a
