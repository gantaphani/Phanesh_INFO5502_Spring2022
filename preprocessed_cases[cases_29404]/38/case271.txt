a recipient of medicare benefits appeals an order requiring her to reimburse the secretary of the department of health and human services for the amount of those benefits,from a malpractice settlement she received from one of her health care providers.the district court concluded that federal law,specifically the medicare secondary payer provisions of the medicare act,entitled the secretary to such reimbursement.see brown thompson,d.we affirm,albeit on somewhat different grounds than those relied on by the district court.
jeannette brown received medical treatment on august and,from health care facilities owned and operated by kaiser foundation health plan for the states kaiser.on august,brown was admitted to the fairfax hospital emergency room for a perforated sigmoid colon and significant sepsis,where she remained for days.the secretary made medicare payments to brown for medical services rendered during this hospitalization.
in february,brown filed a medical malpractice suit against kaiser in state court,alleging that the kaiser physicians provided negligent care in failing to promptly admit her to a hospital.several months later,brown notified a medicare intermediary by letter of the potential to recover those payments made as a result of the malpractice brown letter asked medicare to submit an itemized statement of its claims for reimbursement.the intermediary replied,providing an initial estimate of its claims incurred as a result of the malpractice and notifying brown that medicare claim must be paid up front out of settlement proceeds before any distribution occurs.
a few days before the scheduled january trial date of the state malpractice case,brown settled her claims against kaiser for.thereafter,brown and the medicare intermediary exchanged letters disputing the exact amount medicare should be reimbursed from the settlement proceeds.after several such letters,however,brown informed the intermediary that she had decided to decline payment altogether because it had come to her attention that a number of cases have held that medicare is not entitled to reimbursement where no prompt primary pay e r of medical bills existed.
a month later,brown filed the complaint in this case,seeking a declaratory judgment that the secretary had no claim to her medical malpractice settlement proceeds or,alternatively,that the secretary must adjust his claim downward.the parties ultimately entered into a stipulation agreeing to the reimbursement amount owed to the secretary,if he did,indeed,have a claim to brown settlement proceeds.
the district court,then,had before it only two questions whether the medicare secondary payer provisions entitled the secretary to claim a portion of the kaiser settlement payment as reimbursement for the earlier medicare payments occasioned by the malpractice,given that at the time the medicare payments were made,the settlement was not reasonably expected to be paid promptly,and w hether the kaiser plan,which funded the malpractice settlement,qualifies as a primary plan under these provisions.brown,d at.the district court answered both questions in the affirmative and granted summary judgment to the secretary.id.at.brown timely appealed.in resolving her appeal,we address each issue in seriatim.
in,congress initiated a series of amendments to the medicare act,designed to reduce medicare costs by making the government a secondary provider of medical insurance coverage when a medicare recipient has other sources of primary insurance coverage.thompson goetzmann,cir.these amendments have been codified at b and are referred to as the medicare secondary payer provisions msp.the question of statutory interpretation before us on appeal arises from an amendment made to msp in.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,b,stat.
in particular,brown advances an interpretation based on two portions of msp,as it existed after the word promptly in b a ii subparagraph a ii,and the phrase to which subparagraph a applies in b b i subparagraph b i.read together,brown argues that these phrases mean that medicare has no right to reimbursement of a payment made by a primary plan listed in subparagraph a ii a list that contains a liability insurance policy or plan including a plan unless medicare could have reasonably expected that primary plan to pay promptly at the time medical services were provided.b a ii,b i.
regulations of the health care financing administration hcfa now centers for medicare and medicaid services provide that a payment is made promptly if made within days after the earlier of the date the care was provided or the date a claim was filed with the insurer.because,in the present case,kaiser could not reasonably have been expected to make any payment to brown within days of the medical services provided and,indeed,kaiser did not agree to settle with brown for more than a year after providing her medical services,the adoption of brown interpretation of msp would mean that brown was not required to reimburse medicare out of her settlement proceeds for the payments medicare made for brown care.the district court rejected this argument and instead concluded that the prompt payment language in msp simply controls when medicare may withhold payment in the first instance,not when it may seek reimbursement.see brown,d at.
at the time the parties filed their initial briefs in this case,the courts were divided on whether brown was an appropriate interpretation of msp.compare united states baxter int l,cir holding that,under msp,any payment that medicare does make is secondary and is subject to reimbursement from sources of primary coverage under the statute,regardless of whether those sources can be expected to pay promptly emphasis added,with goetzmann,at noting,in dicta,that the plain language of the msp statute makes the reasonable expectation of a prompt payment a requirement for reimbursement,but that this plain language arguably produced an absurd result,and in re orthopedic bone screw prod.liab,holding that msp by its terms limits the government right to reimbursement to situations in which prompt payment has been made or can reasonably be expected by a primary plan see also estate of urso thompson,d,agreeing with the conclusion reached in baxter.
on december,however,the president signed into law amendments to msp designed to resolve this dispute.see medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,stat,hereinafter mma.the amendments to msp enacted in mma removed the two elements that had resulted in these conflicting interpretations,the word promptly in subparagraph a ii and the to subparagraph a in subparagraph b i.compare b a ii,b i with b a ii,b i ii west,westlaw through may.
in its current form,msp clearly provides that the reasonable expectation of a prompt payment is not a requirement for reimbursement.msp now states unequivocally that a primary plan,and an entity that receives payment from a primary plan,shall reimburse medicare for any payment made by medicare with respect to an item or service if it is demonstrated that such primary plan has or had a responsibility to make payment with respect to such item or service.b b ii.it further states that a primary plan responsibility for such payment may be demonstrated by a judgment,a payment conditioned upon the recipient compromise,waiver,or release whether or not there is a determination or admission of liability of payment for items or services included in a claim against the primary plan or the primary plan insured,or by other means.id.
we requested and received supplemental briefing from the parties addressing the consequences of mma.brown does not attempt to apply her interpretation to msp current statutory language,the language as amended by mma.indeed,brown conceded at oral argument that this new language plainly entitles medicare to reimbursement of any payment it makes for medical services if a primary plan later pays for those medical services as part of a settlement of whether that primary plan could have been expected to pay promptly when medical services were provided.
nonetheless,brown contends that the enactment of mma does not defeat her argu
