factual and procedural background 
this dispute arises from an accident that befell richard garcia and rendered him a quadriplegic.in december,when garcia was years old,he fell from a bridge that was owned and maintained by the county.the cable guardrails on the bridge were loose,and when garcia leaned on them he fell over the top cable into the creek bed below.garcia blood alcohol level at the time of the accident was.
the trial court found the dangerous condition of the bridge contributed to garcia injuries.it found garcia total damages were million.however,the court reduced the award to million on the finding garcia was percent responsible for his injuries.
the future cost of garcia medical care and treatment is extensive.he has limited use of his arms and hands,but has no function below the waist.he is confined to a wheelchair and must use a catheter.he also has problems with his memory and thought processes.garcia expert presented evidence the future cost of his medical care and treatment will be million.
various lien holders asserted claims against garcia recovery.asset care,claimed,and health advocates,llp,claimed.the claim at issue is the lien asserted by dhs in the amount of.
following the judgment,the county filed a motion to invoke the court authority under section to expunge reduce the collateral source liens,including the lien,as a case of undue financial hardship.
the trial court found garcia net award,after deducting attorney fees and costs,would be.it determined that reimbursement of a collateral source payment would result in an undue financial hardship.the court said that d ue to the severity of plaintiff injuries,the net recovery,other claimed medical liens,future medical and rehabilitation expenses and plaintiff lack of ability to obtain gainful employment,this case is the type of case the legislature intended the court to exercise its discretion 
the court ordered that the lien not be reimbursed.
discussion 
subdivision b of section provides that a public entity may bring a posttrial motion to reduce a judgment against it by the amount a collateral source has paid or is obligated to pay for benefits provided a beneficiary prior to trial 
in this case the trial court,acting on the motion of the county in support of garcia,invoked subdivision g of section and denied reimbursement of the lien held by dhs on the ground it would result in undue financial hardship upon him.
subdivision g provides that i n no event shall a reimbursement exceed of the plaintiff net recovery but the court may order no reimbursement if the reimbursement would result in undue financial hardship upon the injured person emphasis added.
dhs claims that subdivision f,rather than subdivision g of section is the dispositive provision.subdivision f provides the court must order reimbursement of the amounts which the plaintiff has received from a lienholder with statutory lien rights,such as,pursuant to this section and on terms as may be just.subdivision f gives the court discretion to determine the portion of collateral source benefits to be reimbursed as to other lienholders,such as private medical programs,health maintenance organizations,unemployment insurance,and private disability insurance carriers.
dhs argues that,since subdivisions f and f distinguish between holders of statutory lien rights and other sources of compensation,the legislature intended to give trial courts discretion to reduce a lien asserted by the latter group but not the former.we disagree.
dhs ignores the role that subdivision g,which does not distinguish between collateral sources,plays as a limitation of the preceding subdivisions.subdivision g applies,as noted,i n any event,which plainly signals that its provisions are a limitation on the other provisions of section.moreover,subdivision f is made subject to the section of which it is a part,including subdivision g.
for these reasons subdivision g gives the trial court discretion in cases of undue financial hardship to deny reimbursement of a lien.
dhs argues the trial court interpretation of section does not comport with the legislature stated purpose of limiting a plaintiff double recovery of damages as evidenced by a letter to the governor deukmejian from the attorney general van de kamp urging approval of the public entity legislation which included section.the letter stated t his legislation would limit of damages,providing for a portion of the award to go to the source of those benefits or to be reduced from the judgment.
the significance to be accorded extrinsic evidence of legislative intention depends upon its capacity to resolve ambiguities in statutory language supportive services workers comp.appeals bd.d.dhs can point to no ambiguity in the language of section,the resolution of which would be aided by the letter.the limitation of a plaintiff double recovery can not be the sole purpose of the legislation.otherwise the legislature would not have included any provision allowing the trial court to deny or limit the reimbursement of a collateral source legislative intent may not be used to bootstrap a meaning that can not be found in the statutory language.see city of sacramento public employees retirement system th,d.
dhs sets forth various public policy arguments why the provisions of section should not be applied.it claims the result is in contravention of the purpose of the program,to recover funds obtained from the beneficiary judgment,award,or settlement against a third party.it argues the trial court ruling is inequitable to the taxpayers of the state,and does not achieve the purpose of section,to prevent of damages by the plaintiff.
dhs does not seek to employ the public policy argument to resolve a statutory ambiguity of consequence to the action.rather,it asks that on public policy grounds alone we rule in its favor.
a public policy argument may be employed in the resolution of a statutory ambiguity under proper circumstances but does not stand alone as superior to a conflicting statute.in the form advanced by dhs,the public policy argument must be addressed to the legislature.
in any event,the trial court interpretation of section is not in contravention of public policy.as a rule,injured beneficiaries who have recovered from a third party for their injuries should be required to reimburse for the cost of medical services rendered.however,in rare cases such as this,the amount awarded the injured beneficiary is insufficient to both reimburse and pay for the injured future medical expenses.in the present case,the award was insufficient to pay for future medical expenses,even if received no reimbursement.a double recovery,which will not unjustly enrich garcia,is not offensive from a policy standpoint in this instance.we fail to see how the result in this case is inequitable to the taxpayers of the state.as we see it,will pay for garcia future medical care one way or another.
welfare and institutions code section 
welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a,provides that in an action prosecuted by the beneficiary alone,the court shall first order the payment of expenses and attorney fees from the judgment and then shall,on the application of the director,allow as a first lien against the amount of the judgment the reasonable value of additional benefits provided to the beneficiary under the program,as provided in subdivision d of section 
dhs claims this section is in conflict with subdivision g of section and should prevail as the more specific provision.we disagree.
the direction of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a that the trial court allow as a first lien the reasonable value of benefits upon the application of the director,appears facially inconsistent with the discretion granted the court by section,subdivision g,to deny enforcement of the lien in cases of undue financial hardship.
however,the more specific question is whether the trial court authority to determine whether reimbursement of the lien would result in undue financial hardship is in conflict with the director authority to w aive collection when it would result in undue hardship upon the person who suffered the injury welf,subd.b.
the lien statutes do not expressly provide that the director discretion to impose a lien is a bar to the court discretion to deny reimbursement,when to impose the lien would result in undue financial hardship.to harmonize these provisions is to recognize that discretion to waive or deny reimbursement for undue financial hardship lies with two entities.the failure of the director to exercise such discretion does not necessarily conflict with exercise of discretion by the court.the director and the court occupy different positions with respect to access to the facts upon which such a hardship judgment could be made.the director may not have been aware of the facts showing the hardship that would result from enforcement of a lien.
however,on the assumption there is a conflict we proceed to a resolution of the claim.
it is the general rule that where the general statute standing alone would include the same matter as the special act,and thus conflict with it,the special act will be considered as an exception to the general statute whether it was passed before or after such general enactment.in re williamson cal d,see also agricultural labor relations bd.superior court cal d,shoemaker myers cal d.the rule is embodied in statutory form.w hen a general and particular provision are inconsistent,the latter is paramount to the former.code civ.
dhs argues the lien provision is specific to the recovery of expenditures from third parties while section generally applies to all cases in which the third party is a public entity.we disagree.
the subject of the statutes,of which the lien provisions are a part,is the recovery of expenditures from a collateral source.the subject of section is the recovery from a collateral source,including,when the source is a public entity.the lien statutes apply to all cases in which a lien is applicable,including the case of a public entity.section specifically limits the enforcement a lien in the case of a public agency.it provides an explicit exception to enforcement of the general lien provisions of the statute.
thus,section is the specific statute because the recovery statutes,standing alone,include the subject of the recovery of liens in cases where a public agency is the defendant responsible for the injuries.section is not broad enough to include the subject of liens in any context other than a case involving a public agency.
the trial court was correct in concluding that section is the specific statute and takes precedence over the lien recovery statutes even assuming a conflict exists.
court discretion to deny reimbursement 
dhs argues the courts have repeatedly held the director of dhs has the sole authority to waive a lien,relying on brown stewart d.and kizer ortiz d.neither case is controlling.
in kizer ortiz,supra,d at page,the court ordered payment of a dhs lien,citing brown stewart,supra,for the assertion the superior court had no discretion to disallow a lien.unlike the case before us,kizer ortiz did not involve a public agency defendant,and thus the trial court had no discretion to disallow the lien.
brown stewart,supra,cited by kizer ortiz,also is not controlling.the defendant tortfeasors argued that dhs practice of filing and serving a notice of lien in the third party action was procedurally improper.they argued dhs was required to file a motion or its equivalent,which the court,in its discretion,might or might not grant.brown stewart,supra,d at.the court disagreed,noting that no statute granted the courts discretion over liens and discretion to waive all or part of the lien rested only with the director of dhs.ibid.
however,brown stewart,supra,was decided in,five years before section was enacted,at a time when there was no statutory authorization of judicial discretion to limit enforcement of a lien.
dhs also argues the lien recovery statutes prevail because welfare and institutions code section provides e xcept as otherwise provided in this article,notwithstanding any other provision of law,the entire amount of any settlement of the injured beneficiary action or claim,with or without suit,is subject to the director claim for reimbursement of the reasonable value of benefits provided and any lien filed pursuant thereto emphasis added.
the section is inapplicable,since it applies only to a settlement.the reimbursement claimed here is from a judgment.
federal law 
dhs argues the trial court interpretation of section is in direct contravention of federal law,which mandates that dhs seek reimbursement for benefits provided to a beneficiary whose injuries were caused by third party tortfeasors.
the supremacy clause of the federal constitution prohibits the court from applying a state law that is inconsistent with federal law.county of los angeles superior court cal th,d.
the california program pays the costs of health care of qualifying individuals who lack the funds to pay them.welf.california receives funding for this program from the federal government,et dhs argues that section conflicts with title united states code section a a and b,which states 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide a that the state or local agency administering such plan will take all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties and b that in any case where such a legal liability is found to exist after medical assistance has been made available on behalf of the individual and where the amount of reimbursement the state can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of such recovery,the state or local agency will seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability 
we fail to see how the provisions of section,allowing the court to limit reimbursement to dhs in limited cases of undue financial hardship,are preempted by a federal law that specifies the conditions for federal approval of a state plan for federal assistance.moreover,to authorize the courts to deny reimbursement in extenuating circumstances does not run afoul of a plan that requires dhs to seek reimbursement.
our review of cases from other states yielded only one that specifically addressed this question.the supreme court of illinois dismissed a similar argument against its state statute,holding we believe it is the clear intent of the statutory language used in the reenactm
