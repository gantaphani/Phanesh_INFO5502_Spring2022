arthur bernklau appellant seeks review of the final decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims that declined to exercise jurisdiction over arguments that appellant was entitled to an earlier effective date for a disability rating disability claim,and affirmed a february,effective date for the award of a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability tdiu claim.bernklau west,we affirm.
background 
this appeal involves two separate claims by the appellant for disability benefits for an injury incurred during his military service injury.we will discuss each claim in turn.
the disability claim 
bernklau served on active duty in the united states armed forces from july to june,when he was honorably discharged.following his discharge,the department of veterans affairs agency determined that he was entitled to a disability rating due to a lower back injury.bernklau disability rating was initially set at zero percent in,was increased to ten percent in,and was the subject of a series of appeals and remands over the next thirty years.in an august,decision board decision,the board of veterans appeals board increased the appellant disability rating to a level of seventy percent,retroactive to november.so far as the record reveals,bernklau did not appeal this decision at that time,and one of the issues in this case concerns the finality of this board decision.
though bernklau did not appeal the board decision,he later sought in unrelated proceedings before the regional office and the board to obtain an earlier effective date for his disability rating.ultimately the agency regional office denied the claim for an earlier effective date for his disability rating.on review,the board of veterans appeals affirmed the regional office decision.in denying bernklau claim for an earlier effective date,the board reasoned in pertinent part that t he veteran did not appeal the board decision,and that decision is final.in re bernklau,slip op.at,citing.
the board recognized that a claim which was previously adjudicated,a final claim may be reopened if new and material evidence is presented by the veteran.id.and bernklau provided the board with documents to support his claim for an earlier effective date.id.at.but the board concluded that t he contentions raised in these numerous submissions are,however,duplicative of the arguments raised and considered before the board in august.id.at.thus,it ruled that the additional evidence received since the august decision is not new and material and does not provide the required evidentiary basis to reopen the appellant claim for an earlier effective date for the rating for the back disability.id.at.
bernklau appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims.on that appeal,he argued that the effective date issue was not before the board at the time of the august decision that the board erred in addressing that issue in the first instance and that this error rendered the decision nonfinal.bernklau west,slip op.at,bernklau.in other words,bernklau argued that because the board decision was,the submission of new and material evidence was not required for readjudication of his claim.
he also argued that the board decision was not final because the board had never responded to two communications.first,he characterized an april,letter from his representative to the regional office as a notice of disagreement nod with an october regional office decision to assign appellant a rating for his disability the agency failure to issue a statement of the case to him in response to that alleged nod as required by d,appellant argued,rendered the board decision.second,bernklau pointed to a january,letter to the regional office in which he complained that the agency had overlooked his service connected disability when evaluating his eligibility for benefits for a heart attack suffered in may.that letter,bernklau argued,was an informal claim for an earlier effective date for his disability rating.
the court of appeals for veterans claims held that it lacked jurisdiction over bernklau appeal regarding an earlier effective date for his disability claim.regarding the appellant argument that the board decision was not final,the court noted that the appellant did not reasonably raise that argument to the board of veterans appeals,even though he had been notified on several occasions prior to the decision on appeal that the august board decision was considered final.bernklau,slip op.at.pointing to our decision in maggitt west,discussed below,the court accordingly held in pertinent part that 
t he court,in its discretion,will decline to exercise its jurisdiction over this argument which was presented for the first time on appeal,because the appellant has failed to demonstrate that there are significant reasons for remanding the matter to the board of veterans appeals for its consideration of this argument in the first instance.
bernklau,slip op.at.and the court further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over appellant argument that the allegedly pending claims provided a proper basis for an earlier effective date,as the appellant did not raise to the board any argument regarding such pending claims.id.at.in short,the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over bernklau arguments because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies by first raising those arguments before the board of veterans appeals.
notwithstanding its conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction,however,the court stated that it does not appear that the board of veterans appeals erred in in addressing the effective date issue,and further concluded that even if the appellant could demonstrate that the board in august erred and that such an error rendered the august board decision nonfinal,it appears that the appellant would not be entitled to an earlier effective date.id.at.in other words,the court appeared to rule on the factual merits of appellant claims for an earlier effective date for his disability rating.
on his appeal to the court of appeals for veterans claims,bernklau separately argued that he was entitled to a total disability rating based upon individual unemployability tdiu.it is to that claim that we now turn.
the tdiu claim 
in march,bernklau filed a separate claim for tdiu disability benefits arising from his lower back injury.tdiu benefits are separate from disability benefits,and may be awarded when the disabled person is,in the judgment of the rating agency,unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of disabilities a.to qualify for tdiu benefits where as here,the veteran suffers from a single disability,that disability must be ratable at percent or more id.once the veteran obtains that disability rating or,of course,a higher rating,he is eligible for tdiu benefits.thus,in the board decision that increased his disability rating to seventy percent,the board also accordingly instructed the agency regional office to adjudicate this tdiu claim.
the regional office denied the claim on september,prompting another series of appeals and remands,including an appeal to this court.see bernklau derwinski,wl,unpublished disposition holding in pertinent part that this court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.on september,the board granted the appellant tdiu claim,and ultimately assigned a february effective date for the resulting tdiu rating.in re bernklau,slip op.at.
bernklau appealed this effective date to the court of appeals for veterans claims.on that appeal,he claimed entitlement to an earlier effective date for his tdiu rating based on his january,letter to the regional office regarding his may heart attack,which he characterized as an unadjudicated informal claim for tdiu.in the alternative,he argued that his subsequent,separate informal tdiu claim made during an unrelated board appeal in warranted an earlier effective date.bernklau,slip op.at.
the court of appeals for veterans claims held that bernklau has not demonstrated that the board determination regarding the effective date for tdiu is clearly erroneous,and accordingly upheld the board award of the february effective date.id.at.the court first declined to exercise jurisdiction over appellant argument that the january correspondence justified an earlier effective date,noting that he did not reasonably raise such a contention to the board prior to the decision on appeal.id.at.and the court noted that the board after thoroughly reviewing the hearing testimony,had concluded that bernklau had not raised an informal claim for tdiu at that hearing.id.at.the court agreed,stating that appellant did not aver at that hearing that his back condition had caused him to be unemployable.id.the court accordingly affirmed the board rejection of appellant claim for an earlier effective date for his tdiu rating.this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
our jurisdiction to review decisions of the court of appeals for veterans claims is limited by statute.we have jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.c see generally forshey principi,en banc.unless there is a constitutional issue presented,however,we may not review factual determinations.d.the jurisdictional reach of the court of appeals for veterans claims presents a question of law for our plenary review.maggitt west.
on this appeal,bernklau contends that the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims not to hear the arguments presented in the first instance to that court is contrary to our recent decision in maggitt west,and that court jurisdictional statute.we do not agree.
maggitt presented the question whether the court of appeals for veterans claims has jurisdiction to hear arguments not previously made before the board of veterans appeals.we held that the court of appeals for veterans claims has jurisdiction to hear arguments presented to it in the first instance,provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the veteran claim.maggitt,at.we made clear,however,that the court was not required to hear arguments not raised earlier in the veterans benefit claim process.id.rather,where as here,congress has not clearly mandated the exhaustion of particular administrative remedies,the exhaustion doctrine is a matter for the exercise of sound judicial discretion.id.quoting mccarthy madigan,d.
we further noted that the decision whether to exercise jurisdiction in such cases entails a analysis of the competing individual and institutional interests,including whether the court of appeals for veterans claims should use its authority to remand the matter,as appropriate,to the board of veterans appeals.id.at quoting a.in other words,we instructed that the decision on the issue be in balancing the competing interests of the veteran and the government.id.
bernklau argues that nothing in the decision on appeal indicates here that the court weighed the competing interests of the veteran and the government,when deciding not to exercise jurisdiction over his arguments.because the decision does not reflect that the court performed the analysis required by maggitt,appellant contends that we should assume that the court did not do so,and vacate and remand for adjudication of his arguments.
it is true that the court of appeals for veterans claims did not articulate whether it weighed the competing interests of the government and bernklau before it declined jurisdiction over bernklau new arguments.but that does not mean that we must assume that the court failed to fulfill its obligations under maggitt.
it is that a litigant right to have all issues fully considered and ruled on by the appellate court does not equate to a right to a full written opinion on every issue raised.united states garza,cir,cert.denied,d see also taylor mckeithen,d stating that courts of appeals have wide latitude in deciding whether and how to write an opinion.while it may be desirable in some cases to afford each issue a complete written discussion,no statute or rule compels such an approach by the court of appeals for veterans claims or indeed any other court.see,furman united states,cir there is no requirement in law that a federal appellate court decision be accompanied by a written opinion.
moreover,courts are entitled to the presumption of regularity when rendering their decisions.as we have previously held 
the presumption of regularity supports official acts of public officers.in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary,the doctrine presumes that public officers have properly discharged their official duties.
butler principi,affirming application of the presumption by the court of appeals for veterans claims to agency actions.when this presumption applies,courts may presume that what appears regular is regular,and the burden shifts to the attacker to show the contrary.id.
this presumption is afforded to tribunals in the conduct of judicial proceedings to the same extent that it is afforded public officers in the discharge of their official duties.see johnson zerbst.when collaterally attacked,the judgment of a court carries with it a presumption of regularity.see also michigan doran,d judicial determinations of probable cause to extradite fugitives are clothed with the traditional presumption of regularity,and thus the courts of the asylum state are without power to review those determinations.we accordingly presume that the court weighed the competing interests of bernklau and the government when it declined to hear the new arguments.and appellant has provided us with no clear evidence to the contrary that would rebut that presumption.butler,at.
bernklau also points to the jurisdictional statute for the court of appeals for veterans claims,which authorizes that court in pertinent part to review decisions of the board of veterans appeals.id.a.appellant contends that section requires the court of appeals for veterans claims to review not only decisions of the board of veterans appeals,but also to adjudicate arguments not initially raised before the board.we do not agree,as nothing in section compels or even remotely suggests such a conclusion.moreover,this argument is merely an invitation to revisit our holding in maggitt.as bernklau is well aware,this panel lacks the authority to overturn a prior decision of another panel.hensley west,citing south united states,uspq en banc.even if we could overturn maggitt,however,we would not do so,as we agree with its holding.
in sum,we conclude that the court of appeals for veterans claims did not fail to follow maggitt or its jurisdictional statute when it declined jurisdiction over the arguments not previously made to the board of veterans appeals 
we also affirm the court of appeals for veterans claims conclusion that bernklau was not entitled to an earlier effective date for his tdiu claim.we discern no legal error in the court reasoning that the appellant has not demonstrated that the board determination regarding the effective date for tdiu is clearly erroneous.bernklau,slip op.at.
in his reply brief and at oral argument,bernklau directed our attention to the veterans claims assistance act of,stat vcaa,which was enacted during the pendency of this appeal.he argues that section a of the vcaa is retroactive that it requires the department of veterans affairs to provide a higher level of assistance to claimants than under the earlier statute and that the agency failed to provide such assistance in this case,requiring that we vacate and remand the decision on appeal.we do not agree,as we conclude that the duties imposed on the agency by section a of the vcaa are not retroactive,and thus do not apply to claims pending on the date of the vcaa enactment november.we accordingly do not reach the other issues raised by bernklau concerning the interpretation of the new legislation.
the vcaa instituted a comprehensive overhaul of the statutory scheme governing the award of veterans benefits.three sections of the legislation are involved here.
section of the legislation,entitled assistance to claimants,imposed three obligations on the agency when adjudicating veterans claims,two of which are relevant here first,section a of the vcaa imposed on the a
