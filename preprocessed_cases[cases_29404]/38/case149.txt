appellant roseann zirnsak brings this action to appeal the final decision of the district court for the western district of pennsylvania,dated december,affirming the denial of her claim for social security disability income benefits.zirnsak colvin,wl.for the reasons that follow we will affirm the decision of the district court.
factual background and procedural history 
in october of,roseann zirnsak zirnsak or the claimant was involved in a motor vehicle accident in which she sustained head and lung injuries and skeletal fractures.zirnsak colvin,wl,at.she was hospitalized following that incident from october,through november.id.while hospitalized,she was temporarily on life support.id.upon her discharge,she was sent to a rehabilitation facility.id.four days after entering the rehabilitation facility,she returned to the hospital for a procedure to have her gangrenous gallbladder removed.id.after her discharge following that procedure,she again returned to the rehabilitation facility.id.zirnsak continued to be treated at a rehabilitation facility from january,through october.id.in february of,she suffered a seizure and sought treatment immediately thereafter.id.she was prescribed medication,and she did not suffer any further seizures.id.between january,and august,zirnsak underwent plastic surgery treatments for lipoma reductions.id.at.
in the years following her accident,zirnsak sought treatment from several medical professionals.zirnsak received the following treatment relevant to her mental condition.zirnsak was treated by thomas franz,from february,through february.id.franz treated zirnsak for traumatic brain injury,left hemiparesis cognitive impairments with memory deficits,organic affective changes,and a seizure disorder.id.kevin kelly,treated zirnsak from february,through february.id.he diagnosed zirnsak with a seizure disorder.id.david newman,evaluated zirnsak over a period from april.id.his report summarizing that evaluation noted a suggestion of mild memory loss and a concentration deficit.id.finally,on april,michelle santilli,psy,performed a mental residual functional capacity rfc assessment of zirnsak.id.she concluded that zirnsak could perform competitive work on a sustained basis.id.
on january,zirnsak applied for social security disability insurance ssdi benefits alleging a disability commencing on may.id.at the parties agree that zirnsak date last insured was december.transcript tr.at accordingly,the relevant period for zirnsak disability determination is the period from may,to december.the social security administration ssa denied zirnsak application on may.id.on june,zirnsak requested a hearing,which was subsequently held on june.id.at the hearing,administrative law judge alj james pileggi heard testimony from zirnsak,her husband,and a vocational expert.id.at.on july,alj pileggi issued a decision denying zirnsak application for benefits.zirnsak,wl,at.he found that zirnsak was not under a disability,as defined in the social security act,at any time from may,the amended alleged onset date,through december,the date last insured.tr.at.as part of that finding,alj pileggi found that zirnsak was capable of performing certain jobs available in the national economy,so long as those jobs were sedentary and routine.id.at.he based that finding,in part,on testimony from a vocational expert who opined that zirnsak was capable of working as an order clerk food and beverage,charge account clerk,telephone clerk,or sedentary subassembler.id.at.

standard of review 
this court reviews any findings of fact made by an alj under the deferential substantial evidence standard.g schaudeck comm r,cir.we must affirm the alj so long as his conclusions are supported by substantial evidence.craigie bowen,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.rutherford barnhart,cir.it is more than a mere scintilla but may be somewhat less than a preponderance of the evidence.id.we review the record as a whole to determine whether substantial evidence supports a factual finding.schaudeck,at.when performing that review,we are mindful that we must not substitute our own judgment for that of the fact finder.rutherford,at.we exercise plenary review over the district court determination of legal issues.schaudeck,at.
the administrative law judge assessment of zirnsak mental residual functioning capacity 
the core issue in this case is whether zirnsak was disabled within the meaning of the social security act at any point during the period from may,through december.section d a of the social security act defines disability as the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.an individual is disabled if her impairments are severe enough that not only is she incapable of performing her previous work,but she is also incapable of engaging in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.id.d a.it is the claimant burden to establish that she is disabled.see id.d a an individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless s he furnishes such medical and other evidence of the existence thereof as the commissioner of social security may require.the claimant must also establish that the onset date of disability occurred prior to the expiration of the claimant insured status.
a,sequential evaluation process is employed to determine whether a particular claimant has met the burden of establishing disability.id.a.the inquiry proceeds as follows.first,the commissioner considers whether the claimant is engaging in substantial gainful activity.id.a i.if yes,then the claimant is not disabled.id.second,the commissioner considers the severity of the claimant impairment s.id.a ii.if the claimant impairment s are either not severe or do not meet the duration requirement,the claimant is not disabled.id.third,the commissioner considers whether the claimant impairment s meet or equal the requirements of one of the commissioner listed impairments.id.a iii.if the claimant impairment s meet the requirements of a listed impairment,then the claimant is disabled.id.
if not,then the inquiry proceeds to the fourth step,where the commissioner considers whether the claimant can return to her past work.id.a iv.to determine whether the claimant can perform her past work,the commissioner assesses the claimant residual functional capacity rfc.id.e.a claimant rfc measures the most she can do despite her limitations.id.a.the commissioner examines all of the relevant medical and other evidence to make its rfc determination.id.a.if the commissioner finds that the claimant can still perform her past work,she is not disabled.id.a iv.it is important to note that during steps two through four of the inquiry,the claimant always bears the burden of establishing that she is severely impaired,and either that the severe impairment meets or equals a listed impairment,or that it prevents her from performing her past work.wallace sec y of health human,cir.
if the claimant meets those burdens by a preponderance of the evidence,then the inquiry proceeds to step five,where the commissioner bears the burden of establishing the existence of other available work that the claimant is capable of performing.a v kangas bowen,cir.to meet this burden,the commissioner must produce evidence that establishes that work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant can do.the commissioner uses the rfc assessment,id.at e,and the testimony of vocational experts and specialists,id.e e,to make this determination.ultimately,entitlement to benefits is dependent upon finding the claimant is incapable of performing work in the national economy.provenzano comm r,civil jbs,wl,at.
zirnsak first argument on appeal is that the alj assessment of her mental rfc is not supported by substantial evidence.specifically,zirnsak argues that the alj erred in rejecting evidence from certain lay witnesses and according little weight to the opinion of newman,the doctor who evaluated zirnsak on april.appellant brief br.at.zirnsak contends that both categories of testimony provide objective evidence of a memory impairment that was not accounted for in the alj rfc finding,and that therefore the alj should have afforded them more weight.id.at.
lay testimony 
it is the claimant burden to establish that she became disabled at some point between the onset date of disability and the date that her insured status expired.in zirnsak case,this period ranges from may,through december.as part of the disability inquiry,an alj can consider evidence from sources to determine the severity of a claimant impairments and how those impairments impact the claimant ability to work.d.sources include spouses,parents and other caregivers,siblings,other relatives,friends,neighbors,and clergy.id.d.the commissioner has issued a policy interpretation ruling to clarify how to consider opinions from sources who are not acceptable medical sources.ssr,wl,at.this ruling states that aljs should consider such factors as the nature and extent of the relationship,whether the evidence is consistent with other evidence,and any other factors that tend to support or refute the evidence when evaluating evidence from sources such as family or friends.id.
to properly evaluate these factors,the alj must necessarily make certain credibility determinations,and this court defers to the alj assessment of credibility.see diaz comm r,cir in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support an administrative law judge decision,we owe deference to his evaluation of the evidence and assessment of the credibility of witnesses.however,the alj must specifically identify and explain what evidence he found not credible and why he found it not credible.adorno shalala,cir citing stewart sec y of health,education and welfare,cir see also stout comm r,cir stating that an alj is required to provide specific reasons for rejecting lay testimony.an alj can not reject evidence for an incorrect or unsupported reason.ray astrue,d,quoting mason shalala,cir.
in,several members of zirnsak family and friends submitted letters to the alj on her behalf.tr.at.each letter stated that zirnsak suffer ed from substantial difficulties.id.the alj found that these letters were only partially credible and therefore accorded them little weight.id.at.the alj specifically referenced the three ssr factors in explaining this decision.id.first,the alj acknowledged that zirnsak friends and family each clearly had an established relationship with her.id.second,he explained that the letters references to zirnsak significant limitations were inconsistent with her limited medical treatment during the relevant period.id.finally,the alj noted that the letters did not directly address zirnsak condition during the relevant period from may,through december.id.the alj used the same process to evaluate the testimony of the claimant husband,donald zirnsak.id.the alj noted that donald zirnsak and the claimant had an established relationship.id.however,the alj ultimately found donald testimony not credible because of its inconsistencies with zirnsak limited treatment and her reported activities of daily living.id.
in evaluating the lay testimony of zirnsak family,friends,and husband,the alj explicitly followed the guidance set forth in ssr.he evaluated the relevant factors,assessed the credibility of certain evidence,and explained why he found certain evidence to be not credible.ray,d at.his reasons for rejecting the evidence are supported by substantial evidence,as the evidence did not relate to the narrow question presented to the alj whether zirnsak was disabled at any point between may,and december.we therefore defer to the alj credibility assessments.diaz,at.
in her brief,zirnsak argues that two social security rulings and a series of other cases compel a contrary result.appellant br.at.this reliance is misplaced.first,the two social security rulings relied on by zirnsak are not designed to provide guidance for how to evaluate lay opinion testimony.the purpose of the first ruling cited,ssr,is to describe the relevant evidence to be considered when establishing the onset date of disability,not whether disability exists.ssr,wl,at emphasis added.the second ruling cited by zirnsak,ssr,lists its purpose as to clarify when the evaluation of symptoms,including pain,requires a finding about the credibility of an individual claimant statements.ssr,wl july.therefore,ssr does not address lay witnesses accounts of the claimant symptoms,but rather the claimant description of her own pain.id.accordingly,the claimant arguments based upon these rulings and certain cases interpreting those rulings are inapposite.therefore,the record is insufficient to establish that the alj erred in according little weight to the testimony of zirnsak friends and husband.
newman testimony 
zirnsak also argues that the alj erred in according the opinion of newman,the consultative psychologist who examined zirnsak in,little weight.appellant br.at.under,a claimant is required to prove that she became disabled prior to the expiration of her insured status.matullo bowen,cir.here,the parties do not dispute that zirnsak insured status expired on december.to determine whether a claimant became disabled prior to the expiration of her insured status,the alj must consider all relevant evidence,including medical evidence,in the record.adorno,at citing stewart,at.however,the alj is free to accept some medical evidence and reject other evidence,provided that he provides an explanation for discrediting the rejected evidence.see also stout,at emphasizing that it is the role of the alj,and not the reviewing court,to articulate specific reasons for rejecting evidence.
here,the alj did articulate a specific reason for giving newman evaluation little weight because it was completed considerably outside of the relevant period.tr.at.we must therefore evaluate whether substantial evidence supports that determination.we find that it does.as stated many times in this opinion,the inquiry in this case is limited to the narrow question of whether zirnsak was disabled within the meaning of section d a of the social security act during the period of may,through december.newman examination was conducted on april,over two years after the expiration of zirnsak insured status.tr.at.at no point does the report assert that it is a retroactive evaluation of zirnsak condition.id.at.the report refers to zirnsak current complaint s.id.at emphasis added.it provides a summary of her current daily living activities.id.it then goes on to provide an assessment of zirnsak current mental status as of april.id.at.in short,the report never explicitly addresses zirnsak condition during the period from may,through december.accordingly,the report has little,if any,relevance to whether zirnsak was disabled during that time.for that reason,the alj did not err in giving the report little weight.
the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert 
zirnsak next argues that the alj decision is not supported by substantial evidence because the hypothetical question posed to the vocational expert hereinafter ve was deficient for failure to fully reflect zirnsak limitations.appellant br.at.specifically,zirnsak argues that the hypothetical should have addressed her memory impairment and her task problems impairment.id.at.testimony of vocational experts in disability determination proceedings typically includes,and often centers upon,one or more hypothetical questions posed by the alj to the vocational expert.podedworny harris,cir.usually,the alj will ask whether a hypothetical claimant with the same physical and mental impairments as the claimant can perform certain jobs that exist in the national economy.id.the hypothetical must accurately portray any impairments of the claimant.rutherford,at.this court has held that to accurately portray a claimant impairments,the alj must include all credibly established limitations in the hypothetical.id.citing plummer apfel,cir.
our decision in rutherford barnhart explains the framework employed by this circuit to determine whether a limitation is credibly established,cir.first,limitations that are supported by medical evidence and are otherwise uncontroverted in the record must be included in the alj hypothetical for us to rely on the ve response to that hypothetical.id.however,where a limitation is supported by medical evidence,but is opposed by other evidence in the record,the alj has discretion to choose whether to include that limitation in the hypothetical.id.this discretion is not unfettered the alj can not reject evidence of a limitation for an unsupported reason.id.finally,the alj also has the discretion to include a limitation that is not supported by any medical evidence if the alj finds the impairment otherwise credible.id.
zirnsak assertions that she suffered from memory and task problem impairments fall into the second category of the framework explained in rutherford they are supported by medical evidence,but that evidence is controverted by other evidence in the record.rutherford,at.two medical examinations support zirnsak contention that she suffered from both impairments during the relevant period.doctor franz july,medical examination of zirnsak noted a memory problem.tr.at.his july,medical examination of zirnsak similarly noted memory and task problems.id.at.
however,this medical evidence is disputed by other evidence in the record.first,zirnsak responses to an activities of daily living questionnaire contradict the notion that she had memory or task problems.tr.at.one section of the questionnaire addresses problems you the claimant might have thinking or concentrating.id.at.in that section,zirnsak noted that she did not require special help to take care of her personal needs.id.at.she also responded that she did not have any problems going out in public or getting along with family,friends,or neighbors.id.at.she further stated that she was able to start and complete projects or activities such as reading a book,putting a puzzle together,fixing things around the house,id.she also responded that she did not have trouble understanding instructions and carrying them out.id.at.however,zirnsak testimony at the hearing before the alj contradicts her own questionnaire responses second,zirnsak testified during her hearing that she regained her driver license in may of.id.at she testified that while she usually drove with her husband,she was only able to drive herself short distances alone during the relevant period.id.at.
this circuit does not require an alj to submit to the ve every impairment alleged by a claimant.rutherford,f d at.rather,the alj is only required to submit credibly established limitations.id.where,as here,a limitation is supported by some medical evidence but controverted by other evidence in the record,it is within the alj discretion whether to submit the limitation to the ve.id.while the record in this case is not conclusive as to whether zirnsak had memory or task problem limitations,there is substantial evidence to support a finding that she did not namely,her lack of demonstrated problems with activities of daily living and her ability to drive.the alj therefore appropriately exercised his discretion when determining which limitations to submit to the ve.in making credibility determinations like this one,this court will not substitute our own judgment for that of the fact finder.id.at.accordingly,we find that the hypothetical question posed to the ve was not deficient for failure to fully reflect zirnsak limitations.
conflict between ve testimony and dictionary of occupational titles 
zirnsak final argument is that the alj failure to resolve conflicts between the ve testimony and the dictionary of occupational titles dot warrants remand of her case.appellant br.at.in step five of the disability inquiry,the commissioner bears the burden of establishing the existence of jobs in the national economy that an individual with the claimant impairments is capable of performing.a v,kangas bowen,cir.to determine what type of work if any a particular claimant is capable of performing,the commissioner uses a variety of sources of information,including the dot,the ssa own regulatory policies and definitions found in the code of federal regulations cfr,and testimony from ves.
the dot is a vocational dictionary that lists and defines all jobs available in the national economy and specifies what qualifications are needed to perform each job.mcherrin astrue,no.civil action,wl,at,citing ssr,wl.the qualification categories listed by the dot for each job include the job strength level,general educational development ged level,and its specific vocational preparation svp level.appendix c,dictionary of occupational titles,available at.strength level reflects the estimated overall strength requirement of the job.id.ged measures the those aspects of education formal and informal which are required of the worker for satisfactory job performance.id.ged is broken into three categories reasoning development,mathematical development,and language development.id.reasoning levels in the dot range from level to level.id.important to this case,jobs with a reasoning level of require that an employee be able to a pply commonsense understanding to carry out instructions furnished in written,oral,or diagrammatic form and d eal with problems involving several concrete variables in or from standardized situations.id.
svp levels,on the other hand,measure the skill level necessary to perform a particular job.ssr,wl,at.a skill is knowledge of a work activity that requires the exercise of significant judgment that goes beyond the carrying out of simple job duties.id.svp levels in the dot range from level to level.id.the dot skill levels correspond with the second source of information relied on by the commissioner the cfr.section of the cfr classifies occupations into three categories unskilled,and skilled.a c.unskilled work is defined as work which needs little or no judgment to do simple duties that can be learned on the job in a short period of time.id.a.unskilled work corresponds to an svp level of work corresponds to an svp level of and skilled work corresponds to an svp level of.ssr,wl,at.
the commissioner can also rely on testimony from a ve to meet its evidentiary burden.e.ves are most commonly used to provide evidence at hearings before aljs to resolve complex vocational issues.ssr,wl,at.however,a common issue and the one argued by zirnsak on appeal arises when a ve testimony conflicts with other sources of information relied on by the commissioner,namely the dot.as a general rule,occupational evidence provided by a ve should be consistent with the occupational evidence presented in the dot.id.at.to ensure consistency,courts have imposed an obligation on aljs to i dentify and obtain a reasonable explanation for any conflicts between occupational evidence provided by ves and information in the dot.id.at rutherford,at.specifically,an alj is required to ask,on the record,whether the ve testimony is consistent with the dot,elicit a reasonable explanation where an inconsistency does appear,and explain in its decision how the conflict was resolved.burns barnhart,cir.an alj failure to comply with these requirements may warrant remand in a particular case.rutherford,at.however,this circuit has emphasized that the presence of inconsistencies does not mandate remand,so long as substantial evi
