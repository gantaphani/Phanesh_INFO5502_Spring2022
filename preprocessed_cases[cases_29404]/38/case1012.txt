scott osenbrock osenbrock appeals from the order affirming the decision of the commissioner of the social security administration commissioner that denied his claim for disability insurance benefits dib under title ii of the social security act.osenbrock contends that the administrative law judge alj determination that he was capable of performing substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy was not supported by substantial evidence.we affirm because we conclude that substantial medical evidence supports the alj finding that osenbrock is capable of performing substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy.
osenbrock was born on july.he dropped out of high school after the grade to enter the air force.
in,he shot himself in the left shoulder with a shotgun.the resultant injury did not affect the use of his right hand.he testified that he has use of his left hand for normal day stuff but when he was still picking stuff up,it would slip out sometimes.notwithstanding the injury to his left arm,osenbrock was able to perform the duties of a mill manager at state roofing.
osenbrock sustained a series of injuries to his back over a period of years prior to october.after each back injury,he received treatment and returned to work.on october,he reinjured his back while lifting a cedar block weighing from to pounds while employed at state roofing.after this injury,osenbrock stayed home until his back pain was so severe that he reported to the emergency room of the valley general hospital on october.he was diagnosed as having an acute low back strain and muscle spasm.he was treated with percodet and robaxin.
he returned to work,but on january,because of continuing problems with his back,he reported to the office of bruce rolfe,an orthopedic surgeon at the washington sports medicine clinic.rolfe recommended a magnetic resonance imaging mri.the mri revealed that osenbrock had a mild circumferential disc bulge,and mild paracentral disc herniations at and.he has been unable to work as a mill manager since january,due to sever e pain in back and right leg from two herniated discs.
sam cullison,treated osenbrock on april,for back pain.cullison noted that osenbrock was obese and had significant drinking problems with heavy alcohol use.on may,cullison examined osenbrock and diagnosed him as having chronic back pain,chronic pain disorder,and a history of alcoholism and chronic back syndrome.on.june,cullison examined osenbrock for chronic back pain.cullison concluded that osenbrock was doing well and tolerating medicine and could return to light duty on june.
osenbrock was involved in a jeep accident on july.on july,osenbrock underwent an mri of his lumbar spine.that mri was compared to an mri of osenbrock back performed on february.jay tsuruda,noted that the study of the lumbar spine is stable.the size of the bulge,paracentral disc herniation and right paracentral disc herniation are unchanged.
on august,osenbrock went to cullison complaining of back pain.cullison diagnosed chronic back pain syndrome and alcoholism.cullison recommended absolute alcohol abstinence.
cullison examined osenbrock on september,for depression and low back pain.cullison noted that osenbrock depression was of a fairly profound nature related to his injury.in a examination on september,he noted that osenbrock was having significant alcohol problems and that he had been arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol three times in the last six years.cullison noted that he was trying to get osenbrock a referral to physical medicine and rehabilitation.
on november,ron brockman,an orthopaedic surgeon,and edward de vita,a neurologist,performed a department of labor and industries evaluation of osenbrock condition.they noted that he was working at light duty,and attending physical therapy two times a week.osenbrock reported that he was consuming to drinks per week.they concluded that osenbrock present condition was the result of an aggravation of a herniated disc in his lumbar spine.
on november,michael mallahan,an audiologist,performed a hearing test on osenbrock.mallahan reported that osenbrock had high frequency and speech range loss in both ears and that he may have difficulty hearing in normal family and social conversations.
cullison examined osenbrock on november,for low back pain.cullison recommended that osenbrock continue taking toradol,carafate,prozac and then initiate trazadone.he also recommended that osenbrock continue in his rehabilitation and consume no alcohol.
on november,cullison noted that osenbrock had missed four or five visits at the center for outpatient rehabilitation at providence hospital in everett and had been dismissed from the program.cullison advised him to start antabuse,begin attendance at alcoholics anonymous,and urged him to get back on track with the rehabilitation center.
osenbrock was discharged on december,from the work conditioning program at the rehabilitation center because he stated he would be unable to continue treatment until january.he gave no reasons for discontinuing treatment.in a work conditioning discharge report,brian nitta,an occupational therapist,noted that osenbrock had demonstrated good body mechanics for lifting,carrying,and other work related activities.
on march,cullison noted that osenbrock had not been able to work since march,due to massive increased pain without any new specific injury.on march,de vita and richard mccollom,conducted a department of labor and industries evaluation.they concluded that osenbrock was suffering from l umbrosacral syndrome with evidence of mri findings of and herniated disc,both but aggravated by industrial injury.they recommended full duty except for no heavy lifting greater than pounds.
cullison referred osenbrock to james mowry,for an opinion based on osenbrock worsening symptoms.mowry saw osenbrock on april.mowry concluded that osenbrock physical exam is highly unreliable,and that he was not a surgical candidate under almost any circumstances.he ordered an electomyogram emg examination.
santosh kumar,conducted an emg on april.his report states normal findings in his symptomatic low back and right leg indicate no evidence of acute or chronic radiculopathy,sciatic nerve deficit or peripheral heuropathy.his chronic right leg pain appears to have significant subjective component without any objective neurologic deficit.
on april,mowry reported that osenbrock returned today with his emg which shows absolutely no abnormalities.i do not think that surgery or any other diagnostic intervention is indicated.
steven jewitt,conducted a psychiatric evaluation of osenbrock on june.he noted that m ost significant in his psychiatric history is a problem with substance abuse.jewitt reported that osenbrock has been charged four or five times with domestic violence and arrested five times for dwi.jewitt also noted that he is going to an alcohol recovery program and still drinking while not telling them.jewitt concluded that i do not believe depression can be considered for a significant factor,in that he is still drinking heavily and prozac will have little if any benefit on someone who is drinking a fifth of whiskey several times a week.jewitt also noted that an alcohol rehabilitation program would be essential for a return to gainful employment.
osenbrock filed an application for disability insurance benefits on april.emil hecht,evaluated osenbrock tinnitus condition on october.he concluded that amplification devices may,in fact,help his ringing to some degree and assist in his communication abilities.the record shows that osenbrock did not purchase a hearing aid to relieve him of his tinnitus symptoms.
loren ihle,became osenbrock treating physician in.on february,twelve days prior to the hearing before the alj,ihle submitted an evaluation form to the washington state department of social and health services that stated osenbrock was suffering from depression with a severity rating of.on the evaluation form,a severity rating of is defined as follows mild significant interference with the ability to perform one or more basic activities.the evaluation report also noted that while osenbrock had a history of alcohol abuse,he was not drinking recently to my knowledge.
osenbrock disability claim was denied on july.the social security administration reconsidered the claim at osenbrock request and denied it on november.osenbrock requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.
three witnesses testified at the hearing before the alj on february.osenbrock testified that the main reason i lost my job at state roofing was because i was able to get work because of my back.when he attempted to return to work after he was injured on october,he found that he could not operate machinery,such as a forklift,or do any of the lifting.
osenbrock also testified that loren ihle was treating him for his back and for depression.the main reasons he feels depressed is that his wife is leaving him and he ca really do anything physical with his kids.in response to questions posed by his attorney,osenbrock stated that the most significant side effect from the medication that he was prescribed is that it caused him to doze off and his mouth to dry up.he tries not to drive,because his medication causes him to fall asleep while driving.osenbrock testified that his driver license had been revoked because of traffic violations which included four or five arrests connected with drinking.osenbrock stated he currently weighs about to pounds.he testified that his normal weight was pounds.
milton schayes,an orthopedic surgeon,testified as a medical expert at the hearing.based on his examination of osenbrock medical records and test results,schayes opined that osenbrock has degenerative disc disease in his back.schayes stated that osenbrock did not meet a listed level of impairment.he also testified that he would put quite a bit of limitation on his physical activity.perhaps not so much due to the back condition as due to just some generalized physical reconditioning which i believe is likely to be the case.schayes testified that osenbrock poor physical condition was the result of prior alcohol abuse and a lack of daily exercise.schayes testified that he agreed with osenbrock treating physician that the claimant was capable of sedentary work with a program of physical reconditioning,control of his alcohol consumption,and smoking.schayes stated that with abstinence and daily exercise osenbrock would be capable of probably medium capacity work even with his back the way it is.schayes testified that osenbrock had every potential for being in a lot better physical condition.shayes also opined that he should be in pretty good shape within three to six months.
john fontaine,a vocational expert ve,testified that osenbrock would be incapable of returning to any of his past work because of a physical impairment resulting from the injury to his back and the chronic pain he suffers in his back and right leg.in response to a hypothetical question posed by the alj,fontaine testified that a person who has previously worked as a mill manager with osenbrock orthopedic impairments who can sit and stand at his option and sit for an hour can perform substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy as a timekeeper.
the alj concluded that osenbrock was not disabled because he could perform modified light work existing in significant numbers in the national economy.the social security administrators office of hearings and appeals denied osenbrock request for review of the alj decision.accordingly,the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner.
osenbrock filed an appeal from the commissioner final decision before the district court.the district court affirmed the commissioner decision.osenbrock has timely appealed from the district court order.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
in his appeal to this court,osenbrock contends that the decision of the commissioner that osenbrock is capable of performing work that is available in significant numbers in the national economy is not supported by substantial evidence.we review de novo a district court order affirming the commissioner denial of benefits.morgan commissioner of the social security administration,cir.our review of the commissioner decision to deny benefits is limited to determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the findings of the commissioner and whether the correct legal standards were applied.see g.substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.morgan,at.where the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,it is the alj conclusion that must be upheld.id.
claims of disability are evaluated under a sequential procedure.see a f.at issue in this appeal is whether the commissioner has sustained his burden of showing,at step five,that,in light of osenbrock residual functional capacity,he can engage in other substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy.see f.there are two ways for the commissioner to meet his step five burden the testimony of a ve or by reference to the guidelines at pt,subpt.p,app.tackett apfel,cir.where the claimant has significant impairments,however,the alj can not rely on the guidelines.see desrosiers secretary of hhs,cir.where the testimony of a ve is used at step five,the ve must identify a specific job or jobs in the national economy having requirements that the claimant physical and mental abilities and vocational qualifications would satisfy.b see burkhart bowen,cir.here,the alj relied on the testimony of a ve that osenbrock can perform the duties of a timekeeper in concluding that the commissioner met his burden of showing that osenbrock was capable of performing substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy.
osenbrock first asserts that the ve testimony that osenbrock was capable of performing the duties of a timekeeper was based on a misunderstanding of osenbrock past work experience.osenbrock testimony at the february,hearing was that,while employed as a manager at the mill,he supervised an average of four workers,distributed wood to the workers,and made sure they had work to do.he also testified that he recorded the quantity of wood used in the mill during the course of a day,which involved transferring information from the workers individual logs into the main log,and the use of a time clock to track their work hours.
the ve testified that this experience qualified osenbrock to work as a timekeeper.the fact that osenbrock did not testify that he had worked as a timekeeper is not dispositive of the transferability of his existing skills to the position of timekeeper.transferability of skills is defined in social security ruling as applying work skills which a person has demonstrated in vocationally relevant past jobs to meet the requirements of other skilled or semiskilled jobs.b.further states that 
transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in which the same or a lesser degree of skill is required,from a skilled to a semiskilled or another skilled job,or from one semiskilled to another semiskilled job the same or similar tools and machines are used and the same or similar raw materials,products,processes or services are involved.a complete similarity of all these factors is not necessary.
here,the ve testified that transferring from the position of mill supervisor to that of timekeeper would be a move from skilled to work.the ve testified that the duties osenbrock performed as a mill manager were similar to those required of a timekeeper.substantial evidence supported the alj finding that osenbrock prior work experience qualified him to perform the duties of a timekeeper.
osenbrock also maintains that the alj erred in failing to include each of his physical and mental impairments in the hypothetical question propounded to the ve.in his brief before this court,osenbrock asserts that he 
suffers from degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine with lumbar spine strain,tinnitus,with a moderate to severe,left worse than right,high frequency sensorineurall hearing loss,an organic brain disorder,depression,a substance addiction disorder in partial remission,hepatitis,sleep apnea,diabetes,ulcers,adverse from medications,and is wound to the left shoulder with residual problems in the left shoulder,arm and hand.
appellant brief at.
no evidence was submitted to the alj that osenbrock suffered from sleep apnea,diabetes,organic brain disorder,or hepatitis,nor did he demonstrate good cause for failing to do so.an alj must propose a hypothetical that is based on medical assumptions supported by substantial evidence in the record that reflects each of the claimant limitations.roberts shalala,cir.because osenbrock did not present any evidence that he suffers from sleep apnea,diabetes,organic brain disorder,or hepatitis in support of his disability claim,the alj did not err in failing to include these alleged impairments in the hypothetical question posed to the ve 
osenbrock also seeks reversal on the basis that the hypothetical questions posed by the alj did not cover all of osenbrock limitations.the alj first hypothetical question included osenbrock hearing impairment and the physical limitations associated with his degenerative disc disease.the ve responded that with the limitations on the length of time he can remain seated,osenbrock could not do entry level assembly work,but could work as a timekeeper.the alj then inquired 
i f the use of medications and drinking,poor physical conditioning would not permit either adherence to a regular work schedule,or at least a reliable work schedule,he became short of breath even walking short distances,whether or not it was secondary to medication or poor physical conditioning or smoking,regardless of what that might be,and even the full range of light work or that kind of,that kind of impairment,that kind of impact,he could do that 
the ve replied that a person suffering from the limitations set forth in the second hypothetical could not work as a timekeeper.
the alj did not err in relying exclusively on the ve response to the first hypothetical question that did not include side effects from medication,alcoholism,and poor conditioning.there were passing mentions of the side effects of osenbrock medication in some of the medical records,but there was no evidence of side effects severe enough to interfere with osenbrock ability to work.when the alj asked osenbrock to specify the most significant side effect from all the medications he took,osenbrock stated dozing off and dry mouth.he also stated that he tried not to drive after taking his medication because i fall asleep when i driving.osenbrock concedes in his brief to this court that his drinking was not thought to be a significant problem by his treating physicians at the time of the hearing,and also asserts that there was overwhelming evidence that osenbrock addiction to alcohol had been in remission for at least two years.additionally,the medical expert testified that osenbrock was capable of alleviating his poor physical condition through daily exercise.
nor was the alj bound to accept as true the restrictions set forth in the second hypothetical question if they were not supported by substantial evidence.an alj is free to accept or reject restrictions in a hypothetical question that are not supported by substantial evidence.see magallanes bowen,cir.thus the alj was free to accept osenbrock treating physician february,diagnosis that the claimant depression was mild and would not significantly interfere with the performance of work related activities,and that osenbrock was not drinking recently.the alj was not bound to accept osenbrock testimony as providing substantial,credible evidence that his use of medicine,his abuse of alcohol,and his physical condition would preclude him from performing light work.
the alj did not propound a hypothetical question that included depression,ulcers,hepatitis,or the residual effects of his wound.an alj must propound a hypothetical to a ve that is based on medical assumptions supported by substantial evidence in the record that reflects all the claimant limitations.see roberts shalala,at.the hypothetical should be accurate,detailed,and supported by the medical record,tackett,at.it is,however,proper for an alj to limit a hypothetical to those impairments that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.magallanes,at.
the omission of depression from the hypothetical question is supported by substantial evidence in the record.the most recent medical evaluations by osenbrock treating physician diagnosed osenbrock depression as a mild impairment,which presented no significant interference with the ability to perform basic activities.a treating physician most recent medical reports are highly probative.stone heckler,cir in a case involving a claimant with a worsening condition,holding that medical evaluations prepared several months before hearing are not substantial evidence sufficient to rebut more recent conclusions by a treating doctor.
there is no evidence in the record that osenbrock suffers from hepatitis.indeed,one report stated that there was no evidence of hepatic rupture.when asked about his stomach problems,osenbrock stated that he had ulcers but that he was taking prilosec and surprisingly it works excellent in controlling the pain he had experienced when drinking cold or warm things.
the alj did not err in excluding the residual effects of osenbrock gun shot from the hypothetical question.the record shows that osenbrock worked at his past employment as a mill manager for approximately six years after injuring his shoulder and left arm.osenbrock testified that he is and denied having any problems gripping objects with his right hand.he also stated that he did not try to use his left hand for such things.
the alj rejected osenbrock testimony regarding the impact of his depression,his ingestion of medication,his abuse of alcohol,and the severity of his pain on his ability to work.an alj reasons for discrediting a claimant testimony concerning his symptoms must be clear and convincing.see swenson sullivan,cir.the alj must make specific findings justifying the rejection of excess symptom testimony.the alj findings in this matter satisfied this burden.in this respect,the alj found as follows 
in determining that the claimant can perform light level work activity,the undersigned has also considered the claimant allegations of a degree of pain and limitation far in excess of the objective medical findings.the undersigned believes that he has clear and convincing reasons as required by the law of the ninth circuit court of appeals and social security ruling,to reject the claimant excess complaints.
first,neurological and orthopedic evaluations have revealed very little evidence of any significant disabling abnormality of the claimant upper or lower extremities or spine.
second,the claimant has not been using a strong codeine or morphine based analgesics that are commonly prescribed for severe and unremitting pain.there is no evidence of significant side effects from the medications that he has been taking.
third,the claimant has not participated in any significant pain regimen or therapy program.
fourth,to the extent that the claimant activities of daily living are limited,they are.this is pointed out by schayes,the medical expert,who has indicated that the claimant current restriction of activities of daily living are a lifestyle choice.the claimant does not possess the motivation to do more,which is reflected by his physical deconditioning.schayes has in fact indicated that if the claimant were to commence a strategy to improve his circumstances by stopping smoking,quitting his alcohol consumption and getting on a program of reconditioning,then the claimant would be capable of performing almost medium level work activity on a sustained basis.
fifth,there is no evidence of disuse muscle atrophy,no evidence of a severe weight loss because of loss of appetite from pain,and no evidence of severe sleep deprivation because of pain.also,there is no evidence of attention,concentration,or cognitive deficits from pain.
sixth,despite the claimant allegations of severe pain and limitation,he was released by his treating physician,for return to light duty work effective july,exh
