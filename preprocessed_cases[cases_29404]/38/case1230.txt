background 
the benefits act authorizes the bja to pay a monetary benefit to certain surviving relatives of a public safety officer who has died because of an injury sustained in the line of duty.a.the category of public safety officer includes an individual serving a public agency in an official capacity,with or without compensation,as a law enforcement officer,as a firefighter,or as a chaplain.id.a.the question is whether the decedents were firefighters within the public safety officer category.in order to fall within that category,an individual must be serving a public agency in an official capacity as a firefighter.id.public agencies include federal and state agencies.id.before the bja,the petitioners claimed that the decedents were employed by the state of oregon.here,they contend that the decedents were serving the united states forest service forest service in an official capacity.
in october,a number of state and federal governmental entities,including the state of oregon department of forestry oregon and the forest service,entered into the master cooperative fire protection agreement master agreement.the master agreement was designed to enable the signatories to coordinate efforts for the prevention,detection,and suppression of wildfires.pet r app.in,oregon invited bids from contractors to provide one or more twenty person wildfire firefighting crews for initial attack,suppression,and severity assignments within the states of oregon and washington and elsewhere.oregon accepted the bid submitted by first strike environmental first strike for the fire season.first strike is a private company that works with governmental and private entities to help suppress wildfires.
the interagency crew agreement crew agreement between oregon and first strike stated that t he service s rendered by first strike under this agreement are those of an independent contractor.first strike is not an officer,employee or agent of the state.the crew agreement also provided that other signatories to the master agreement,including the forest service,could request personnel,supplies,or equipment from first strike.
on august,the forest service asked first strike to send a crew to a fire in the boise national forest.first strike dispatched a person crew,including its employees richard moore,david hammer,leland price,mark ransdell,jesse james,ricardo ruiz,paul gibson,and jeff hengel collectively,the decedents and the crew boss,justin krueger.the first strike crew worked there for nearly two weeks.during that time,the forest service supervisor,rick martin,communicated orders only to the first strike crew boss.the forest service supervisor transmitted orders via handheld radio,but was not with the first strike crew and did not direct the activities of individual crew members.instead,the first strike crew boss directed and supervised the individual crew members activities.at some points,the first strike crew worked alongside hot shot crews made up of forest service employees.after nearly two weeks of work,the crew was demobilized on august.while the eight decedents were returning home,the van carrying them collided with a tractor trailer,and all eight died.
petitioners,the decedents survivors,filed claims pursuant to the benefits act.the benefits office denied the claims.the petitioners sought redeterminations from the bja,which upheld the denial of each of the claims on the ground that c laimants have failed to establish that the decedent was serving a public agency in an official capacity and,therefore,have failed to establish that he was a public safety officer under the benefits act.the bja explained the decedents could not qualify because they were employees of first strike,a private company,and first strike was an independent contractor of oregon.first strike employees therefore could not be understood to be serving oregon in an official capacity under the benefits act and regulations.citing.the bja emphasized that its determination was not meant to detract from the great value of the decedent service to his community and to other communities that he helped,or the tremendous loss borne by the claimants.
petitioners sought review of the bja final determination in this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.juneau dep t of justice.
discussion 
we review the bja decision to deny claims under the benefits act to determine whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved and whether substantial evidence supports the decision denying the claim.id.quoting amber messick united states,see also groff united states,chacon united states.here,we must decide whether the bja complied with the benefits act and its own regulations in determining that the decedents did not qualify as public safety officers because they were formally employed by a private company that had an independent contractual relationship with the government.
the benefits act provides that i n any case in which the bja determines,under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter,that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,the bja shall pay a benefit to the officer surviving relatives.a emphasis added.as defined by the statute,a public safety officer is an individual serving a public agency in an official capacity,with or without compensation,as a law enforcement officer,as a firefighter,or as a chaplain.id.a emphasis added a firefighter includes an individual serving as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized volunteer fire department.id.the statute does not otherwise define the term firefighter or the phrase in an official capacity,but authorizes the bja to establish such rules,regulations,and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.a.
we have previously held that congress intended that bja pronouncements interpreting the benefits act would have the force of law,and therefore that we must defer to the bja interpretation of the statute as long as it is reasonable,in accordance with chevron res.def.council.ambermessick,at upholding the bja interpretation of public safety officer to exclude minor apprentices not authorized to engage directly in firefighting activity see also chacon,at upholding bja interpretation of public safety officer to exclude prison inmates serving on firefighting detail.we have established that chevron deference applies equally to the bja statutory interpretations announced through adjudication.groff,at.
we addressed the independent contractor issue in groff.there,the bja had denied benefits act claims brought by survivors of pilots who died while providing aerial fire suppression services.id.at.the pilots were employees of private companies that had independently contracted with state and federal government agencies.id.the bja concluded that the employee of a private contractor does not qualify as a public safety officer within the meaning of the benefits act.id.at.on review,we recognized that the statute did not directly address the status of employees of independent contractors,but that the bja predecessor agency had previously addressed the question in adjudicatory rulings.id.at discussing public safety officers benefits determination re holstine,july,aff without published,holstine dep t of justice,cir unpublished table decision.under that interpretation
