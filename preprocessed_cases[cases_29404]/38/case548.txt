petitioner freeman united coal mining company freeman appeals an order of the bene fits review board of the united states department of labor,which granted respondent herman summers summers claim for relief under the black lung benefits reform act.we enforce the decision of the board.
procedural history 
this is the second time that summers claim for benefits has come before the court.summers worked as a coal miner in southern illinois from to and to.he retired and filed a claim for black lung benefits october.after an administrative law judge alj denied the request,the board remanded for further review and then affirmed the denial.we upheld the board order.summers freeman united coal mining,cir.summers subsequently petitioned the agency to modify its decision,stating that he had obtained new medical reports and data,which strengthened his claim.an alj originally denied the petition,but the board reversed and allowed summers to supplement the record with this additional information.
the case was remanded for further consideration before a new judge,thomas burke.after considering the record as a whole,alj burke proceeded to award benefits in an order dated september.the board affirmed.freeman subsequently filed this appeal and argues that the alj erred in invoking the statutory presumption that summers was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis and failing to find that this presumption was rebutted by the medical evidence submitted by the coal company,which suggested that summers disability is wholly attributable to severe asthma and is unrelated to his coal mining.
ii.factual background 
summers was exposed to coal dust for most of his years in the mining industry.some of his exposure occurred while he was stationed in underground mines between may and november and april to august.during the former period,summers hung electrical wire and trolley wire in old ben coal company mine in west frankfort.during the latter period,summers upgraded the electrical equipment in the bottom of freeman mine in benton.black dust permeated the working environment at old ben,and,according to summers,there was substantial coal dust in the benton mine as well.
the majority of summers exposure to coal dust,however,occurred when he worked inside the offices and shops that were built above ground on the coal company property.summers worked at the site of freeman united crown mine in springfield,from november to july and the site of freeman mine in benton from july to april.he was an unusually hard worker,putting in a straight shift plus one hour of overtime each weekday,and another overtime shift each saturday.moreover,he was on call around the clock.he left the coal company to work at southern illinois university in april but re turned in september to help overhaul the infrastructure of the mine.after several months,he was promoted and transferred to freeman central offices in west frankfort,where he was given responsibility for maintaining and repairing electrical equipment in all of the area coal mines and processing plants.summers worked days a week in this position until he retired in october.
while in the central offices,summers spent portions of almost every weekday inspecting freeman coal preparation plants and portions of one or two additional weekdays maintaining freeman underground mines.he described how the miners activities in the preparation plants stirred up so much dust that he regularly left work with coal tracings all over his hair,eyebrows,and clothes.in fact,he stated that he was probably exposed to as much dust in the coal preparation plants as he was in the underground mines at old ben in the.part of summers deposition reads as follows 
q can you describe the coal preparation plant 
a well,depending on the plant,they are sometimes three,four,five stories high and it has all kinds of shakers.when the coal comes in,it usually run over these shakers to size the coal to get the different sizes.they sell coal on order.some companies want small coal,some want large coal.so this coal is run over these shakers so the small ones fall through,and then as it goes on it gets to the bigger ones,and there is a lot of dust in these preparation plants because they are handling coal all the time.
q could you compare the dust generated at the coal preparation plant with the dust you were exposed to when you were working underground at old ben 
a it a difficult thing.i say it pretty much the same if you around any of these shakers or if you around where they are loading the coal in the coal cars,i would say that you are probably exposed to as much dust there as you are working underground.
summers also explained that he was exposed to substantial levels of dust during his years in springfield and benton.he divided his time among the coal preparation plants,the hoist rooms,and the repair shops.he worked at least once or twice a week for minutes to several hours in the preparation plants,where the conditions mirrored those described above.in the hoist rooms,where he worked for to minutes on weekdays and eight hours on saturdays,machine generators hummed away with circulation fans stirring up coal dust while summers lowered men into the mine shaft or performed routine maintenance tasks.finally,in the repair shops,where summers spent approximately to minutes a day,the dust so permeated the air that he would always leave work covered with coal dust.the shops were,hovels with seven foot ceilings,a lone window,and no exhaust fans.summers used an air hose to blow the coal dust off and out of the machines he restored dust collected on the walls and the ceilings and needed to be swept out periodically.the company did not provide its employees with masks.
summers described the hoist rooms as very dusty areas and the repair shops as some of the dustiest areas on the surface of the mine.part of his deposition discusses the extent of his exposure as follows 
q what were the dustiest areas on the surface at the crown mine when you worked there 
a the dustiest areas 
a well,the motor repair shop was one of the dustiest areas.the hoist room was certainly a dusty area,because in the front of this building we had this large hole where the two ropes went out that were tied on to these buckets.and that window was about,i say,five feet across and four feet up and down,and we sitting there while they are loading coal cars right out in front of this building,and the prevailing winds would also blow it right into the hoist room.it was a very dusty area.
alj burke took summers claim for black lung benefits under submission in.the voluminous record included scores of,dozens of pulmonary function and blood gas tests,reports from physicians,and several depositions and affidavits.the underlying facts were undisputed the parties agreed that summers has severe asthma and such obstructive lung diseases as emphysema,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,and bronchitis.the parties strongly disagreed,however,about the cause of these ailments.two were positive for pneumoconiosis,but were negative.several doctors believed that summers was totally disabled by asthma or copd,but other experts concluded that his disability was substantially caused by his exposure to coal dust.the coal company relied mainly on the opinions of gregory fino summers bolstered his claim primarily with the reports of robert cohen and david hinkamp.alj burke concluded that summers own testimony raised an inference of disability caused,at least in part,by coal dust.the judge then turned to the medical evidence proffered by the coal company in an attempt to rebut this inference.he found this evidence unconvincing and,therefore,granted summers petition for benefits.
iii.standard of review 
we review questions of law de novo,but we give the alj factual findings considerable deference.we ask only whether the alj decision is rational,supported by substantial evidence,and in accordance with the law.peabody coal helms,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a rational mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quoting richardson perales,d.we do not reweigh the evidence,resolve inconsistencies in the record,make credibility determinations,or substitute our inferences for those drawn below.blakley amax coal,cir amax coal beasley,cir.
iv.discussion 
a.the presumption 
the landmark federal coal mine health and safety act of,as amended,is remedial legislation that is liberally construed to effectuate its purpose of improving the of coal miners one component of this legislation,the black lung benefits reform act,et,aids miners who are totally disabled by black lung disease and establishes certain statutory presumptions that help remove the obstacles facing miners who seek to obtain such aid.
because summers claim was filed prior to january,we apply what is known as the presumption imposed by c.that is to say,we presume that summers is disabled by pneumoconiosis if he can demonstrate that evidence is inconclusive but he has a totally disabling respiratory or pulmonary impairment and he is a coal miner who was employed for years or more in either a an underground coal mine or b it is determined that the conditions of his employment in a coal mine were substantially similar to conditions in an underground mine.peabody coal spese,cir en banc.the miner is entitled to benefits unless the coal company overcomes this presumption with rebuttal evidence,the nature of which we discuss later in part.
freeman concedes the first two elements.the experts all agreed that summers is totally disabled,and although the classic form of complicated black lung disease is usually discernible on chest,all but two of summers results were repeatedly negative.see zeigler coal owcp,cir reversing award based on evidence consisting solely of five negative readings and two positive readings.similarly,there is no serious dispute that summers is a coal miner,as defined by the relevant regulations as part of his usual course of business,he worked directly on the coal company property,either within or above the underground coal mines,maintaining or repairing machines that were indispensable to the extraction or preparation of coal.see mitchell director,owcp,cir amigo smokeless coal director,owcp,cir.director,owcp ziegler coal,cir.
conditions of employment 
the next issue we address is whether summers proved that he worked for at least years in an underground coal mine or in a coal mine with conditions substantially similar to those in an underground coal mine.freeman contends that the record is barren of any objective facts from which the alj could have determined the conditions of summers workplace.freeman argues that even the most generous reading of claimant comparable work experience amounts to two years and nine months of actual work underground,and seven years of comparable surface work.we disagree.
the alj finding of similarity was supported by summers unrefuted testimony about his employment conditions.in director,owcp midland coal,cir,we held that a surface or strip miner was not required to directly compare his work environment to conditions underground.rather,the miner could establish similarity simply by proffering sufficient evidence of the surface mining conditions in which he worked.it would then be the function of the alj,based on his expertise and,we would expect,certain appropriate objective factors to compare the surface mining conditions established by the evidence to conditions known to prevail in underground mines.id.at.we conclude that midland coal s evidentiary framework logically applies in this case.coal mines include all of the structures,facilities,and real or personal property upon,under or above the surface of land that is used for extracting or preparing coal.a.summers intermittently labored underground or in buildings located atop subterranean coal mines,performing tasks inexorably intertwined with coal production.therefore,he is a miner,according to the regulations,and we will not require him to prove similarity in a different manner merely because he did not wield a pickaxe and a shovel while he worked.the evidentiary burdens are the same for all miners covered under the act.see battaglia peabody coal,cir t he regulations draw no distinction between underground miners and aboveground miners.
this is not to say,as the claimant asserted at oral argument,that a miner can prove similarity simply by showing that he was in or around a coal mine for at least years,without any further discussion of his employment conditions.such a scintilla of evidence would not discharge the claimant burden of proof.yet on this record,we readily conclude that the alj invocation of the presumption was proper.we find no merit to the coal company claim that summers simply made conclusory assertions such as,the rooms were very dusty.to the contrary,we believe that summers clearly delineated,in objective terms,the awful conditions on the surface of the mine.as we noted in part ii,summers clearly and most vividly described how the tasks he performed in the repair shops,hoist rooms,and preparation plants resulted in dust exposure.he described how the wind and the exhaust fans aggravated that exposure,and he discussed the extent of that exposure.this unrebutted testimony,on its own terms,would have been sufficient for the alj,with his expertise and knowledge of the industry,to compare summers working conditions to those prevalent in underground mines.see blakley,at.furthermore,we note that summers gave additional,convincing,and undisputed testimony that his job conditions above and below ground were pretty much the same.the alj was bound to find similarity after receiving such testimony,for one can not rationally ignore credible,uncontested evidence.see peabody coal lowis,cir.
freeman tells us that the alj erroneously analyzed the work environment because the judge mistakenly believed that summers worked within feet of the mine tipple.in response,we remind the petitioner that just as the alj can not mischaracterize testimony or take statements out of context,the coal company should not distort the record on appeal.summers was asked,how far was the repair shop from the tipple and he responded,it was closer to the other shaft where the men went up and down.if you want to talk about that tipple,it was within or feet.our review convinces us that the alj drew rational inferences from this portion of the record and,indeed,the record as a whole.the judge then determined that summers labored in conditions substantially similar to those underground.we will not disturb those findings.see summers,at.
given the findings of substantial similarity,the issue becomes whether summers work in the coal mines totaled years,as that figure is defined by the act and its enabling regulations.summers clocked in five or six days a week over the course of years.he worked in underground coal mines from may to november and april to august,and he worked at underground coal mines inside miserable workrooms and processing plants from november to april and from august to october.
in arguing that summers can not invoke the presumption,freeman assumes that an individual working above ground must prove that he was exposed to substantial coal dust for the same number of working hours that an underground miner would spend in subterranean conditions over the course of years of employment.using freeman figures,this would be at least working hours or working days the company added up the total number of hours that summers spent working underground and working in the surface repair shops,hoist rooms,and coal preparation plants.the company then divided that figure by eight in order to calculate summers total daily exposure to coal dust.because this number does not equal,the company believes that the alj improperly invoked the presumption we are sure this is wrong.see.
for purposes of calculating a miner length of employment,a year is defined as one calendar year,or partial periods totaling one year,during which the miner has worked in or around a coal mine or mines for at least working days.id.a.a working day means any day or part of a day for which a miner received pay for work as a miner,but shall not include any day for which the miner received pay while on an approved absence,such as vacation or sick leave.id
