the plaintiffs represent a putative class of children whose parents claim that the commissioner of social security the commissioner has implemented a policy the policy that excludes some children from eligibility for supplemental security income benefits ssi benefits in a manner that violates the social security act the act and the commissioner own regulations.pursuant to those regulations,childhood disability is determined by evaluating applicants within six domains of functioning,such as the child ability to acquire and use information.children are eligible for benefits if they have at least two marked limitations on their functioning within these domains or at least one extreme limitation.under the policy,the combined effect of a child multiple mental or physical impairments may be deemed a marked or extreme limitation if the limitation occurs within a single domain.but the policy prohibits the social security administration the ssa from considering the combined effects of limitations in different domains.thus,the ssa will not adjust a limitation in one domain based on limitations in other domains.
the plaintiffs maintain that the policy violates the act command that the ssa consider the combined effects of a child impairments throughout the disability determination process.a g.they also claim that the policy violates a nearly identical provision in the commissioner regulations.the district court disagreed and granted summary judgment to the commissioner.we affirm.
background 
this is the second time we have addressed the plaintiffs claims.we provide an abbreviated version of the extensive background,including the relevant statutory and regulatory history,recounted in our prior decision,encarnacion ex rel.george barnhart,cir encarnacion i.
the act provides for ssi benefits to disabled children as well as adults.see,stat.the commissioner has authority to promulgate regulations to determine eligibility for ssi benefits.see a.in,congress added to the act a provision that applies to all disability determinations whether for children or adults,which instructs 
in determining whether an individual physical or mental impairment or impairments are of a sufficient medical severity that such impairment or impairments could be the basis of eligibility for ssi benefits,the commissioner shall consider the combined effect of all of the individual impairments without regard to whether any such impairment,if considered separately,would be of such severity.if the commissioner does find a medically severe combination of impairments,the combined impact of the impairments shall be considered throughout the disability determination process.
social security disability benefits reform act of,stat,codified at a g.in,the ssa adopted a regulation that repeats this statute nearly verbatim.see disability insurance and supplemental security income determining disability and blindness multiple impairments,codified at.these two provisions are central to the plaintiffs claims in this case.
the commissioner regulations for determining a child eligibility for ssi benefits have undergone many amendments.one important change came as a result of the supreme court decision in sullivan zebley,d.there,the supreme court held that the ssa regulations for determining whether a child is disabled,which permitted benefits to children only if their impairments matched or medically equaled specific impairments listed in an appendix to the ssa regulations,were an impermissible implementation of the act.see id.at.the regulations did not permit a child claimant to show that the overall functional impact of his unlisted impairment or combination of impairments is as severe as that of a listed impairment.id.at.
in response to sullivan,the ssa amended the regulations to require an individualized functional assessment ifa for each child.see supplemental security income determining disability for a child under age,codified at.as a result of the new regulations,a child impairments were evaluated within six domains of childhood activity or functioning.see encarnacion i,at.the amended regulations established a hierarchy of limitations the effect of an impairment or combination of impairments extreme,marked,moderate,and severe.see id.the regulations recommended that children be deemed disabled if their impairments caused a marked limitation in one domain and a moderate limitation in another domain,or if a child had three moderate limitations.see id.
in,the regime for children ssi benefits underwent more changes.congress amended the act to define a disabled child as one who has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment,which results in marked or severe functional limitations,and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of,stat,codified at a c i.congress made clear that children should not qualify for benefits under the new definition unless they have at least two marked limitations,thus making eligibility more restrictive.see encarnacion i,at citing,at conf,reprinted in.congress also eliminated the ifa process,b,stat.at.
the commissioner was charged with promulgating such regulations as may be necessary to implement the amendment,id,stat.at,and issued regulations pursuant to this statutory authority,see et.the regulations establish a process.first,the child must not be engaged in substantial gainful activity.id.a.second,the child must have a medically determinable impairment s that is severe in that it causes more than minimal functional limitations.id.c.third,the child impairment or combination of impairments must medically or functionally equal an impairment listed in an appendix to the regulations.see id.d pt,subpt.p,app.listing and describing impairments.the plaintiffs challenge concerns the manner of determining functional equivalence at the third step of this process.
for a child impairment to functionally equal a listed impairment,the impairment must result in marked limitations in two domains of functioning or an extreme limitation in one domain.a a.the domains that the regulations establish to determine whether impairments result in marked or extreme limitations are acquiring and using information,attending and completing tasks,interacting and relating with others,moving about and manipulating objects,caring for oneself,and health and physical.id.a b.the ssa must determine whether an impairment or combination of impairments causes a marked limitation on a child functioning in at least two of these domains,or an extreme limitation in at least one domain.a marked limitation is more than moderate but less than extreme and interferes seriously with a child ability to independently initiate,sustain,or complete activities.id.a e i.an extreme limitation is more than marked and interferes very seriously with a child ability to independently initiate,sustain,or complete activities.id.e.the regulations recognize that an impairment or combination of impairments may have effects in more than one domain thus,the ssa evaluates a child impairments in any domain in which they cause limitations.id.a c.the question that the plaintiffs urge us to answer in the affirmative is whether the act and the regulations require the ssa to consider the combined effects of a child impairments across domains.in other words,must the ssa consider,for example,whether the effects of impairments that cause a moderate limitation on a child ability to acquire and use information domain and a moderate limitation on the child ability to complete tasks domain result in a marked limitation the plaintiffs advocate that the ssa must consider such adjustments to limitation levels to properly take a comprehensive look at the applicant.under its policy,the ssa does not engage in this sort of analysis.
the commissioner points to two documents to support the existence of the policy an ssa training manual,see ssa,office of disability,publ,childhood disability training student manual,tab f at,and commentary in the notice of the agency final rulemaking implementing co
