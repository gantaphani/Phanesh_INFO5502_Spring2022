background 
appellants jacob wanner wanner and king wright wright collectively,appellants are veterans who sought benefits from the department of veterans affairs va for tinnitus.tinnitus is a hearing condition with symptoms that include ringing,buzzing,roaring,or clicking in the ears.
wanner served in the united states marine corps between and,during which time he developed tuberculosis.he was awarded a service connection for his tuberculosis in.in,wanner sought benefits from a va regional office ro for bilateral hearing loss,which he stated was a result of his tuberculosis medication.in,the board of veterans appeals the board awarded wanner a service connection for tinnitus,retroactive to when he filed his claim,but gave him a noncompensable rating for the condition.
in,wanner sought a compensable rating because of an increase in the severity of his tinnitus.the ro increased wanner rating for hearing loss,but maintained the noncompensable rating for his tinnitus because it was not a symptom of head injury,concussion,or acoustic trauma as required by the version of dc hereinafter,the trauma requirement wanner appealed the ro decision to the board,which awarded him a rating of for his tinnitus on june.the board limited wanner retroactive benefits to june,however,because,on that date,the va amended dc to eliminate the trauma requirement.see a,dc.as amended,dc required only that the tinnitus be recurrent.see,dc.wanner appealed the board decision to the veterans court.
wright served in the united states army between and and has a story similar to wanner.in,an ro awarded wright a service connection and assigned a noncompensable rating for impairment of auditory acuity.following a medical examination in,an ro awarded wright a service connection for his tinnitus but continued his noncompensable rating.in,the ro removed the noncompensable rating and assigned wright a disability rating of for his hearing loss,but stated that the tinnitus did not warrant a separate compensable rating because it was not the result of acoustic trauma.wright again sought benefits for his tinnitus in and the ro again denied his claim,maintaining his disability rating at.
wright appealed the decision to the board and,like wanner,argued that he was entitled to a disability rating per ear for his tinnitus.the board awarded wright a rating for his tinnitus and maintained the rating for his other hearing impairment.as it did with wanner,the board limited the effective date of the compensation for tinnitus to june.wright also appealed his case to the veterans court.
the veterans court consolidated wanner and wright cases and heard them together.appellants argued that,under,they were entitled to a rating for each ear rather than a single rating for both.the veterans court noted that the board did not address the applicability of section,and remanded for consideration of the issue.wanner.at.
wanner also argued that he was entitled to an effective date earlier than june,because the trauma requirement in dc was unlawful.the basis of wanner charge of unlawfulness was both on on the equal protection clause.the secretary challenged wanner statutory argument by asserting that the veterans court lacked jurisdiction over the argument under b.section b,which is the jurisdictional statute for the veterans court,explains 
review in the court shall be on the record of proceedings before the secretary and the board.the extent of the review shall be limited to the scope provided in section of this title.the court may not review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title or any action of the secretary in adopting or revising that schedule.
b.the secretary argued that because dc is part of the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section,it was beyond the veterans court jurisdiction under section b.
the veterans court declined to address wanner constitutional argument,opting instead to decide the issue on statutory grounds.wanner.at.the court concluded,contrary to the secretary argument,that it did possess jurisdiction to review dc.relying on its decisions in villano brown.and hood brown,the veterans court explained that,although it was precluded from reviewing the rating schedule for issues such as intraschedular conflict,what should be considered a disability,and the appropriate rating for any disability,it could review whether the regulation complies with the statutory authority under which disability compensation is paid.wanner.at.furthermore,the court explained,which is referenced in section,authorized the veterans court to hold unlawful and set aside regulations that were not in accordance with law or that were in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations wanner.at see also a a,c.
the veterans court addressed the merits of wanner claim and concluded that the trauma requirement of dc was invalid because it violated.wanner.at.section,the court explained,provides that the united states will pay disability compensation to any veteran for a disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,in the active military,naval,or air service,during a period of war.emphasis added.wanner argued that because the trauma requirement of dc limited the payment of benefits to only certain veterans suffering from disability within the meaning of section provision drew distinctions that were impermissible under mandate requiring the united states to pay benefits to any veteran thus disabled.id.the veterans court also found dc arbitrary and capricious because it was accompanied by no regulatory history justifying the distinction between veterans suffering tinnitus based on the trauma requirement.wanner.at.
accordingly,the veterans court vacated the decision of the board and remanded appellants cases for readjudication under the sole remaining limitation on compensation for tinnitus under the version of dc persistence.the secretary timely appealed and,as we explain below,this court has jurisdiction pursuant to a.

standard of review 
under a,this court may review the decisions of the veterans court with respect to any statute or regulation other than a refusal to review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title or any interpretation thereof that was relied on by the veterans court in making the decision.a.this court reviews statutory interpretations by the veterans court de novo,and may set aside any regulation or interpretation of a regulation that it finds to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law contrary to a constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or without observation of a procedure required by law.d herndon principi,bustos west.review of the veterans court compliance with its jurisdictional statute is a question of law,reviewed de novo.cook principi.
as an initial matter,we agree with the secretary that we have jurisdiction over this appeal under the exception in williams principi.although the issue is purely legal,and therefore within the scope of jurisdiction proscribed by,we have generally declined to review orders of the veterans court,and we have held that remand orders from the veterans court ordinarily are not appealable because they are not final.adams principi.as the secretary points out,however,this court created an exception to this rule in williams,where the court explained 
we will depart from the strict rule of finality when the court of appeals for veterans claims has remanded for further proceedings only if three conditions a
