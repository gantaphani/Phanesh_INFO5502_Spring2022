wilson diagnosed pearsall as follows 
wilson also completed a medical source statement.in this statement,wilson indicated that pearsall was moderately limited in his ability to understand and remember detailed instructions to carry out detailed instructions to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods to work in coordination with or proximity to others without being distracted by them to interact appropriately with the general public to accept instructions and respond appropriately to supervisors to get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes and to set realistic goals or make plans independently of others.wilson also noted that pearsall was not significantly limited in his ability to perform activities within a schedule,maintain regular attendance,sustain an ordinary work routine,work in coordination with others and make simple decisions.finally,wilson indicated that pearsall was not significantly limited in his ability to complete a normal work day and work week without interruption,ask simple questions,ask for assistance,maintain socially appropriate behavior and respond appropriately to changes in the work setting.

a vocational expert also testified at the hearing.the alj asked the vocational expert a hypothetical question about a person who had a neurogenic bladder,would require a permanent catheter change once a month,would need to urinate every minutes,would occasionally suffer from incontinence,did not like to be around a lot of people,had some anxiety and problems concentrating and had some dependency characteristics.the vocational expert testified that such a person would be able to perform some jobs in the national economy,such as small parts assembler,cafeteria attendant,addresser or fishing reel assembler.pearsall attorney then asked the vocational expert about a hypothetical person subject to all of the limitations set forth in wilson medical source statement.the expert responded that such a person would not be able to perform any work on a sustained basis.
in july,the alj issued a decision denying disability benefits to pearsall.the alj found that pearsall testimony regarding the nature,severity and duration of his impairments is contradicted by the medical record.the alj noted that there was some divergence of opinion among psychologists who have examined the claimant.the alj found that lutz opinion was supported by objective testing and a mental status examination and found lutz opinion that pearsall could at least understand and remember simple instructions and sustain concentration and persistence on at least simple tasks to be persuasive.by contrast,the alj found that wilson opinion was not supported by objective testing and therefore was entitled to lesser weight.
on appeal,pearsall asserts that the record as a whole did not support the residual functional capacity of pearsall adopted by the alj substantial evidence did not support the alj adoption of lutz medical opinion rather than wilson medical opinion the alj reliance on the medical vocational guidelines found at pt,subpart p,ap
