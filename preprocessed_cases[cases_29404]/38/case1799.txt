the question of statutory interpretation presented in this appeal is one of first impression whether,pursuant to section of the illinois pension code ilcs west,a participant in the illinois municipal retirement fund imrf who earns concurrent service credits due to simultaneous employment with two participating municipalities forfeits his rights to all imrf pension benefits if he is convicted of a felony which is related to or arises out of or in connection with the participant service to only one participating municipality.
background 
in,august taddeo became township supervisor for proviso township in cook county and held this position until his retirement in.upon his election to the position of township supervisor,taddeo became a participant in the illinois municipal retirement fund.in,while maintaining his position as township supervisor,taddeo became mayor of melrose park and served in that capacity from until.from until,taddeo earned concurrent service credits,as provided in article of the illinois pension code the code,due to his participation in,and contributions to,the imrf as both township supervisor and mayor.
in august,taddeo entered a guilty plea in the united states district court for the northern district of illinois.he admitted that,as mayor of melrose park,he had appointed nicholas spina to the position of village attorney from to,in exchange for cash payments from spina.as a result of the plea,taddeo was convicted of extortion under the color of official right and making false statements on a federal income tax return,both felony offenses.taddeo was sentenced to months imprisonment,fined,and ordered to repay spina the extorted from him.
in december,taddeo was notified by the imrf that,pursuant to section of the code,all of his pension benefits were being terminated as a result of his felony convictions.section of the code provides 
none of the benefits provided for in this article shall be paid to any person who is convicted of any felony relating to or arising out of or in connection with his service as an employee.ilcs west.
subsequently,in march,taddeo requested an appeal hearing before the board of trustees of the illinois municipal retirement fund the board to contest the termination of his pension benefits.at the hearing,taddeo conceded that his felony convictions were related to and in connection with his employment as mayor of melrose park and that,pursuant to section,any imrf pension benefits he would have received as a result of his service as mayor must be forfeited.he argued,however,that he was entitled to receive that portion of his imrf pension benefits which he had accrued as township supervisor for proviso township because there was no nexus between his service for proviso township and his felony convictions.
on december,the board issued its decision,upholding the staff determination that taddeo was disqualified from receiving any imrf benefits.the board,pointing to the language contained in section,reasoned that,because taddeo was an employee and committed felonies related to his employment with one of his imrf employers,he was entitled to none of the benefits provided for under article.
taddeo filed a complaint for administrative review in the circuit court of cook county.the circuit court set aside the board decision and reinstated taddeo pension benefits for his employment as township supervisor.on appeal,the appellate court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.d.
the board and its members,louis kosiba,john novak,max bochmann,thomas ross,martha rademacher,marvin shoop,steven sonnemaker,and sharon thompson,in their official capacities,petitioned this court for leave to appeal,which we granted.we also allowed the teachers retirement system of the state of illinois and the state universities retirement system of illinois to submit an amicus curiae brief in support of the board.we also granted robert grever leave to submit an amicus curiae brief in support of taddeo.
as noted earlier,the facts in the case at bar are uncontested.the matter to be resolved in this appeal is the proper interpretation of the pension forfeiture provision which disqualifies a member of the illinois municipal retirement fund from receiving pension benefits if convicted of a felony relating to or arising out of or in connection with his service as an employee.ilcs west.the interpretation of this statutory provision is a question of law.see mattis state universities retirement system.consequently,we review the board interpretation of the relevant pension code provision de novo.shields judges retirement system.we acknowledge that the interpretation of a statute by the agency charged with its administration is generally given deference but it is not binding and,if erroneous,will be rejected.shields,at,citing city of decatur american federation of state,county,municipal employees,local.
our primary goal when interpreting the language of a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.devoney retirement board of the policemen annuity benefit fund.legislative intent is best derived from the language of the statute itself,which,if unambiguous,should be enforced as written.mattis,at,devoney,at.if the statutory language is susceptible to more than one interpretation,however,legislative intent may be ascertained by considering the entire act,its nature,its object,and the consequences resulting from different constructions.shields,at,citing fumarolo chicago board of education.it should be remembered,too,that pension statutes are to be liberally construed in favor of the rights of the pensioner.shields,at,citing matsuda cook county employees officers annuity benefit fund.
in the case at bar,the board argues that the plain language of section must be read literally and,when so read,requires us to find that none of the benefits provided for in article may be paid if the imrf participant commits any felony relating to or arising out of or in connection with his service as an employee.according to the board,the statutory phrase as an employee should be interpreted broadly to mean as an employee of any imrf employer.based on this interpretation,the board claims that section unambiguously provides that,if a participant in the imrf commits a felony related to his employment with any participating municipality,the employee shall receive none of the benefits.we disagree.
in devoney,we interpreted section of the pension code,one of several identical pension disqualification provisions contained in the code section governs police officers participating in the policemen annuity and benefit fund of the city of chicago and provides 
none of the benefits provided for in this article shall be paid to any person who is convicted of any felony relating to or arising out of or in connection with his service as a policeman.ilcs west.
we held that w hen applying the pension disqualification statutes,including section,the pivotal inquiry is whether a nexus exists between the employee criminal wrongdoing and the performance of his official duties.devoney,at.the appellate court had found a nexus because devoney unlawful activity a scheme to defraud an insurance company and his official duties based on the fact that he had violated his sworn duty as a police officer to report crime and arrest persons engaged in criminal conduct.we rejected this rationale and held that what triggers disqualification is the existence of a connection between the actual felony conviction and the officer service as a policeman.devoney,at.we subsequently affirmed the board decision to disqualify devoney based on our finding that the nexus requirement was satisfied because devoney would not have been in a position or selected to participate in the scheme to defraud but for the fact that he was a police officer of high rank.devoney,at.
applying the reasoning of devoney to the case at bar,it is clear that taddeo is entitled to the imrf pension he earned for his service as township supervisor.according to devoney,pension benefits are forfeited only if there is a clear and specific connection between the felony committed and the participant employment.here,as t
