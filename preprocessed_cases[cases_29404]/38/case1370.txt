leroy comer appeals the judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims which held that he had not properly raised the issue of whether he was entitled to an earlier effective date for total disability based on individual unemployability tdiu benefits.see comer nicholoson,wl.vet.claims lexis.july,veterans court decision.because we conclude that the court misinterpreted roberson principi,when it held that the duty to sympathetically and fully construe a pro se veteran filings did not apply to an appeal submitted to the board of veterans appeals following a rating determination,we reverse and remand.
background 
from to,comer served on active duty in the united states army.from to,he served in vietnam,where his duties included guarding an ammunition depot that was,he asserts,under mortar attack almost every night.
on december,comer,acting pro se,filed a claim for disability benefits with the waco,texas,regional office ro of the department of veterans affairs va.he claimed entitlement to service connection for stress disorder ptsd,asserting that he suffered from nightmares,depression and headaches.although he was rated as percent disabled due to ptsd,the ro declined to award him disability benefits,concluding that the evidence did not establish that his ptsd was connected to his vietnam service.
on february,comer asked that his original claim for service connection for ptsd be reopened.his request to reopen was denied by the ro,but on appeal the board reversed after determining that new evidence had been submitted that was so significant that it must be considered in order to fairly decide the merits of the claim.in re comer,slip op.at,board decision.in remanding the reopened claim to the ro,the board noted that comer had been diagnosed with ptsd and that it generally appears that the diagnosis of ptsd is related to service.id.at.
on remand,the ro granted comer service connection for his previously rated percent ptsd disability.the disability rating was effective as of february,the date he filed the motion to reopen his claim.in march,comer submitted a notice of disagreement,requesting that he be assigned a disability rating higher than percent and that his benefits be made retroactive to his original ptsd claim.in response,the ro increased the disability rating to percent,but did not change the effective date for his benefits.
in june,comer filed an appeal with the board.he sought benefits retroactive to his original ptsd claim and an increased disability rating.he filed pro se,although a representative from the disabled american veterans dav organization submitted a statement on his behalf.
while his appeal was pending,the va,on may,gave comer a classification and pension c p exam.the examining physician diagnosed him with ptsd and noted that,since his last c p exam,he had had no stable job.the physician further observed that comer reported having nightmares and flashbacks about the war once weekly and that these nightmares increased when he was under stress.following the c p exam,the ro assigned comer an increased disability rating of percent and,based on his demonstrated employment problems,granted him tdiu benefits.both the percent disability rating and the tdiu award were effective as of may,the date of the c p exam.
subsequently,on february,the board denied comer request for an increased rating for the period from february,to may.it also denied his request for disability benefits prior to.the board stated that it could not award benefits retroactive to comer initial claim for benefits because he had not specifically alleged clear and unmistakable error in the earlier rating decision.in re comer,slip op.at,board decision.
comer,now represented by counsel,appealed to the veterans court.the court held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the issue of whether comer should have been granted tdiu benefits prior to may,because he had not specifically raised that issue in his notice of disagreement with the board decision.see veterans court decision,wl at.the court also rejected his argument that the va had failed to comply with its notice obligations under a,concluding that the va had provided comer with notice of what evidence the va was responsible for obtaining and what comer could do to assist in the process.veterans court decision,wl at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.

discussion 
this court has authority to review decisions of the veterans court regarding the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.c flores nicholson.we review the interpretation of statutory provisions without deference.stanley principi,howard gober.in cases where the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of a veteran claim,we treat the application of law to undisputed fact as a question of law.conley peake,see groves peake.
comer first argues that the veterans court misconstrued roberson,at,when it held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the issue of whether he was entitled to an earlier effective date for tdiu benefits because he had not explicitly raised that issue before the board.in his view,roberson requires the board to consider whether a tdiu award is warranted whenever a pro se claimant seeks a higher disability rating and submits cogent evidence of unemployability,regardless of whether he states specifically that he is seeking tdiu benefits.we agree.
in roberson,a veteran,who had had significant employment difficulties,filed a pro se claim seeking disability benefits,but did not specify that he was seeking a tdiu award.at.the ro awarded him a percent disability rating for ptsd,but did not consider whether he also might be entitled to a tdiu award,which would entitle him to a percent disability rating.see total disability ratings for compensation may be assigned,where the schedular rating is less than total,when the disabled person is,in the judgment of the rating agency,unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of disabilities.roberson later sought to reopen his claim,asserting that the ro decision contained clear and unmistakable error cue because the ro had failed to consider his entitlement to tdiu benefits.the veterans court rejected this argument,concluding that he had no right to tdiu benefits because he had not specifically requested them in his initial claim.
on appeal,this court reversed.we concluded that although roberson had not specifically requested tdiu benefits,the va was required to consider his entitlement to such benefits because the record contained clear evidence of his unemployability.roberson,at.we explained that regardless of whether a claim is specifically labeled as a claim for tdiu,the va is obligated to determine all potential claims raised by the evidence.id.accordingly,the va must consider whether a tdiu award is warranted whenever a veteran submits evidence of a medical disability and makes a claim for the highest rating possible,and additionally submits evidence of unemployability.id.
a similar analysis applies here.like roberson,comer,acting pro se,sought an increased disability rating like roberson,comer presented persuasive evidence of his unemployability he has not been employed on a basis since and the veterans court did not dispute that there was extensive record evidence of comer employment difficulties.veterans court decision,wl at.thus,as in roberson,the va should have considered comer entitlement to tdiu benefits.although he did not explicitly assert the right to a tdiu award for the period from february,to may,his pro se appeal,which sought an earlier effective date and a higher disability rating for ptsd benefits was sufficient,when coupled with the evidence showing his unemployability,to raise the issue of his entitlement to an earlier effective date for his tdiu award.simply put,under roberson,a claim to tdiu benefits is not a claim that must be pled with specificity it is implicitly raised whenever a pro se veteran,who presents cogent evidence of unemployability,seeks to obtain a higher disability rating.see szemraj principi,the va is required,regardless of the specific labels claims are given in the veteran pleadings,to read pro se submissions sympathetically and to determine all potential claims raised by the evidence.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the government,however,attempts to distinguish comer situation from that presented in roberson.in its view,roberson does not apply a to appeal submissions to the board following an initial rating determination,or b to situations in which a veteran is assisted by a representative from a veterans service organization.
the government concedes that under roberson the ro has the duty to consider whether a claimant is entitled to a tdiu award,even when entitlement to tdiu benefits is not explicitly raised.it contends,however,that roberson is inapplicable here because comer does not seek a sympathetic reading of a claim or pleading but,instead,seeks the board review of an issue that was not raised on appeal.
the government reads roberson too narrowly.this is not the first time that it has advanced an overly restrictive interpretation of roberson,and this will not be the first time its efforts will be rejected.see andrews nicholson,roberson is not limited to its particular facts and instead requires,with respect to all pro se pleadings,that the va give a sympathetic reading to the veteran filings.internal quotation marks omitted szemraj,at but our decision in roberson is not limited to its particular facts as the court of appeals for veterans claims appears to have suggested here.moody principi,the va is required to give a sympathetic reading to a veteran filings even where the facts of a particular case do not coincide with the facts presented in roberson.although roberson involved an initial claim submitted to an ro,there is no reason that the rule it articulated should not apply with equal force to a notice of disagreement submitted after an ro decision.unlike at the veterans court,where proceedings are more adversarial in nature,see forshey principi,en banc,in proceedings before the board,the relationship between the veteran and the government is and,jaquay principi.because of the paternalistic nature of the proceedings,the board,like the ro,is required to fully and sympathetically develop the veteran claim to its optimum before deciding it on the merits.mcgee peake,citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
here,comer appealed a ro decision that granted him an increased ptsd disability rating of percent and a tdiu award,both of which were effective may.his appeal asserted that he was entitled to an increased evaluation for ptsd and an earlier effective date for his ptsd disability benefits.although comer did not state specifically that he was entitled to an earlier effective date for his tdiu award,his claim for an increased rating and an earlier effective date for his ptsd benefits,coupled with the persuasive and pervasive evidence in the record demonstrating his unemployability,was sufficient to raise the issue of his entitlement to an earlier effective date for his tdiu award as well.while the veterans court correctly noted that a veteran is obligated to raise an issue in a notice of disagreement if he wishes to preserve his right to assert that issue on appeal,see veterans court decision,wl at,the determination of whether an issue has been properly raised must be made with due regard for the va duty to read a veteran submissions sympathetically.in other words,the va duty to read an appeal submission sympathetically to ascertain all potential claims it contains is antecedent to its duty to ensure that an issue has been properly raised on appeal.andrews,at t he va duty to sympathetically read a veteran pro se cue motion to discern all potential claims is antecedent to a determination of whether a cue claim has been pled with specificity.
indeed,specifically provides that the board is required to construe an appellant arguments in a liberal manner for purposes of determining whether they raise issues on appeal.see robinson mansfield,t he board is required to consider all issues raised either by the claimant or by the evidence of record.indeed,by regulation,the board is required to construe an appellant arguments in a liberal manner citations and internal quotation marks omitted.a liberal and sympathetic reading of appeal submissions is necessary because a pro se veteran may lack a complete understanding of the subtle differences in various forms of va disability benefits and of the sometimes arcane terminology used to describe those benefits.see hughes rowe,d pleadings drafted by pro se litigants should be held to a lesser standard than those drafted by lawyers since a n unrepresented litigant should not be punished for his failure to recognize subtle factual or legal deficiencies in his claims.forshey,at i n situations where a party appeared pro se before the lower court,a court of appeals may appropriately be less stringent in requiring that the issue have been raised explicitly below.
the government interest in veterans cases is not that it shall win,but rather that justice shall be done,that all veterans so entitled receive the benefits due to them.barrett nicholson,see also jaquay,at congress has created a paternalistic veterans benefits system to care for those who served their country in uniform.the va disability compensation system is not meant to be a trap for the unwary,or a stratagem to deny compensation to a veteran who has a valid claim,but who may be unaware of the various forms of compensation available to him.to the contrary,the va has the affirmative duty to assist claimants by informing veterans of the benefits available to them and assisting them in developing claims they may have.jaquay,at.the need for such assistance is particularly acute where,as here,a veteran is afflicted with a significant psychological disability at the time he files his appeal.see board decision,slip op.at noting that comer symptoms have included nightmares and flashbacks,sleep impairment,depression,flat affect and self isolation.
we also reject the government contention that the board had no duty to construe comer appeal sympathetically because he had assistance from an aide from a veterans service organization.although we have held that the duty to construe a veteran filings sympathetically does not necessarily apply when a veteran is represented by an attorney,andrews,at,the assistance provided by the dav aide is not the equivalent of legal representation.comer filed his initial claim pro se,appealed the decision denying him benefits pro se,and filed his initial notices of disagreement pro se.it was not until after he had filed his appeal that a dav aide,in december,filed a statement on his behalf.this sort of limited assistance is insufficient to disqualify comer as a pro se claimant.
indeed,even if comer had received more significant assistance from the dav,representation by an organizational aide is not equivalent to representation by a licensed attorney.although aides from veterans service organizations provide invaluable assistance to claimants seeking to find their way through the labyrinthine corridors of the veterans adjudicatory system,they are not generally trained or licensed in the practice of law.cook brown.thus,in jaquay,at,we excused the fact that a veteran had sent his appeal to the wrong address,even though he had had some assistance from a representative from a veterans service organization.
the dav was created by congressional charter to advance the interests of all wounded,injured,and disabled american veterans and to cooperate with the department of veterans affairs in advancing the condition,health,and interests of disabled veterans.emphasis added.since the function of aides from the dav is to cooperate with the va in obtaining benefits for disabled veterans,their role is fundamentally different from attorneys who represent clients in adversarial proceedings.see stanley principi,noting that lawyers had b
