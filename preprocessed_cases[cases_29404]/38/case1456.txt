we review the legal aspects of a determination by the court of federal claims that the appellant claim was barred by the statute of limitations without deference.caldwell united states,citing applegate united states.
in brown park development united states,we articulated when the continuing claim doctrine applies 
in order for the continuing claim doctrine to apply,the plaintiff claim must be inherently susceptible to being broken down into a series of independent and distinct events or wrongs,each having its own associated damages however,a claim based upon a single distinct event,which may have continued ill effects later on,is not a continuing claim.
our predecessor court has held the continuing claim doctrine is applicable where e ach wrong constitute d an alleged violation of a statute or regulation that occurred when that particular wrong occurred,independent of the accrual of other wrongs.id.in burich united states,for example,burich asserted that he was entitled to overtime rather than the premium payments he had received for his overtime work.because compensation was due and payable periodically,we found that a claim arose each time the government allegedly failed to pay the proper amount of overtime pay and ruled that the continuing claim doctrine was available.id.at see also beebe united states,noting that a separate cause of action accrued each time overtime compensation was excluded from plaintiff pay.
similar findings were made in batten united states.batten involved a claim for periodic installments of back pay allegedly owed civilian employees of the navy due to an hourly wage increase.while not needing to reach the issue of the statute of limitations,we specifically noted that such facts gave rise to a continuing claim involving multiple causes of action,each one arising at the time the government fail ed to make the payment alleged to be due.id.at.
on the other hand,if there was only a single alleged wrong,even though the wrong caused later adverse effects,our case law has said the continuing claim doctrine is not applicable.hart united states,for example,involved a suit by the widow of a retired air force sergeant seeking annuity benefits allegedly due her since the date of her husband death.she claimed that the government had violated a statute that required it to notify her of her husband election not to participate in the survivor plan.we rejected hart assertion that a new claim accrued each time she was to be paid under the annuity and stated b ecause all events necessary to her benefits claim had occurred when her husband died,we conclude that plaintiff claim for annuity benefits is not a continuing claim.id.at.
similarly,in lane united states,our predecessor court considered lane claim that he was illegally discharged from the army and that he was therefore entitled to active duty pay from the date of discharge.the court held that it was barred by the statute of limitations,because the claim accrue d all at once upon lane discharge and he could not file suit more than six years from that date.id.at.
as we explained in brown park estates,these cases involve individuals who 
really only pointed to one alleged wrong by the government,which accrued all at once at one point in time,even though it may have had later adverse effects.the plaintiffs alleged later wrongs,such as nonpayment of annuities or wages,were not independently accruing violations of any statutes or regulations in themselves,but rather were merely damages resulting from the single earlier alleged violation by the as lack of notification or wrongful accrued outside the statute of limitations period.
