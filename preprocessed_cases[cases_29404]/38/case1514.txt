background 
lane served on active duty in the army from september of to february of.his service included a tour in vietnam from march of to march of.after his return from vietnam,lane went absent without official leave awol for a total of days,including one period of consecutive days.as a result,he was discharged from the service on february,under other than honorable conditions.
lane service medical records reflect that he sought treatment for sleeplessness in october of and march of.in addition,during his separation medical examination,he indicated that he had experienced frequent trouble sleeping and frequent or terrifying nightmares.he also indicated that he had attempted suicide.at the same time,he denied ever having nervous trouble of any sort or any drug or narcotic habit.
following his discharge,lane applied for va benefits.in june of,the los angeles ro,referring to lane record of having been awol,determined that lane discharge was under other than honorable conditions and,as such,was a bar to benefits.subsequently,however,in may of,pursuant to a presidential proclamation,lane received executive clemency and a clemency discharge.thereafter,in february of,the army discharge review board,established pursuant to,upgraded his discharge to under honorable conditions.that action was affirmed by the discharge review board in may of.
in april of,lane once again applied for va benefits,this time to the san diego ro.considering his claim,the ro noted that lane initially had been discharged under other than honorable conditions for having been awol,but that subsequently he had received a clemency discharge.the ro determined,however,that the original dishonorable discharge remained a bar to lane receiving va benefits.lane filed a notice of disagreement,alleging that he was eligible for va benefits based on the upgraded discharge issued by the army discharge review board.in october of,the ro issued another decision confirming its prior decision that lane discharge was considered to have been issued under conditions which preclude d payment of va benefits.the decision noted that an honorable or general discharge issued on or after october,by a discharge review board established under usc does not set aside any bar to benefits imposed under var c currently c.lane then appealed to the board.
in july of,after the ro had apparently misplaced lane appeal for many years,the board affirmed the ro decision.lane i,slip op.at.the board held that the character of lane discharge barred him from receiving va benefits.id.at.in reaching this conclusion,the board relied on a,which states,inter alia 
a the discharge of any person on the basis of an absence without authority from active duty for a continuous period of at least one hundred and eighty days if such person was discharged under conditions other than honorable unless such person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the secretary that there are compelling circumstances to warrant such prolonged unauthorized absence shall bar all rights of such person under laws administered by the secretary based upon the period of service from which discharged or dismissed,notwithstanding any action subsequent to the date of such discharge by a board established pursuant to section of title.
a emphasis added.the board stated that,pursuant to section a,it had to determine whether there were compelling circumstances to warrant lane prolonged unauthorized absence.lane i,slip op.at.the board turned to c for the factors it needed to consider to determine whether such circumstances existed.id.at.section c provides,inter alia 
c benefits are not payable where the former service member was discharged or released under one of the following conditions 
by reason of a discharge under other than honorable conditions issued as a result of an absence without official leave awol for a continuous period of at least days.this bar to benefit entitlement does not apply if there are compelling circumstances to warrant the prolonged unauthorized absence the following factors will be considered in determining whether there are compelling circumstances to warrant the prolonged unauthorized absence.
i length and character of service exclusive of the period of prolonged awol.service exclusive of the period of prolonged awol should generally be of such quality and length that it can be characterized as honest,faithful and meritorious and of benefit to the nation.
ii reasons for going awol.reasons which are entitled to be given consideration when offered by the claimant include family emergencies or obligations,or similar types of obligations or duties owed to third parties.the reasons for going awol should be evaluated in terms of the person age,cultural background,educational level and judgmental maturity.consideration should be given to how the situation appeared to the person himself or herself,and not how the adjudicator might have reacted.hardship or suffering incurred during overseas service,or as a result of combat wounds of other or aggravated disability,is to be carefully and sympathetically considered in evaluating the person state of mind at the time the prolonged awol period began.
c emphases added.the board then applied section a and section c to lane case to determine whether there were compelling reasons for his awol periods.lane i,slip op.at.the board noted that lane pointed to several reasons for going awol when he enlisted in the army,he was told he would be an administrative clerk but was instead placed in the infantry he was given drugs by his fellow soldiers in vietnam and became dependent upon those drugs to escape his fear of combat and he experienced many traumatic incidents while serving in vietnam.lane stated that,upon his return from vietnam,his superiors treated him like dirt,he was addicted to drugs and in a state of confusion,and he could not cope with army life.as a result,he started going awol.id.at.
the board found that lane service in vietnam satisfied c i,in that it was of such quality and length that it could be characterized as honest,faithful and meritorious and of benefit to the nation.id.at.in addition,the board determined that lane combat service would have exposed him to some hardship suffering during overseas service.id.the board observed,however,that the objective evidence of record,contemporaneous with lane return from overseas duty,failed to document the presence of any circumstances which supported lane assertions regarding drug dependence,difficulty with superiors,or an inability to fulfill his duties as assigned due to being in a state of confusion.id.the board noted 
there are no records of hospitalization or counseling reports to confirm treatment for any psychiatric symptomatology or substance abuse either upon return from overseas or during the time periods in which the appellant was absent from his unit.in fact,the first evidence of record to suggest either the presence of a psychiatric disorder or substance abuse is dated,many years after service discharge,and there is no indication within these records to establish the presence of an acquired psychiatric disorder or a substance abuse disorder in or.
id.in sum,the board found that,in light of the totality of the evidence in the record,it could not conclude that there were compelling circumstances present upon lane return from overseas which were of such severity as to force him into leaving his unit and thereby warrant his prolonged periods of unauthorized absence.id.at.accordingly,the board held that the character of lane discharge from service was a bar to va benefits.id.at.
lane filed a motion with the board alleging that its decision in lane i contained cue.lane argued,inter alia,that the board erred when it failed to give proper weight and consideration to the underlying reason for his unauthorized absences in accordance with c i and ii.he asserted that the board did not carefully and sympathetically consider,from his point of view,as required by section c ii,the factors that influenced him to go awol,such as his youth and immaturity,his problems with drugs and alcohol,and his subsequent development of psychiatric disabilities.lane contended that the board use of an objective evidence standard to evaluate his alleged reasons for going awol was improper.he argued that the regulation did not mandate an objective standard of proof,and hence,because the regulation referred to considering the veteran situation from the veteran point of view,it was improper for the board to use such a standard.
the board denied lane motion,holding that its decision in lane i did not contain cue.lane ii,slip op.at.the board noted that under a,a board decision is subject to revision on the grounds of cue and must be reversed or revised if the evidence establishes such error id.at.the board observed that c ii requires the adjudicator to consider how the situation appeared to the veteran himself when evaluating whether compelling circumstances justified periods of awol.id.at.the board noted,however,that this evaluation does not equate to what is essentially the veteran belief that he can offer any number of compelling circumstances without regard to establishing an evidentiary basis for same.id.at.it stated 
while consideration of the compelling circumstances must be from the veteran point of view,it must be presumed that the veteran must in some manner back up his claim with some evidence because the regulation is silent as to establishing what kind of proof is needed to successfully plead one or more compelling circumstances.consideration of one or more factors giving rise to the compelling circumstances from the veteran point of view would only then apply when a factor was established in a factual sense.the board acknowledges that in the typical case,a veteran age is easily ascertained by official documents in the file,but since the regulation refers to age in the context of more subjective terms like one judgmental maturity,it is logical to conclude that the regulation intends to impart a broad framework from which to judge the case.hence,in the board view,section c ii can be construed to allow the board to examine the record as a whole and determine whether the evidence supports the veteran claim that one or more of these factors excused his unauthorized absences.as a result,some cases may be supported by testimonial evidence alone whereas others may demand corroborating evidence.
id.the board concluded that the board in lane i had considered the veteran circumstances,but that because it had found no evidence in the record to show how any of the claimed circumstances played a significant role in the prolonged awol periods,the board had not committed cue in determining that the evidence as a whole did not support lane claim.id.at.
lane appealed the board decision in lane ii to the veterans court.in his appeal,he argued that the standard of review in an appeal involving an unsuccessful collateral challenge to a previously final board decision requires two separate and distinct review processes.he contended that in reviewing the rejection of a cue challenge,the veterans court should first determine whether the board properly reviewed the collateral challenge and supported its decision with an adequate statement of reasons or bases.he argued that if the court finds that the board did meet that standard,it then should conduct a de novo review of the merits of the collateral challenge under a,because a collateral challenge presents a question of law.section a provides,inter alia 
a in any action brought under this chapter,the court of appeals for veterans claims,to the extent necessary to its decision and when presented,shall 
decide all relevant questions of law,interpret constitutional,statutory,and regulatory provisions,and determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of an action of the secretary 
compel action of the secretary unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed 
hold unlawful and set aside decisions,findings other than those described in clause of this subsection,conclusions,rules,and regulations issued or adopted by the secretary,the board of veterans appeals,or the chairman of the board found to be 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or 
d without observance of procedure required by law and 
in the case of a finding of material fact adverse to the claimant made in reaching a decision in a case before the department with respect to benefits under laws administered by the secretary,hold unlawful and set aside or reverse such finding if the finding is clearly erroneous.
a emphases added.
turning to the merits,lane objected to the board statement in lane ii that under c ii it must be presumed that the veteran must in some manner back up his claim with some evidence because the regulation is silent as to establishing what kind of proof is needed to successfully plead one or more compelling circumstances.see lane ii,slip op.at.lane argued that the board did not cite to any authority for the requirement of objective contemporaneous evidence that no such requirement could be found in the regulation that the board had created an evidentiary presumption that did not exist in the law and that in fact the regulation contemplates a subjective standard of proof.the veterans court rejected lane arguments and affirmed the decision of the board.lane iii.at.
addressing its standard of review,the court stated that under a a,its review of a board decision denying a claim of cue in a prior board decision is limited to determining whether the board evaluation of the claim was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,and whether the decision is supported by an adequate statement of reasons or bases.id.at citations omitted.the court further stated that i f the board articulates a satisfactory explanation for its decision,including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,the court must affirm.id.quoting jordan brown.the court noted that although it has held that it will conduct a de novo review of whether a viable cue allegation was presented to the board,it has consistently ruled that the question of whether the board erred in determining that a prior decision did not contain cue is reviewed by the court under the arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law standard of review set forth in section a a.id.at citations omitted.
the veterans court then turned to lane arguments regarding the board interpretation of c.it noted that lane was arguing in essence that the board had erred in requiring objective contemporaneous evidence of his circumstances and in looking to the evidence of record as a whole to determine whether there was support for his stated reasons for going awol.id.at.in rejecting this argument,the court observed neither the statute nor the implementing regulation directs the adjudicator simply to accept any and all reasoning from a claimant.id.if so construed,noted the court,the claimant would impermissibly become the final adjudicator of his own claim.id.instead,the court observed,section a directs that a claimant demonstrate to the satisfaction of the secretary that there are compelling circumstances,suggesting a requirement of some proof of the offered circumstances and giving the secretary consid
