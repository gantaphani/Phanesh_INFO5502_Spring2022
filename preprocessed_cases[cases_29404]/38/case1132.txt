backgrounda.overview of programs 
medicare is a federal health insurance program designed to provide medical services,medical equipment,and supplies to persons years of age and older and to blind and disabled persons.congress established medicare through title xviii of the social security act,stat.current version at.the united states department of health and human services hhs funds and administers medicare.the health care financing administration hcfa,an agency within hhs,manages the medicare program.medicaid and the civilian health and medical program of the uniformed services champus provide similar coverage,respectively,for the indigent and armed services retirees and dependents of active duty members.the three programs function essentially the same.to illustrate their function,we will discuss the medicare program.
medicare part a covers the cost of hospital services and related care,and reimburses hospitals for services provided to its beneficiaries by means of a prospective payment system pps.medicare groups standardized medical codes for patients,diseases,and procedures into diagnostic related groups drg that provide the basis for pps.the average cost of care for each drg determines the reimbursement amount,rather than the actual cost of care to a beneficiary.a hospital that elects to participate in the medicare part a program is known as a provider.the provider enters into a contract with hcfa in which the provider agrees to conform to the provisions of the social security act ssa and applicable sections of the code of federal regulations cfr during its participation in the program.
under the medicare program,a provider files annual cost reports setting forth information and calculations identifying the medicare costs that the hospital claims should be reimbursed by medicare for that year.the cost reports include a certification that each cost report filed is true,correct,complete,and prepared from the books and records of the provider.the cost reports also contain an acknowledgment of the following statement intentional misrepresentation or falsification of any information contained in this cost report may be punishable by fine imprisonment under federal law.in preparing cost reports,providers often utilize outside accounting firms as consultants.
the cost reports allocate portions of overhead costs,such as employee salaries and benefits,supplies,and utilities to each of the reimbursable costs as administrative and general costs.medicare factors these costs into the reimbursement and administers the reimbursement throughout the fiscal year in periodic interim payments pips.other costs which secure real property or other capital assets,such as depreciation,interest on certain long term debt,and lease expenses,are capital related costs.medicare reimburses capital costs in a different manner,and as a result,these costs are more financially beneficial to the provider.the breakdown and reclassification of certain capital costs occur in schedules known as worksheets and in the cost reports.
the providers file the cost reports with insurance companies that contract with hhs to be fiscal intermediaries fi.the fi administers the medicare program and distributes medicare funds based upon the claims included by the providers in their cost reports.the fi is responsible for reviewing the cost reports and processing payment of claims.after an audit process,the fi cost report review culminates in a notice of program review npr,or final settlement.both the fi and the provider have a period in which to reopen a cost report in order to make changes.in the event of a claims dispute between the fi and the provider,the provider can either appeal an audit adjustment,or claim the disputed cost.if the provider claims the disputed cost,it must disclose to the fi the claimed item in the cost report itself,on the protest line or the settlement page,or in the transmittal letter that accompanies the filed cost report.
basic american medical,bami owned and operated several hospital facilities in southwest florida that participated in the medicare,champus,and medicaid programs as providers,including fawcett memorial hospital fawcett.by the late,fawcett was bami second largest hospital,and medicare reimbursement constituted over of the revenue of bami hospitals.in,fawcett borrowed from manufacturers hanover trust company the manufacturers loan and used that money to refinance five other that previously had been treated as and one that had been treated as and one that had been treated as.in its cost report,fawcett claimed the manufacturers loan interest as,but the fi adjusted that to.
in,fawcett changed its fiscal year end from october to december,and consequently,filed two cost reports that year.providers reimbursement consultants prc,fawcett consultant,prepared the cost reports.in both cost reports,fawcett claimed the interest on the manufacturers loan as.the fi again adjusted the interest to.in,fawcett paid off the manufacturers loan with a loan obtained from northwestern national life insurance company northwestern.citizens fidelity mortgage serviced the northwestern loan.the citizens loan.northwestern assumed an existing first mortgage of,and the balance went to fawcett.in its cost report,fawcett claimed interest on the citizens loan as,and the fi reduced this to.fawcett cost report claimed the citizens loan interest as and,consistent with the fi treatment of the interest in the cost report.
appellant jay jarrell jarrell began working for bami in as of finance.fawcett cost report claimed the citizens loan interest as.harold bachner bachner,a prc principal,testified at trial that prc had made a mistake in the cost report because it had not properly reclassified the portion of the interest to.bachner was unsure when prc discovered the mistake,but stated that prc did not tell the fi about the mistake.the fi later adjusted the interest for the citizens loan to,but applied the split to all fawcett loans.
fawcett cost report claimed the citizens loan interest as.subsequently,jarrell asked prc to amend the cost report to claim the interest as.prc worried about amending the cost report because it was likely to expose the mistake in the cost report in which fawcett had claimed the interest as.during the audit of the cost report,prc submitted an amended cost report,at bami request,claiming the citizens loan interest as,but prc did not use the protest line on the cost report.the transmittal letter stated that bami submitted the amended report to correct material errors and omissions.initially,the fi rejected the amendment to the cost report however,another fi later adjusted it to and applied the split to all fawcett loans.
bami had no reimbursement director before,so lynn dick dick,bami corporate controller,and jarrell controlled filing the and cost reports.the cost report claimed the citizens loan interest as,basing this on the amended cost report,which had claimed the citizens loan interest as.jerry lenon lenon,prc,advised dick that if fawcett cost report acknowledged that part of the interest was consistent with the would owe medicare approximately.lenon suggested that,if fawcett claimed the interest as on the cost report,it should do so on the protest line to flag it for the auditor and to preserve fawcett appeal rights.jarrell and dick told lenon that they disagreed with his proposal for treatment of the interest.they firmly believed that the interest was.lenon informed jarrell and dick that claiming the interest as might be fraud so h
