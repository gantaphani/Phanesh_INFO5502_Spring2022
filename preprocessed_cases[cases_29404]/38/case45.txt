elsa odina herrera was convicted by a jury of three counts stemming from her use of personal information,including a social security number,that did not belong to her in order to secure subsidized housing under a federal program.she maintains that she can not be guilty of these offenses because her behavior does not constitute a crime under the three statutes at issue.we do not read the statutes as she does,and we affirm.

high point village,a housing development in roslindale,massachusetts,provided housing in two ways.first,it operated a tier system providing rent that varied according to the tenant income.second,it operated a federally funded rent subsidy program often referred to as section housing.see et.there was a waiting list for this second program because there were more tenants than section vouchers available.tenants in the tier program were automatically added to the waiting list for the section program when their income qualified them for it.high point village then automatically distributed vouchers,as they came available,to tenants on the waiting list.
herrera,an undocumented immigrant from the dominican republic,took up residence at high point village,using the name and identifying information including the social security number of one rosana rolon alvarado.herrera also used a massachusetts identification card bearing her own picture but alvarado information.when herrera reported a drop in her income,she became eligible for the section subsidy,but only because she was using the identity of alvarado,an american citizen.as an undocumented alien,herrera could not qualify for federally subsidized housing under her real identity,regardless of her income.
in april,a section voucher was automatically assigned to herrera.in honoring the voucher,the united states department of housing and urban development paid more than of her rent for the next thirteen months.soon after hud began paying part of herrera rent,a federal official became suspicious that herrera was not who she claimed to be.in january a hud special agent attended,undercover,a recertification proceeding conducted by high point village he observed herrera filling out forms certifying she was a united states citizen and using alvarado information.
herrera was arrested in may,after she moved out of high point village.the indictment charged her with use of another social security number,a b knowingly converting public money or property,and aggravated identity theft.herrera consistently asserted that her conduct did not fall under any of these three statutes.she moved to quash the indictment and dismiss the case before trial and moved for directed verdict after presentation of the government evidence.she raises the same issues on appeal.

iii.discussion 
herrera claims that none of the three statutes under which she was convicted apply to the conduct of which she was accused.first,she claims that conviction under requires proof of elements not present in her case.next,she claims that a b prohibits the use of a false social security number only to obtain a social security payment,not to obtain other benefits.finally,she says that because she is innocent of the first two charges as a matter of law,she must be acquitted of aggravated identity theft because it requires as a predicate one of the other two offenses.we address the arguments pertaining to each statute in turn.
section of title was drafted to collect from scattered sources crimes so kindred as to belong in one category those that prohibit unlawful taking from the government.morissette united states.herrera levels three challenges at her conviction under this statute.first,she argues that the statute requires the government to prove asportation,the element of common law larceny.next,she claims that in order to obtain a conviction under,the government is required to prove an actual loss,and here it did not.finally,herrera argues that what she obtained was a residential lease,not a thing of value of the united states.we find none of these arguments persuasive.
herrera argues that each of the older crimes from which was forged contained as an element asportation,a physical carrying away,and that she has not carried anything away from the government.but the enactment of did more than aggregate existing crimes.the statute also added knowingly converts,to the list of proscribed activities,as well as steals,words that do not implicate the common law definition of larceny.see id.this,justice jackson wrote for the court,was an attempt to close gaps between the original common law offenses.
what has concerned codifiers of the offense is that gaps or crevices have separated particular crimes of this general class and guilty men have escaped through the breaches.the books contain a surfeit of cases drawing fine distinctions between slightly different circumstances under which one may obtain wrongful advantages from another property.the codifiers wanted to reach all such instances.
see also united states crutchley,cir citing morissette and holding that larceny by trick is encompassed within.where congress has gone beyond the common law terms used to define a crime,we will not presume the crime is limited to its common law contours.
moreover,reading the statute to require asportation would perforce limit to tangible property,as intangibles can not be carried away.this reading of the statute is too narrow and is contradicted by the great weight of authority.see united states barger,cir i nformation itself is enough to meet the thing of value element of the statute.united states may,cir thing of value was the flight time itself where national guard planes were used for personal flights united states girard,cir although the content of a writing is an intangible,it is nonetheless a thing of value.see also united states collins,congress intended to enact a broad prohibition against the misappropriation of anything belonging to the national government,unrestrained by the fine and technical distinctions of the common law.we hold that asportation is not required in every conviction under.
herrera also contends that requires the government to prove an actual loss.we disagree.for this proposition,herrera cites united states collins,cir that case concerned a warrant drawn up by a municipal agency,and cashed by someone who stole it the ninth circuit determined that since the funds released by the bank were bank funds,not government funds,and the warrant itself was not the property of the government,the government had failed to prove a loss and the defendant was entitled to acquittal.first,collins is inapplicable to the facts of this case here,the payments made by hud were government funds.but more importantly,collins is not the law of this circuit.see united states santiago,cir the statute,however,does not require a showing that the united states was prejudiced.it merely requires the government to show that a thing of value of the united states has been knowingly received,concealed or retained by the accused with improper intent quoting.nor,for that matter,has collins been followed by any other circuit.see united states milton,united states scott,cir per curiam collecting cases in the seventh circuit barnes,at fifth circuit.we doubt that we are free to revisit this determination,and in any event decline to do so 
finally,herrera argues that obtaining subsidized housing is not a violatio
