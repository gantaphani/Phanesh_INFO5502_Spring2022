presumptive eligibility and the gateway program.
presumptive eligibility is an optional federal program through which uninsured children up to age may obtain temporary benefits before their eligibility for ongoing has been determined.welf.california implemented the gateway program on july,as a vehicle for establishing presumptive eligibility,also referred to as.the gateway program expanded health care coverage by drawing in uninsured children under the age of from families with incomes of up to percent of the federal poverty level,and to encourage them to apply for ongoing coverage in the and healthy families programs the department refers to the gateway program as providing a temporary safety net for indigent children to receive benefits.
the gateway program is an electronic enrollment process that immediately establishes presumptive eligibility at health care provider offices health care providers utilize an electronic form to children through the gateway program using the internet or a point of service device.presumptive eligibility initiated through the gateway program provides temporary benefits for two months.welf,subd.f,subd.a.

procedural history 
armando and his mother maria doe,individually and as guardian ad litem of armando,respondents herein,filed a petition for writ of mandate in july,the month the department began utilizing the gateway program.the petition alleged that armando was a deemed eligible infant because he was born in may to a mother receiving benefits and he continued to reside in his mother residence.the petition alleged that armando entered the system through the gateway program.the petition further alleged that the department was about to illegally terminate the benefits of armando and other deemed eligible infants who began receiving benefits through the gateway program.
in response,the department stated that individuals in the presumed eligibility program had not yet been determined eligible for benefits,thereby negating the duty to issue a notice of action prior to a termination of presumed eligible benefits.the department admitted that armando was a deemed eligible infant if the county had established his eligibility by verifying his mother eligibility at the time of birth and verifying that he resided with his mother in the month of his birth.otherwise,the department denied that armando was a deemed eligible infant 
on september,the trial court issued a statement and order the september order directing the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate and directing the department to refrain from terminating the benefits of only those infant beneficiaries who are automatically deemed eligible for pursuant to ccr and who began,or will begin,receiving benefits through the gateway program refrain from terminating the benefits of only those infant beneficiaries who are automatically deemed eligible for pursuant to ccr and who began,or will begin receiving benefits through the gateway program,without a prior of eligibility 
following the issuance of the trial court september order,respondents filed a motion to compel compliance and sought an order to show cause re contempt on the grounds that the department had refused to confirm that it would comply with the court order.thereafter,the department moved for modification,clarification,reconsideration of the september order.in support of this motion,the department presented evidence that the gateway application did not collect the information necessary to establish deemed eligibility and that there was no way to refrain from terminating the benefits of only deemed eligible infants without stopping the termination of presumptive eligibility benefits for all infants 
the trial court denied the department motion and declined to issue an order to show cause with respect to contempt,but ordered the parties to meet and confer on a plan for compliance with the september order.the trial court then scheduled further compliance hearings.
in conjunction with the compliance hearings,the department submitted evidence that a recent change in state law,adopted by assembly bill reg.sess.in august,allowed the department,at its option,to implement a deemed eligibility component to the gateway.the department presented a sworn declaration of a staff services manager stating that the department had already begun making changes to coordinate a deemed eligibility component into the existing gateway process.however,the department estimated that permanent changes would take until april,to complete.
on november,the trial court issued a compliance order recognizing the department intention to make permanent changes to the gateway program.however,the court determined that an interim compliance plan,modeled on the standard redetermination procedures set forth in welfare and institutions code section,was necessary to preserve the status quo and prevent irreparable injury.the trial court ordered the department to use its best efforts to identify deemed eligible infants who began coverage through the gateway program by utilizing its expertise and discretion to determine the best means of identifying infants who meet the criteria for deemed eligibility and establishing their eligibility during the presumptive eligibility period.the court ordered the department to refrain from terminating benefits of any infant under age one who began receiving benefits through the gateway program who the department could reasonably identify,using the information already in its possession.additionally,the trial court ordered the department to identify and reinstate benefits for deemed eligible infants who began receiving benefits through the gateway program and whose benefits were terminated for failure to submit a application and who could be identified after the infant presumptive eligibility period ended.a writ of mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section was issued on november.
on december,the department filed a notice of appeal of the writ of mandate and the september and november orders.following the filing of the department notice of appeal,respondents filed a memorandum to enforce the november compliance order.respondents argued that the september and november orders and writ were prohibitory and were not stayed pending appeal.the department objected on the ground that further proceedings in the trial court were automatically stayed by code of civil procedure section,subdivision a.on february,the trial court found the orders and writ were not automatically stayed on appeal it ordered a compliance report and scheduled an additional compliance hearing.the department filed a separate notice of appeal of the february order on march,
on april,we issued an immediate stay of all proceedings on april,we issued an alternative writ on the grounds that an order directing the issuance of a writ of mandate is automatically stayed pending appeal.after the trial court entered an order staying the proceedings,we dissolved the stay and discharged the alternative writ 
although the enforcement orders have been stayed,the department has completed the changes to the gateway program electronic enrollment system.as of june,the electronic gateway program form now includes questions needed to identify whether an infant is deemed eligible.specifically,the form includes a line pertaining to infants under the age of one year,which asks whether the infant lived with the mother in the month of birth and asks for the mother date of birth and benefit identification and or social security number.

standard of review.
on appeal following a trial court decision on a petition for a writ of mandate,the reviewing court need only review the record to determine whether the trial court findings are supported by substantial evidence.citation.however,we review questions of law independently.citation.alliance for a better downtown millbrae wade th,d.where,as here,the issue involves statutory interpretation,we exercise our independent judgment and review the matter de novo.woodbury th,d.
no clear,present,and ministerial duty justifies the writ or related orders.
a writ of mandate will lie only to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins,as a duty resulting from an office,trust,or station code civ,subd.a.an action commanded can not control an exercise of discretion,to compel an administrative agency to exercise its discretion in a particular manner.common cause of california board of supervisors cal d,sklar franchise tax board d.however,mandamus may issue to compel the exercise of discretion,to compel some action upon the subject involved.common cause of california board of supervisors,supra,cal d,sklar franchise tax board,supra,d.

state and federal law create no duty.
as discussed,the gateway program is an electronic means of providing presumptive eligibility benefits.state and federal law are eligibility or benefits are temporary and are required to terminate at the end of the statutory period without further determination by the department,unless an application has been filed prior to the end of the statutory period.b b welf,subd.a.equally clear is state and federal law pertaining to deemed eligibility.deemed eligible infants are treated as if they have submitted a application and have had a final,favorable eligibility determination.e,tit.additionally,deemed eligible infants are entitled to continue their benefits until they are found to be ineligible by a redetermination of eligibility by the county.welf,subds.a d.
respondents do not refute the provisions of the presumptive eligibility law,but argue that the department has a duty to give legal effect to deemed eligible infants and the laws of redetermination in its gateway program.by this argument,respondents are,in essence,importing the requirements of deemed eligibility law into the presumed eligibility law.however,the plain language of the applicable statutes and regulations indicate that deemed eligibility and presumptive eligibility are two separate and distinct methods of establishing a child eligibility for medical benefits,with different temporal limits and procedures.
section b of title of the united states code provides that the presumptive eligibility period a begins with the date on which a qualified entity determines,on the basis of preliminary information,that the family income of the child does not exceed the applicable income level of eligibility under the state plan,and b ends with and includes the earlier of i the day on which a determination is made with respect to the eligibility of the child for medical assistance under the state plan,or ii in the case of a child on whose behalf an application is not filed by the last day of the month following the month during which the entity makes the determination referred to in subparagraph a,such last day.italics added.
additionally,welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a provides benefits provided to an individual pursuant to a preliminary determination as described in section,or of title of the united states code shall end,without the necessity of any further review or determination by the department,on or before the last day of the month following the month in which the preliminary determination was made,unless an application for medical assistance under the state plan is filed on or before that date.italics added.
unlike presumed eligibility,deemed eligibility establishes actual ongoing benefits during the first year of life.specifically,united states code section e provides a child born to a woman eligible for and receiving medical assistance under a state plan on the date of the childs birth shall be deemed to have applied for medical assistance and to have been found eligible for such assistance under such plan on the date of such birth and to remain eligible for such assistance for a period of one year so long as the child is a member of the womans household and the woman remains or would remain if pregnant eligible for such assistance italics ad
