james turner appeals the district court grant of summary judgment in favor of the commissioner of social security upholding a denial of disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act.turner contends that the administrative law judge alj did not give sufficient weight to the opinion of one of his doctors,improperly discredited his own testimony,and failed to adequately address his veteran affairs va disability rating.because substantial evidence supports the alj decision and the alj committed no legal error,we affirm.
turner suffers from stress disorder.in,he filed an application for title ii disability insurance benefits,i,d,claiming that he was unable to work on july,due to gunshot wounds,chronic back pain,and stress disorder.both parties agree that turner must show that he was disabled on or before december,in order to qualify for benefits under title ii of the social security act.
in,turner was years old.during his service in the army,he sustained gunshot and shrapnel wounds in vietnam to his left arm,temple,foot,and leg.between to,turner underwent several medical examinations through the.in,heide,a psychiatrist,examined turner and diagnosed him with probable stress disorder.according to heide,turner avoided the subject of vietnam,expressed that he felt paranoia in crowds,and stated that he was easily startled by loud noises,but denied feeling depressed,sad,or hopeless.heide reported that turner was pleasant and cooperative and opined that turner functional ability was fair.in,aflatooni,a psychiatrist,examined turner and diagnosed him with stress disorder and atypical depression.turner reported that he experienced nightmares and flashbacks about vietnam.he stated that he was depressed,angry,forgetful,and uncertain about the future.aflatooni reported that turner was cooperative and pleasant,showed no anxiety or irritability,made eye contact,and was fairly well oriented to time,place,and person.
in,koogler,also with the va,administered a psychiatric examination to turner.during the examination,turner reported that he had daily thoughts about vietnam and some flashbacks triggered by helicopters,but reported no nightmares.turner explained that he had difficulty concentrating,did not read,avoided crowds,slept sporadically,and disliked unexpected noises.he expressed paranoia about the government and losing his compensation.koogler observed that turner was oriented,had a normal intellect,and displayed good judgment.at the end of the report,koogler included a summary,in which he stated that turner was disabled from a back injury and suffered from stress disorder and depression.koogler noted that turner had maintained himself without severe problems with his stress disorder by isolating himself from society and living out in the country.
in,two years after the time relevant for turner disability determination,koogler examined turner again and noted that there had been no change in turner mental status since their last meeting.koogler observed that turner continue d to have a severe back problem and hobbles in and out of his chair koogler noted that turner had not received treatment,but that he was in good spirits and fe lt like his anger wa s controlled because he wa s left alone.later that year,john mcfarland,a social worker,examined turner.mcfarland noted that turner chose to live an isolated life,trading his labor on a ranch for lodging.mcfarland noted 
the veteran was somewhat guarded during this interview.he states he feels that one result of this interview would be that his compensation would be cut off regarding employability,the veteran is doing just about all that he can do presently.he would not be able to tolerate any employment which required any sort of structure,answering to bosses,or dealing with people.
turner received va disability ratings in,and.in,the va assigned a stress disorder disability rating of thirty percent.this rating indicated occupational and social impairment with occasional decrease in work efficiency and intermittent periods of inability to perform occupational tasks although generally functioning satisfactorily,with routine behavior,and conversation normal.in,the va maintained the thirty percent rating.in,the va raised turner stress disability rating to percent and made it retroactive to the year.
in,turner filed with the social security administration for disability benefits due to his gunshot wounds,chronic back pain,and stress disorder.at his hearings turner testified that he was disabled due to back pain and stress disorder.he stated that he could only walk a half mile at a time,sit fifteen to twenty minutes at a time,and lift up to forty pounds.turner testified that he had no mental problems but that he did not trust anybody and liked to be alone.he stated that he took motrin for his back pain,tried to avoid doctors,and obtained treatment only when the va called to see him.during a regular day,turner performed various household chores and work on the ranch,including feeding cattle,fixing holes in fences,and assisting in rounding and branding cattle.
at turner second hearing,a medical expert,crossen,who had not personally examined turner,but who had reviewed his medical records and prior hearing transcripts,confirmed that turner had stress disorder and depression.crossen pointed to the fact that during the time that turner claimed to be unable to work,he successfully lived by himself,responsibly cared for a ranch,and formed a relationship that led to marriage.crossen observed that the record contained little evidence that turner was completely incapacitated besides turner own subjective complaints.
using the required sequential framework for determining whether a claimant is disabled,see,the alj determined that turner had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since his alleged onset date,that turner had a severe impairment namely,stress disorder,and that the impairment did not meet or equal the requirements of any listed impairment that would demonstrate presumptive disability under pt,subpt.p,app.the alj then found that turner had the residual functional capacity to work at any exertion level,but that he would be limited to simple,repetitive tasks,require an environment without a lot of background activity,not be able to perform work involving public contact,and work best alone.using this residual functional capacity,a vocational expert testified that an individual with turner experience and background could find jobs such as a cleaner,laundry sorter,or folding machine operator in the national economy.because turner could perform some jobs in the national economy,the alj determined that turner was not disabled under the social security act.the commissioner affirmed the alj decision,and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the commissioner.turner timely appealed.
on appeal,turner alleges that he is disabled solely due to his stress disorder he does not challenge the alj rejection of his physical disability complaints.turner argues that the alj erred in determining his functional capacity in three ways by not giving sufficient weight to koogler examination by rejecting turner subjective complaints by inadequately addressing the disability findings of the.we examine each in turn 
turner first argues that the alj improperly rejected the medical findings of his treating doctor,koogler.as a general rule,more weight should be given to the opinion of a treating source than to the opinion of doctors who do not treat the claimant t he commissioner must provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting the uncontradicted opinion of an examining physician t he opinion of an examining doctor,even if contradicted by another doctor,can only be rejected for specific and legitimate reasons lester chater,cir quotation marks omitted.turner argues that crossen opinion contradicted koogler report.it is not clear,however,that koogler actually concluded that turner was disabled from stress disorder,nor is it clear that crossen or the alj actually rejected koogler report.what koogler said,in the briefest of summaries,was that turner was disabled from a back injury he sustained in.but the back injury is not the basis for turner claim he alleges that he is disabled because of his stress disorder.but with respect to stress disorder,koogler concluded only that t he veteran has been able to maintain himself without severe problems with his stress disorder by isolating himself from society and living out in the country.at turner hearing,crossen agreed that turner had stress disorder,was easily distracted,and had a startle response.even with these limitations,crossen could not find that the little evidence in the record supported turner claim that he was disabled.crossen testified that koogler report did not establish that turner was disabled.crossen stated,i think koogler assessment and reasoning there is reasonable,but as far as any evidence or anything that would actually confirm that turner could not work,i do see anything there there nothing there to say that he ca do more than what he was doing.the alj agreed that koogler report d id not necessarily imply that the claimant is incapacitated by his stress disorder.as the alj found,nothing in koogler report assign ed any specific limitations on the claimant or stated that turner was unable to work with little interpersonal interaction.even if crossen testimony did not contradict koogler report,the alj did not need to provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting koogler report because the alj did not reject any of koogler conclusions.the alj incorporated koogler observations into turner residual functional capacity.
to the extent that koogler evaluation could be read to suggest that turner was disabled and could not work,the alj gave specific and legitimate reasons,lester,at,for rejecting that implication in favor of crossen testimony that the record did not support turner claim.the alj noted that koogler opinion was based almost entirely on the claimant.most of koogler evaluation recorded turner report of his sleeping patterns,anger,or startled responses,without any independent analysis or diagnosis.in fact,koogler assumed from the outset,without offering his own diagnosis,that turner suffered from stress disorder.other than observing that turner had a startle response when a telephone rang,koogler made no attempt to cite objective findings to substantiate a claim that turner would be unable to do simple,repetitive tasks without a lot of background activity and with no public contact.in addition,because koogler had not had any previous interaction with the claimant,the alj found that koogler was in a poor position to assess the claimant statements.the alj concluded that koogler report did little to assist the claimant in establishing that he is disabled for social security purposes.on this record,the alj reasonably rejected koogler evaluation to the extent that it implied that turner could not perform simple,repetitive tasks in an environment without public contact or background activity.
although the alj rejected any implication in koogler evaluation that turner was disabled,he did incorporate koogler observations into his residual functional capacity determination.the alj took into account turner marked limitations in social functioning by limiting him to work in which there is no public contact,and where it is recognized that he works best alone.the alj observed that turner could not perform complex work,but should be limited to simple and routine work.in particular,h is and startle reflex limit him to work without significant background activity.these limitations were entirely consistent with koogler limitation.
turner also argues that john mcfarland report supports his claim that the alj improperly discredited koogler evaluation.mcfarland concluded that turner would not be able to tolerate any employment which required any sort of structure,answering to bosses,or dealing with people.although we explained why koogler evaluation does not conclude that turner was disabled,we also think mcfarland report does not establish that turner was incapacitated.first,as a social worker,mcfarland is not considered an acceptable medical source under the regulations.a,d.the regulations treat p ublic and private social welfare agency personnel as other sources,c.d,and the alj may expressly disregard lay testimony if the alj gives reasons germane to each witness for doing so.lewis apfel,cir.here,the alj determination that koogler examination was the only examination during the actual period at issue,between the alleged onset date of july,and the date last insured of december,was a germane reason for not addressing mcfarland opinion that turner was unable to work with structure or answer to bosses.second,mcfarland gave no support for his broad claim that turner could not work.mcfarland wrote that turner had nightmares,that he did not like crowds,and that he felt on guard at night because he feared intruders.but none of these factors support mcfarland opinion that turner would not be able to tolerate any employment.on the contrary,mcfarland evaluation revealed confidence in turner ability to function on the ranch and noted that turner did quite a lot of work around the ranch and obtained supplies from the town every two weeks.third,mcfarland is the only person who opined that turner was completely unable to work and he did so outside the relevant time period.although the va doctors who interviewed turner concluded that he suffered from stress disorder,none of the doctors indicated that turner was unable to work because of this diagnosis.the alj did not err in disregarding mcfarland report.
in sum,there is no evidence in the record from an appropriate medical source during the relevant time period that refutes the alj determination that turner,even with stress disorder,was capable of performing simple,repetitive tasks in an environment where he could work alone and without public contact.
turner next argues that the alj improperly rejected his alleged mental complaints,particularly his need to be isolated from other people but turner never claimed that he was incapacitated by his need to be alone.he testified at his hearing that he did not have friends,avoided everybody,and did not put up with most people.sensitive to turner complaints,the alj determined that turner would work best alone and could not work with the public.the vocational expert took these limitations into account when she testified about the kinds of jobs available to turner in the national economy.
moreover,the alj provided several cogent reasons for rejecting turner claim that he could not put up with most people and his suggestion that this limitation left him unable to work.the alj noted that heide and aflatooni both found him to be cooperative and pleasant.turner told koogler that he had been able to develop control over his anger.in addition,the alj stated that turner residence on the ranch reflects the confidence that others have in him to perform tasks and that he adequately dealt with people when he went into town to obtain supplies or to the va for examinations.the alj also noted that turner was capable of developing a personal relationship during this time that resulted in marriage.although turner preferred to isolate himself,the alj did not improperly discredit turner subjective complaints.
the alj also found that turner was not entirely credible because he had made exaggerated statements about the intensity and persistence of his physical impairments.during his hearings and on his disability application,turner stated that his back pain limited his ability to stand,sit,and walk,but then described that his work on the ranch involved building fences,running a tractor,feeding cattle,and laying irrigation waterlines.because of this discrepancy in his testimony,the alj found that turner could not be found to be wholly credible regarding any allegation of total disability.the alj properly rejected turner implication that he was disabled because he could not put up with most people.
finally,turner argues that the alj did not give proper weight to turner va disability rating.because social security disability and va disability programs serve the same governmental benefits to those unable to work because
