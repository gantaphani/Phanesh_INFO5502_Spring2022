the petitioner in this case,richard erickson,has filed an application for attorney fees in connection with his two appeals to this court.in his application,he sets forth four grounds for the recovery of attorney fees and expenses.we hold that none of the four grounds provides a legal basis for erickson to receive attorney fees in this case,and we therefore deny the application.
erickson,a postal service employee from to,was a member of the army national guard reserve throughout that period.during the years of his employment,he was absent from his postal service position for lengthy periods of time while he was on active duty with the national guard.between and he was absent for a total of more than months,and between and,he worked at the postal service for only four days.in january,during one of erickson periods of active duty,the postal service inquired whether he intended to return to his postal service job.erickson replied that he would not report back to work with the agency until he completed his current tour of duty in september.he stated at that time that he preferred military service to working for the postal service.shortly thereafter,the postal service removed him for excessive use of military leave.erickson postal serv.erickson i.
following his removal from the postal service,erickson with the national guard.he remained on active military duty until december.in september,he filed an appeal with the merit systems protection board alleging that the postal service had violated his rights under the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of userra by removing him from his position based on his military service.the board rejected his claim under userra reemployment rights provision,holding that he had not made a timely request for reemployment with the agency.the board also rejected his claim under userra antidiscrimination provision,holding that erickson military service was not a motivating factor in the agency decision to remove him.the board also held that erickson had forfeited his reemployment rights because at the time of his appeal his cumulative absence from the agency exceeded the limit set by userra.erickson i,at.
on erickson appeal,this court affirmed the board decision with respect to his reemployment claim,but reversed with respect to his discrimination claim.as to his discrimination claim,the court held that the evidence was clear that erickson removal was attributable to his military service and that at the time of his removal he had not been absent from his position with the postal service for a total of five years.the court remanded the case to the board to resolve the remaining question whether erickson had waived his rights under userra by abandoning his civilian career in favor of a career in the military.erickson i,at.
on remand,the board found that erickson had waived his userra rights by abandoning his civilian career.erickson again appealed to this court,arguing that the board findings in that regard were not supported by substantial evidence.this court agreed with erickson that the board findings were not supported by substantial evidence.accordingly,the court remanded the case to the board for further proceedings on erickson claim.erickson postal serv.erickson ii.
in the second remand proceeding,the board ruled in favor of erickson on his discrimination claim.it granted him reinstatement with back wages and benefits as of the date of his removal.erickson has now filed an application here seeking fees for his attorneys work in the two appeals he took to this court.
in support of his application,erickson makes four arguments.first,he contends that the merit systems protection board is authorized to grant fees for work in this court under userra attorney fee statute,c.second,he argues that userra authorizes this court to grant attorney fees for work done on appeal,although there is no specific statute that contains such authorization.third,he argues that he is entitled to an attorney fee award under the equal access to justice act eaja,d.fourth,he seeks an attorney fee award under the attorney fee provision of the back pay act,b a ii.we conclude that none of the four grounds on which erickson relies provides a basis for a fee award for work done in this court.
a.the merit systems protection board is not authorized to award fees incurred during judicial review under userra 
erickson first argument is that the merit systems protection board has statutory authority to make a comprehensive fee award under userra,which would include not only fees for work done before the board,but also fees for work done before this court.
the statute on which erickson relies,c,authorizes the board,in its discretion,to award attorney fees to a successful userra claimant.although the statutory language does not expressly rule out a fee award for work done before a reviewing court,the focus of the statute is on work done before the board.thus,the statute provides that a fee award is authorized only if the board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the board that such person is entitled to an order requiring compliance or compensation.c.
interpreting the userra fee statute as not giving the board authority to grant fee applications for work done before this court is consistent with a longstanding line of cases in which this court has held that the board is not authorized to grant an award of fees for work done on appeal from a board order.see gallo dep t of,t his court is the appropriate forum in which to request attorney fees incurred in proceedings before this court.ramos dep t of justice,the board is not authorized under the back pay act to enter an award for work done before the court of appeals phillips servs,same covington dep t of health and human,the board lacks authority to award attorney fees for services rendered in connection with judicial review gavette office of pers,en banc eaja request for work done on appeal must be directed to the court of appeals.
erickson argues that the cited cases do not speak to attorney fees under userra and that this court is therefore free to depart from its precedent interpreting the fee provisions of other statutory schemes.the reasoning of those cited cases,however,did not depend on the details of the particular statutory schemes.erickson does not provide a convincing argument as to why userra is different.instead,he states only that a rule that forbids the board from awarding fees for judicial review would conflict with a plain reading of userra,which authorizes the board to award fees and would unduly restrict the broad equitable powers afforded a court to vindicate veterans rights,and the liberal construction given to userra for the benefit of those who left private life to serve their country.
such broad policy generalizations can not make up for the absence of statutory authority or override the applicable case law.while statutory language unambiguously granting the board authority to award fees for work done on appeal would,of course,trump prior precedents to the contrary,there is no such unambiguous language in the userra fee statute.in fact,as noted,the language of the statute suggests the contrary.
the absence of clear statutory authority to award fees for work on appeal is particularly telling in light of the fact that such a statutory authorization for a fee award against the government would constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity.see ruckelshaus sierra club,except to the extent it has waived its immunity,the government is immune from claims for attorney fees.a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text,and a ny ambiguities in the statutory language are to be construed in favor of immunity.faa cooper.ambiguity exists if there is a plausible interpretation of the statute that would not authorize money damages against the government.id.it is far from clear that section c authorizes the board to award attorney fees for work done in the course of judicial review of board decisions.we therefore follow our prior precedents in analogous contexts and hold that the board lacks statutory authority to grant an award for fees incurred in erickson appeals to this court.
ussera does not authorize this court to grant attorney fees 
erickson next argues that if the board lacks authority under userra to grant his fee request,this court should grant the award pursuant to userra because userra is to be construed liberally and because veterans statutes are to be resolved in favor of veterans.erickson admits that his interpretation arguably conflicts with a purely literal reading of section c language that the board is authorized to award fees.he argues,however,that it would be untenable for the court to interpret the statute in such a way that provides no avenue for a veteran to recover legal fees at the appellate level.
the problem with erickson argument is that this court is not authorized to award attorney fees when it lacks statutory authorization to do so.see fed.cir.gallo dep t of,under rule,this court must itself be authorized by law to award attorney fees.furthermore,this court does not derive its authority to award attorney fees from the board authority to do so.gallo,at see also id.at m erely because this court is authorized to review a tribunal that is statutorily authorized to award attorney fees,does not mean that this court itself is authorized by that same statute to award attorney fees in the first instance for example,the board in certain circumstances may award attorney fees for work before it when attorney fees are not available under the same statute for work done before this court.instead,there must be an independent statutory authorization for the court to award fees.id.at.because no such independent statutory authorization exists under userra,the court can not award attorney fees under userra in this case.
c.erickson is not entitled to an award of attorney fees under eaja 
erickson next contends that he is entitled to a fee award under eaja.his application for eaja fees,however,is untimely and must be denied for that reason.
a petition for eaja fees must be filed within days of the final judgment in the action.d b.in a case in which the court of appeals remands to an agency due to agency error,without retaining jurisdiction over the case,the party that sought the remand is deemed to be the prevailing party,and the day eaja clock begins to run with the remand order itself.former emps.of motorola ceramic prods.united states,see also shalala schaefer,ward postal,gurley peake.
erickson relies on covington department of health and human services,where this court granted an application for attorney fees after a remand to the board resulted in a successful outcome for the petitioner.covington,however,was a case that was decided prior to former employees and the supreme court cases that former employees relied on in fashioning the rule that the eaja day clock starts to run at the time of the remand assuming the remand is due to an error in the agency and the court of appeals does not retain jurisdiction.therefore,covington is no longer good law for the purpose of determining when the clock begins to run on an eaja fee application.
erickson first appeal was remanded because the board had not addressed whether he had waived his userra rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of a military career,which was the ground relied on by the administrative judge who initially rejected erickson userra claim.erickson i,at.the board had instead relied on the ground that military service was not the motivating factor behind the postal service removal of erickson from his position in.according to the board,the postal service was motivated merely by his absence,without regard for the reason for his absence.this court rejected the argument that terminating an employee because of his absence due to military service was different from terminating him because of his military service,and it remanded the case to the board to consider whether erickson had abandoned his civilian career,as the administrative judge had determined.id.at.
erickson second appeal was remanded because the court found that the board determination that he had abandoned his civilian career prior to his removal from the postal service in was not supported by substantial evidence.erickson ii,at.
there is no need to decide whether the remand in erickson i was the result of board error thereby conveying status on erickson and starting a day eaja clock because the remand in erickson ii was clearly the result of board error.erickson was therefore a prevailing party when the remand order issued in erickson ii.for that reason,the day eaja clock began to run in.that clock has long since expired.erickson request for fees under eaja is therefore untimely.
even if erickson eaja application were timely,it would be without merit.eaja authorizes a court to award fees to a litigant in a case against the government if the government position in the case was not substantially justified.d a.in erickson case,the government prevailed before the board in the proceedings that led to both of the appeals to this court.the cases on appeal were close,and even though erickson prevailed on both occasions,we are not prepared to say that the government position in defending the board decisions was not substantially justified.erickson would therefore not be entitled to a fee award under eaja even if he had filed his eaja applications on time.
d.the attorney fee provision of the back pay act is not applicable to preference eligible postal employees 
finally,erickson argues that the court can and should award attorney fees under the fee provision of the back pay act,b a ii.
in general,the back pay act has been interpreted as authorizing the courts of appeals to award attorney fees incurred on appeal.gallo dep t of,olsen dep t of commerce,hoska dep t of the army.the government argues,however,that the back pay act does not apply to the postal service,and that the provisions of the back pay act including the attorney fee provision do not apply to postal service employees.erickson argues that the back pay act in general,and the attorney fee provision in particular,apply to preference eligible employees in the postal service,certain veterans,also referred to as preference eligibles,even though those provisions do not apply to postal service employees generally.
the federal circuit has not resolved the question whether,or to what extent,the back pay act applies to preference eligible employees in the postal service.see romero united states,not deciding the issue whether the back pay act applies to postal workers due to sparse record and minimal argument united states connolly,declining to decide whether the back pay act applies to postal service employees see also white bloomberg,cir t he back pay act is no longer statutorily applicable to the postal service.kellus united states,stating that the fourth circuit has held that the back pay act does not apply to the postal service and that even though the federal circuit pretermitted deciding the question as to whether the back pay act is applicable to postal service employees it seems clear that the back pay act does not authorize suit in the claims court 
after careful consideration,we conclude that,even if the back pay provision of the back pay act applies to preference eligible employees in the postal service an issue we need not reach to decide this case the attorney fee provision of that act does not.
the analysis of this issue begins with.that statute provides that no federal law dealing with public or federal employees shall apply to the exercise of the powers of the postal service unless the law is enumerated in subsection b of that code provision.the back pay act is not enumerated in b.that act therefore does not apply generally to the postal service.
in addition,the back pay act by its own terms does not apply to the postal service because the postal service is not an executive agency,the term that is used to define the scope of the act coverage.see a.instead,the postal service is defined by statute as an independent establishment of the executive branch.although executive agency is defined as an ex
