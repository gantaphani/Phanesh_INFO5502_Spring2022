john kirkendall appeals the decision of the merit systems protection board,which dismissed his claims that he had been discriminated against in violation of the veterans employment opportunities act of veoa,and the uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act userra.kirkendall dep t of the army,wl mspb.because the veoa is subject to equitable tolling and kirkendall is entitled to a hearing on his userra claim,we reverse and remand.
background 
kirkendall,a disabled veteran who suffers from organic brain syndrome,applied for a position as a supervisory equipment specialist aircraft,with the department of the army agency at fort bragg,north carolina.kirkendall service and resulting disability entitled him to a preference.he included a resume with his application,which indicated,inter alia,that he had admirably served as the commander of a direct support platoon at fort bragg,and as a force integration officer and an executive at fort bliss,texas.in addition,kirkendall resume listed numerous,specific duties he had performed,as well as several technical courses he had taken while in the army.on january,the agency found that kirkendall application lacked sufficient detail regarding his experience and rated him ineligible for the position.kenneth black,also a preference eligible veteran,was chosen to fill the position.
kirkendall filed several complaints with the agency contesting his,all of which were denied.he then filed a formal complaint with the department of labor dol claiming a violation of his veterans preference rights and discrimination based on his disability.on november,dol rejected the complaint because it had not been filed within days of the agency alleged violation as required by a a.on june,kirkendall appealed to the merit systems protection board.
the administrative judge aj dismissed kirkendall veoa claim as untimely and his userra claim for failure to state a claim.the board affirmed the aj decision that the veoa claim was precluded for failure to timely file,but reversed the determination that kirkendall had failed to state a proper claim for relief.rather,the board held that kirkendall assertion that he was not selected based on his status as a disabled veteran was cognizable under userra.on remand,the aj held,without a hearing,that kirkendall had offered no proof that his veteran status was a substantial or motivating factor in his.the aj further held that discrimination could not be inferred because kirkendall was based on the indefiniteness of his application all other applicants on the certificate of eligibles were veterans and a veteran,who was eligible for a preference,was selected for the position.the aj remand decision was adopted by the board when review was denied.
kirkendall appeals the board decision to this court,claiming that the board erred by failing to toll the filing periods contained in and by refusing to hold a hearing on his userra claim.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
we are presented with three issues is the filing deadline contained in a a subject to equitable tolling is the filing deadline contained in d b subject to equitable tolling and are veterans entitled to a hearing regarding their userra claims.because each of these questions involves the interpretation of a statute,we review the board decision de novo.see pitsker office of pers,statutory interpretation is a question of law which we review de novo.
equitable tolling 
the agency contends that the board lacks jurisdiction over kirkendall veoa claim for two reasons.first,he failed to file his complaint with dol within days of the decision not to list him on the certificate of as required by subsection a a second,he failed to appeal dol determination to the board within days as required by subsection d b in response,kirkendall argues that both filing periods are subject to equitable tolling and that his severe disability justifies tolling in this case.
in irwin department of veterans affairs,d,the supreme court established a presumption in favor of equitable tolling in suits against the government when permitted in analogous private litigation.in an attempt to honor congressional intent,the court later held that this presumption can be rebutted if there is good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply.united states brockamp,d.five factors evince a contrary congressional intent a statute detail,its technical language,its multiple iterations of the limitations period in procedural and substantive form,its explicit inclusion of exceptions,and its underlying subject matter.brice sec y of health human.
there can be little doubt that kirkendall employment discrimination claim is analogous to claims brought pursuant to title vii.see irwin,at.holding that the statutory time limits applicable to lawsuits against private employers under title vii are subject to equitable tolling brice,at holding that claims under the vaccine act are sufficiently similar to tort claims so as to invoke the irwin presumption.we therefore begin our analysis by assuming that equitable tolling applies.as a result,we need only determine whether the language and context of section indicate that congress desired otherwise.
as an initial matter,we must dispose of the agency contention that the failure to meet the filing deadline in subsection a a irrevocably forecloses a veteran from exhausting his administrative remedies,thus precluding jurisdiction in the board.the agency theory does not comport with our holding in bailey west,en banc,that the supreme court has not distinguish ed among the various kinds of time limitations that may act as conditions to the waiver of sovereign immunity.furthermore,the agency theory directly contradicts zipes trans world airlines,d,a title vii case,which held that filing a timely charge of discrimination with the eeoc is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court,but a requirement that,like a statute of limitations,is subject to waiver,estoppel,and equitable tolling.
other courts have likewise held that filing deadlines contained in statutes requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies are not jurisdictional,but rather are subject to equitable relief.for example,in edelman lynchburg college,cir,another title vii case,the fourth circuit held that the exhaustion requirement,like a statute of limitations,can be tolled.see also leong potter,cir the exhaustion requirement is akin to a statute of limitations and is subject to waiver,equitable estoppel,and equitable tolling.similarly,harms internal revenue service,cir,held that the failure to timely exhaust administrative remedies with the mspb is not a jurisdictional deficiency but rather is in the nature of a violation of a statute of limitations.in the context of the occupational safety and health act,the tenth circuit held that the requirement that an employee must file a complaint with the secretary of labor within days of a violation could be tolled.donovan hahner,foreman harness,cir analyzing c.and,the second circuit held that the failure to timely exhaust administrative remedies prescribed in the financial institution reform,recovery,and enforcement act can be excused when required by equity.carlyle towers condo.ass fed.deposit ins,cir.we therefore hold that the exhaustion requirement contained in subsection a a that a veteran file a complaint with dol within days of the alleged violation is akin to a statute of limitations.as such,we apply the same analysis to subsection a a as we apply to subsection d b in determining whether equitable tolling is allowed.
turning to the focus of our inquiry,we consider each of the five factors outlined in brockamp,at,to determine whether congress intended that equitable tolling not be allowed.first,section is not detailed.this is especially true in comparison with other administrative schemes held subject to equitable tolling,such as title vii,irwin,at,and social security,bowen city of,d.similarly,section is less detailed than the highly complex scheme used to provide benefits to veterans.see bailey,holding that is subject to equitable tolling.but see brice,at holding that the national childhood vaccine injury act is part of a detailed statutory scheme which includes other strict deadlines.
second,section language is not technical.and,although the language used in subsection d b is fairly forceful,the supreme court has held that the use of barred is,by itself,not sufficient to persuade it that congress intended to prohibit equitable tolling.irwin,at.our court came to the same conclusion in former employees of sonoco products chao,where we held that d could be tolled.
third,the timing provisions in section are not repeated.see brockamp,at.section reiterates its limitations several times in several different ways.fourth,section does not contain explicit exceptions to the two filing deadlines.see bailey,at likewise,section does not provide its own exceptions to the general rule.see also brockamp,at.section sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits,and those very specific exceptions do not include equitable tolling.martinez united states,en banc finding that contains an explicit exception for persons under legal disability brice,at t he act includes a specific exception from the limitations period for a petition improperly filed in state or federal court.
the final,and most persuasive of the five brockamp factors,is the underlying subject matter of section.the purpose of the veoa is to assist veterans in obtaining gainful employment with the federal government and to provide a mechanism for enforcing this right.in a very real sense,the veoa is an expression of gratitude by the federal government to the men and women who have risked their lives in defense of the united states.it is clear to us that,far from intending a strict interpretation,congress understood the availability of the irwin presumption,which was well established by when the veoa was adopted.we further note that veterans who seek to enforce their rights under the veoa will often proceed without the benefit of representation,just as kirkendall did.under such circumstances,it is particularly inappropriate to foreclose equitable relief.zipes,at.quoting love pullman,d see also bowen,at.the statute of limitations we construe in this case is contained in a statute that congress designed to be unusually protective of claimants.internal quotation marks omitted.and,finally,the limitations periods in section are exceedingly shorter than the period we held subject to equitable tolling in bailey,at.
having considered the five brockamp factors we are left with the definite and firm conviction that congress did not intend to override the irwin presumption as to either filing period in section.as such,we hold that both subsection a a and subsection d b are subject to equitable tolling.on remand,the board is instructed to assess whether kirkendall disability prevented him from complying with the filing requirements.see arbas nicholson,barrett principi.
ii.hearing rights under userra 
we next address kirkendall contention that he was entitled to a hearing on his userra claim the board explained in a footnote that it has discretion in userra cases to grant a hearing,and that,because there was no genuine factual dispute,a hearing was unnecessary.in refusing to grant hearings in userra cases,the board has argued that refers to userra claims as complaints,not as appeals,and therefore a which guarantees a hearing in all appeals to the board,does not apply.see metzenbaum dep t of justice,explaining the board reasoning for holding that userra complaints are not appeals.
the board reasoning defies common sense and contradicts its own regulations.first,the vast majority of cases heard by the board,and subject to section,are appeals of employment decisions,disciplinary or otherwise,made in the first instance by an agency.see,price soc.sec,guillebeau dep t of the navy,knight dep t of.these cases do not involve a lower tribunal,such as a district court,yet they clearly involve an initial decision maker distinct from the board.in the same way,userra claims originate when an agency makes an employment decision,refuses to hire a veteran.regardless of the fact that section uses the term complaint,these employment decisions are then appealed to the board for review.more troubling,however,is the board interpretation of sections and as providing less procedural protection to veterans who have potentially been victimized than to employees who have been discharged for misconduct.to the contrary,this reasoning is a gross misinterpretation of the purpose of userra.
second,the board itself understood that userra claims are appeals within the meaning of section and has promulgated numerous regulations memorializing this understanding.in,the board determined that a appeal.appeal means a request for review of an agency action the same meaning as in f and includes a complaint or action as those terms are used in userra.and in,the board refers to userra claims as appeals or to userra claimants as appellants no fewer than fourteen times.and,as noted in metzenbaum,at,the board intentionally included userra claims in its appellate jurisdiction 
for these reasons,section applies to userra cases.consequently,veterans pursuing userra claims before the board are entitled to a hearing.
conclusion 
accordingly,the decision of the board that the filing periods in can not be tolled and that does not apply to userra cases is reversed.the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
john kirkendall shall have his costs.
reversed and remanded 
the majority today holds with respect to the veoa appeal that when congress said in no event may any appeal be brought later than days,it did not really mean in no event.with respect to the userra claim the majority gives appeal a different meaning than the well established meaning of that term.i respectfully dissent.
in my view,the board should be affirmed both on the veoa claim and on the userra claim.kirkendall has failed to bring his veoa appeal within days as required by d b,and since the userra proceeding is not an appeal he is not entitled to a hearing under because he has failed to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.
turning first to the veoa appeal,the majority holds that d b is subject to equitable tolling under irwin department of veterans affairs,d.ante at.in every equitable tolling situation the threshold question is whether equitable tolling would be available in comparable private party litigation.as irwin held,it is evident that no more favorable tolling doctrine may be employed against the government than is employed in suits between private litigants.at.we reemphasized this rule in bailey west the rule we draw from irwin is that the doctrine of equitable tolling,when available in comparable suits of private parties,is available in suits against the united states,unless congress has expressed its intent to the contrary,en banc emphasis added.the majority starts with the premise that there can be little doubt that kirkendall employment discrimination claim is analogous to claims brought pursuant to title vii of the civil rights act.ante at.because the title vii statute of limitations between private parties in district court can be tolled,the majority holds that the irwin equitable tolling presumption applies.ante at.
in my view,the majority mistake lies in failing to distinguish between original and appellate proceedings.while it is true enough that kirkendall veoa claim is analogous to a title vii discrimination suit,his veoa appeal is not analogous to an original district court civil action.the veoa specifically states that the action before the board is an appeal from the department of labor.see d.kirkendall veoa appeal with the board is thus analogous to an appeal to a court of appeals under title vii.the analogous appellate filing deadline in private party title vii cases is,which is mandatory,jurisdictional,and can not not be tolled browder.dep t of,d oja dep t of the army.since equitable tolling would not be available for comparable private party litigation,it is not available under the veoa for kirkendall board appeal.
even if we were to assume that tolling would be a
