six states seek review of a directive of the department of health and human services hhs that bars them from using temporary assistance for needy families tanf grants to pay for the common costs of administering the tanf,medicaid,and food stamp programs.we conclude that hhs erroneously determined that it was without discretion to permit those expenditures.
prior to,three important federal programs provided assistance to people in need aid to families with dependent children afdc,et medicaid,id.et and the food stamp program,et.in,congress passed the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of,referred to by the parties as the welfare reform act,stat.codified as amended in scattered sections of title and other titles of.the welfare reform act replaced afdc with the tanf program.unlike afdc,which was an individual entitlement program,tanf provides federal block grants that states may use for their own public assistance programs.see et conf.noo,at,at.the amount of a state tanf grant is based on the amount of the reimbursement paid to the state under afdc during an historical base period.see.in order to receive a tanf grant,a state must submit a state plan,which hhs must approve,describing how the state intends to use the grant.id.a state may spend its grant in any manner that is reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of the tanf program,or in any manner that the state was authorized to use amounts received under afdc.id.a.
this case involves the use of tanf grants to pay the costs of program administration.prior to the enactment of the welfare reform act,the federal government reimbursed of most state administrative expenditures for each of the three,medicaid,and food a dollar limit on the amount of administrative expenditures eligible for federal reimbursement.see a afdc id.a medicaid a food stamps.this partial reimbursement scheme continues for medicaid and food stamps.as noted,however,tanf is a block grant program,under which a state receives a fixed amount of federal funds.a state may use those funds to administer the tanf program,but shall not expend more than percent of the grant for administrative purposes.b.
the specific point at issue here is whether states may use their tanf funds to pay for all of the costs that are common to the administration of tanf,medicaid,and food stamps.such costs may include,for example,the expense of determining the eligibility of applicants for assistance where the relevant criteria are common to all three programs,the cost of leasing offices and hiring employees who administer all of the programs,and the cost of administering databases containing the records of individuals who receive benefits under all of the programs.
for the past thirty years,the office of management and budget omb has issued standards concerning the allocation of the costs of government programs omb circular provides that,ordinarily,costs that benefit multiple programs funded by federal grants must be allocated among the benefiting programs in accordance with relative benefits received,rather than allocated to a single program.cost principles for state,local,and indian tribal governments,omb circular,attach.a.a the parties refer to this principle as benefiting program allocation.since,hhs has incorporated by reference omb circular in its own regulations and guidance documents.see see also id.adopted in implementation guide for omb circular,cost principles and procedures for developing cost allocation plans and indirect cost rates for agreements with the federal government,asmb hhs april 
notwithstanding the benefiting program allocation principle of omb circular,during the life of the afdc program hhs permitted states to allocate entirely to afdc all costs that were common to administration of the afdc,medicaid,and food stamp programs.the parties refer to this approach,in which common costs are allocated to a single program,as primary program allocation.its application to the afdc program was regarded as an exception to the general rule of circular 
following passage of the welfare reform act and creation of the tanf program,hhs moved to stop states from continuing to employ primary program allocation.on september,without notice or opportunity for comment,hhs office of grants and acquisition management ogam issued ogam action transmittal.the action transmittal reconfirms that,as a general rule,circular requires that 
i f any program benefits from an activity or cost,then costs must be allocated to each program.where multiple programs are involved,a single program may not be designated as the sole benefiting program primary program.
ogam action transmittal hhs.although the action transmittal recognizes that there are exceptions to this general rule,it further declares that 
cost shifting to a primary program is not permitted by most program statutes,except where there is a specific legislative provision allowing such cost shifting.while the former afdc program allowed such an exception,the tanf legislation that replaced afdc does not permit it being designated as the sole benefiting or primary program.therefore,the tanf program is subject to the cost allocation principles of.
id.emphasis added.starting with state fiscal years beginning on or after october,the action transmittal requires state cost allocation plans for the tanf program to comply with the benefiting program allocation principle.id.
six filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia seeking to prevent hhs from enforcing action transmittal.the states alleged that they incur common administrative costs that benefit tanf,medicaid,and food stamps,and that the welfare reform act permits them to use their tanf grants to cover costs that benefit tanf and other programs simultaneously.compl.at.in their papers in the district court,the plaintiffs explained that because of the fall in welfare caseloads,states have been unable to use their full tanf grants,so that they are better off financially by charging all common costs to the tanf program.plaintiffs mot.for summ.at.
the states complaint charged that action transmittal violated the administrative procedure act apa because,inter alia,it was not in accordance with law,with the tanf provisions of the welfare reform act,and because it was issued without notice and comment.see,a,d.the district court rejected these contentions and granted summary judgment in favor of hhs.arizona shalala,d.the court concluded that hhs interpretation of the welfare reform act deserved judicial deference under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,that the department reasonably interpreted the legislation to bar states from applying the primary program allocation approach to their tanf grants,that notice and comment procedures were not required in this case,and that the plaintiffs other arguments were without merit 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment against the states apa claims de novo.see independent petroleum ass of am.dewitt,wl,at,ftc.we,in part iii,the states first argument that the action transmittal is not in accordance with law,a,because its interpretation of the tanf provisions of the welfare reform act is inconsistent with the statute.hhs contends that its interpretation of the legislation must be accorded substantial deference under the rule announced in chevron.the states contend,and we agree albeit for a different reason,that chevron deference is inappropriate in this case.
chevron instructs reviewing courts to apply a framework to issues of statutory construction.first,we must ask whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,in which case we must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.chevron,at.at.if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we move to the second step and must defer to the agency interpretation as long as it is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.at.
the states contend that the supreme court recent decision in united states mead,d,which was issued after the district court decision in this case,makes chevron deference inapplicable to agency action of the kind embodied in the action transmittal.they point out that in mead,the court said i nterpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines are beyond the chevron pale.id.at quoting christensen harris county,d.action transmittal is a policy statement,the states contend,and thus does not deserve judicial deference 
we need not decide whether hhs decision to announce its statutory interpretation in the form of an action transmittal deprives that interpretation of judicial deference,because the department pronouncement does not warrant deference for another reason.the court direction in chevron was to accord deference to an agency reasonable policy choice where congress delegated to the agency the discretion to make such a choice.see chevron,at.at.the problem here,however,is that in barring primary program allocation,hhs did not purport to exercise discretion.to the contrary,the action transmittal declares that the tanf legislation does not permit it being designated as the primary program.action transmittal emphasis added.confirming the point,hhs briefs state the department view that it has no choice but to require benefiting program allocation.see appellees br.at contending that it is the intent of congress,rather than of hhs,that obliges the states to cover costs allocated outside tanf from programs other than tanf emphasis added see also id.at.in chevron terms,then,the agency itself has stopped at step one hhs believes that the statute clearly bars primary program allocation,and that it is without discretion to reach another result.
deference to an agency statutory interpretation is only appropriate when the agency has exercised its own judgment,not when it believes that interpretation is compelled by congress.phillips petroleum ferc,see transitional hosps.shalala,prill nlrb.the question of whether benefiting program allocation is actually compelled by statute is a question of law,which we review de novo.see chevron,at.at transitional,at.it is to that question that we now turn 
the states cite several provisions of the welfare reform act in support of their challenge to hhs belief that the tanf legislation bars the use of primary program allocation.we need not consider all of the states arguments,as two key provisions,subsections and of a,are sufficient to decide the case section a provides 
a state to which a grant is made under tanf may use the grant 
in any manner that is reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of this part or 
in any manner that the state was authorized to use amounts received under part a the afdc and emergency assistance programs or f the job opportunities and basic skills program of this subchapter,as these parts were in effect on september,
a.we consider these two subsections below.
citing a,the states contend that they may pay common administrative costs out of their tanf grants because such expenditures are reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of the tanf program.that purpose,as described in a,is to increase the flexibility of the states in operating a program designed to assist needy families and end dependence on government benefits 
hhs does not dispute that states may pay the costs of administering the tanf program itself out of their tanf grants.indeed,a contrary position would be hard to square with b,which,in limiting expenditures for administrative purposes to percent of the grant,clearly assumes that some such expenditures will be made.hhs contends,however,that allocating costs of administering medicaid and food stamps to tanf is not reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of the tanf legislation.tanf,the department argues,does not benefit from the payment of costs that are the responsibility of other programs.
but the costs at issue here are not costs that are solely applicable to other programs.this case is about common costs,such as the expense of determining eligibility for programs that have the same eligibility criteria.these are costs that tanf would have to bear even if the other programs did not exist,and that are incurred in order to ensure that a state tanf program accomplishes its objectives.accordingly,there is no question but that the tanf program benefits from payment of these common costs indeed,the premise of benefiting program allocation is that the costs subject to allocation benefit all of the programs at issue.see action transmittal requiring that costs be allocated to all benefiting programs based on relative benefits derived emphasis added 
hhs further argues that the statutory limitation on administrative expenditures demonstrates congressional concern about excessive administrative spending,and supports the view that expenditure of tanf funds on administrative costs allocable to medicaid and food stamps is unauthorized.only the first half of this argument is correct.there is no doubt that congress imposed a cap in order to limit administrative expenditures what other purpose could such a limit have but nothing in the primary program allocation approach preferred by the plaintiffs would permit a state to spend more than that the limit on administrative funds.moreover,while the existence of a cap reflects a concern about limiting expenditures,it may also indicate congress view that the cap alone is sufficient to satisfy that concern,and that there is no need to tell the states how to spend their grant money within that cap as long as the expenditures are otherwise calculated to advance the purpose of the program.
finally,hhs contends that omb circular represented a background of cost principles for federal grants against which congress enacted the tanf program.appellees br.at.circular was in effect when congress enacted the welfare reform act,hhs argues,and if congress had wished tanf to be exempt from these principles,it could have expressly so provided.id.because it did not do so,the department continues,it is reasonable to suppose that congress understood that tanf costs would be allocated within the parameters of circular.id.the problem with this argument is that the background against which congress enacted the welfare reform act included both circular general principle of benefiting program allocation and its exception for the afdc program.see supra part although that background may not compel the conclusion that congress intended to continue the afdc exception for its successor program,tanf,it hardly proves the opposite.
the benefiting program allocation principle may well be an appropriate tool for accounting for common costs,but it is only accounting tool,not a statutory command.it is not possible to read a which permits a state to use its tanf grant in any manner that is reasonably calculated to accomplish the purpose of the tanf barring hhs from permitting a state to spend its grant money on the costs of running the tanf program merely because those expenditures help run other programs as well.that conclusion is further reinforced by congress declaration that the purpose referenced in a is to increase the flexibility of states in operating the program.id.a see also,pt,at noting that a major purpose of the tanf legislation is to allow states maximum flexibility in the use of federal dollars.although we do not foreclose the possibility that hhs could,in the exercise of its discretion,determine that the allocation of common costs to tanf is not reasonably calculated to accomplish tanf purpose,the statute does not require hhs to reach that conclusion.
the states also contend that authorization for primary program allocation may independently be found in the grandfather clause of a.that subsection permits a state to use a tanf grant in any manner that the state was authorized to use amounts received under the afdc program.a.since states were authorized to use amounts received under afdc to pay the common administrative costs of afdc,medicaid,and food stamps,the states argue that subsection a like subsection a authorizes hhs to permit primary program allocation.hhs disputes this view of a for two reasons.
first,the department contends that the key phrase,authorized to use,refers solely to expenses that were
