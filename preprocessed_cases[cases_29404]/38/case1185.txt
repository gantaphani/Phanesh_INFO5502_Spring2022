paula parrott appeals the decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court in parrott mcdonald,e,wl vet.app.in that decision,the veterans court awarded parrott in attorney fees and expenses under the equal access to justice act eaja,d.on appeal,parrott argues that,in arriving at its award of attorney fees,the veterans court misinterpreted eaja.as a result,she contends,the court adopted an incorrect approach for determining the cost of living adjustment to be used in calculating her attorney hourly rate.she also contends that the court then abused its discretion by not allowing her to resubmit her eaja application using the approach the court had adopted.
for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the veterans court did not err with respect to its cost of living adjustment determination.we also hold that we lack jurisdiction to address parrott contention that the court abused its discretion in not allowing her to resubmit her eaja application.the decision of the veterans court is therefore affirmed.
background 
the pertinent facts are not in dispute.on august,the board of veterans appeals board denied parrott claims for benefits on account of her veteran husband esophageal adenocarcinoma,with liver and peritoneal metastasis,and his ensuing death.subsequently,on may,the veterans court vacated the board decision and remanded the case to the board for further development and readjudication.order,parrott mcdonald,vet.app.may.following the court decision,parrott timely filed for attorney fees and expenses under eaja.
in relevant part,eaja provides as follows 
except as otherwise specifically provided by statute,a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses,incurred by that party in any civil action,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states in any court having jurisdiction of that action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
in the proceedings below,the secretary agreed that parrott was a prevailing party and that his position in the underlying litigation was not substantially justified.in addition,the secretary did not contend that there were any special circumstances that made an award to parrott unjust.thus,the sole issue before the veterans court was whether parrott was entitled to the amount of fees and expenses she claimed.in her eaja application,parrott sought to recover attorney fees in the amount of and in expenses representing the filing fee in the veterans court.
eaja states that attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living justifies a higher fee.d a see also levernier,united states,fed.cir.t he court may adjust the statutory cap governing the rate of attorneys fees upward to account for an increase in the cost of living.when a court makes an upward adjustment in the cap governing the rate of attorney fees,it usually calculates the adjustment using either the national consumer price index cpi for urban consumers or a local cpi.see thangaraja gonzales,cir.calculating hourly rate adjustments using the national cpi mannino west,vet.app,calculating hourly rate adjustments using a local cpi see also sprinkle colvin,cir.collecting cases.for convenience,we refer to these two methodologies,respectively,as the national cpi approach and the local cpi approach.the national cpi approach generally focuses on the national scope of the statutory cap and the ease of computation.see jawad barnhart,supp,cal.adopting the national cpi approach due to eaja countrywide cap and pragmatic concerns with using local indices.the local cpi approach typically focuses on where an attorney works and has his or her office.see mannino,vet.app.at reasoning that upward cost of living adjustments should account for the actual cpi increase where the attorney works.
parrott claim for attorney fees of was based on alleged hours of work by her attorney at an hourly billing rate of to arrive at this rate,parrott calculated a cpi adjustment using the cpi for washington.parrott stated that her attorney,chris attig,had his principal office in dallas,texas,but also maintained offices in little rock,arkansas,and san francisco,california,and that he worked on her case in all three offices.parrott argued that,although only a very small portion of work in the case was performed in washington,using the washington,cpi was consistent with the veterans court decision in mannino.according to parrott,applying the washington,cpi fulfill ed the intent of mannino applying the local increase actually experienced by an eaja applicant represented by a firm where work was performed nationally,but always before the court in washington,dc.parrott declined to provide,as alternatives,either four separate billing rates based upon the cpis for dallas,little rock,san francisco,and washington,or a billing rate based solely upon the cpi for dallas.
responding to parrott application,the secretary acknowledged that an adjustment of the rate was appropriate.he argued,though,that the adjustment should be calculated using the cpi for dallas,texas,where attig had his principal office.this approach resulted in an hourly billing rate of.
the veterans court declined to follow either parrott or the secretary approach,concluding that neither the cpi for washington,nor the cpi for dallas,texas,was appropriate.rather,the court stated,the fairer course is to use the cost of living actually experienced by parrott attorney where the legal services were performed.parrott,wl,at internal quotation marks and alterations omitted quoting porter astrue,supp.starting from that premise,the court reasoned that the approach most consistent with mannino was to use the local cpi to calculate the hourly rate for each of the three locations in which attig performed work dallas,little rock,and san francisco and then to review attig itemized billing statement and apportion each of the billing entries listed to each of his firm offices where work was performed.id.
noting that the burden was on parrott to show the reasonableness of the fees requested,id.citing blum stenson,the veterans court stated that parrott had failed to carry that burden 
to grant the fees requested by parrott,the court would have to make a determination that it is reasonable for an attorney appearing before this court of national practice to request fees at the washington,metropolitan area hourly rate for services performed in locations outside of the washington,metropolitan area.parrott has failed to meet her burden of showing the reasonableness of the fees she requested.
as seen,the veterans court determined that the correct approach for determining attig fee was to use the local cpi to calculate the hourly rate for each of the three locations in which attig performed work and to then review attig itemized billing statement and apportion each billing entry to the firm office where the work resulting in the entry was performed.the court stated,however,that t o grant fees under the standard the court has determined is proper the court would have to seek additional information from parrott and her attorney namely the amount of work performed in each office and calculate four separate hourly rates.id.at.declining to take on this task,the court stated it would,instead,award attorney fees at the statutory rate of.id.after finding that was a reasonable number of hours for the work performed by attig,the court ruled that parrott was entitled to recover attorney fees in the amount of hours of attorney work,billed at the rate of per hour,plus in filing fees,for a total recovery of.parrott timely appealed the veterans court decision.we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
section of title provides that we shall decide all relevant questions of law arising from appeals from decisions of the veterans court,but,e xcept to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue,we may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.sneed mcdonald,fed.cir.quoting d.as noted,parrott argues that,in its decision on her attorney fees application,the veterans court misinterpreted eaja.
an argument that the veterans court misinterpreted a statute falls within our jurisdiction.see cameron shinseki,fed.cir.holding that we have jurisdiction over the veterans court interpretation of statutes bowey west,fed.cir.holding that the veteran court interpretation of eaja presents a question of law within our jurisdiction.because they present issues of law,we review questions of statutory interpretation from the veterans court de novo.bowey,at statutory interpretation is a question of law,which we review without deference.see also hudgens mcdonald,fed.cir.we review statutory and regulatory interpretations of the veterans court de novo.quoting johnson mcdonald,fed.cir.
parrott argues that the veterans court misconstrued eaja by requiring her to calculate the cost of living adjustment to her attorney hourly rate using the local cpi approach.appellant opening br.according to parrott,eaja does not mandate a particular method for computing attorney fees,and the veterans court therefore erred by requiring a specific approach for every case.id.at.continuing,parrott urges that there is ambiguity in eaja because it does not specify the cpi approach to be used in calculating an attorney hourly rate.from there,she contends that,because ambiguity in a statute relating to veterans benefits is to be construed in favor of the veteran,she should be permitted to use the cpi approach yielding the highest return in fees id.at.in parrott view,this optimal yield approach allows her to select the cpi of the location of her attorney or the location of the veterans court.id.at.here,parrott contends that she is entitled to use the cpi for the location of the veterans court washington id.at.
the secretary responds that the veterans court complied with its precedent in mannino.appellee response br.while acknowledging that courts have split in their use of the national cpi and the local cpi approaches,he urges that the weight of authority favors the local cpi approach.id.at.in the secretary view,the local cpi approach is more consistent with the plain language of eaja because prevailing market rates and the cost of living are inherently local phenomena.id.at.moreover,he continues,the local cpi approach produces fairer outcomes because it accounts for the actual cost of living experienced by the eaja applicant attorney.id.at.the secretary also resists parrott optimal yield approach,arguing that eaja is not a veterans benefits statute,but rather a statute of general application.he also argues that eaja represents a waiver of sovereign immunity and thus should be strictly construed in the government favor.id.at.
as in any statutory construction case,we begin with the plain language of the statute.see sebelius cloer.eaja reimburses prevailing parties in certain civil actions against the united states for reasonable attorney fees.d a.attorney fees must be based upon prevailing market rates and are statutorily capped at per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living justifies a higher fee.d a emphases added.
in mannino,the veterans court adopted the local cpi approach for calculating increases in hourly attorney rates above the eaja cap.mannino,vet.app.at.the court held that eaja presumptively limits an attorney hourly rate to and that any upward adjustment must be based on the local cpi where the attorney works.id.the veterans court noted that there is a split of authority on this issue and that some district courts do use the national cpi approach.id.at.the court determined,however,that using the local cpi approach is the fairer course because it better reflects the increases actually experienced by the eaja applicant.id.at internal alterations omitted quoting cox constr.united states,cl.
the question addressed in mannino appears to be one of first impression in this court.in chiu united states,fed.cir,we reviewed a decision from the united states claims court that used local cost of living figures to calculate eaja fees,but we took no position on the propriety of that approach.see at accepting without comment the local washington,cost of living,taking issue with the date of the claims court cost of living but not its location.similarly,in levernier,we reversed the claims court upward adjustment of eaja fees where market rates were below the statutory cap,but we did not address whether the local or the national cpi should apply where market rates were above the cap.at.finally,in doty united states,fed.cir,we awarded eaja fees based upon an hourly rate above the statutory cap,but in that case the government did not contest the manner of calculating attorney fees,and we thus had no occasion to rule on the question before us now.at.none of these cases provides controlling guidance on the proper cpi approach under eaja 
after considering the statutory text and the relevant cases,we think the local cpi approach,where a local cpi is available,see mannino,vet.app.at,is more consistent with eaja than the national approach.we therefore hold that the veterans court did not err in ruling that the local cpi approach represented the correct method of calculating the adjustment in parrott attorney hourly rate 
the local cpi approach gives the most effect to the statutory text.eaja expressly defines recoverable attorney fees in terms of prevailing market rates for the kind and quality of the services furnished and states in relevant part that attorney fees shall not be awarded in excess of per hour unless the court determines that an increase in the cost of living justifies a higher fee.d a.these two factors market rates and the cost of living strike us as being inherently local in nature.we thus believe that using the market rate and the cost of living actually experienced by an eaja applicant attorney is most consistent with eaja plain language.mannino,vet.app.at cox,cl.at.indeed,the supreme court,under a different statute,expressed reasonable attorney fees in terms of prevailing market rates in the relevant community.blum,at emphasis added interpreting the attorney fees provision for civil rights actions under.
the local cpi approach also better fulfills the purposes underpinning eaja.congress passed eaja to ensure adequate representation for those needing to vindicate their rights against the government and minimize the cost of this redress to taxpayers.baker bowen,cir.see also eaja,pub,stat.describing eaja purposes kelly nicholson,fed.cir.the local cpi approach advances both of these goals.it assists litigants with meritorious claims in securing suitable counsel,whose costs may exceed national rates.undercompensating such applicants would deter them from bringing lawful claims against the government,thereby frustrating eaja stated intent.see,payne sullivan,cir.finding that insufficiently compensating eaja applicants undermine s the purpose of eaja to remove the financial disincentive to challenge wrongful government action quoting animal lovers volunteer ass n,carlucci,cir.meyer sullivan,cir.hamblen,supp.at.similarly,the local cpi approach reduces taxpayer exposure by preventing windfalls to attorneys whose costs of living lie below the national average.hamblen,supp.at mannino,vet.app.at.
the national cpi approach provides none of the above benefits.under that approach,attorneys whose costs of living dip below the national cpi receive a windfall,encumbering the public with fees unneeded to represent the applicant.at the same time,attorneys whose costs of living surpass the national cpi are not reimbursed for their true fees,discouraging the representation eaja seeks to secure.
using local cpi figures is also consistent with our holding in levernier.in that case,we refused to grant a cost of living increase to an attorney whose market rate fell short of the statutory cap.levernier,at.because an attorney rate is partially a function of his or her cost of living among other things,levernier suggests that local price conditions can serve
