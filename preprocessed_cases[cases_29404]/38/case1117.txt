plaintiff karyn walker is a qui tam relator,seeking recovery on behalf of the united states pursuant to the false claims act.walker appeals a summary judgment granted to defendant properties of lake county,formerly known as leesburg family medicine,lfm.and walker contends that the district court erred in limiting the scope of information discoverable in the case to that information relevant to the time period during which she was employed by lfm as a nurse practitioner.lfm,contending that the district court erred in denying its motion to dismiss walker amended complaint.
we conclude that the district court erred in holding that walker had not produced sufficient evidence of the falsity of the claims submitted by lfm to resist summary judgment.therefore,we reverse the district court judgment.we also find error in the district court order limiting discovery.we find no error in the district court denial of lfm motion to dismiss.
background procedural history 
the medicare program is a system of health insurance administered by the united states department of health and human services,through the center for medicare and medicaid services cms.cms was formerly known as the health care financing administration hcfa.medicare part b is a federally subsidized,voluntary health insurance program that pays a portion of the costs of certain health services,including the costs of clinic visits to healthcare providers among them,physicians,physician assistants,and nurse practitioners.reimbursement for medicare part b claims is made through cms,which contracts with private insurance carriers throughout the united states to administer and pay claims within their regions from the medicare trust fund.these insurance carriers are known as fiscal intermediaries,or fis.in general,when a healthcare service is rendered to a patient covered by medicare part b,the healthcare provider bills through the fi.the fi reviews the bill and pays the healthcare provider.cms publishes a series of manuals that provide billing and payment instructions to the medicare community.among these manuals are the medicare carrier manual,directed to the fis,and the provider reimbursement manual,directed to healthcare providers.
lfm operates medical clinics in leesburg and lady lake,florida.at these clinics,physicians,physician assistants,and nurse practitioners provide medical services to the community.many,if not most,of lfm patients are covered by medicare part lfm submits claims for medicare reimbursement for healthcare services rendered by physicians,physician assistants and nurse practitioners to its fi,blue cross blue shield of florida,pursuant to a contract between lfm and blue cross blue shield.these claims are made on hcfa forms in electronic form,as required by the medicare regulations,and signed electronically by lfm physicians.each hcfa form states 
signature of physician or supplier 
medicare,champus,feca and black lung 
i certify that the services shown on this form were medically indicated and necessary for the health of the patient and were personally furnished by me or were furnished incident to my professional service by my employee under my immediate personal supervision,except as otherwise expressly permitted by medicare or champus regulations.
for services to be considered incident to a physician professional service,they must be rendered under the physician immediate personal supervision by employee,they must be an integral,although incidental part of a covered physician service,they must be of kinds commonly furnished in physician offices,and the services of nonphysicians must be included on the physician bills.
healthcare providers may bill medicare part b for the services of physician assistants and nurse practitioners in one of two ways the amount of reimbursement the providers receive is dependent on the billing method.physician assistant or nurse practitioner services may be billed as services incident to the service of a physician.cfr.to be correctly billed in this manner,the physician assistant or nurse practitioner services must have been provided under certain circumstances when physician assistant or nurse practitioner services are billed as incident to the service of a physician,the physician unique provider identification number upin is used on the bill submitted to the fi.alternatively,a provider may bill medicare for physician assistant and nurse practitioner services under the physician assistant or nurse practitioner own upin.billing medicare in this second way indicates that the physician assistant or nurse practitioner has performed the service under some level of supervision by a physician,but the requirements of cfr have not necessarily been met.for services billed under a physician assistant or nurse practitioner upin,the fi pays of what it would pay for the same services billed under a physician upin.
walker worked for lfm from february until may as a nurse practitioner.during that time,there were many occasions when she saw patients independently without physician supervision.physicians were not always physically present in the lfm clinic while walker and other nurse practitioners and physician assistants saw patients,but physicians were always available for consultation by pager and telephone.
ii.contentions of the parties 
walker brings this suit as a qui tam relator under the false claims act.she alleges that lfm filed false claims for medicare reimbursement by billing medicare for services rendered by nurse practitioners and physician assistants as if those services were rendered incident to the service of a physician,even though lfm knew that the nurse practitioner and physician assistant services did not meet several of the criteria necessary for billing in that manner.chief among walker complaints is that lfm billed all nurse practitioner and physician assistant services as incident to the service of a physician,even though the nurse practitioners and physician assistants often treated patients at lfm clinics when no physician was physically present in the clinic.she contends that a physician physical presence within the office suite was required in order for the nurse practitioner or physician assistant service to have been rendered incident to the service of a physician,as used in cfr and under the physician immediate personal supervision as certified by the physician on each hcfa claim form.walker further contends that lfm knew that its billing practice was fraudulent and that lfm knew the proper way to bill the services as services rendered directly by the nurse practitioner or physician assistant rather than as services incident to the service of a physician.walker alleges that,as a result of the fraudulent manner in which lfm billed medicare,lfm was paid more than it should have been paid for nurse practitioner and physician assistant services to medicare patients.
lfm admits that physicians were not always physically present in the clinic while nurse practitioners and physician assistants treated patients.lfm also admits that it submitted hcfa forms to blue cross blue shield requesting medicare reimbursement for services of nurse practitioners and physician assistants performed incident to the service of a physician,even if the nurse practitioner and physician assistant services were performed while no physician was physically present in the lfm office suite.lfm further concedes that the submission of the hcfa forms constitutes the presentation of claims for purposes of the false claims act.however,lfm argues that,as a matter of law,these claims could not have been false within the meaning of the false claims act because the phrase incident to the service of a physician was,at least until january,vague and subject to reasonable interpretations other than that championed by walker.it further argues that the immediate personal supervision language in the hcfa certification is similarly vague and therefore,as a matter of law,can not be the basis for a false claim.
the parties also disagree about the time period relevant to walker lawsuit.walker maintains that lfm made false claims for physician assistant and nurse practitioner services performed from the time it first hired a physician assistant in through the date walker filed her complaint,and she argues that her complaint properly alleges the existence of false claims throughout this entire period.lfm,on the other hand,contends that walker could allege properly only that false claims were presented from february through may,the dates of her employment at lfm 
the district court granted lfm summary judgment because it found that lfm requests for reimbursement could not be false as a matter of law.the district court reasoned that,because the medicare statutes and regulations in effect during the period of walker employment with lfm did not adequately define the phrase incident to the service of a physician and because the terms immediate,integral,and incidental as used on the hcfa form are inherently imprecise,lfm interpretation of the terms that nurse practitioners and physician assistants could see patients independently so long as a physician was available by pager and telephone must be accepted as reasonable.in opposition to lfm motion for summary judgment,walker offered evidence of how the regulatory language and the hcfa certification language were interpreted in the medicare community.walker contends that this evidence would support a finding that the claims submitted were false.however,the district court considered the evidence insufficient to present an issue of fact as to the meaning of the terms.
iii.issues on appeal 
to determine whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment,we must decide whether the medicare regulations and hcfa form are unclear regarding the criteria that must be fulfilled in order for services of a nurse practitioner or physician assistant to be billed as services incident to the service of a physician.if we decide that they are unclear,we must then decide whether a court may look to evidence other than the language of the regulation and form to determine whether a claim,allegedly submitted in violation of that language,is false within the meaning of the false claims act.if we decide that a court may look to evidence outside the language at issue,we must determine whether the evidence walker presented in opposition to lfm motion for summary judgment is sufficient to create an issue of fact as to the falsity of the claims lfm made to medicare.
we also decide whether the district court erred in limiting discovery in the action to information relevant to the time period during which walker was employed by lfm.
finally,to decide lfm,we determine whether walker amended complaint satisfies the requirements of rule b.
iv.standards of review 
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same legal standards that bound that court and viewing all facts and reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.strickland water works and sewer bd.of the city of birmingham,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.

discussion 
the false claims act states 
any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,to an officer or employee of the united states government a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than,plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person 
a.the false claims act authorizes private citizens to bring actions on behalf of the united states.b.these plaintiffs are known as qui tam relators.to establish a cause of action under the false claims act,a relator must prove three elements a false or fraudulent claim which was presented,or caused to be presented,by the defendant to the united states for payment or approval with the knowledge that the claim was false.a.recovery under the false claims act is not measured by the amount of any actual damage a relator might have sustained personally as a result of a defendant false claim.rather,the relator stands in the shoes of the united states government.she can prosecute the lawsuit on the united states behalf,and recover,for the united states,the losses attributable to any fraudulent claim and the civil penalty authorized by the statute.
a.the grant of summary judgment 
in this case,the district court granted summary judgment for lfm because it found that,as a matter of law,walker complaint and evidence did not present the possibility of a false or fraudulent claim.as stated above,the district court found that the regulatory language that walker claimed was violated when lfm submitted its claims was ambiguous and therefore could not,as a matter of law,serve as the predicate for a false claims action.we find error in the district court reasoning.
first,we note that the district court granted lfm summary judgment on walker entire complaint even though a subset of the claims alleged by walker were allegedly submitted after the medicare regulation had been amended and clarified.see supra.as of january,four months before walker filed her original complaint in this case,the regulation providing conditions for coverage of services rendered incident to the service of a physician was clear about the meaning of that phrase.as of that date,all services billed as incident to the services of a physician must have been rendered under a physician direct supervision.cfr b.in order to satisfy this direct supervision requirement,the physician must have been present in the office suite and immediately available to furnish assistance and direction throughout the performance of the procedure.cfr a,b ii.this regulatory language unambiguously requires that a physician be present in the office.furthermore,this new regulatory language illuminates the meaning of the physician certification on the hcfa form that the billed services were personally furnished by me or were furnished incident to my professional service by my employee under my immediate personal supervision,at least as of january.
medicare claims may be false if they claim reimbursement for services or costs that either are not reimbursable or were not rendered as claimed.see united states calhoon,cir peterson weinberger,cir.given the clear definition of services rendered incident to the service of a physician that became effective january,walker should be permitted to present evidence to a supporting her allegations that any medicare claims lfm submitted from january,until the date of her complaint for services of nurse practitioners or physician assistants incident to the service of a physician,were not,in fact,rendered in compliance with the applicable medicare regulation and,therefore,were false.an issue of fact also exists as to whether lfm physician certifications on the hcfa forms submitted from january,until the date of walker complaint were false.
additionally,the district court erred by holding that any ambiguity in the earlier version of cfr and the hcfa certification necessarily forecloses,as a matter of law,the falsity of claims submitted by lfm prior to january.we agree that the regulatory language in effect until january,was ambiguous.but we disagree as to the legal significance of that ambiguity.in opposition to lfm motion for summary judgment,walker submitted provisions from the medicare carrier manual,medicare bulletins,seminar programs,and expert testimony regarding proper billing incident to the service of a physician,as used in cfr.she also presented two notes written by lfm employee that paraphrase a billing consultant advice.all of these sources were offered to show the meaning of the language in the regulation and on the hcfa form and the reasonableness of lfm claimed understanding of that language.at least some of these sources would support a finding that,in the medicare community,the language was understood to mean that a physician had to be physically present i
