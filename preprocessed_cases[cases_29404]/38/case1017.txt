the oklahoma health care authority ohca asserted a medicaid lien on a million settlement of plaintiffs malpractice suit against dale wolford.the district court,however,allotted ohca only in full satisfaction of the lien.ohca appeals,contending that the district court lost jurisdiction of the malpractice litigation when ohca intervention as a defendant destroyed diversity of citizenship that the district court erred in not conducting an evidentiary hearing at which ohca could challenge the reduction of its lien and that the district court did not comply with oklahoma law when it reduced ohca lien.we reject the jurisdictional argument because the statute,permitted the joinder of ohca as a nondiverse defendant.we reject ohca second contention because it did not timely request an evidentiary hearing.as for its final contention,we hold that the district court correctly construed oklahoma law but erred in finding that the settling parties had proved by clear and convincing evidence that only of the settlement could be attributed to medical care paid by medicaid.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
on may,plaintiff stacy price gave birth to her daughter,at grady memorial hospital in chickasha,oklahoma.the father is plaintiff chad james.was born with severe brain damage and other disabilities,which have required and will continue to require significant medical care.price,on behalf of,applied for and received medicaid benefits.as a condition of receiving benefits,she assigned to medicaid agency for right to receive any payments from a third party for k.medical care.see a a states must require medicaid recipients to assign such rights.in addition,oklahoma law places a statutory lien on such payments.see.stat.tit,d.
on september,price and james,individually and as next friends of,sued wolford,who had delivered,for alleged negligence during labor and delivery.the united states district court for the western district of oklahoma had jurisdiction under because plaintiffs were residents of oklahoma and wolford was a resident of maryland.plaintiffs claimed damages for medical expenses and loss of consortium with their daughter.their expert,lon huff,estimated the lifetime cost of care at just over million.wolford moved to limit or exclude huff testimony as unreliable,but the district court denied the motion after a hearing to determine whether the testimony satisfied the requirements of daubert merrell dow pharmaceuticals.during a settlement conference on june,the parties agreed to settle for million counsel for ohca was present and did not object to the settlement total.as of june,ohca had paid of medical expenses.
on july plaintiffs and wolford filed a joint motion asking the district court to approve the settlement.the motion,which was served on ohca,attached a proposed order allocating to ohca in full satisfaction of its lien.on august the court held a friendly suit hearing attended by attorneys for plaintiffs,wolford,and ohca.the court was informed that the case had settled for million,of which was to go to james for the expenses he had incurred in caring for,and was to go to ohca.ohca objected to the allocation.in response,plaintiffs attorney pointed to huff million estimate of the cost of lifetime care and contended that medicaid is only entitled to its proportionate share of the settlement proceeds versus what the overall damages were that could have been claimed in the case.at.ohca attorney responded that plaintiffs had provided ohca with no information regarding the asserted million value of their claim.
upon a suggestion by plaintiffs attorney,the court invited briefing,and ohca attorney requested permission to file a motion to intervene so that she could file a brief.the court granted the request and deferred its decision on the settlement pending full briefing by the parties on the allocation to ohca.ohca filed its motion to intervene and supporting brief on august,attaching a proposed answer and counterclaim.the motion and brief argued against the proposed lien payment of,but did not request an evidentiary hearing to present additional evidence.the proposed answer stated the cost of care,and the counterclaim asserted ohca entitlement to recover from the settlement proceeds.ohca also submitted a brief on legal issues regarding medicaid liens.addressing the proposed settlement allocation,the brief noted that no evidence has been submitted regarding plaintiffs valuation of their case the ohca has certainly not stipulated to any valuation other than the amount plaintiffs determined was appropriate to settle claims for.id.at.
the district court granted ohca motion to intervene,but gave little relief.finding that plaintiffs and wolford had proved the propriety of their proposed allocation by clear and convincing evidence,as required by oklahoma law,see.stat.tit,d d,it ordered that ohca be paid in full satisfaction of its lien.it agreed with plaintiffs and wolford that the ratio of the set aside for ohca lien to the total lien of is roughly equal to the ratio of the million settlement amount to plaintiffs damages including lifetime expenses of million but it then redirected to ohca the that the settlement agreement had allocated to james for medical expenses.
on november,ohca filed a motion under.asking the district court to modify its judgment or dismiss the action on the ground that ohca intervention destroyed diversity.the court denied the motion and ohca appealed.it asserts that its intervention destroyed diversity because it is not a citizen of a state,that it was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the propriety of the settlement allocation,and that oklahoma law requires that it be paid its full lien amount from the settlement proceeds because plaintiffs have not proved the propriety of their allocation of those proceeds.
ii.discussion 
jurisdiction 
we first address whether the district court had jurisdiction over this case after ohca intervened.in general,our review of a question of jurisdiction is de novo,see king fisher marine,phoenix,cir,although we review for clear error any findings of fact relevant to the question,see aves ex rel.aves shah,cir.
ohca claims that its intervention destroyed the requirement of complete diversity,see lincoln prop.roche,because it is an alter ego of the state of oklahoma and diversity suits must be between citizens of different states rather than between a state and a citizen of another state,see state highway comm of utah constr,texas of nous.cmty.affairs verex assurance,cir in an action where a state is a party,there can be no federal jurisdiction on the basis of diversity of citizenship because a state is not a citizen for purposes of diversity jurisdiction.although we agree that if ohca had been a named defendant when suit was brought,the federal court would not have had diversity jurisdiction assuming,as we do,that ohca is an alter ego of the state,we do not agree that ohca intervention destroyed jurisdiction.
ordinarily,the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought,and after vesting,it can not be ousted by subsequent events.mullan torrance,wheat,accord grupo dataflux atlas global group.there is no dispute that the district court had diversity jurisdiction over the original suit between plaintiffs and wolford.plaintiffs properly alleged an amount in controversy greater than,and the adverse parties were citizens of different states,with plaintiffs residing in oklahoma and wolford residing in maryland.see.
once a district court has jurisdiction,additional claims and parties can be added under the statute,a,which grants the district courts jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under article iii of the united states constitution.a claim is part of the same case or controversy if it derive s from a common nucleus of operative fact.city of chicago int l coll.of surgeons,quoting united mine workers of am.gibbs.here,there is no question that ohca claim for a share of the settlement proceeds arises out of the same facts as the underlying tort claim.and a explicitly states that supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties.
although b sets forth exceptions to supplemental jurisdiction,they are not applicable here.the exceptions relating to intervention under.rule preclude supplemental jurisdiction over claims by parties seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under rule and claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,if exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section.b.neither exception applies here because ohca intervened as a defendant,not a plaintiff,and plaintiffs assert no claims against it.see generally exxon mobil allapattah,discussing dev.fin.alpha hous.health care,cir the plain language of b limits supplemental jurisdiction over claims of plaintiffs against persons made parties under rule,and of parties who join or intervene as plaintiffs pursuant to rule.the section has little to say about defendants.citation and internal quotation marks omitted denis mclaughlin,the federal supplemental jurisdiction constitutional and statutory analysis,t he statute exempts defendants from the restrictions of b and thus fully preserves supplemental jurisdiction for claims asserted by defendants in all actions,whether founded on federal question,diversity of citizenship,or any other jurisdictional basis.charles alan wright,arthur miller,mary kay kane,federal practice and procedure,at b plays no role in claims,such as counterclaims and crossclaims,asserted by defendants or defendants moreover,it is clear that a defendant or defendant does not become a plaintiff for purposes of b by asserting a claim.
we must note,however,a qualification to our conclusion that because of ohca status as a defendant,b does not foreclose jurisdiction.although ohca moved to intervene as a defendant,courts are not bound by the way in which the parties seek to align themselves.hence,we might be required to reject supplemental jurisdiction based on an exception under b if we had to realign ohca as a plaintiff.we therefore explore that possibility.
the leading case on realignment is city of indianapolis chase nat.bank of new york.in that case a citizen of new york brought suit against three citizens of indiana.but the supreme court ruled that the requisite diversity was lacking because one of the defendants should have been aligned as a plaintiff.the four parties were chase national bank chase,a new york corporation indianapolis gas company indianapolis gas and citizens gas company citizens,both indiana corporations and the city of indianapolis the city.see id.at.indianapolis gas was the city incumbent gas company.citizens was formed to compete with it,but citizen franchise provided that years after formation,the company would be wound up and its property conveyed to the city subject to the company outstanding legal obligations.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.before the years elapsed,indianapolis gas leased all its property to citizens for a term.as part of the agreement,citizens was to pay the interest on indianapolis gas bonds.chase was the trustee under a mortgage deed from indianapolis gas that secured the bonds.when the franchise expired,citizens conveyed its property to the city,but the city refused to be bound by the terms of the lease from indianapolis gas.see id.because the city would not pay interest on the indianapolis gas bonds,chase sued the three defendants,asking that the court declare the lease a valid obligation of the city and that the interest due be paid by the parties liable therefor.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.citizens and the city contended that the lease was not valid but indianapolis gas agreed with chase.see id.although the court acknowledged that the complaint alleged liability of indianapolis gas on the bonds,it said that this liability was not really in issue,and by its answer,indianapolis gas took it out of the case.id.at.thus,the only question presented by the litigation was whether the lease bound the city,and chase and indianapolis gas have always been united on this issue,id.at.the supreme court therefore ruled that the parties must be realigned so that those two parties were placed on the same side.see id.at.because an indiana citizen was then on each side,the district court lacked diversity jurisdiction to hear the matter.id.at.
the federal courts of appeals are divided on how to interpret city of indianapolis,some applying the test and others the test or its cousin,the collision of interests test to determine when a party must be realigned.see james moore et,moore federal practice ed.under the test,the parties must be realigned if there is no adversity with regard to the primary issue in dispute.id.at city of indianapolis,at alignment must be ascertained from the principal purpose of the suit internal quotation marks omitted.under the test,a party need not be realigned so long as it has an actual and substantial conflict with a party on the other side.moore et,supra,city of indianapolis,at to sustain diversity jurisdiction there must exist an actual,substantial,controversy between citizens of different states citations and internal quotation marks omitted.
the test might be difficult to apply in this case because the primary purpose arguably changed between the time that the plaintiffs filed suit when the core issue was wolford liability and the time that ohca intervened when the core issue was the amount of ohca lien.but that problem need not concern us because this circuit uses the test.we adopted that test in farmers alliance mutual insurance jones,cir.see moore et,supra,including this circuit as one that has adopted the test.shippey was killed while driving a car.his three passengers,melissa spann,alan jones,and craig lee mccracken,were injured.see id.the car was owned by spann chevrolet and insured under a policy issued by farmers.farmers assumed liability only for accidents in which the driver received proper permission to drive the car.after jones and mccracken brought negligence actions against shippey estate in state court,farmers filed in federal court a diversity action seeking a declaratory judgment that it was not liable on its policy because shippey did not have permission to drive the car.the defendants were spann chevrolet,orval spann a vice president of spann chevrolet,melissa spann,shippey estate,jones,and mccracken.the district court found that shippey was not a covered driver and ruled that farmers was not liable.jones and mccracken appealed,arguing that the district court had lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because there had been no adversity between plaintiff farmers and defendants orval spann and spann chevrolet,who should have been realigned as plaintiffs,which would destroy diversity.see id.at.we disagreed.although jones and mccracken were correct that spann and spann chevrolet shared farmers view that it was not liable to jones and mccracken,the interests of farmers diverged from those of spann and spann chevrolet in that the latter contended that farmers owed duties to defend them and to provide coverage in the event of an adverse verdict.see id.at.we made no attempt in farmers alliance to determine the primary purpose of the litigation.it was enough that the oppositely aligned parties had substantial adverse interests.
in this case there is a substantial conflict between ohca and plaintiffs.any sum going to ohca is taken from plaintiffs recovery.therefore,we can not realign ohca as a plaintiff,and the district court had jurisdiction over the entire suit after ohca intervention.
after the district court entered its order approving the settlement and allocating of the proceeds to ohca in full satisfaction of its lien,ohca filed a motion to reconsider under.in addition to raising the jurisdictional argument that we have rejected,it argued that ohca had been improperly denied the opportunity to engage in discovery and present evidence and that the district court order did not properly apply oklahoma law in determining ohca share of the
