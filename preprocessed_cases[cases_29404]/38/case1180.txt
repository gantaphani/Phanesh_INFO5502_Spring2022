attorney david power seeks a writ of mandamus compelling the social security administration ssa to approve a fee agreement he submitted to recover fees for representing a claimant before the ssa.the district court dismissed power complaint,finding that he had failed to satisfy the strict requirements for mandamus.because neither power right to relief nor the ssa duty to provide it is clear,and because power failed to avail himself of an adequate alternative remedy,we affirm the district court determination that a grant of the extraordinary remedy of mandamus is inappropriate in this case.
under the social security act,a,an attorney who represents a person with a claim for social security benefits before the ssa has a right to a reasonable fee,fixed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the commissioner of social security.id.a.in,the ssa issued regulations establishing a fee petition process for the purpose of determining a reasonable fee.see.those regulations require the attorney to submit a petition listing such information as the services rendered,the amount of time expended,and the fee desired.id.a.the ssa then evaluates the petition based on such factors as the complexity of the case,the level of skill required of the attorney,and the results achieved for the claimant.id.b 
in,congress amended a,adding a new subsection,a.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat.that subsection authorizes an attorney who assists a claimant with an administrative claim to receive compensation pursuant to a fee agreement entered into with the claimant.such an agreement must satisfy three prerequisites i it must be submitted to the commissioner in writing prior to the time the commissioner makes a determination on the claim ii it must specify a fee that does not exceed the lesser of of the benefits awarded or and iii the commissioner must make a determination favorable to the claimant.a a.if these requirements are satisfied,then the commissioner of social security shall approve that agreement at the time of the favorable determination,and the fee specified in the agreement shall be the maximum fee.id.as with fee petitions,when a fee agreement is approved,the ssa certifies the fee for payment out of the benefits owed to the claimant.see id.a b.
this case originated in a claim for disability benefits filed by jerome fleeton in.at that time,fleeton lived in ohio and was represented before the agency there by john mcnally,iii.fleeton signed an appointment of representative form and a fee agreement naming mcnally as his attorney.see joint appendix at.fleeton initial application for disability benefits was denied,and he requested a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.before the hearing took place,however,fleeton moved to maryland and had the hearing transferred to the washington,hearing office.
fleeton engaged power,the plaintiff here,to represent him before the alj in washington.fleeton signed a second appointment of representative form and another attorney fee agreement,this time with power.see at.the alj awarded fleeton benefits on october,and issued an order approv ing the fee agreement between the claimant and his representative.at.
the ssa soon realized that two attorneys had represented fleeton over the course of his claim.on july,the deputy chief alj of the ssa office of hearings and appeals issued an order disapproving power fee agreement.in a letter to power,the deputy chief alj explained that s ince the claimant appointed more than one representative,and all did not sign a single,common fee agreement or waive charging and collecting a fee,the social security administration can not process your fee under the fee agreement process.at.in order to collect a fee,the letter advised,power would have to file a fee petition.id.
power did not file a fee petition,nor did he seek a fee waiver from mcnally.instead,he filed suit in the united states district court for the district of columbia under,seeking a writ of mandamus ordering the ssa to approve his fee agreement the district court dismissed power complaint,holding that a does not grant an attorney a clear right,nor impose upon the ssa a clear duty,with respect to approval of a fee agreement when two or more attorneys have submitted agreements regarding the same claim.the court also held that,given the availability of the fee petition process,power had failed to show that mandamus was the only adequate remedy available.we review the district court dismissal of the complaint de novo,accepting the complaint allegations as true for purposes of this appeal.see gray poole.
the remedy of mandamus is a drastic one,to be invoked only in extraordinary circumstances.allied chemical daiflon,d.mandamus is available only if the plaintiff has a clear right to relief the defendant has a clear duty to act and there is no other adequate remedy available to plaintiff.northern states power dep t of energy,quoting council of and for the blind of delaware cty.valley,regan,en banc.the party seeking mandamus has the burden of showing that its right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable.northern states power,at quoting gulfstream aerospace mayacamas,d.the plaintiff has failed to satisfy that burden here.
power bases his claim that he has satisfied the first two requirements of plaintiff right to relief and defendant duty to act be the language of a a.that provision declares that the commissioner of social security shall approve a fee agreement if the agreement meets the three prerequisites of the subsection described above.as the ssa points out,however,a is silent as to what the commissioner should do if she is presented with more than one fee agreement.indeed,the three statutory prerequisites,as well as the shall approve clause,are all written in the that congress did not contemplate a scenario in which multiple attorneys presented agreements moreover,as the ssa further argues,if there were a mandatory duty to approve any agreement that met the three prerequisites,and if two agreements in a single case did so,then approval of both could conflict with an important purpose of a a ii to cap the amount that a claimant may agree to pay in attorneys fees at the lesser of of his recovery or.accordingly,the ssa set forth in its july where there are agreements with more than one attorney,the attorneys must file fee petitions so that the agency can review the requested fees for their overall reasonableness.
power concedes that the statute is silent on the question of how the ssa should handle multiple fee agreements.he argues,however,that the ssa need not resort to the fee petition process of a to handle the problem of multiple fees that in combination may exceed the statutory maximum.as power points out,an alternative solution is offered by a a,which empowers the commissioner to reduce a fee agreement if the fee is clearly excessive for services rendered.nonetheless,the fact that there are alternative solutions to the problem posed by multiple fee agreements does not impose a clear duty on the ssa to choose the alternative preferred by the plaintiff.
power also contends that the ssa position in this case is inconsistent with its prior interpretation of a.following the trail of agency pronouncements on this subject poses only slightly less difficulty than following the trail of bread crumbs left by hansel and gretel.power rests his claim on an attachment to a internal memorandum written by daniel skoler,who at the time was the associate commissioner of the ssa office of hearings and appeals.the attachment to the memorandum states that,even if an alj mistakenly approves one of multiple fee agreements,the ssa should continue to process the agreement because the agency exception to paying under multiple agreements is not statutory.at.the ssa responds to power argument by advising that it has replaced the skoler memorandum with a new interpretation of the statutory requirements of a,an interpretation that the agency says is reflected in its current program operations manual system poms.see letter from ssa to power july,citing poms gn at.under this new interpretation,the agency says,a fee request must be m
