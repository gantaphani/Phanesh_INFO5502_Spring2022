background 
barrett served on active duty in the army from july to january,and in the navy from february to july.he alleges that soon after returning from his tour of duty in vietnam he began to experience emotional problems,but that the symptoms did not become severe until.in,barrett was diagnosed with stress disorder ptsd and panic disorder.he claims that by he suffered from flashbacks and hallucinations.
barrett sought service connection for his ptsd and a hand injury both claims were denied by the regional office and the board of veterans appeals board.on august,the board mailed its decision affirming the denial of benefits to barrett.barrett appealed the board decision to the veterans court on december,eight days beyond the period for appeal.the government moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.on may,barrett responded that he was prevented from filing a timely notice of appeal because he had been incapacitated by mental illness,and that the veterans court should therefore toll the running of the appeal period.the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,stating that ill health has not been adopted as a basis for such tolling.barrett principi,wl.claims lexis.june,barrett i.on appeal,we reversed the veterans court,holding that mental illness can justify equitable tolling of section a under some circumstances,barrett principi,barrett ii,and remanded for application of this standard to barrett case.

barrett moved to stay proceedings pending the outcome of jones principi,then before the veterans court on a motion for remand to the dva for record development on the issue of mental incapacity for the purpose of equitable tolling.on august,the veterans court deferred consideration of barrett motion and ordered him to file his response within seven days.barrett responded,relying on the arguments and evidence presented in his may,submission.
in the government response,it attached and made arguments based on several medical records dating from the period,august to december,obtained from barrett medical treatment facility,the birmingham veterans affairs medical center.among these records are an august,medical progress note and other documentation stating that barrett failed to report for medical appointments on december and.with respect to these records,the secretary states that the dva provided the veterans court with copies of dva medical records reflecting the diagnosis and consequences of barrett psychiatric disability.gov t br.at.before the veterans court,barrett counsel stated,and the government does not contest,that these records were previously unknown to him.it is unclear from the record before us if the government sought all records relevant to the issue of mental incapacity bearing on equitable tolling.it is also unclear if it provided the veterans court with all relevant records that it obtained,or selectively submitted only portions.

discussion 
our review is limited to questions of law,see d,and it is de novo,see a see also bailey west,en banc citations omitted.this case presents a narrow question of law what duty does the dva have in developing the record before the veterans court on the issue of equitable tolling 
to begin,we recognize that barrett bears the ultimate burden of establishing the veterans court jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.see mcnutt motors acceptance.butler principi.however,this does not mean that the dva has no duty to assist the court in determining its jurisdiction.indeed,our holding in barrett ii acknowledged as much furthermore,the dva,which employs a host of medical professionals,is uniquely qualified to facilitate the diagnosis of troubled claimants should such allegations arise.at.in fact,when the veterans court determines that it needs additional information to decide jurisdictional issues,its general practice is to require the government as well as the veteran to provide the relevant records in its possession and,where necessary,to develop new facts that go exclusively to the jurisdictional question.
for example,in this case,the veterans court ordered the government to submit supplemental briefing on the equitable tolling issue and to attach any additional relevant evidence.remand order at.vet.claims lexis,at.the government complied,at least in part,by seeking out,obtaining,and submitting the medical records and other documents discussed above.similarly,in claiborne nicholson,where equitable tolling based on ill health was at issue,the court ordered supplemental briefing from the government and required it to attach any additional relevant evidence.
in sthele principi,the issue was equitable tolling based on the secretary alleged failure to mail a copy of the board final decision to the veteran.while recognizing that a presumption of regularity applied to the government mailings and that the veteran bore the ultimate burden of establishing jurisdiction,id.at,the veterans court required the government to develop jurisdictional facts.indeed,it ordered the chairman of the board of veterans appeals to submit a declaration detailing the board current practices regarding and mailing of board decisions and those practices employed at the time the appellant copy of the board final decision was and mailed.id.at.the government complied by submitting a declaration from the senior deputy vice chairman of the board.id.at.after hearing argument on the equitable tolling issue,the veterans court decided that it required more evidence,and ordered a further filing from the government.id.in that filing,the government submitted at least four additional declarations pertaining to the dva and mailroom procedures.id.at.the secretary declarations and filings ultimately assisted the veteran in rebutting the presumption of regularity.see id.at discussing the jurisdictional evidence,including the government declarations,and noting that,t he evidence before the court in this case is somewhat perplexing and reflects multiple irregularities in va handling of the appellant case that,coupled with the appellant assertion of nonreceipt,constitute the clear evidence that is necessary to rebut the assumed presumption of regularity.on the ultimate issue,the veterans cour
