introduction 
robert manning manning or plaintiff appeals from a judgment of the district court for the southern district of new york casey,dated august,denying plaintiff motion for reconsideration of the court september,memorandum and order dismissing the plaintiff fraud claim and granting defendant motion for reconsideration,dismissing plaintiff claim under the medicare secondary payer act msp.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the decision to dismiss plaintiff fraud claim,but reverse the decision to dismiss plaintiff claim under the msp.we hold that the statute of limitations applicable to private rights of action under the false claims act should be applied to private rights of action under the msp,and therefore plaintiff msp claim is not time barred.we further hold that plaintiff should be permitted an opportunity to amend his complaint to allege more sufficiently a claim for bad faith refusal to pay insurance benefits.therefore,we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.facts procedural 
on february,manning,a father of two,was rendered a quadriplegic when he fell from a utility pole in upstate new york while working for defendant niagara mohawk power nmp.nmp used as its workers compensation carrier the utilities mutual insurance umi collectively defendants.from until,umi paid plaintiff workers compensation benefits,which included a weekly stipend and plaintiff medical expenses and the costs of nursing care.in,plaintiff obtained a judgment against new york telephone company,from whose utility pole he had fallen,and recovered a net sum of approximately.as allowed by new york state workers compensation law wcl,umi both received a lien for the workers compensation benefits already provided and stopped paying benefits while plaintiff expenses were covered by the recovery from new york telephone company.
in,having exhausted his recovery from new york telephone company,plaintiff requested that defendants resume his benefits under the wcl.defendants refused,asserting that plaintiff had not established that his recovery had been exhausted.when plaintiff became financially unable to pay for his medical costs,medicare,a health insurance program sponsored mainly by the federal government,began to cover some of his medical expenses.according to plaintiff amended complaint,the defendants knew that his tort recovery had been depleted,and the failure to resume his benefits for the next years was in bad faith and designed to perpetrate a fraud against plaintiff and the medicare system.
in order to obtain resumption of his workers compensation benefits,plaintiff initiated litigation in before the new york state workers compensation board wcb.despite being ordered several times by the wcb to resume paying benefits to the plaintiff,defendants continued to litigate the case,appealing to the new york state appellate courts on three occasions.see manning niagara mohawk power,dep t manning niagara mohawk power,dep t manning niagara mohawk power,dep t.defendants lost each appeal,yet continued to deny plaintiff benefits.the new york attorney general office became involved in the case in,writing several letters to the defendants which informed them of their legal duty to resume paying plaintiff benefits.
in july,just two months after manning case was profiled in the new york times as the longest running dispute before the wcb,the parties settled the dispute by stipulation,with million being paid to the plaintiff.under the stipulation,plaintiff released all claims within the exclusive jurisdiction of the wcb.however,plaintiff expressly reserved the right to litigate claims pursuant to federal or state law that were not within the wcb exclusive jurisdiction.
on july,plaintiff filed the complaint giving rise to this appeal in the southern district of new york,and soon thereafter filed an amended complaint.count one of the amended complaint seeks damages of two times,the cost of plaintiff medical care since,which plaintiff alleges should have been paid by defendants but instead was paid by medicare.plaintiff asserts that he is entitled to these damages pursuant to the msp,b.count two of plaintiff amended complaint demands compensatory and punitive damages of at least million for defendants bad faith failure to pay for his medical expenses in a timely manner.the amended complaint alleges that defendants fraudulent refusal to pay for his medical costs caused him physical harm,emotional distress,and resulted in his receiving inferior health care.soon after the amended complaint was filed,defendants each separately submitted motions to dismiss and for summary judgment.with regard to plaintiff msp claim,defendants asserted it was time barred.
ruling on defendants motions,the district court dismissed plaintiff fraud claim for failure to plead reliance on a material misrepresentation by defendants.however,the court denied defendants motion to dismiss plaintiff msp claim,finding that the claim was timely under the applicable statute of limitations.see manning utilities mut.ins,civ.rcc,wl,manning i.both parties moved for reconsideration,and the district court ruled for the defendants on both issues,affirming the dismissal of the fraud claim and dismissing plaintiff msp claim as.see manning utilities mut.ins,civ.rcc,wl,manning ii.
iii.standard of review 
as noted,defendants submitted motions seeking dismissal of the amended complaint under both rule b and rule of the federal rules of civil procedure.as we discuss below in section iv b of this opinion,we view the district court decision as one dismissing plaintiff fraud claim under rule b.we review de novo decisions on both motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment.see tarshis riese,cir motion to dismiss howley town of stratford,cir motion for summary judgment.
iv.discussion 
a.the district court decision to dismiss plaintiff msp claim on grounds is reversed.
on motion for reconsideration,the district court dismissed plaintiff claim under the msp.before proceeding with our review of that decision,a short background of the msp is warranted.the msp designates certain insurers,such as employers and the employers workers compensation carriers,as primary payers for medical services,and relegates medicare to the role of secondary payer.see b a.thus,medicare will not pay for expenses that should be covered by the primary payers if medicare pays,it will be subject to a right of recoupment from the primary payer.see id.b b.to encourage compliance with these requirements,congress has authorized a private cause of action and double damages against entities designated as primary payers that fail to pay for medical costs for which they were responsible,which are borne in fact by medicare.see id.b a the statute also provides for a cause of action for the government to recover the money paid by medicare alternatively,the government is subrogated to the right of the private citizen for the recovery of such funds.see id.b b ii iii 
plaintiff amended complaint seeks damages of two times in medical costs he alleges should have been assumed by defendants but instead was paid by medicare.as noted,the district court dismissed this claim on grounds.see manning ii,wl,at.federal courts must establish the appropriate statute of limitations for private actions brought under the msp,as congress has not specified which limitations period applies.see united paperworkers int l union specialty paperboard,cir federal law determines which limitations period to apply when federal statute does not provide for one.other than this case,only one federal court has wrestled with identifying the limitations period for private actions brought under the msp.see brooks blue cross blue shield of,wl,at,aff on other grounds,cir.
both the southern district of florida in brooks and the district court in this case decided that the proper limitations period for msp actions is established by borrowing the respective state limitations period most closely analogous to the msp statute.see brooks,wl,at manning i,wl,at manning ii,wl,at citing reed united transp.union,d.neither district court devoted much analysis to this issue or the possibility that an exception to the rule of borrowing a state limitations period would apply to the msp plaintiff asserts that because there exists a more analogous federal statute,the federal false claims act,the limitations period from that analogous federal statute should apply to private actions brought under the msp.ultimately,although it is a close question,we agree with plaintiff.
legal background for identifying the appropriate limitations period.
a process exists for federal courts to establish limitations periods for causes of action created by federal statute which do not specify such.in reed,the supreme court stated that when congress does not supply a statute of limitations to a federally created statutory cause of action 
we have generally concluded that congress intended that the courts apply the most closely analogous statute of limitations under state law.
state legislatures do not devise their limitations periods with national interests in mind,however,and it is the duty of the federal courts to assure that the importation of state law will not frustrate or interfere with the implementation of national policies.thus,on the assumption that congress would not choose to adopt state limitations rules at odds with the purpose or operation of federal substantive law,we have recognized a closely circumscribed exception to the general rule that statutes of limitation are to be borrowed from state law.we decline to borrow a state statute of limitations only when a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes,and when the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.this is a narrow exception to the general rule.

this court reviewed the law in phelan local,cir,cert.denied,d 
where,as here,the federal statute under which a plaintiff brings an action does not provide a specific limitations period,federal courts must determine the appropriate limitations period according to federal law.citation omitted.this normally entails borrowing the most closely analogous state statute of limitations.see,delcostello ibt,d.however,as has become increasingly apparent in the last several years,see lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d borrowing federal securities limitation to create uniformity agency holding associates,d borrowing antitrust limitation in rico case delcostello,at.borrowing federal limitation in labor case,state limitations periods do not necessarily complement federal statutes and borrowing them sometimes proves unwise.communications workers of america western electric,cir t he glance in the direction of the cupboard should not be an automatic or reflexive one.
id.parallel citations omitted.
thus,in sum,according to reed,phelan and subsequent cases,the test is as follows we borrow federal rather than state limitations periods where a federal rule of limitations clearly provides a closer analogy than state alternatives,and the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of the litigation render the federal limitation a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.phelan,at internal quotation marks omitted accord united paperworkers int l union,at.and although the exception is a narrow one,this court has noted that there are a number of cases in which the supreme court has have found the exception applicable see phelan,at.
similarities between private actions brought under the msp and the false claims act.
today,we find that the strict requirements of the exception are met,and hold that the statute of limitations applicable to private rights of action under the false claims act fca,see b,should be applied to private rights of action under the msp.the fca authorizes suits by both the government and private citizens to recover monies erroneously paid to those who defraud the government by submitting or collecting falsified claims.the fca is similar to the msp in that both statutes allow individual citizens,as well as the government,to sue in order to right an economic wrong done to the government.compare id.a b,with b a.both the fca and msp allow for a multiplier of damages to enable the government to recover its funds while also providing a financial incentive for private citizens to bring such suits.compare a,with b b ii.both statutes thus create private attorneys general by authorizing private citizens to receive part of the recovery.compare d,with b a.the supreme court has found significant the fact that two federal statutes create private attorneys general when determining whether to apply the limitations period from one statute to the other.see agency holding assocs,d declining to borrow state limitations period and instead borrowing the federal antitrust limitations period for civil rico suits,based in part on fact that both federal statutes created private attorneys general.
in sum,there are important similarities between the fca and msp statutes and the private rights of action created therein.the similarity of the actions brought under these two statutes is further suggested by the fact that courts have recognized fca claims against insurers based on violations of the msp.see cooper blue cross blue shield of,cir united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,provident life accident ins.this suggests that the two statutes seek to provide a remedy for similar injuries.
on the other hand,we note procedural differences between actions brought under the msp and those brought under the fca.the msp creates a private right of action for individuals whose medical bills are improperly denied by insurers and instead paid by medicare,and the government is subrogated to the right of the private citizen for the recovery of such funds.see b a b b iii.under the fca,a private citizen can sue to recover on a claim falsely submitted and paid by the united states,but such action is a relator action brought in the name of the government.see b.unlike in msp actions,the government must be allowed to participate in fca actions filed by private individuals,and,if the government so desires,to take over the prosecution of such actions.see id.b.furthermore,the government can have private fca suits dismissed even over the objection of the citizen who filed the action,as long as notice and an opportunity for a hearing are provided to the individual citizen.see id.c a.
despite these procedural differences,the fca clearly provides a closer analogy than new york state alternatives,and the first part of the reed phelan test is therefore satisfied.phelan,at.we have not found,and the parties have not pointed us to,any new york or california cause of action which more closely resembles private actions under the msp see ceres partners gel,cir borrowing a federal statute of limitations may be warranted where the federal claim does not match any claims.we therefore move to consider the second step of the test,inquiring whether the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of the litigation render the federal limitation a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.phelan,at internal quotation marks omitted.
difficulties in applying a state statute of limitations.
in considering this somewhat cryptic test,courts have looked at several factors,including whether the cause of action encompasses a wide range of situations and injuries,and whether many of the resulting lawsuits will involve the laws of multiple states.the presence of either or both these factors has been found to indicate that a uniform federal limitations period is desirable in that it significantly furthers the interests of predictability and reducing judicial and litigation costs.see lampf,pleva,lipkind,prupis petigrow gilbertson,d plurality opinion where federal cause of action encompasses many topics,such that a single statute of limitations can not be applied within one jurisdiction without difficulty,one standard limitations period to be applied nationally is desirable agency holding,at.because civil rico actions often involve interstate disputes,a federal statute of limitations is appropriate ceres partners,at finding that federal limitations period should apply to certain private rights of action judicially implied from securities laws,noting that selection of a uniform federal limitations period may be warranted where the statutory claim in question covers a multiplicity of types of actions,leading to the possible application of a number of different types of state statutes of limitations,or where the challenged action is multistate in nature,perhaps leading to forum shopping and inordinate litigation expense but see united paperworkers,at unlike suits brought under or the civil rico provisions,the worker adjustment and retraining notification act,et,gives rise to only one kind of action,thus neither predictability nor judicial economy would suffer from borrowing a state limitations period.
the private cause of action created by the msp raises some of the same concerns that have previously led the supreme court and this court to borrow federal limitations periods.although msp actions may not often encompass many topics and subtopics,interstate litigation is certainly likely between plaintiffs in one state and the corporate headquarters of insurance companies in another.as in this case,such interstate litigation will often involve state borrowing statutes.to discourage forum shopping by plaintiffs looking for the longest limitations periods,borrowing statutes generally provide that,when an action is brought by a of the state on a cause of action that accrues outside the state,the forum state will apply either the limitations period of the state in which the action accrued or that of the forum state,whichever is shorter.see.see also,jack weinstein,harold korn,arthur miller,new york civil practice describing purposes and workings of new york borrowing statute oscar chase,weinstein,korn miller cplr manual ed.at same.when borrowing statutes apply,they generally result in short limitations periods because the shorter of the two possible periods will apply.
given that the msp statute creates a private right of action to help the government recover monies erroneously paid by medicare,there is a federal interest in having a longer statute of limitations apply to msp actions we glean this intent from the text of the statute,which explicitly seeks to recover funds paid by medicare,see b,and find some support in the legislative history.
the history of the msp legislation is consistent with our view that the private right of action was created to save money for the medicare system.the omnibus reconciliation act of first created the msp.see,stat.that act established that medicare was only secondarily responsible for the medical expenses of those covered by medicare who were also covered by certain other forms of insurance.see id.the intent of congress in shifting the burden of primary coverage from medicare to certain private insurance carriers was to place the burden where it could best be absorbed,especially considering that these insurers had already assumed such received the contracts with the insured.m edicare has served to relieve private insurers of obligations to pay the costs of medical care in cases where there would otherwise be liability under the private insurance contract,reprinted in.the msp,as amended by the deficit reduction act of,provided the government with an explicit statutory right of recovery for medicare overpayments against those designated as primary payers.see,a,stat.see generally provident life accident ins.united states,reviewing the history of the msp enactments and amendments through.the msp was again amended in to add a private right of action to recover funds paid by medicare when other insurance plans were legally required to pay as primary payers.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.
notably,the fca was also amended in to allow for increased citizen participation,including more citizen lawsuits,to assist the government in exposing fraud and recovering erroneously issued payments.see,stat.as a senate report noted,the overall intent in amending the qui tam section of the false claims act is to encourage more private enforcement suits.reprinted in,see also united states ex rel.williams nec,cir reviewing amendments and finding that they were intended to increase private citizen involvement in exposing fraud against the government united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,prudential ins,cir same.the fact that the fca and msp were both amended in to allow for increased citizen participation in helping the government recover funds erroneously paid is a further argument for applying the fca limitations period to private actions brought under the msp.
additionally,it does not strike us as correct that the government interest in recovery of wrongly paid medicare funds should be dependent on an insured state of residence or an insurance company headquarters.the federal interest in recovering monies erroneously paid by medicare is better served by uniformly adopting the limitations period applicable to private claims brought pursuant to the fca.see b.we also note that such a holding will bring into conformity the limitations period applicable to private rights of action with the limitations period which has been held applicable to government actions under the msp.see provident life accident ins.at general statute of limitations applicable to actions by the government,set forth in a,applies to msp actions brought by the government,accord united states blue cross blue shield of.
moreover,a holding that the appropriate statute of limitations is to be governed by looking to state law would likely lead to complex litigations over which state limitations period to apply.see chase,supra at describing thorny questions involving application of new york borrowing statute.as in this case,a msp claimant may move between states during the limitations period,raising difficult questions.assuming for the moment that a federal limitations period is inapplicable,this case presents an extremely complicated puzzle to determine which state limitations period applies.we would be forced to ascertain who the truly injured party is choosing between plaintiff and medicare,where the cause of action accrued,whether to apply the new york borrowing statute,and which state limitations period applies.all of these are difficult questions involving both state and federal law.indeed,on defendants motion for reconsideration,the district court reversed its prior decision and held that new york borrowing statute should apply.see manning ii,wl,at this case is an excellent example of why a uniform federal statute of limitations for all msp actions would be preferable in terms of predictability and reducing judicial and litigation costs.
in conclusion,for the reasons described in the foregoing analysis,we find that the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of the litigation render the federal limitation a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking.phelan,at internal quotation marks omitted.we therefore hold that the two steps of the test are met and that this case fits within the closely circumscribed exception of reed and its progeny.the statute of limitations applicable to fca claims applies to private actions brought under the msp.because plaintiff complaint,filed in july,seeks damages associated with defendants refusal to pay for medical expenses incurred after,his msp claim is timely and must be allowed to proceed.
b.the district court decision to dismiss plaintiff claim of fraud is affirmed.
count two of plaintiff amended complaint demands compensatory and punitive damages of at least million for defendants bad faith refusal to pay for his medical expenses and other workers compensation benefits in a timely manner.the amended complaint alleges that defendants fraudulent refusal to pay for his health costs caused him physical harm,emotional distress,and that he suffered inferior health care.the district court first decision dismissed count two and the dismissal was affirmed on motion for reconsideration.see manning i,wl,at manning ii,wl at.we affirm the district court decision to dismiss plaintiff fraud claim.however,we also find that the plaintiff should be allowed an opportunity to amend his complaint to allege more sufficiently a claim against defendants for their bad faith refusal to pay him insurance benefits.before explaining these holdings,we must first ascertain the point at which the plaintiff fraud claim was dismissed.
the fraud claim was dismissed on a motion to dismiss.
there is some confusion over whether the district court dismissed the claim on umi summary judgment motion or motion to dismiss.plaintiff amended complaint was served on october.on october,umi moved for an order under.rules b,b and,dismissing count ii of plaintiff amended complaint.within days of umi motion,nmp submitted a motion seeking dismissal of count i of plaintiff amended complaint under the same federal rules.the defendants specifically adopted each other motions.discovery between the parties then continued for some time.on september,the district court submitted its first decision.see manning i,wl.
manning i begins by stating before the court are defendants motions for summary judgment.id.at.this statement,in addition to the fact that a certain amount of discovery had already proceeded between the parties,would normally mean that this court would review the district court decision under summary judgment principles.however,the language of the district court decision suggests that the court dismissed plaintiff fraud claim under a motion to dismiss,not a motion for summary judgment.first,the court stated that it would avoid tackling the factual disputes presented by the parties 
to establish whether defendants conduct reached the level set forth in walker shledon,and rocanova equitable life assur.soc,would require much factual determination.however,the court need not reach a conclusion on this before determining whether plaintiff has sufficiently set forth an independent actionable tort claim against defendants,the first requirement of the rocanova analysis.
manning i,wl,at emphasis added.
the district court then proceeded to examine and find inadequate the face of the pleadings.
the court decided 
to satisfy.rule b,plaintiff pleadings must contain sufficient detail to give defendants notice of the transactions intended to be proven and the elements of the claims.plaintiff failed to plead reliance on the misrepresentation of a material fact by defendants reliance and knowing misrepresentation are both essential elements of fraud.
id.emphasis added internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
the district court clear focus on the pleadings and not the evidence submitted,persuades us to review the dismissal of the plaintiff fraud claim under a motion to dismiss standard.
plaintiff failed to state a fraud claim under new york law.
taking as true all of the allegations contained in plaintiff complaint and drawing all inferences in his favor,we nevertheless hold that plaintiff fraud claim was properly dismissed.in order to properly explain our holding,we must provide some background into relevant new york law.
new york courts have created a regime in which an insured claims against a insurer are generally considered under a contract theory,and the damages available are limited to those awarded under contract.see generally new york continental ins,rocanova,at.in this case,the plaintiff can not recover contractual damages from defendants because such claims are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the wcb and were settled by stipulation between the parties.
however,new york courts have identified a limited number of instances where an insured can recover damages in excess of contract damages,that is,tort damages,from his or her insurer.under rocanova,the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages in such cases requires a analysis.first,the defendant conduct must be actionable as an independent tort for which compensatory damages are ordinarily available.rocanova,at.second,in order to state a claim for punitive damages,a claimant must allege conduct which is aimed at the public generally,involves a fraud evincing a high degree of moral turpitude and demonstrates such wanton dishonesty as to imply a criminal indifference to civil obligations.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted see also new york,at,summarizing rocanova test 
the district court identified the rocanova test and properly focused on whether count two of plaintiff amended complaint set forth an actionable tort outside the contract.see manning i,wl,at.we begin with the same question.
tort damages are available in new york where,inter alia,a n insurer engages in conduct outside the contract but intended to defeat the contract.new york,at,accord logan empire blue cross blue shield,dep t see also recovery credit,cir under new york law,a fraud claim associated with a breach of contract can be sustained and tort damages can be recovered where plaintiff can demonstrate a fraudulent misrepresentation collateral or extraneous to the contract.
based on these cases,plaintiff fraud claim can proceed if it sufficiently alleges that defendants engaged in fraud collateral or outside the contract,which was intended to defeat the contract.see new york,at,at.under new york law,the essential elements of a fraud claim include representation of a material existing fact,falsity,scienter,deception,and injury.new york,at,internal quotation marks omitted see,at to prove fraud under new york law,plaintiff must show the defendant made a material false representation,the defendant intended to defraud the plaintiff thereby,the plaintiff reasonably relied upon the representation,and the plaintiff suffered damage as a result of such reliance internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court dismissed plaintiff claim because it found that his complaint failed to allege reliance on the misrepresentation of a material fact.manning i,wl,at.we agree.reviewing the amended complaint in the instant case,we discern two possible allegations of misrepresentations by the defendants.the first is that,beginning in,the defendants agreed to resume payment for plaintiff medical care but failed to do so.see joint appendix at.such a misrepresentation,which is merely a statement of intent to perform under the contract,can not constitute fraud in new york see,at statements of intent to perform under the contract are not sufficient to sustain a fraud claim in new york.
plaintiff amended complaint can also be read to allege a second misrepresentation.beginning in,one of nmp employees repeatedly told plaintiff that,before plaintiff benefits could be resumed,defendants would require an accounting to ensure that plaintiff had exhausted the funds he received in settlement of his negligence suit.see joint appendix at.the complaint states that plaintiff provided defendants with all the information necessary to conduct such an accounting,but defendants continued to use this accounting excuse for years to deny plaintiff workers compensation benefits.id.
we now analyze such an allegation under the test for a fraud claim set forth in,at.we assume without deciding that the amended complaint sufficiently alleges that defendants made a material representation which was intended to defraud the plaintiff.even so,fatal to the fraud claim is plaintiff failure to allege reasonable reliance on such misrepresentations and that he suffered damages as a result.nowhere in plaintiff complaint does he allege that he reasonably and detrimentally relied on this accounting excuse employed by the defendants.while plaintiff briefs to this court argue that he detrimentally relied on this representation in that he both provided financial information to defendants and that he had his own accountant compile an accounting,such allegations were not made in the complaint as is required.even if we were to consider the factual allegations presented in plaintiff briefs,we would find that,as a matter of law,plaintiff reliance on the accounting excuse for so many years was not reasonable.in order to survive the statute of limitations applied to his fra
