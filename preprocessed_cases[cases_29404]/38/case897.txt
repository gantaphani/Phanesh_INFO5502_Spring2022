mary bray bray appeals the district court judgment affirming the commissioner of social security commissioner final decision denying her application for social security disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under titles ii and xvi of the social security act.bray contends that the administrative law judge alj failed to make findings concerning whether she possesses transferable skills as social security ruling ssr expressly requires.bray also argues that the alj erred in discounting her testimony,disregarding a treating physician medical opinion,and failing to account for her mental impairments in determining her residual functional capacity.lastly,bray contends that the alj applied the governing medical vocational guidelines mechanically in a borderline situation in violation of b,by including her in the age category even though she was less than a month from turning at the time of the alj decision.
we have jurisdiction under,and we hold that the alj erred by failing to make findings on the issue of whether bray possessed transferable skills.we thus reverse and remand.
background 
on march,bray filed an application for disability insurance benefits alleging that she had been disabled since november.after her claim was denied initially and on reconsideration,bray requested a hearing before an alj.on november,bray protectively filed for supplemental social security income payments,and that application was consolidated with her prior claim and expedited to the hearing level.
on march,the date of her hearing,bray was years old and approximately a month from turning.she has a high school education and one year vocational training as a medical assistant.she suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,asthma,hypertension,anxiety,depression,and arthritis.most recently,before filing her application,bray worked for an ill friend as a caregiver before that she briefly worked at a call center handling customer service inquiries,but was terminated after three weeks on the job when she requested workplace accommodations related to her difficulty breathing.subsequently,she enrolled in a custodial training program,but dropped out of the program after three weeks due to difficulty keeping pace and tolerating exposure to chemical fumes.bray worked as a grocery clerk from august to january,as a medical assistant from to,and as an insurance underwriter from to.she has been unable to hold a job for more than six months since losing her medical assistant position in thus,the alj determined that she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the onset date of her alleged disability 
at her hearing,bray testified that she can not walk more than half a block without stopping to catch her breath or making use of an inhaler or nebulizer.she also offered a written prescription from a treating physician,issued on may,limiting her to four hours of work per day,five days a week.the physician wrote the prescription after bray visited the emergency room reporting a flare up of her copd.a physician with the oregon disability determination service dds evaluated bray physical condition and concluded that she was capable of standing or walking for six hours out of an work day and sitting six hours out of an work day.
the alj found bray testimony regarding her symptoms to be not entirely credible due to inconsistencies with record evidence of her daily activities,treatment history,and objective medical condition.the alj also discounted the prescription limiting bray to four hours of work per day,concluding that the limitation was inconsistent with evidence in bray medical record.relying in large part on the dds physician assessment,the alj constructed bray residual functional capacity rfc,her ability to work after accounting for her verifiable impairments.the alj also determined that bray employment history had provided her with previous skilled work experience.a vocational expert ve testified that a person with bray rfc,age,education,and work experience could find work as a general clerk,file clerk,or sales clerk all semiskilled jobs,and that such jobs were available in significant numbers in both the national and regional economies relying on the ve opinion,the alj determined that bray was capable of performing a modified range of light work and found her not disabled.
the social security administration ssa appeals council denied bray petition for review,making the alj order the final agency order.bray then commenced this action in the district court,which affirmed the alj order.bray timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review a district court judgment upholding the denial of social security benefits de novo.tackett apfel,cir.we may set aside a denial of benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error.robbins soc.sec,cir.substantial evidence means more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.andrews shalala,cir.where the evidence as a whole can support either a grant or a denial,we may not substitute our judgment for the alj.massachi astrue,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
discussion 
aljs are to apply a sequential review process in determining whether a claimant qualifies as disabled bowen yuckert,d.the burden of proof is on the claimant at steps one through four,but shifts to the commissioner at step five.see tackett,at.if the alj determines that a claimant is either disabled or not disabled at any step in the process,the alj does not continue on to the next step.see a.
the first step is not at issue.both bray and the commissioner agree that bray is not currently performing substantial gainful work.see a i.at steps two and three,the alj found that bray copd and her depression and anxiety were severe impairments,but that neither corresponded to the listed impairments in the regulations.see d.bray does not challenge this finding.
between steps three and four,the alj must,as an intermediate step,assess the claimant rfc.see e.bray contests the alj construction of her rfc.at step four the alj must determine whether,in light of the claimant rfc,she can return to substantial gainful activity performed in the past.e.the alj determined that bray was not capable of returning to her past relevant work as a medical assistant or insurance underwriter,and neither party disputes that finding.at step five,the commissioner must establish that the claimant is capable of performing substantial gainful work 
the alj stated bray rfc in this way 
the claimant has the rfc to lift pounds occasionally and pounds frequently.she can stand and walk hours out of an day and sit hours out of an day.she can occasionally climb.she should avoid concentrated exposure to respiratory irritants.she is able to carry out,attend and concentrate on all but the most detailed and complex tasks.
the alj presented the above statement to the ve,who then considered whether an individual burdened with the stated limitations could obtain gainful work in the national economy.the ve testified that bray could not return to gainful work in her former capacity as a medical assistant or underwriter,but that she had transferable skills and could transition to work as a general clerk,file clerk,or sales clerk.accordingly,the alj determined that bray is not disabled.
i.the alj failure to follow ssr 
relying on ssr,bray contends that the alj committed reversible error when he assumed that bray possessed transferable skills without making specific findings in support of that assumption.ssr states,in relevant part 
when the issue of skills and their transferability must be decided,the alj is required to make certain findings of fact and include them in the written decision.findings should be supported with appropriate documentation.
when a finding is made that a claimant has transferable skills,the acquired work skills must be identified,and specific occupations to which the acquired work skills are transferable must be cited in the alj decision it is important that these findings be made at all levels of adjudication to clearly establish the basis for the determination or decision for the claimant and for a reviewing body including a federal district court.
ssr,wl,at.the alj found that bray has previous skilled work experience,but made no finding as to the transferability of any acquired skills.the decision does not identify the particular skills that bray possesses,nor does it explain the basis for the determination that she possesses skilled work experience.
at bray hearing,the ve testified that bray experience as an insurance fifteen years prior to the hearing exposed her to computers customer service,and possibly some data entry,and that her work as a medical assistant may also have exposed her to similar skills.it is impossible to discern whether the ve brief commentary represents the sole basis for the alj assumption that bray had transferable skills.the decision is similarly silent on the issue of whether the particular skills that the ve identified would be transferable in bray case given her age and medical impairments.see ssr,at a person has no special advantage if he or she is skilled or semiskilled but can qualify only for an unskilled job because his skills can not be used to any significant degree in other jobs.
moreover,the guidelines state that i n order to find transferability of skills to skilled sedentary work for individuals who are of advanced age and over,there must be very little,if any,vocational adjustment required in terms of tools,work processes,work settings,or the industry.pt,subpt.p,app.f.the skills that the ve cited at the hearing derived from bray work as an insurance underwriter more than fifteen years earlier.neither the alj decision nor the ve testimony addresses whether was one month from turning at the time of her have to undergo more than minimal vocational adjustment to perform successfully the tasks required of a file clerk,general clerk,or sales clerk,or otherwise determined whether the skills required of an insurance underwriter are substantially similar to those required of a general,file,or sales clerk.
ssrs,according to the governing regulations,are binding on all components of the social security administration and represent precedent final opinions and orders and statements of policy and interpretations of the ssa b see also heckler edwards,d noting the function of ssrs.ssrs reflect the official interpretation of the ssa and are entitled to some deference as long as they are consistent with the social security act and regulations.avenetti barnhart,cir quoting ukolov barnhart,cir.ssrs do not carry the force of law,but they are binding on aljs nonetheless.see quang van han bowen,cir.
the commissioner concedes that the alj did not follow the express requirements of ssr,but argues that the ssr is not applicable in this case.citing a sixth circuit opinion for support,the commissioner argues that ssr does not require specific findings when the alj relies on the testimony of a ve to determine whether a claimant has transferable skills.see wilson comm r of soc,cir.in wilson,the commissioner argued that ssr requires specific findings only when the alj relies exclusively on the grids to reach a determination.see id.at.the court concluded that the commissioner reading of ssr was entitled to substantial deference and that the proffered interpretation was reasonable.id.at.
for the reasons set forth below,however,we believe the second circuit opinion in draegert barnhart,cir,offers a sounder approach.in draegert,the court held that specific findings on transferable skills are necessary even where the alj relies on the testimony of a ve.see id.at see also botefur heckler,concluding that specific findings under ssr are required when the alj relies on a ve testimony.
in auer robbins the supreme court held that an agency interpretation of its own regulations,even when the interpretation is adopted as a position in litigation,is entitled to substantial deference,d.the auer opinion implies that,in order to receive substantial deference,an agency interpretation must represent its fair and considered judgment,rather than a position that is merely convenient in a given dispute.see at.citing bowen georgetown,d bigelow dep t of,tatel,dissenting stating that no deference is due where there is reason to suspect that an agency interpretation of its own regulation represents a convenient litigation position rather than an expression of the agency fair and considered judgment.
even granting a large measure of interpretive deference,the commissioner reading of ssr strains credulity.the ssr does not qualify its application,stating only that w hen the issue of skills and their transferability must be decided,the alj is required to make certain findings of fact and include them in the written decision.findings should be supported with appropriate documentation.ssr,wl,at emphasis added see also christensen harris county,d holding that no deference is due under auer where the underlying regulation is unambiguous.further,the ssr states that c onsultation with a ve may be necessary to ascertain whether a given skill or set of skills are transferable in a claimant particular case.ssr,wl,at.thus,the ssr presumes that aljs will be relying on expert testimony to determine whether a claimant has transferable skills,and it makes little sense to interpret the ssr provision requiring specific written findings as inapplicable whenever an expert is involved.it is the alj,and not the ve,who is responsible for making findings.
according to the district court,the alj assumption that bray had transferable skills was sufficiently reviewable.adopting the sixth circuit logic,the district court explained that in the absence of supplementary testimony from a vocational expert,the alj would be obligated to specifically include a finding related to transferable skills but where the alj relies on an expert,the source of evidence regarding transferable skills is apparent and reviewable by the court.the district court then concluded that it was correct for the ve to assume that bray had some degree of computer skill.this is precisely the sort of finding,however,that ssr requires the alj,and not the court,to make.principles of administrative law require us to review the alj decision based on the reasoning and factual findings offered by the post hoc rationalizations that attempt to intuit what the adjudicator may have been thinking.see sec chenery.i n dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make,courts must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.snell apfel,cir the requirement of exists,in part,to let claimants understand the disposition of their cases.
the alj departure from established ssa procedure thwarts this court ability to determine whether or not bray possesses transferable dispositive issue for her claim.chiappa sec y of dep t of health,educ.welfare,the failure of aljs to make specific findings in disability cases is among the principal causes of the delay and uncertainty in this area of the law.the district court chose to review the transferable skills finding based on what it assumed the alj to have determined,but meaningful review of an administrative decision requires access to the facts and reasons supporting that decision.see chenery,at.ssr articulates this principle in a clear form.the alj erred in disregarding the regulation and the district court erred in disregarding the underlying principle.
we thus remand this case to the commissioner so that the alj can further develop the record and make specific findings on whether bray has transferable skills see terry sullivan,cir holding that this court has discretion to remand for further fact finding,if the record is unclear as to a claimant entitlement to disability benefits.
ii.the residual functional capacity determination 
the alj finding flowed from the presentation of a hypothetical rfc to a ve,who then identified specific jobs bray could perform.bray contests the representativeness of the alj hypothetical by challenging three predicate findings that bray testimony regarding the severity of her symptoms was not entirely credible that a treating physician prescription note was not entirely credible and that severe,medically determinable mental impairments notwithstanding,bray is able to carry out,attend and concentrate on all but the most detailed and complex tasks.we agree with the district court that substantial evidence supports the alj construction of bray rfc.
bray testimony 
the alj found that bray description of her symptoms was not entirely credible.specifically,the alj discounted bray statement that she is incapable of walking more than half a block without stopping to catch her breath and using a nebulizer or inhaler,that she is unable to lift twenty pounds,and that she can not carry as much as ten pounds very far.substantial evidence supports the alj decision to give limited weight to bray characterization of her symptoms.
if an alj finds a claimant characterization of his or her own symptoms unreliable,the alj must make a credibility determination backed up by specific findings.see bunnell sullivan,cir.o nce the claimant produces objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment,an adjudicator may not reject a claimant subjective complaints based solely on a lack of objective medical evidence to fully corroborate the claimant allegations.id.in reaching a credibility determination,an alj may weigh inconsistencies between the claimant testimony and his or her conduct,daily activities,and work record,among other factors.see light soc.sec,cir.
the alj made specific findings in support of his decision to discount bray testimony,noting that bray continued to smoke cigarettes up until one month before her hearing,despite complaining of debilitating shortness of breath and acute chemical sensitivity she leads an active lifestyle,including cleaning,cooking,walking her dogs,and driving to appointments she recently worked as a personal caregiver for two years,and has sought out other employment since then she reported to an evaluating physician that she only becomes wheezy when engaging in heavy exertion,and on other occasions reported that her copd was going fine and bray statements at her hearing do not comport with objective evidence in her medical record.the above findings are supported by the record,and belie bray claim of debilitating respiratory illness.
bray maintains that it was improper for the alj to cite her continued smoking as adversely impacting her credibility.see shramek apfel,cir noting,in dicta,that nicotine addictive properties made it extremely tenuous to discredit a claimant description of her impairments based on the claimant continued smoking.the alj reasoned that if bray respiratory ailments were as severe as she claimed,she would likely refrain from smoking.it is certainly possible that bray was so addicted to cigarettes that she continued smoking even in the face of debilitating shortness of breath and acute chemical sensitivity.even so,the alj presented four other independent bases for discounting bray testimony,and each finds ample support in the record.thus,the alj reliance on bray continued smoking,even if erroneous,amounts to harmless error.see batson comm r of soc.sec,cir concluding that,even if the record did not support one of the alj stated reasons for disbelieving a claimant testimony,the error was harmless.
the treating physician 
bray contends that the alj erred in elevating contrary evidence above the opinion of a treating physician.at her hearing,bray introduced a prescription written by seyer,limiting her daily work activity to four hours per day,five days a week.in contrast,the dds physician that evaluated bray physical impairments reported that bray was capable of occasionally lifting twenty pounds,frequently lifting ten pounds,standing or walking for six hours out of an work day,and sitting six hours out of an work day.
the alj gave several reasons for granting seyer prescription note little weight the note was written at bray specific request bray medical records reveal that she only experiences severe shortness of breath after heavy exertion and not in conjunction with the usual activities of daily living seyer prescription was written after an exacerbation of her copd and bray did not seek medical treatment again for eight months after seyer wrote the prescription,suggesting a lack of need for a continued limitation of her work hours.
a treating physician opinion is entitled to substantial weight.embrey bowen,cir.when evidence in the record contradicts the opinion of a treating physician,the alj must present specific and legitimate reasons for discounting the treating physician opinion,supported by substantial evidence.lester chater,cir however,t he alj need not accept the opinion of any physician,including a treating physician,if that opinion is brief,conclusory,and inadequately supported by clinical findings.thomas barnhart,cir.
bray argues that the alj stated reasons are neither legitimate nor sufficient to justify discounting seyer prescription note.specifically,bray contends that the fact that seyer wrote the note at her request is not a legitimate reason for disbelieving it,because a treating physician would not prescribe medically unwarranted restrictions.as the district court noted,however,the treating physician prescribed work restrictions were based on bray subjective characterization of her symptoms.as the alj determined that bray description of her limitations was not entirely credible,it is reasonable to discount a physician prescription that was based on those less than credible statements.
consideration of bray mental impairments 
if an alj finds a severe impairment at step two,that impairment must be considered in the remaining steps of the sequential analysis.the alj found that bray possessed two severe and an adjustment disorder,symptoms of anxiety and depression.bray argues that the alj failed to account for her adjustment disorder in the final construction of her rfc,and thus ran afoul of the governing regulations.hypothetical questions posed to a ve must set out all the limitations and restrictions of the particular claimant russell sullivan,cir.if an alj hypothetical does not reflect all of the claimant limitations,then the expert testimony has no evidentiary value to support a finding that the claimant can perform jobs in the national economy.delorme sullivan,cir.
the alj adequately accounted for bray adjustment disorder in his construction of her rfc and in the hypothetical he presented to the ve.he asked the ve to assume that bray could carry out,attend sic and concentrate on all but the most detailed and complex tasks.bray argues that this statement contradicts the alj earlier finding at step two that bray mental impairments were severe.she posits that a severe impairment,by definition,inhibits a claimant from engaging in basic work activities,and the alj statement of her rfc does not capture that limitation.bray offers no authority to support the proposition that a severe mental impairment must correspond to limitations on a claimant ability to perform basic work activities.
more importantly,the medical record supports the alj conclusions that bray mental impairments prevented her from completing only the most complex tasks.in constructing bray rfc,the alj relied on the opinion of krishnan,a psychiatrist who evaluated bray in august of.krishnan concluded that 
the claimant can accept instructions from supervisors and interact with coworkers and the public.the claimant will be able to perform work activities on a consistent basis without special or additional supervision.the claimant would likely be able to maintain regular attendance in the workplace,as she is currently working.she is able to complete a normal without interruptions from her psychiatric condition.she also would be able to deal with the usual stress encountered in competitive work.
bray does not offer evidence to controvert krishnan assessment,and the alj conclusion that bray can carry out,attend and concentrate on all but the most detailed and complex tasks represents a reasonable finding,grounded in the administrative record.
conclusion 
the alj assumed that bray had transferable skills,but failed to articulate a clear basis to support that assumption,contrary to the requirement of ssr.as a result,this court can not properly determine whether substantial evidence supports the alj decision finding bray not disabled.the issue of transferability of skills is dispositive,as bray is now years old,and thus should be considered in the advanced age category.according to the grids,a with bray limitations who lacks transferable skills qualifies as disabled 
we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case with instructions that it further remand this case to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded.
i am in agreement with the holdings and reasoning in the ii the residual functional capacity determination of the opinion.likewise,i concur with the result reached in the i the alj failure to follow ssr,that the decision below should be reversed and remanded to the commissioner for further proceedings.however,i arrive at that conclusion by an entirely different approach.the problem here was not fundamentally due to a failure of the alj to make a specific finding regarding transferable skills but to the inconsistent and erroneous findings actually made by the alj in his written decision and adopted by the district court 
additional background 
at the march,hearing,the ve testimony was specifically based in part upon the dictionary of occupational titles dot the ve summarized bray relevant work history as follows 
her most recent job was telemarketing,sedentary exertion level.that is defined in the dot as an svp three in my opinion vocationally it goes between a two and a three depending on where you work in the telemarketing field.
and her date of employment was march of for i guess a duration of three weeks.caregiver,light exertional level,svp three,of to some period in.grocery clerk,meat department,medium exertional level,svp two,unskilled,of to of.medical assistant,light exertional level,svp six,skilled,of to of.underwriter,sedentary exertional level,svp seven,skilled,of through of.
in response to the alj hypothetical which included bray age at onset of disability,education,work experience,residual functional capacity,and ability to attend and concentrate on all but the most detailed and complex tasks,the ve indicated 
that individual could perform the care giving job or what they call companion.this individual would be able to perform telemarketing types of work.i do not believe this person with a limitation on the detail you mentioned could handle the underwriter or the medical assistant.and by the way,medical assistant,that many times is at the medium exertional level 
as to the underwriter and medical assistant jobs,the ve opined that 
there are skills transferable in relationship to office clerical responsibility.in our underwriting job even as a medical assistant,she was exposed to computers,filing,typing,customer service,possibly some data entry,those kinds of skills.emphasis added.
ultimately,the ve concluded that bray could work as a general clerk,file clerk or sales clerk,and there was available employment in those fields 
the alj found that bray has the residual functional capacity to perform a significant range of light work he noted that 
the vocational expert testified that given the claimant residual functional capacity,she is incapable of performing her past relevant work as a grocery clerk,medical assistant and insurance underwriter.she would be capable of performing her past work as a telemarketer and caregiver.however,these jobs were not performed at the substantial gainful activity level and thus are not considered past relevant work.the claimant is incapable of returning to her past relevant work.
the alj ultimately decided that 
based on the credible testimony of the vocational expert,the undersigned concludes that considering the claimant age,educational background,work experience and residual functional capacity,she is capable of making a successful adjustment to work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy.a finding of not disabled is therefore reached within the framework of rule.
ii.discussion 
applicable law 
the concept of transferability of skills is delineated in d as follows 
we the ssa consider you the claimant to have skills that can be used in other jobs,when the skilled or work activities you did in past work can be used to meet the requirements of skilled or work activities of other jobs or kinds of work.this depends largely on the similarity of occupationally significant work activities among different jobs.
transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in which 
i the same or a lesser degree of skill is required 
ii the same or similar tools and machines are used and 
iii the same or similar raw materials,products,processes,or services are involved.
there are degrees of transferability of skills ranging from very close similarities to remote and incidental similarities among jobs.a complete similarity of all three factors is not necessary for transferability.
if you are of advanced age age or older,and you have a severe impairment s that limits you to sedentary or light work,we will find that you can not make an adjustment to other work unless you have skills that you can transfer to other skilled or semiskilled work that you can do despite your impairment s.
ssr states that w hen the issue of skills and their transferability must be decided,the alj is required to make certain findings of fact and include them in the written decision.wl at see also jensen barnhart,cir.also,w hen a finding is made that a claimant has transferable skills,the acquired work skills must be identified,and specific occupations to which the acquired work skills are transferable must be cited in the alj decision.wl at.however,ssr additionally indicates that 
transferability of skills is an issue only when an individual impairment s,though severe,does not meet or equal the criteria in the listing of impairments in appendix of the regulations pt,subpt.p,app.but does prevent the performance of past relevant work prw,and that work has been determined to be skilled or semiskilled.prw is defined in regulations sections and.when the table rules in appendix pt,subpt.p,app.are applicable to a case,transferability will be decisive in the conclusion of disabled or not disabled in only a relatively few instances because,even if it is determined that there are no transferable skills,a finding of not disabled may be based on the ability to do unskilled work.
id.at.further,ssr recognizes that on occasion,in situations involving similar types of jobs,certain skills may be readily transferable.
where job skills have universal applicability across industry lines,clerical,professional,administrative,or managerial types of jobs,transferability of skills to industries differing from past work experience can usually be accomplished with very little,if any,vocational adjustment where jobs with similar skills can be identified as being within an individual rfc residual functional capacity.
ssr states that the ssa relies primarily on the dot including its companion publication the sco the revised dictionary of occupational titles for information about the requirements of work in the national economy.we use these publications at steps and of the sequential evaluation process.wl at.the occupational evidence provided by a ve should generally be consistent with the occupational information supplied by the dot.id.when there is a conflict between the ve evidence and the dot,it is a duty of the alj to inquire on the record as to the reason for the inconsistency before relying on the ve evidence.id.
the ve testimony that bray prior job as a grocery clerk,meat department had a physical exertion level of medium and an svp level of two,unskilled is contrary to both the dot classification and the only evidence on the topic in the administrative record.the dot lists the strength rating for the occupation of a sales clerk,food retail trade as l or light and an svp level of or.dictionary of occupational titles ed.the dot notes that the sales clerk,food retail trade job classification also covers grocery clerk retail trade and meat counter clerk retail trade.id.in the work history report which she filled out and submitted to the ssa in april of,bray described her grocery clerk job as requiring her to occasionally lift lbs,to frequently lift lbs and to stand walk up to hours.her description of that job places it within the light work category.see b.
because the ve testimony as to the requirements of the grocery clerk position was in conflict with the dot specifications,the alj had an affirmative responsibility to inquire as to the reasons and evidentiary basis for the ve deviation.see ssr,wl at tommasetti,at massachi,at.the alj did not make any such inquiry,which constitutes error.
the alj in his conclusion stated that given the claimant residual functional capacity,she is incapable of performing her past relevant work as a grocery clerk,medical assistant and insurance underwriter.first,it is noted that in the beginning of his decision,the alj wrote that 
after the date of alleged onset of disability,the claimant worked as a grocery clerk.the work was performed during a temporary period of remissions from symptoms and ended after less than months due to her impairments.this job is considered an unsuccessful work attempt.
it is questionable whether the grocery clerk job,if it had been correctly characterized as an unsuccessful work attempt,could later be considered part of bray past relevant work however,assuming arguendo that it can be,the alj bray residual functional capacity which the alj later found allowed her to do light work in the general,file or sales clerk occupations barred her from performing her past work as a grocery based upon the ve erroneous testimony that the grocery clerk job requires medium physical exertion requirements 
in addition,the alj bray was incapable of performing her past work as a grocery clerk and yet that she could perform work as a sales on its face inconsistent.the duties of a grocery clerk,food retail trade are described in the dictionary of occupational titles ed as follows 
obtains or prepares food items requested by customers in retail food store,totals customer bill,receives payment,and makes change fills customer order,performing duties such as obtaining items from shelves,freezers,coolers,bins,tables,or containers cleaning poultry scaling and trimming fish slicing meat or cheese,using slicing machine preparing sandwiches and salads dispensing beverages and warming food items in oven.weighs items,such as produce,meat,and poultry to determine price.lists and totals prices,using paper and pencil,calculator,or cash register.informs customer of total price of purchases.receives payment from customer for purchases and makes change.bags or wraps purchases for customer.cleans shelves,bins,tables,and coolers.stamps,marks,or tags price on merchandise.sets up displays and stocks shelves,coolers,counter,bins,tables,freezers,containers,or trays with new merchandise.may make deliveries to customer home or place of business may write orders,decorate cakes,or describe available specialty products,such as birthday cakes.may order merchandise from warehouse or supplier.may be designated according to type of food sold as grocery clerk retail trade meat counter clerk retail trade produce clerk retail trade i sales clerk,fish retail trade.
the duties of a sales clerk retail trade are substantially the same as those of a grocery clerk,food retail trade and are delineated in section as 
obtains or receives merchandise,totals bill,accepts payment,and makes change for customers in retail store such as tobacco shop,drug store,candy store,or liquor store stocks shelves,counters,or tables with merchandise.sets up advertising displays or arranges merchandise on counters or tables to promote sales.stamps,marks,or tags price on merchandise.obtains merchandise requested by customer or receives merchandise selected by customer.answers customer questions concerning location,price,and use of merchandise.totals price and tax on merchandise purchase by customer,using paper and pencil,cash register,or calculator,to determine bill.accepts payment and makes change.wraps or bags merchandise for customers.cleans shelves,counters,or tables.removes and records amount of cash in register at end of shift.may calculate sales discount to determine price.may keep record of sales,prepare inventory of stock,or order merchandise.may be designated according to produce sold or type of store.
a finding without any explanation or reasoning that bray could do the work required of a sales clerk but not the job of a grocery clerk is in error.
finally,as to the issue of transferability of skills,the alj placed bray in rule of the grids and found her to be not disabled.pt,subpt.p,app,table.rule covers claimants who are closely approaching advanced age,d age,who are at a minimum high school graduates,and who have had past skilled or jobs where their skills are transferable.under ssr,by placing bray in a of the grids which contains a requirement of transferable skills,the alj should have made a finding identifying the work skills involved and the occupations to which they applied.the alj did not do so here,which constitutes error.however,that omission was not significant at that time or the source of reversible error.even if one were to conclude that the alj failure to identify the transferable skills should be treated as if bray had no transferrable skills,bray would then fall within rule of the grids which would still place her in the not disabled category.see pt,subpt.p,app,table.consequently,the fundamental problem here was not the alj failure to identify the transferable skills but rather whether placement of bray into rule or for that matter into rules or was correct this issue concerns whether the alj properly considered the requirements of b and pt,subpt.p,app,c and d however,in light of footnote of the majority opinion,the alj placement of bray into rule becomes moot and the issue of transferability of skills is moved from the backburner to the front 
iii.conclusion 
for the reasons stated above,i concur that the decision of the district court should be reversed and the case remanded to the commissioner for further proceedings.
as the concurrence notes,the alj found that bray worked as a grocery clerk for less than six months and lost the job due to her impairments.concur.op.at.accordingly,the alj deemed bray stint as a grocery clerk an unsuccessful work attempt that did not amount to substantial gainful activity.as such,bray time as a grocery clerk can not be considered past relevant work.see b explaining that past relevant work must involve substantial gainful activity.
