factual and procedural background 
the medicaid act authorizes federal grants to states for medical assistance to certain low income persons.orthopaedic hospital belshe cir,orthopaedic.the program is funded by both the federal and state governments,and administered by the states.to receive matching federal funding,states must agree to comply with the applicable medicaid law.orthopaedic,supra,at.the state program in california is called.
within broad federal rules,the states determine the payment levels for services,and make payment for services directly to the individuals or entities furnishing the services.orthopaedic,supra,at.the medicaid act requires each participating state to adopt a state plan describing the policy and methods to be used to set payment rates.orthopaedic,supra,at b.federal regulations describe the state plan as a comprehensive written statement submitted by the agency describing the nature and scope of its medicaid program and giving assurance that it will be administered in conformity with the specific requirements of title xix,the regulations in this chapter iv,and other applicable official issuances of the department.the state plan contains all information necessary for cms centers for medicare medicaid services to determine whether the plan can be approved to serve as a basis for federal financial participation ffp in the state program.
under the medicaid act,each state plan must,provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.a a section.
department of health services dhs is the agency that administers california state plan.welf,tit.california state plan provides that the methodology for establishing payment rates is to develop an evidentiary base or rate study resulting in the determination of a proposed rate,to present the proposed rate at a public hearing to gather public input,to determine the payment rate based on both the evidentiary base and the public input,and to establish the payment rate through the adoption of regulations the regulations specify that the department shall administer the program in accordance with t he state plan under title xix of the social security act.tit,b.provider rates may also be adjusted when required by state statute,provided the requirements of federal law are met.
additionally,with regard to home health agency services,the services at issue in this litigation,the state plan contained the following language as of the date this action was filed 
the state agency shall perform an annual review of the reimbursement rates paid to providers of home health agency services.the purpose of such review is to ensure that the rates comply with federal regulation section a a,which requires payments to be 
consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and 
sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
despite this plan provision,dhs has not performed a review of the applicable reimbursement rates since.
dhs adjusted the reimbursement rates at issue,those for home health care providers,in,and.the increases for these years were six percent in,less than one percent in,and percent in.dhs attempted to reduce rates by five percent for,but the reduction was enjoined as a result of federal litigation.clayworth bonta d.the governor proposed a percent reduction in,but the legislature did not implement this proposal.
plaintiffs filed a complaint and petition for mandamus relief alleging violation of federal law and the california state plan.they sought a writ of mandate ordering dhs to reimburse plaintiffs members for the difference between the rates paid and the providers usual charges in the alternative,they sought to force dhs to review its reimbursement rates,determine whether the rates complied with federal and state law,and reimburse plaintiffs for any shortfall.plaintiffs also sought a writ of mandate ordering dhs to set current and future rates in compliance with state and federal law.
the trial court found dhs subject to a mandatory duty to perform an annual review of the reimbursement rates pursuant to the state plan,and issued a writ of mandate ordering dhs to perform a review as required by the state plan for and annually thereafter as long as required by the state plan or other applicable law.the trial court denied plaintiffs request for an order requiring dhs to perform retrospective rate reviews and to reimburse the providers for any difference,finding plaintiffs did not demonstrate that they were entitled to any such relief.
specifically,the trial court tentative ruling stated that plaintiffs evidence,consisting of generalized cost data showing that the cost of providing home health care services in california has increased more than the rates paid by the state,was suggestive of the inadequacy of current rates.however,the trial court concluded that such evidence did not demonstrate that on an overall basis rates violate federal and state law by being inconsistent with efficiency,economy and quality of care or by being insufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure that care and services are available at least to the extent they are available to the general population.
plaintiffs appeal the trial court judgment insofar as it failed to order retrospective rate reviews and reimbursement.dhs cross appeals the judgment insofar as it ordered dhs to perform a rate review beginning in.
discussion 
dhs claims the appeal is moot because the provision of the state plan providing the basis for the relief granted by the trial court is now.plaintiffs appeal challenges the trial court refusal to order rate increases for.the state plan provision repealing the annual rate review provision became effective as of december.because the repealed provision had no effect on the earlier years,the appeal of the order denying rate increases for prior years is not moot.
standing and private right of action 
dhs argues the trial court erred in granting plaintiffs any relief because the requirements for issuance of a writ were not met.there are two essential requirements to the issuance of a traditional writ of mandate a clear,present and usually ministerial duty on the part of the respondent,and a clear,present and beneficial right on the part of the petitioner to the performance of that duty.loder municipal court for san diego judicial dist.of san diego county cal d.we address the second requirement first.under this section,we shall consider dhs arguments that plaintiffs are not entitled to relief because there is no private right o
