hoa hong van,a successful claimant for supplemental security income ssi benefits,appeals the district court denial of her application for attorneys fees as by the filing provision in the equal access to justice act eaja or the act,which requires a party to submit a fee application within thirty days of final judgment in the action,d b,and defines final judgment as a judgment that is final and not appealable id.d g.the district court held that because,following a remand under sentence six of g,the commissioner of social security commissioner consented to a judgment enforcing the agency determination in favor of van,the judgment became final and not appealable immediately,requiring van to file her fee application within days after entry of judgment,rather than days after expiration of the appeal period provided for in rule a b of the federal rules of appellate procedure.because van filed her fee application days after entry of judgment,the district court denied her application as untimely.id.
in this case,we consider whether in order to be deemed timely under d b,a social security disability claimant who,following a remand under sentence six of g,obtains a favorable determination from the agency and enforces it in the district court by a judgment to which the government consents must file an application for attorneys fees under eaja within days after the entry of judgment,or,whether he may file within days following expiration of the appeal period provided for by rule a b.we hold that such a claimant,like other successful remand claimants,may file within days after the appeal period in rule a has expired.thus,we reverse the district court and remand with instructions to consider van fee application on the merits.
in january,van filed an application for ssi benefits.the social security administration ssa denied her application in april,and after a hearing before an administrative law judge alj in january,the alj denied her claim.in january,the appeals council denied van request for review of the alj decision,and,in march,van filed an action in the district court pursuant to g,challenging the denial of her benefits.thereafter,in january,she filed a motion for summary judgment,and,in response,in february,the commissioner filed a motion to remand.on march,the district court denied van motion for summary judgment and granted the commissioner motion to remand.the district judge subsequently made it clear in an april,order that the march remand was issued pursuant to sentence six of g.van appealed the remand order to this court,and we held that we lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a remand.van barnhart.cir.
following the remand,the appeals council vacated its earlier decision,and,on june,after considering new evidence,an alj awarded benefits to van.on august,van filed an ex parte motion in the district court,requesting that the case be reopened and that the district court issue a final judgment.district judge napoleon jones reopened the case on august,and on november,magistrate judge anthony battaglia directed the commissioner to file a supplemental transcript of the proceedings conducted before the ssa by december.the commissioner submitted the supplemental transcript on december,and on january,van submitted to the court an ex parte request for a final judgment.on january,the magistrate judge ordered that a judgment be entered,stating that p ursuant to this court order of august,and the results of the proceedings,which have been filed with this court,and which found that plaintiff has been disabled since january,it is hereby ordered that judgment in this matter be entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendant.subsequent to the issuance of this order,on february,the commissioner filed a document with the district court entitled consent to entry of judgment,which stated that b ecause the commissioner has awarded benefits to plaintiff following further proceedings on remand,the commissioner consents to the entry of judgment as proposed by van.on february,district judge larry burns issued an order identical to the one issued nine days earlier by the magistrate judge,and the judgment was entered.
on april,van filed a motion for attorneys fees under eaja with the district court.this filing occurred days after the february,entry of judgment,and days after the january,order.van requested in attorneys fees.the commissioner opposed the motion and argued,inter alia,that the district court lacked jurisdiction over it because it was untimely.the commissioner argued that van was required to file her motion within days after the entry of judgment,because a party can not generally appeal a consent judgment she urged that in a case in which the government has so consented,the period for filing a motion for attorneys fees under d b begins to run immediately upon the district court entry of final judgment,citing melkonyan sullivan,d,and slaven american trading trans,cir.according to the commissioner,neither party could appeal the judgment,the judgment was not appealable and,as a result,the period to file for eaja fees commenced immediately upon entry of the judgment.
the district court agreed with the commissioner argument that van was required to file her motion for attorneys fees within days after entry of the judgment and held that van motion was untimely because it was filed days after the february,entry of judgment.accordingly,it denied her eaja application as in a written order filed august,thereafter,van filed a timely appeal with this court.we have jurisdiction under.
on appeal,van asserts that her motion for attorneys fees was timely filed,because the period in d b did not begin to run until days after entry of the judgment,and she filed days after two days into the period.van argues that under melkonyan and shalala schaefer,d,when a social security disability claimant case is remanded pursuant to sentence six of g,and she subsequently obtains a district court judgment enforcing a favorable agency determination,the filing period does not begin to run until the appeal period provided for in rule a b has expired,whether or not the government has consented to the judgment.see fed.a b.relying in part on the legislative history of eaja,van asserts that the regular statutory filing period,which includes the appeal period,is unaffected by the commissioner consent to a judgment that follows a remand under sentence six.

the equal access to justice act eaja or act departs from the general rule that each party to a lawsuit pays his or her own legal fees.scarborough,at.citing alyeska pipeline serv.wilderness soc y,d.under eaja,a party that prevails against the united states in a civil action is entitled,in certain circumstances,to an award of attorney fees,court costs,and other expenses,flores shalala,cir,but not when the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified d a.
eaja,however,limits the time during which a claimant may file a fee application.see id.d b.under d b,a party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection id.emphasis added.section d g,in turn,provides that final judgment means a judgment that is final and not appealable id.as a result,in order to be timely,a party seeking attorneys fees must file his application within days after a judgment that is final and not appealable.id.the applicable statutory provisions are contained in eaja as in.equal access to justice act,extension and amendment,c g,stat.
in this case,we must first examine the law,as it has thus far been established,regarding when a judgment enforcing an agency determination favorable to a social security disability claimant,following a remand under sentence six of g,constitutes a final judgment,or,more specifically,a judgment that is final and not appealable d b,d g.we must then determine whether a different rule applies in cases in which the government consents to the entry of the judgment.in construing the applicable statutory provisions,our objective is to ascertain the intent of congress in enacting them and give effect to the legislative will.united states stephens,cir.accordingly,if the plain language of d renders its meaning reasonably clear,the court will not investigate further unless its application leads to unreasonable or impracticable results.id.quoting united states daas,cir.because here the statute is ambiguous,and because judicial decisions have previously considered the pertinent language and the legislative history behind it,we rely primarily on prior decisions interpreting these terms as well as the relevant legislative history.see ins,cir discussing the legislative history behind the of eaja and stating that under this statutory language,there is more than one plausible interpretation of final judgment.citation omitted see also melkonyan,at.consulting the legislative history behind d to determine when a final judgment occurs under eaja.in particular,we review two supreme court decisions issued subsequent to eaja that interpret the term final and not appealable in social security disability cases involving remands under g,melkonyan,at,and schaefer,at.we also examine pertinent circuit court decisions interpreting d and the relevant legislative history of the act.
before discussing melkonyan and schaefer,however,we briefly review the statutory authority for both judicial review and remands in social security cases.pursuant to g,an individual may seek judicial review in the district court after any final decision of the commissioner of social security made after a hearing to which he was a party.id.once a claimant brings an action under g,the district court may remand to the commissioner of social security administration only under sentence four or sentence six of g.akopyan,at citing schaefer,at.melkonyan,at.a remand under sentence four is essentially a determination that the agency erred in some respect in reaching a decision to deny benefits,id.citing jackson chater,cir,whereas a remand under sentence six can be ordered only in two particular instances where the commissioner requests a remand before answering the complaint,or where new,material evidence is adduced that was for good cause not presented before the agency.id.at citing schaefer,at.
in melkonyan,the supreme court interpreted eaja in the context of a social security action,and explained that in,when congress reenacted d b,it adopted an unusual definition of final judgment in order to resolve a circuit split between this court and the seventh circuit regarding whether the period in d b begins to run when a judgment is entered or only after the appeal period has run.at.
congress opted for the latter approach,the more liberal rule that had been adopted by the seventh circuit.the court stated that 
a s for why congress added the unusual definition of final judgment,the answer is clear.the definition was added in to resolve a conflict in the lower courts on the question whether a judgment was to be regarded as final for eaja purposes when it was entered,or only when the period for taking an appeal had lapsed.brief for respondent footnote omitted.the ninth circuit had held that the eaja filing period began to run when the district court entered judgment.mcquiston marsh.the seventh circuit rejected this view,holding that the eaja filing period should be deemed to begin only after the time for taking an appeal from the district court judgment had expired.mcdonald schweiker,congress responded to this split in the federal courts by explicitly adopting and ratifying the mcdonald approach,the committee believes that the interpretation of the court in mcdonald is the correct one.see also,the term final judgment has been clarified to mean a judgment the time to appeal which has expired for all parties.
see also,at,reprinted in,stating that the term final judgment has been clarified to mean a judgment that is final and not appealable,and specifying that when a district court judgment is not appealed by the government,the period would begin to run upon expiration of the time for filing the notice of appeal.
in mcdonald,the seventh circuit,in an opinion authored by judge posner,had reasoned that the practical consequences that would flow from requiring a fee application to be filed within days of judgment necessitated interpreting eaja period as beginning after the period for appeal had expired.at.otherwise,as judge posner wrote,some applicants might be compelled to file multiple costly fee applications or file applications prior to when the fees were fully ascertainable following the appellate proceedings.id.moreover,requiring a fee applicant to file an application before the government could file its own appeal would serve as a perverse weapon for discouraging meritorious fee applications,because the government might appeal the underlying judgment if it learned that the fees were significant.id.at.this would create a dilemma for claimants considering whether to file a fee application,which the framers of eaja could not have meant to create when they used the words final judgment id.
with these adverse practical consequences in mind,congress ratified the mcdonald approach in the reenactment of eaja,and expressed similar reasons to those stated by the mcdonald court for adopting the final and not appealable language.see adams sec,that congress adopted the mcdonald approach for applications in judicial proceedings under suggests that congress also agreed with the court underlying reasoning.for instance,a house report stated that b y adopting the seventh circuit interpretation,the amendment will give both courts and litigants clear guidance on what is expected and avoid the unnecessary confusion which accompanied this issue in the past,at,at.
in addition to explaining the origin of the term final judgment in d b,the melkonyan court clarified how this term applies in the context of the two types of remands of social security cases under g.because the melkonyan court was uncertain whether the district court had intended to issue a remand or a remand,it stated when the judgment would become a final judgment for the purpose of d b in each instance.in remands,the court concluded,the filing period begins after the final judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing is entered by the court and the appeal period has run,so that the judgment is no longer appealable.see d g.melkonyan,at.emphasis added.in sentence six cases,the court said,the filing period does not begin until after the postremand proceedings are completed,the secretary returns to court,the court enters a final judgment,and the appeal period runs.id.emphasis added accord akopyan,at citing melkonyan,at.
as a result of this formulation by the supreme court,although the timing of a fee application following a remand differs from that of a fee application following a remand,it does so primarily because the former may only be filed after the completion of the proceedings and a return to the district court to enter a judgment.melkonyan,at.flores,at.once the requisite judgment is entered,however,the timing is identical in both types of cases,in that in both the claimant must file within days after the appeal period provided for in rule a has run.see melkonyan,at.schaefer,at.akopyan,at yang shalala,cir.because the prescribed appeal period in rule a for cases in which the united states is a party is days,fed.a b,a judgment in an ssi case is no longer appealable or not appealable when the appeal period has run.see melkonyan,at.accord barry bowen,cir the judgment is final when it is no longer appealable,d g,and this occurs when the government period in which to appeal has elapsed,see fed.rule a.melkonyan neither set forth nor implied the existence of any exceptions to its rule.
the government asserts,nevertheless,that a different rule applies when it consents to the entry of a judgment favorable to an ssi claimant.in such a case,it contends,there is no appeal period,and the days begins to run immediately upon the entry of judgment rather than upon the expiration of the appeal period provided for in rule a.we reject this contention,and hold that the appeal period applies whether or not the government consents to the judgment.
we begin our analysis of the government argument by examining melkonyan further.notably,the melkonyan court stated that,for remands,the filing period begins after the appeal period runs,despite the fact that the court had already recognized that on remand the agency had found the petitioner disabled and had granted petitioner all the relief he had initially requested.at.moreover,despite knowing that the commissioner had awarded the benefits and would,therefore,in all likelihood consent to a judgment for melkonyan in the district court,the court concluded its opinion by stating that if this was a sentence six remand petitioner can easily reapply for eaja fees following the district court entry of a final judgment.id.at.emphasis added.the court did not qualify this statement with any suggestion that,should the commissioner formally consent to the award of the relief the agency had ordered,the entry of the judgment granting benefits would,in direct contravention of the rule it had just announced,constitute a final judgment before rule a appeal period runs.id.at.
we recognize that attorneys fees are frequently sought in remand cases when the commissioner has,upon remand,awarded benefits to the disabled claimant,and that attorneys fees are not sought in cases in which the claimant is ultimately unsuccessful.we also recognize that in the former category of cases the commissioner ordinarily has little reason to object to the judgment.in light of the court failure to distinguish between district court judgments favorable to the claimant to which the government formally consents,and those to which it merely fails to object or even those to which it may for some reason object,we read melkonyan as adopting a uniform approach to all favorable judgments that follow remands.thus,under melkonyan,a successful disability applicant may file for attorneys fees days after the appeal period provided for in rule a has run,regardless of the specific form of the court judgment,or the particular nature of the government to or acquiescence in an award of benefits.such a uniform approach is consistent with the intent of congress,as evidenced by the house same report cited in stated that by adopting the interpretation that a judgment is final when the time to appeal had run,it will give both courts and litigants clear guidance on what is expected and avoid the unnecessary confusion which accompanied this issue in the past,at,at.under a uniform approach,litigants will have clear guidance on what is expected,removing any uncertainty or confusion about the appropriate date to file fee applications following remands.further,a uniform approach to judgments following remands avoid s an overly technical construction of these terms,and ensures that the definition of final judgment is not used as a trap for the unwary resulting in the unwarranted denial of fees.id.at,at.
we previously made this very point in,where we stated that w hen congress the eaja in,it sought to clarify its intent by defining final judgment in a manner that would avoid the overly technical approach previously taken by some courts,at internal quotation and citation omitted see also id.citing,at,at this section should not be used as a trap for the unwary resulting in the unwarranted denial of fees myers sullivan,cir finding that the requirement should be interpreted broadly and that overtechnical constructions of the requirement should be avoided.adams,at realization of the purpose of eaja necessarily requires an interpretation of the procedural requirements of eaja in a manner that is not unduly confusing or misleading so that they are not a trap for the unwary.quoting myers,at.
contrary to the government argument,the fact that it has consented to a judgment following a does not necessarily mean that the judgment is not appealable.d g.as the government acknowledges,there are exceptions to the rule that consent judgments are not subject to appeal given that some consent judgments may in fact be appealed,a claimant can not know with certainty that the commissioner will not file a notice of appeal in his case until the appeal period has ended nor can the claimant be certain that the commissioner will not decide to invoke one of the existing exceptions to the general rule,or ask the court to create a new one.thus,under the approach advocated by the post hoc whether the judgment obtained by the specific litigant was appealable when it was security disability litigants who obtain judgments to which the government consents following remands would be subject to the very uncertainty as to whether the commissioner may or could as to when the days begins to congress and this court so assiduously sought to avoid.
if we were to adopt the government approach to cases,we would be encouraging the very type of unnecessary confusion which accompanied this issue in the past,at,at,and would revive the concerns raised by the seventh circuit in same concerns that prompted congress to amend the definition of final judgment to avoid entrapping unwary fee applicants.id.at,at,at accord adams,at concluding that a approach constitutes the type of trap that congress intended the courts to avoid when interpreting eaja,and stating that it would pointlessly leave considerable uncertainty about when eaja day deadline would expire and result in an unworkable rule scafar contracting,secretary of labor,cir following adams and stating that requiring the filing of a fee application before the agency could appeal would breathe life into the hypothetical problems and concerns earlier expressed by this court and others over the proper interpretation of s final judgment in the context of.
finally,we conclude that a uniform rule governing judgments that follow remands comports with our recent statement that we construe the act definition of final judgment as designating the date when there is no longer any possibility that the district court judgment is open to attack,at quoting myers,at.where there is a potential for either party to appeal a particular type of judgment under the relevant statute that designates the time to appeal,there is a possibility that the district court judgment is open to attack during the period provided for in the statute,at emphasis added quoting myers,at accord adams,at.even if a court determining the timeliness of an eaja fee application could have reasonably concluded at the outset of the appeal period that the particular judgment would not be appealable,the mere fact that there was a potential for the type of judgment to be appealed under the relevant statute means least from the standpoint of the was a possibility that the judgment was open to attack during the appeal period,at.because,in a number of circumstances,there is a potential for a party to appeal a judgment to which it consented,see local,at slaven,at tapper,at,there is a possibility with respect to any such individual judgment that it is open to attack during the appeal period provided for in rule a,at.accordingly,the filing period for all such judgments does not begin to run until the period in rule a has actually lapsed,or,until an appeal has been completed,thereby eliminating any possibility that a party could institute a further attack upon the particular judgment.id.
not only do melkonyan and the legislative history of d b dictate the use of a uniform rule in the case of judgments that follow remands,but the court subsequent decision in schaefer and our decisions interpreting d b in the context of remands also support that same conclusion.two years after melkonyan,the supreme court again addressed the question of when a final judgment occurs under d b,this time in a remand case,shalala schaefer,d.in schaefer,when considering the rule to be applied to sentence four cases,the court w e described the law with complete accuracy in melkonyan,when we said that i n
