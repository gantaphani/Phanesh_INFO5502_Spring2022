michael ward ward and daniel edgar edgar,executive officers at cape coral hospital the hospital,appeal their convictions and the sentences imposed for crimes arising out of various schemes whereby ward and edgar used their positions to illegally convert hospital funds to their own benefit.specifically,ward appeals his total concurrent sentences and his conviction for the following conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of count theft from an organization receiving government funds,in violation of counts,and money laundering,in violation of a counts and bank fraud,in violation of count and tax evasion,in violation of counts.edgar appeals his total concurrent sentences and his conviction for the following conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of count theft from an organization receiving government funds,in violation of counts,and money laundering,in violation of a counts and and tax evasion,in violation of counts.
ward and edgar present multiple grounds for overturning their convictions and sentences.we have carefully considered these various arguments and have concluded that the district court did not commit reversible error in this case.the parties arguments regarding the constitutionality of,however,merit some discussion.edgar argues that is facially unconstitutional because congress lacks the power to enact criminal laws under the spending clause of the constitution edgar further asserts that if is void due to its constitutional infirmity,then his money laundering convictions can not stand because the convictions were the predicate offenses alleged in the money laundering counts.ward has adopted these arguments by motion.ward also argues that the indictment was fatally flawed because is unconstitutionally vague is unconstitutional as applied because there is no continuing federal interest in the medicare,part a funds after their distribution to the hospital the indictment failed to allege that the exception found at c was inapplicable and the indictment failed to sufficiently allege facts establishing federal jurisdiction under.we address those of his claims resting on constitutional challenges to.
background 
ward served as the hospital president and chief executive officer from through may.edgar joined the hospital as chief operating officer in.through a series of transactions spanning the years to,ward and edgar misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars from the hospital for their own benefit.a detailed description of the schemes they carried out,however,is not necessary to the resolution of their constitutional claims.for the purpose of our discussion,the key fact is the hospital participation in the medicare,part a program,which provides federal assistance payments to hospitals and other institutions inasmuch as a slightly more detailed description of the conduct underlying ward conviction is required in resolving his contention that the statute is unconstitutionally vague,we set forth additional facts at the appropriate point in our discussion.
discussion 
in fulfilling its legislative function,congress may only act pursuant to an express grant of power or authority in article i of the constitution.courts considering claims involving have concluded that congress passed the statute pursuant to its powers under the spending clause.see,united states zwick,cir united states santopietro,cir united states mccormack,d,collecting cases see also fischer united states,d thomas,dissenting united states suarez,cir boggs,dissenting in part.the spending clause of the constitution empowers congress to lay and collect taxes,duties,imposts,and excises,to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the united states.art.i,cl.
edgar argues that congress has no power to pass criminal laws under the spending clause.he maintains that courts have upheld conditional grants of funds to state and local governments on the theory that congress is not enacting a law binding on those governments,but instead offering a contract which the governments may reject or accept subject to the conditions attached by congress.it is this contract theory,edgar asserts,that prevents such congressional actions from upsetting the balance of power between federal and state governments.edgar contends that,by contrast,is a federal criminal statute designed to punish conduct traditionally within the realm of state concerns,and that such legislative action extends beyond the scope of congress powers under the spending clause.accordingly,edgar contends that the district court should have granted his motion to dismiss the counts because is facially unconstitutional.ward has adopted these arguments by motion.after carefully considering the question,we now hold that is a valid exercise of congress powers under the spending clause.
i.the supreme court limiting construction of in united states fischer.
our conclusion that is constitutional has as its first point of reference the supreme court treatment of the statute.the first supreme court decision reviewing a prosecution stated that there was no serious doubt about the constitutionality of the statute provision under the circumstances presented.see salinas united states,d citing westfall united states.in fischer united states,d,the court again upheld a conviction.the defendant in fischer was a health care consultant who had been prosecuted under for fraud and bribery involving a municipal hospital agency which received more than in federal funds.at issue was whether payments to the hospital agency under the federal medicare program constituted benefits for purposes of b,a limiting provision which requires that the alleged offense conduct involve an organization,government,or agency that receives,in any one year period,benefits in excess of under a federal program involving a grant,contract,subsidy,loan,guarantee,insurance,or other form of federal assistance.
characterizing medicare as a comprehensive federal assistance enterprise aimed at ensuring the availability of quality health care for the broader community,fischer,at,the court held that medicare payments to health care providers count as benefits under b and not,as the defendant argued,simply as compensation for services rendered.id.at.the court thus upheld the health care consultant conviction under the statute misappropriation and bribery provisions.at the same time,the court rejected the government contention that any funds distributed from federal coffers would qualify as benefits for purposes of the limitation established by b.a majority stated 
any receipt of federal funds can,at some level of generality,be characterized as a benefit.the statute does not employ this broad,almost limitless use of the term.doing so would turn almost every act of fraud or bribery into a federal offense,upsetting the proper federal balance.
id.at.the court went on to hold that the evaluation of whether particular federal receipts count as benefits turns on the relevant federal program structure,operation,and purpose,as well as the conditions under which an entity receives federal payments.id.it reasoned that medicare payments pass the requisite threshold,citing as relevant factors the program comprehensive scheme of regulation and its broad aim of promoting the stability of providers.
we are persuaded that the court reference to the proper federal balance demonstrates its cognizance of potential constitutional limitations upon the application of.united states suarez,cir boggs,dissenting in part remarking that the fischer majority language regarding the need to respect the proper balance between state and federal sovereigns makes clear their constitutional concerns with a broad reading of.the court rejection of the government proposed construction of the term benefits,on the basis of the threat it posed the proper federal balance,clearly implied a conclusion as to the soundness of the court own alternative construction.by requiring attention to a program structure,operation,and purpose in determining whether federal monies constitute benefits,the court indicated that constitutional concerns implicated by the statute language may be overcome through careful construction.
in this sense,the court approach to has validated the efforts of the second and third circuits in several decisions.both courts had identified the same constitutional concern addressed by the court in fischer the potential amenability of to interpretations that would render an exceedingly large class of traditional state offenses subject to federal prosecution.see united states zwick,cir noting that most literal interpretation of is troubling from an interpretative standpoint in that it broadens the range of activity criminalized by the statute and alters the existing balance of federal and state powers united states santopietro,cir offering,as reductio ad absurdum,the federal prosecution of a bribe paid to a city meat inspector just because the city parks department had received a federal grant of.the solution endorsed by both circuits was the recognition of an offense element limiting the statute application to conduct bearing a sufficient connection to the expenditure of federal funds or the integrity of federal programs.the supreme court decision in fischer has now confirmed the existence of the constitutional limits suspected by the second and third circuits,while also clarifying that these limits are built into b requirement that recipient entities receive at least in federal benefits over the course of a year.after fischer,it is clear that the term benefits encompasses only federal funds expended under sufficiently comprehensive programs.application of this standard is to be guided by reference to a program structure,operation,and purpose,as well as the conditions under which recipient entities receive funds.this discussion of the relevant factors presages a broad enough inquiry to assure that applications of remain within constitutional bounds.
ii.congressional authority to enact as a necessary and proper means of preserving its spending power.
although the fischer majority did not expressly reference any constitutional provision,we are persuaded that a basis for the enactment of may be found in congress authority,under the necessary and proper clause,to protect its capacity to fruitfully exercise the spending power.as a means of ensuring the efficacy of federal appropriations to comprehensive federal assistance programs,the enforcement mechanism strikes us as bearing a sufficient relationship to congress spending power to dispel any doubt as to its constitutionality.
article i of the constitution gives congress the authority to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution its enumerated powers.art.i,cl.from the time of the supreme court landmark decision in maryland,wheat,it has been recognized that the necessary and proper clause authorizes congress,subject to other constraints imposed by the constitution,to adopt measures that bear a rational connection to any of its enumerated powers.therefore,may be upheld if the availability of federal criminal jurisdiction over the specified offense conduct bears a reasonable relationship to exercise of the congressional spending power.
in fischer,the supreme court analysis at times bears inflections of this mode of analysis.the court noted that the language of subsection b reveals congress expansive,unambiguous intent to ensure the integrity of organizations participating in federal assistance programs.fischer,at.this reference to ensuring integrity,as well as the identification of plural federal assistance programs,suggests a reading of as serving a congressional the creation of an enforcement mechanism sufficient to assure that disbursements meeting the b threshold are in fact applied in furtherance of the purposes for which they are dispensed.
further support for our reliance upon the necessary and proper clause may be found in united states lipscomb,cir,despite the failure of a fractured panel in that case to resolve an challenge to constitutionality.shifting majorities of the lipscomb panel contributed to a judgment reversing a former dallas city council member conviction under for accepting bribes from a taxicab company.this judgment,however,did not depend on any conclusion as to constitutionality.rather,each of the two opinions addressing the defendant constitutional challenge appears to have viewed the enactment of as within congress powers under the necessary and proper clause.in one of the three opinions entered in the case,judge wiener applied a analysis as one ground on which the statute and the defendant prosecution could be upheld.judge wiener found the rational connection standard satisfied by two federal interests in criminal jurisdiction over corruption of the kind at bar.first was the absolute size of federal funds by the city of dallas.lipscomb.second was the integrity vel non of federal programs and funds,id.at,by which judge wiener meant congress interest in ensuring the honesty of state and local officials who have federal funds in their purview or federal programs under their authority.id.
in a separate opinion,judge smith outlined his opposing view that was unconstitutional as applied through the prosecution of the former council member corrupt activities.judge smith opinion nonetheless suggested that the necessary and proper clause affords a sufficient basis for congress enactment of.distinguishing the federal interest in programs from the federal government generalized interest in everything that occurs within its borders,lipscomb,he reasoned that policing a taxicab company bribery of a local legislator is necessary and proper only to the pursuit of the latter,generalized interest,and thus exceeds the bounds of congress article i powers.judge smith therefore appears to have presumed that is necessary and proper inasmuch as it may be applied to safeguard substantial amounts of federal funding disbursed in connection with reasonably comprehensive federal assistance programs.
the opinions of both judge wiener and judge smith thus support our view that the necessary and proper clause provides congress with the requisite authority to enact,even if some prosecutions under the statute may require reversal.indeed,for congress to exercise its spending power effectively,it must be assured that the instrumentalities through which the federal government pursues comprehensive aims can be trusted to apply appropriated funds toward their intended objectives.the legislative history of provides evidence of exactly such an intent.according to a senate report accompanying the statute,the purpose of the law is to create new offenses to augment the ability of the united states to vindicate significant acts of theft,fraud,and bribery involving federal monies that are disbursed to private organizations or state and local governments pursuant to a federal program,sess.the report also states that the federal government clearly retains a strong interest in assuring the integrity of program funds.id.
these statements indicate that through,congress sought to establish a safeguard to assure that federal benefits would be used for their intended purposes.provides such assurance by authorizing the federal prosecution of individuals who corrupt entities which receive more than in federal funds in connection with programs defined by a sufficiently comprehensive structure,operation,and purpose to merit characterization of the funds as benefits under b.fischer,at.it is reasonable for congress to conclude that any corruption of such recipient organizations,regardless of whether the corruption involves the misappropriation of specifically federal funds,endangers the comprehensive programs in which the organizations participate,and thus the effective exercise of the congressional spending power as well.
accordingly,we reject the defendants facial challenge to the constitutionality of.moreover,since the defendants have not demonstrated any constitutional infirmity in the enactment of,the convictions premised on the offenses must also stand.
iii.section is not unconstitutionally vague.
ward raises two additional constitutional challenges to his conviction under.the first focuses on an exception set forth in c,which precludes p
