plaintiff anna lea justice appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to defendants,the pike county board of education board and its superintendent,frank welch,in her free speech and disability discrimination action.justice,a certified teacher,worked as grants department director for the board.when welch became the new superintendent,after a campaign in which justice supported his opponents,he abolished the grants department and reassigned justice to the classroom.rather than comply,justice sought and received a pension based on her physical inability to perform some classroom duties.the district court rejected justice claim that she had been terminated from her grants department position in retaliation for her political affiliation because her position was of a type allowing political discrimination.the district court rejected justice disability discrimination claim because justice,in seeking a state teacher disability pension,had implicitly denied her status as a qualified individual under the ada.we reverse on both issues.
justice was a certified teacher in the pike county school system under the kentucky teacher tenure act.she worked as a teacher from through and held various administrative positions from through.in november,the board,at the initiative of the superintendent,reo johns,created a grants department and appointed justice its director.her job description,largely drafted by justice herself,was as follows 
the grants department director is responsible for seeing that the goals and objectives of the grants department are achieved.
description of duties 
write grant proposals spearhead the research,planning,and proposal writing for submission of proposals to federal,state,and foundation funding sources.
program monitoring and evaluation monitor and evaluate funded programs according to guidelines as set forth in the proposal and evaluate program strengths and weaknesses.
establish and monitor grant teams select,train and work with teachers at each school who are part of the pike county grant team.
spearhead proposal development work with committees in various disciplines to develop goals,objectives,and budgets.
conduct needs assessments plan for and conduct needs assessments to determine needs for program development.
locate funding sources for the district research funding sources for specific needs.
provide technical assistance provide technical assistance on an as needed basis to school staff and provide grant writing workshops for teachers and administrative staff.
professional development attend grant writing workshops and conferences in a variety of disciplines so as to be abreast of the latest trends in education.
as grants director,she reported directly to the superintendent and in turn supervised two clerical workers.
in,johns came under public scrutiny after local newspapers published articles alleging that he had closed down a public school in order to enhance the business of a competing private school run by johns son,the kentucky youth academy.justice served as a director of the kentucky youth academy and,at public meetings of the board,she repeatedly defended johns and the academy.nevertheless,in may,johns resigned as superintendent and brenda gooslin was appointed interim superintendent.after johns resignation,justice published an article in the local paper further defending and praising him.
in august,supporters of defendant welch defeated gooslin supporters in school board elections and the board appointed welch as the new superintendent.in april,welch,claiming that the grants department was not an efficient use of resources,prevailed upon the board to abolish it and return its functions to other administrators.welch notified justice that,starting in the school year,she would be assigned back to classroom teaching duty.as classroom teacher,justice would have continued to draw the same per diem salary.but because as a classroom teacher she was only expected to work days a year,compared to the days a year as a grants director,this would have involved a significant reduction in annual salary.
justice had become significantly disabled since she last held a classroom teaching position.on november,about the same time she was promoted to grants director,she suffered a serious car accident,resulting in multiple fractures,contusions,and whiplash.these injuries and the subsequent arthritis made it difficult for her to stand or walk for extended periods of time,climb stairs,or run.these disabilities did not substantially interfere with her work as a grants director,most of which was sedentary.according to justice medical experts,these disabilities would have made it very difficult for her to function as an effective classroom teacher,a position requiring frequent standing and walking.justice also suffers from chronic depression and had been taking medication for this condition since.justice claims that her mental problems were triggered by a confrontation with a student and that they render her unable to handle classroom stress.
justice complained about the reassignment to welch,alleging that it constituted punishment for her political association with and support for johns.she also claimed that she was unable to perform the duties of a classroom teacher because of her disabilities and that she had to be assigned to a position.when welch was unmoved by these complaints,justice accepted the classroom assignment under protest and immediately applied for disability retirement under the kentucky teacher retirement system.to succeed in such an application,the claimant must demonstrate that she is unable to perform the essential functions of her job.on august,prior to her scheduled start of work as classroom teacher,justice was granted disability retirement.
on october,justice filed a complaint against the board and welch in the united states district court for the eastern district of kentucky.in it she alleged that the defendants had deprived her of her first and fourteenth amendment rights to freedoms of expression,speech,and association,in violation of,denied her a position in order to punish her for her political affiliation,in violation of,and discriminated against her on the basis of her disabilities,in violation of the americans with disabilities act ada,and the rehabilitation act.she also alleged parallel state constitutional claims,under.const.and,and state claims.on these grounds,she asked for compensatory and punitive damages,injunctive relief,and attorney fees.on august,the district court granted the defendants motion for summary judgment.the district court concluded that the position of grant development director was one for which consideration of political affiliation or support was appropriate,thus defeating justice federal constitutional claims,and that justice,by applying for disability retirement,had conceded that she was not a qualified individual within the scope of the ada and the rehabilitation act,thus defeating her disability discrimination claims.having disposed of all of justice federal claims,the district court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over her state law claims.the district court also did not rule on the defendants proffered eleventh amendment and qualified immunity defenses.before the court now is justice timely appeal of the district court grant of summary judgment on the federal questions.
during the pendency of this appeal,we heard and decided two factually and legally cases.in hager pike county board of education,cir,we decided a case mirroring justice constitutional claims.carolyn sue hager,too,was a teacher in the pike county school system.id.at.hager had publicly supported johns appointment as superintendent and johns had appointed hager to the position of gifted and talented.ibid.after johns retired and welch became superintendent,he decided to eliminate hager position and reassign the duties to another central office employee in an unpaid capacity.id.at.he believed this arrangement was a more economic and efficient use of district resources.ibid.hager was reassigned to classroom teaching at the elementary school level,with a salary reduction of and no responsibilities in the gifted and talented program.ibid.two months before justice filed her complaint,hager filed a complaint against the same defendants,raising the same constitutional claims,in the same court,presided over by the same judge.the district court,as here,found that hager position was of a type that allowed her to be dismissed on the basis of political affiliation or support,and granted summary judgment to defendants.id.at.we held that hager position was not of this type and therefore reversed and remanded for a finding as to whether hager political affiliation or support had been the cause in fact of her dismissal.ibid.
in dotson pike county board of education,wl.cir per curiam table,we decided a case mirroring justice disability discrimination claims.fannie louise dotson,too,had been a teacher in the pike county school system.id.at.in,dotson retired on income from the board early retirement plan.ibid.she also drew disability benefits from the kentucky teacher retirement system based on knee and back injuries,until she was informed that teachers drawing disability benefits from that system where ineligible for the board early retirement plan.ibid.in response,dotson filed a complaint alleging disability discrimination,in violation of the ada and the rehabilitation act,against the same defendants,in the same court,presided over by the same judge.ibid.the district court held that dotson receipt of disability benefits prevented her from claiming that she is a qualified individual with a disability who could perform the essential functions of her job,as required by the ada.ibid.because the standards for disability under the ada and the retirement plan differ,we reversed.id.at.
we recently summarized the state of the law of politically motivated firings 
the plaintiff argues that her demotion and reassignment were in retaliation for the exercise of her constitutional rights to political expression and association.these rights are under the constitution.see,rutan republican party,d quoting elrod burns,d plurality opinion political belief and association constitute the core of those activities protected by the first amendment.moreover,even practices that only potentially threaten political association are highly suspect.mccloud testa,cir mccloud i.
the defendants argue that the plaintiff was in a position that allowed the defendants to consider political affiliation in their personnel decisions under the exceptions to the general prohibition against government employment decisions based on political activities.the district court agreed and found no violation of a constitutional right.whether political affiliation is an appropriate consideration for a government position is a question of law.sowards loudon county,cir.therefore,to obtain summary judgment,defendants must establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether political affiliation may appropriately be considered with respect to the position in question.id.quoting feeney shipley,cir.
it is that public employees enjoy first amendment freedoms of political belief and association,however,if the exercise of those rights interferes with the discharge of public duties,then the rights may have to yield to the government interest in maintaining effectiveness and efficiency.elrod,at.limiting patronage dismissals to policymaking positions is sufficient to achieve the valid governmental objective of preventing holdover employees from undermining the ability of a new administration to implement its policies.id.in contrast,n onpolicymaking individuals usually have only limited responsibilities and are therefore not in a position to thwart the goals of the.hall tollett,cir quoting elrod,at.therefore,the single substantive question is whether a nonpolicymaking,nonconfidential government employee can be discharged or threatened with discharge from a job that she is satisfactorily performing upon the sole ground of her political beliefs.elrod,at.stewart,concurring.this question extends beyond the context of firings,to include areas such as transfers,promotions,and recalls from layoffs.rutan,at.abolition of positions,reassignments,demotions are also included.see blatter,cir en banc.thus,to avoid a constitutional violation in instances of patronage,the hiring authority must demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.branti finkel,d emphasis added.
hager,at citations regularized.
to add concreteness to this exception to the first amendment protection of public employees,we have established four broad categories of positions that fall within the exception.mccloud i,at.these categories are positions explicitly empowered by law to exercise political discretion positions not explicitly so empowered,but exercising political discretion by a jurisdiction pattern or practice confidential advisors and positions filled by balancing of affiliations.ibid.while a government position need not fall neatly within one of the categories to fit into the exception,any position that falls into these categories with reasonable certainty removes its holder from the constitutional protection against political dismissal enjoyed by other employees.sowards,at.the court below held that justice position fell within category two and here the board argues that justice position falls within categories one,two,and three.that her position is not within category four is undisputed.we consider the applicability of the first three categories seriatim and conclude that justice position of grants development director does not fit within any of them 
in mccloud i,we defined category one as positions specifically named in relevant federal,state,county or municipal law to which discretionary authority with respect to the enforcement of that law or the carrying out of some other policy of political concern is granted.at.this category captures the intuition gained from reading elrod,branti,and rutan that a chief executive cabinet secretaries and similar employees fall into the branti exception.the proviso that the policymaking authority possessed by a category one must be held in relation to a matter of political concern stems from the discussion in branti that a football coach is a policymaker,but not the sort of policymaker for whom political affiliation is an appropriate requirement under the first amendment.id.at.as an illustrative examples of a position within this category we listed a secretary of state given statutory authority over various state corporation law policies.id.at.
the board argues that because it is authorized by law to establish written job descriptions,and justice had such a description,her position falls within category one.this scarcely needs refuting.a written job description is not federal,state,county or municipal law.nothing in our precedents suggests it is and the board cites no support for this proposition.our category one case law focuses on whether positions established in law are political in nature.see,hoard sizemore,cir county road supervisor within category one because state law specifically provides for the position which has the general charge of all county roads and bridges within his county and must see that county roads and bridges are improved and maintained as provided by law and r oad maintenance is a policy of political concern and the road foreman has some discretionary authority with respect to carrying out this policy.collins voinovich,cir executive director of ohio lottery commission within category one because it is a position charged with administering the lottery in accordance with the governor mandate and named in state law.however,we have never held that the requirement that a position be established in law could be fulfilled by a mere job description.instead,we have created category two to cover positions similar to category one positions but not created by law.
in mccloud i,we defined category two as positions to which a significant portion of the total discretionary authority available to category one has been delegated or positions not named in law,possessing by virtue of the jurisd
