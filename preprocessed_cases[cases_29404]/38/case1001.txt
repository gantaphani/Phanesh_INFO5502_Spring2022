joseph bustamante appeals the district court judgment affirming the social security administration ssa denial of his application for disability benefits and for supplemental security income under titles ii and xvi of the social security act the act.we have jurisdiction under,and we reverse and remand because the administrative law judge alj prematurely evaluated the impact of bustamante alcoholism prior to completing the sequential disability inquiry and the alj conclusion that bustamante did not have a severe mental impairment was not supported by substantial evidence.
background 
bustamante was years old at the time of the alleged onset of his disability in.he has an education and relevant work experience as a newspaper delivery person and temporary laborer.bustamante also has at least a history of alcohol abuse and is frequently homeless.
procedural history 
on july,bustamante applied for a period of disability and disability insurance benefits under i and of the act,i and,and for supplemental security income ssi under a a of the act,a a,collectively,disability benefits.bustamante initially alleged that he suffered from diabetes mellitus,tuberculosis,pneumonia,and back problems.he later alleged diabetes,memory problems,a history of alcohol abuse,and anxiety.
the ssa denied his application on january.bustamante then requested a hearing before an alj to obtain a de novo review of the ssa ruling.at a hearing on april,bustamante testified and was represented by counsel.at the conclusion of the hearing,the alj held the record open for the receipt of additional psychological evidence.
on december,the alj,after considering the additional evidence,issued a written decision finding bustamante ineligible for disability benefits.
the alj found that bustamante suffered from diabetes mellitus and had a history of pulmonary tuberculosis,but that these conditions did not constitute a severe physical impairment,as defined by,because the former was not severe and the latter was successfully treated with medication.
the alj also found that bustamante suffered from two mental impairments a personality disorder and a substance abuse addiction disorder,that result ed in moderate difficulties with activities of daily living,marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning,and seldom deficiencies in concentration,persistence or pace.the alj noted that bustamante also had continual episodes of deterioration or decompensation in the work place.
nevertheless,the alj rejected bustamante mental impairments as a basis for disability eligibility on several independent grounds.first,the alj found that alcohol abuse is his primary impairment and that any secondary behavioral and emotional conditions he may have are the product and consequence of his alcohol abuse and not an independently severe or disabling impairment.second,the alj concluded that even bustamante alcohol abuse did not reach a disabling level of severity.third,the alj concluded,with little analysis,that bustamante retains the physical and mental ability to perform basic functions,including his past relevant work as a newspaper delivery person or laborer.the alj also found that bustamante was not credible as to his limitations.finally,the alj concluded that alcohol abuse is a contributing factor material to a finding of disability.
bustamante appealed the alj decision to the ssa appeals council on december.the appeals council affirmed after reviewing both the alj decision and additional evidence from a psychiatrist who examined bustamante after the alj decision.
on august,bustamante sought judicial review of the final decision by filing a complaint in federal district court against the commissioner of the ssa,pursuant to g and c.the district court granted summary judgment against bustamante on september,in a order,stating simply that defendant decision is supported by substantial evidence.
bustamante filed a timely notice of appeal on october.
medical psychological evidence 
between and,several medical and mental health professionals examined bustamante.the reports of the first three were considered by the alj in his december decision.the report of the last one,newman,was not prepared until after the alj decision but was considered by the ssa appeals council on bustamante appeal and is part of the administrative record.

andersen concluded that he would defer to the results of a neuropsychiatric examination in this patient but speculated that bustamante best qualifier for disability would be through the presence of his basically untreated substance abuse problem and the chronic mood disorder,which i believe may be secondary to chronic alcoholism.he acknowledged that it would be difficult to make an exact diagnosis in this case,since his drinking began at such a young age.
