background 
mcgee is a vietnam veteran who served on active duty in the marine corps from may until september.while on active duty,he was diagnosed with severe sarcoidosis a lung disorder,and in august,a physical evaluation board found him unfit for duty and rated his disability at thirty percent.in september,he was released from active duty and placed on the temporary disability retired list mcgee testified before the board that his temporary retirement benefits ceased in,at which time he was not advised of a need to file a formal claim with the department of veterans affairs va to obtain service connection for his disability.
on april,mcgee wrote a letter to a va regional office ro asserting that his lung disorder had been determined to be service connected and that he had been discharged with a thirty percent disability rating.although his lungs were still bothering him,his benefits had ceased.in february,the ro awarded him service connection for sarcoidosis and assigned a disability rating of thirty percent,effective july.mcgee claim went through several appeals within the ro,and the ro ultimately awarded him service connection with a one hundred percent disability rating,effective april.mcgee appealed the decision of the ro to the board on the ground that he was entitled to an effective date earlier than april.
the board found that there was no evidence in the record that the va had received a written claim from mcgee for service connection for sarcoidosis prior to april,and thus denied his request for an earlier effective date.see a stating that subject to certain exceptions not at issue here,the date on which a claim is received is the earliest date for which service connection can be granted.as part of its decision,the board stated 
the file shows that by correspondence,rating decisions,and the statement of the case,the ro has informed the veteran of the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim.pertinent records are on file.the law,not the evidence,governs the outcome of this case.the board finds that the notice and duty to assist provisions of the law are met.
emphasis added.mcgee appealed the board ruling to the veterans court.mcgee.at.
on appeal to the veterans court,mcgee argued that the board erroneously issued its decision on a less than fully developed record because it failed to consider all applicable provisions of law as required by.section a states decisions of the board shall be based on the entire record in the proceeding and upon consideration of all evidence and material of record and applicable provisions of law.mcgee argued that is an applicable provision of law that the board was required to consider before it reached its decision.see mcgee.at.section states 
a member of an armed force may not be discharged or released from active duty because of physical disability until he has made a claim for compensation,pension,or hospitalization,to be filed with the department of veterans affairs,or has refused to make such a claim or has signed a statement that his right to make such a claim has been explained to him,or has refused to sign such a statement.
a the veterans court rejected mcgee argument and held that the board was not required to consider because it is not an applicable provision of law within the meaning of a.mcgee.at.the veterans court described its decision as a determination as to whether the board complied with its statutory obligation in light of its failure to consider a particular law not found within title of the.id.at.it further reasoned that imposes no obligation upon the secretary of veterans affairs and fails to provide for any remedy in the context.id.at.mcgee timely appealed to this court.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
the jurisdiction of this court to review decisions of the veterans court is limited by statute.forshey principi,en banc.under c,we have exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation,or any interpretation thereof by the veterans court.see also forshey,at.constitutional and statutory interpretations by the veterans court are reviewed de novo.principi.this court is limited by its jurisdictional statute and,absent a constitutional issue,may not review challenges to factual determinations or challenges to the application of a law or regulation to facts.d.because mcgee challenges the veterans court interpretation of a statute,we have jurisdiction pursuant to c.
mcgee submits that the veterans court upheld the board decision under an erroneous interpretation of applicable as used in a.he argues that the plain meaning of applicable is relevant.because indicates that mcgee service personnel file may contain evidence that tends to establish or disprove his claim to an earlier service connection date,he submits that is relevant to his claim and thus an applicable law that the board is required to consider.rather than dispute the appropriate interpretation of applicable,the secretary characterizes mcgee appeal as a challenge under d to the board failure to discuss in its decision at oral argument,the secretary further posited that is not relevant because its terms do not require the marine corps to maintain records that would be sufficient to prove mcgee claim.
when a statute is at issue,we begin with the statutory language.williams taylor,d statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute.myore nicholson.the statute plain meaning is derived from its text and its structure.alexander sandoval,d norfolk dredging united states.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,the inquiry ends with the plain meaning.myore,at.moreover when a statute is ambiguous,interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran favor.brown gardner,d padgett nicholson.
the plain meaning of applicable begins with its ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.williams taylor,d.this ordinary meaning may be properly informed by the use of dictionaries.see united states rodgers,d using dictionary to assess natural,nontechnical reading of the statutory language telecare leavitt,t he plain meaning of a statute is to be ascertained using standard dictionaries in effect at the time of the statute enactment.the adjective applicable,defined in part as capable of being applied having reference,derives from the verb apply.oxford english dictionary ed.the primary definition of apply is to put a thing into practical context with another.oxford english dictionary.according to these definitions,the ordinary,contemporary,common meaning of applicable provision of law is a provision that has reference to,or places something into practical context with,the board decision.thus,rather than require a specific legal result,such as the imposition of an obligation on the secretary or the creation of a remedy for a veteran claimant,a provision of law is applicable to the board decision if its terms have some practical relevance to that decision.
we must also examine and consider the statutory framework within which the board makes its decision.consistent with the dictionary definitions,this framework clarifies that a provision of law applies to the board decision if it is relevant to the decision.the board adjudicates a claim for veterans benefits within a compensation system that is uniquely.hensley west.this statutory system imposes on the board an obligation to fully and sympathetically develop the veteran claim to its optimum before deciding it on the merits.at,reprinted in,discussing veteran judicial review act,a,a,stat.moreover,the veteran judicial review act imposes a statutory du
