background 
overview of prwora and title 
this appeal involves an interlocking set of cooperative welfare and child support programs.seeking to standardize the states systems for welfare and child support payments,congress enacted the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of prwora under its spending power.among other sweeping changes,prwora abolished aid to families with dependent children afdc,the entitlement program that had long provided cash assistance to underprivileged families.in afdc place,prwora established temporary assistance to needy families tanf block grants.under the tanf regime,each state receives a predetermined block of tanf funding with which to administer its welfare program.see a.
although prwora provides states significantly more discretion to design and manage their own welfare systems,tanf block grants do not come without strings.rather,to qualify for a tanf block grant,a state child support enforcement program must conform to the specifications of title of the social security act.see a.among other requirements,title requires a participating state to receive approval of its program from the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs.see a.additionally,each state child support enforcement program must use a single state disbursement unit sdu to collect,distribute,and disburse payments.a.
child support payments made to custodial parents who currently receive tanf benefits or previously received tanf benefits are known as title payments.under title,current tanf recipients must assign their child support rights to the state.a.to offset the costs of providing tanf benefits,the state may keep most of the child support payments it collects on behalf of current tanf recipients.see a.former tanf recipients are entitled to a portion of the payments collected,and the size of this portion varies according to the date the parent stopped receiving tanf benefits.a.
child support payments made to custodial parents who have never received tanf benefits are known as payments.custodial parents do not have to assign their child support rights to the state and are thus entitled to receive all collected child support funds.a.if a state court issues an income withholding order in a custodial parent child support case,however,the parent employer must withhold a portion of the parent income and submit it to the sdu.a b a b.accordingly,in child support cases involving an income withholding order,custodial parents child support payments must flow through the sdu.
to oversee this complex program,congress established the office of child support enforcement ocse within the hhs.see a.this agency audits the states compliance with their federally approved plans.a c.if a state does not substantially comply with the requirements of title,the secretary of hhs may penalize the state by reducing its tanf grant by up to five percent.a.the secretary has interpreted substantial compliance as a full compliance with requirements that services be offered statewide and that certain recipients be notified monthly of the support collected,as well as with reporting,recordkeeping,and accounting rules b percent compliance with case opening and case closure criteria and c percent compliance with most remaining program requirements.blessing freestone,d citing.
dhr and aoc role in alabama child support payment system 
dhr administers alabama tanf and title programs.among its various responsibilities,dhr oversees the operation of alabama sdu and collects,distributes,and disburses all title payments.dhr also collects and distributes all payments made pursuant to income withholding orders,and disburses a portion of these payments.
aoc primary function is to oversee the administration of alabama court system.under a contract with dhr,however,aoc also disburses all of the remaining payments.although title requires states to have a single point of disbursement for all child support payments,hhs has authorized dhr practice of disbursing a portion of its payments via aoc.
relevant procedural history 
on december,eight named plaintiffs filed a corrected amended class action complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief amended complaint against dhr and aoc,alleging widespread deficiencies in alabama child support payment system.two additional plaintiffs subsequently intervened.on september,the district court granted summary judgment to dhr and aoc on all of the ten named plaintiffs claims for relief 
only nine of the named plaintiffs have appealed the district court summary judgment order.each remaining appellant falls into one of two categories.first,appellants kimberly arrington,terralisa,carmelitess felder,tanya jackson,sharon scott,rhonda warren,and lakisha woodall the arrington appellants currently or formerly received tanf benefits accordingly,the child support payments they receive constitute title payments disbursed by dhr.second,appellants tammy chapman and jamie codd the chapman appellants have never received tanf benefits,but their child support payments are subject to income withholding orders.the child support payments they receive constitute payments disbursed by aoc.
on appeal,appellants challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to dhr and aoc on their eleventh claim for relief,in which they assert provides them the right,enforceable against dhr and aoc under,to distribution of their payments in strict compliance with additionally,the arrington challenge the district court grant of summary judgment to dhr on their and claims for relief.under these two claims,they contend dhr violated their procedural due process rights by failing to provide them adequate notice of dhr handling of their payments,and their right to and the procedures for requesting a hearing.

iii.analysis 
statutory claim 
appellants contend dhr and aoc have failed to distribute their child support payments in accordance with the requirements set forth in of title seeking redress for dhr and aoc alleged mishandling of their payments,appellants claim gives them a private right,enforceable under,to distribution of their payments in strict compliance with.this issue is one of first impression in our circuit.
legal framework for claims that spending clause legislation creates individual rights enforceable under 
in maine thiboutot,the supreme court established that provides a private cause of action against any person who,acting under color of state law,abridges rights created by the constitution and laws of the united states.see,d see also.one year later,in pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,the supreme court clarified that spending clause legislation is especially unlikely to create individual rights enforceable under.see,d.in legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power,the supreme court reasoned,the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of action for noncompliance but rather action by the federal government to terminate funds to the state.id.
we have previously rejected the assertion that title,as an undifferentiated whole,creates rights enforceable under.in wehunt ledbetter,a group of plaintiffs claimed they possessed an individually enforceable right to have the state of georgia strictly comply with title.see,cir.these plaintiffs did not ground their claim in a specific provision of title rather,they claimed title generally established privately enforceable rights.see id.we held title,in its entirety,does not create individual rights enforceable under,because congress enacted it to immediately lower the cost to the taxpayer as well as to lessen the number of families enrolling in welfare in the to society as a whole rather than specific individuals.id.at.
after a circuit split developed over the issue presented in wehunt,the supreme court settled the matter in blessing freestone,d.the blessing plaintiffs claimed they had an enforceable individual right to have the state of arizona child support program achieve substantial compliance with title requirements.id.at.at.without distinguishing among title various provisions,the ninth circuit held the plaintiffs had such a right.id.at.at.the supreme court reversed the ninth circuit,holding title substantial compliance requirement was not intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents,and therefore it does not constitute a federal right.id.at.at.moreover,the supreme court stated the ninth circuit erred in taking a blanket approach to determining whether title creates rights.id.at.at.only when the complaint is broken down into manageable analytic bites,the supreme court asserted,can a court ascertain whether each separate claim satisfies the various criteria we have set forth for determining whether a federal statute creates rights.id.at.at.
in reaching this holding,the blessing court set forth three prerequisites for establishing that a federal statute confers rights enforceable under.
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
id.at.at citations omitted.however,e ven if a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individual right,there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under.id.at.at.to rebut this presumption,the state must demonstrate congress intended to foreclose a remedy under either expressly,by forbidding recourse to in the statute itself,or impliedly,by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under.id.
in gonzaga university doe,the supreme court clarified the first of blessing three requirements,making clear that only unambiguously conferred rights,as distinguished from mere benefits or interests,are enforceable under.see,d.specifically,the supreme court asserted if a federal statute text and structure provide some indication that congress may have intended to create individual rights,and some indication it may not have,that means congress has not spoken with the requisite clear voice.ambiguity precludes enforceable rights.foster children bush,cir citing gonzaga,at.at.to determine whether congress intended the provisions in question to benefit the plaintiff,a court must weigh three factors whether the statute contains language that is individually focused addresses the needs of individual persons being satisfied instead of having a systemwide or aggregate focus and lacks an enforcement mechanism through which an aggrieved individual can obtain review.id.
gonzaga involved a plaintiff who attempted to bring an action under to enforce provisions of the family educational rights and privacy act of ferpa,which congress enacted pursuant to its spending power.see gonzaga,at.at.ferpa provides in relevant part no funds shall be made available to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of permitting the release of education records of students without the written consent of their parents b.under a,the secretary of education may terminate funding only if the educational agency or institution fails to comply substantially with ferpa requirements.
under the first gonzaga factor,the supreme court determined ferpa does not contain language because it speaks only to the secretary of education,directing the secretary to deny federal funds if the prohibited release of education records takes place.id.at.at.second,the supreme court stated ferpa has an aggregate rather than individual focus,because educational agencies and institutions remain eligible for funding so long as they comply substantially with ferpa on a systemwide,rather than,basis.see id.at.at.the supreme court noted its conclusion on this issue was not unlike blessing,which found that title failed to support a suit in part because it only required substantial compliance with federal regulations.id.third,the supreme court determined ferpa provisions empowering the secretary of education to deal with violations and requiring the secretary to establish a review board constituted an enforcement mechanism for aggrieved individuals.id.at.at.accordingly,the supreme court held all three factors weighed in favor of finding spending legislation drafted in terms resembling those of ferpa can not confer enforceable rights.id.at.at.
we first applied gonzaga analytical framework in foster children.a group of foster children argued d and e of title of the social security act,which pertain to the states case review systems for foster children,provided them rights enforceable under.see foster children,at.enacted under congress spending power,title establishes a program of federal payments to states for foster care and adoption assistance.see id.at.pursuant to d and e,case review system means a procedure for ensuring a child health and education record is reviewed and updated,and supplied to the foster parent or foster care provider with whom the child is placed,at the time of each placement of the child in foster care,and,in the case of certain foster children,the state shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child parents.id.at.
first,even though d and e contain language requiring the state to take certain actions relative to individual foster children,the state shall file a petition,we determined d and e do not have the kind of,language required by gonzaga.see id.at the references to individual children and their placements are made in the context of describing what the procedure is supposed to ensure,and such provisions can not make out the requisite congressional intent to confer individual rights enforceable by.quoting gonzaga,at.at.second,we reasoned the substantial conformity requirement in title is similar to ferpa,which the court in gonzaga concluded showed an aggregate instead of an individual focus.id.citing gonzaga,at.at.third,although we acknowledged title does not contain a comprehensive enforcement scheme,we determined the first two factors point in the other direction and prevent us from saying that congress spoke with a clear voice to unambiguously manifest its intent to create enforceable rights.id.at.accordingly,we held d and e failed under gonzaga analysis and,hence,did not satisfy the first blessing requirement.id.at.
in summary,when a plaintiff claims a statutory provision creates individual rights enforceable under,she must establish all three requirements set forth in blessing.the first blessing requirement instructs us to determine whether congress intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.to decide whether the provision satisfies this first blessing requirement,we must weigh the three factors set forth in gonzaga.specifically,we must consider whether the provision contains individually focused,language has an individual,rather than systemwide or aggregate,focus and lacks an enforcement mechanism for aggrieved individuals.if we determine these three gonzaga factors weigh against a finding that congress intended the provision to benefit the plaintiff,then the provision does not satisfy the first blessing requirement and the plaintiff claim must fail.
application of this legal framework to 
turning to this appeal,we must weigh each of the three gonzaga factors to determine whether satisfies the first requirement of blessing test.if does not satisfy blessing first requirement,then it does not provide appellants with individual rights,enforceable under,to distribution of child support payments in strict compliance with.
individually focused,language 
like the provisions at issue in gonzaga and foster children,does not contain individually focused,language under the first gonzaga factor.in gonzaga,the supreme court pointed to title vi of the civil rights act of and title ix of the education amendments of as examples of explicit language.see at.at.titles vi and ix each provide no person shall be subjected to discrimination.a.according to the supreme court,w here a statute does not include this sort of explicit right or language,we rarely impute to congress an intention to create a private right of action.gonzaga,at.at citing cannon of chicago,d alexander sandoval,d.
the ferpa language addressed in gonzaga speaks only to the secretary of education,instructing the secretary to withhold funds from educational agencies and institutions with prohibited policies and practices it does not speak directly to individual students.id.at.at.therefore,the supreme court concluded ferpa language fell short of the quintessential language found in titles vi and ix.id.similarly,language speaks only to the states,instructing them to distribute child support payments in a certain fashion it does not speak directly to individual custodial parents.thus,the language in both ferpa and is at least one step removed from speaking of individually enforceable private rights,and does not evince titles vi and ix unmistakable focus on the benefitted class.see id.at.at quoting cannon,at.at.in the absence of explicit language,is at best ambiguous.and as gonzaga made clear,a mbiguity precludes enforceable rights.foster children,at citing gonzaga,at.at.
furthermore,our conclusion comports with foster children.sections d and e of title refer to an individual foster child but do so only to describe the case review procedure general mission.id.at.likewise,repeatedly refers to the individual recipient family,but does so only to explain how the state generally must distribute child support funds.moreover,similar to the phrase the state shall file a petition in e,the phrase the state shall permeates and prefaces the procedures by which states must distribute child support funds they collect under title.according to foster children,such language gives an aggregate or system wide focus instead of one that indicates concern with whether the needs of any particular individual are met.id.under gonzaga and foster children,therefore does not contain language,and the first gonzaga factor is not satisfied 
individual,rather than systemwide or aggregate,focus 
as we discussed in part,the supreme court and our circuit have repeatedly held substantial compliance provisions in spending clause legislation are inconsistent with individually enforceable rights.beginning with blessing,the supreme court addressed a,title substantial compliance provision,and concluded far from creating an individual entitlement to services,the substantial compliance standard is simply a yardstick for the secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a state title program.at.at emphasis in original.next,in gonzaga,the supreme court extended blessing reasoning to hold ferpa comply substantially provision indicated an aggregate rather than individual focus under the second gonzaga factor.at.at.in foster children,our circuit determined the substantial conformity requirement at issue was similar to ferpa,which the court in gonzaga concluded showed an aggregate instead of an individual focus.at.
this appeal brings the analysis full circle,requiring us to determine whether title substantial compliance same provision addressed in has a systemwide or aggregate,rather than individual,focus under the second gonzaga factor.based on the precedent set forth in blessing,gonzaga,and foster children,we conclude it does.
lack of an enforcement mechanism for aggrieved individuals 
as for gonzaga third factor,lacks a remedial scheme sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under.nevertheless,the lack of an enforcement mechanism by which an aggrieved individual can obtain review is but one of the factors we consider.id.at.the other two factors counsel in favor of finding congress did not speak with a clear voice to unambiguously manifest its intent to create enforceable rights.id.without such an unambiguous intent,appellants can not satisfy the first requirement of the blessing test.we thus hold does not confer a private right to distribution of child support payments enforceable under the district court did not err in granting dhr and aoc summary judgment on this issue.
constitutional claims procedural due process 
the arrington appellants,all of whom are current or former tanf recipients,contend the notices dhr currently provides do not satisfy the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.first,they argue dhr fails to provide adequate notice pertaining to its collection,distribution,and disbursement of their title child support payments.second,they assert the publicly available statutes,regulations,and agency policy manuals regarding dhr hearing process do not provide adequate notice of their right to a hearing and the procedures for requesting one.
the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides no state shall deprive any person of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law.const.amend xiv.procedural due process rules are meant to protect persons not from the deprivation,but from the mistaken or unjustified deprivation of life,liberty,or property.carey piphus,d.in this circuit,a claim alleging a denial of procedural due process requires proof of three elements a deprivation of a liberty or property interest state action and process.grayden rhodes,cir citing cryder oxendine,cir.dhr involvement in collecting,distributing,and disbursing child support payments constitutes state action under the second element of the grayden test.thus,only the first and third elements are at issue on appeal.
deprivation of a property interest 
under the first element of the grayden test,we must consider whether the arrington appellants have shown not only a property interest,but also a governmental deprivation of that property interest.see grayden,at stating the satisfied the first element of the grayden test because they enjoyed a property interest in continued residency at their apartments and were deprived of that interest upon eviction property interests stem not from the constitution,but from such sources as statutes,regulations,ordinances,and contracts.see bd.of regents of state colls.roth,d.whether these sources create a property interest must be decided by reference to state law.id.at.at.
the alabama courts have determined custodial parents possess a property interest in child support payments.see morgan county dep t of human res,so d,a custodial parent has a property interest in having her child support order paid in full by the parent.thus,we must determine whether the arrington appellants have been deprived of this property interest.
as the district court held,the arrington appellants have failed to adduce evidence that dhr deprived them of their child support payments.in their briefs,the arrington appellants do not point to any evidence in the record suggesting they received less than their full child support payment,endured undue delay in receiving their payments,or had identifiable errors in their payments that dhr failed to correct.at least three times during oral argument,we asked the arrington appellants counsel to direct our attention to such evidence in the record,but he failed to do so.in short,after extensive discovery,the arrington appellants could not produce a scintilla of evidence indicating they suffered a deprivation of their child support payments.thus,they present no genuine issue of material fact regarding whether they were deprived of a property interest,and their procedural due process claims must fail under the first element of the grayden test.
constitutionally inadequate process 
even if the arrington appellants could show a deprivation of their child support payments,however,their procedural due process claims would still fail under the third element of the grayden test.the arrington appellants challenge the adequacy of the notice dhr provides them regarding its handling of their child support payments,and the notice of their right to and the procedures for requesting a hearing.we address each issue in turn.
notice of dhr handling of child support payments 
the arrington appellants argue the monthly notice of child support collections and the perforated stub attached to their monthly child support payment check do not adequately enable them to determine the timing and accuracy of their child support payments.specifically,they contend these monthly notices lack vital information about their payments and explanations which will allow a parent to understand the distribution of each child support collection and to identify possible errors in distribution and delays in disbursement.without these details and explanations,the arrington appellants argue,title custodial parents have no way of discerning whether dhr has erroneously deprived them of their child support payments.
to determine what type of notice is adequate to satisfy the due process clause,we apply the test set forth in mullane central hanover bank trust.see dusenbery united states,d grayden,at under the mullane standard,notice must be reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.mullane,at.at.due process is a flexible concept that varies with the particular circumstances of each case,and myriad forms of notice may satisfy the mullane standard.see grayden,at.our task is not to determine whether the notice the arrington appellants request would be ideal under all the circumstances,but rather whether the notice they currently receive is reasonable under all the circumstances.
section of title requires states to provide title custodial parents notice on a monthly basis of the amount of the support payments collected.accordingly,dhr mails the monthly notice of child support collections to title custodial parents.these notices contain five columns listing the parent name,court order,amount paid to current,amount paid to arrears,and amount paid to family.
based on this information,custodial parents can confirm dhr accurately recorded the parent child support payment amount by comparing the dollar figure appearing on their court with the dollar figure appearing under the amount paid to current column.to then determine what amount if any dhr withheld as reimbursement for tanf funds,they can check the dollar figure appearing under the amount paid to arrears column.finally,they can ensure they received the amount dhr purportedly owed by comparing the amount appearing on their payment check stub with the dollar amount appearing in the amount paid to family column.
if custodial parents still have questions or concerns after reviewing their monthly notice of child support collections,the payment check stub reminds them to contact dhr,automated voice response hotline or visit dhr web page for additional information.dhr hotline not only provides custodial parents with updated balance information,but also gives them the option to speak directly with a child support worker at dhr customer service unit csu.parents may also directly call,fax,write,or visit the csu during regular business hours for information and assistance.additionally,custodial parents may contact the csu or visit dhr website to obtain a copy of their court order payment summary,which provides a summary of their payments and includes detailed information about the timing and accuracy of these payments 
the monthly notice of child support with the payment check stub,the hotline,the csu,and the court order payment title custodial parents ample information with which to determine whether they have received their full child support payments in a timely manner.considering all the circumstances,we conclude dhr monthly notices are reasonably calculated to inform custodial parents of the action dhr has taken with regard to their child support payments.accordingly,the arrington appellants procedural due process claim with respect to dhr notice fails.
notice of the right to and the procedures for requesting a hearing 
the arrington appellants also contend the due process clause requires dhr to provide them individualized,contemporaneous notice of their right to a hearing and the procedures for obtaining one.specifically,they assert either the notice of child support collections or the payment check stub should include a statement informing title custodial parents of not only their right to an administrative hearing,but also the procedure for initiating such a hearing.
in response,dhr points to the public availability of alabama statutes,administrative rules,and agency policy manuals,which set forth the procedures for pursuing administrative remedies.according to dhr,the supreme court holding in city of west covina perkins,d,establishes these publicly available sources,standing alone,provide adequate contemporaneous notice of custodial parents right to,and the procedures for,requesting a hearing.
in grayden,we applied west covina to a procedural due process claim for the first time.at.grayden involved a group of tenants who claimed the city violated their procedural due process rights when a city code enforcement officer condemned their apartment complex and evicted them from their apartments.id.at.the condemnation notices posted on the tenants doors stated they had hours to vacate the premises,but did not inform them of their right to a hearing or the procedures for requesting one.id.at.although the city argued a city code section provided tenants adequate contemporaneous notice of their right to a hearing,the tenants asserted the due process clause entitled them to individualized notice.see id.at.
we began by noting f or one hundred years,the supreme court has declared that a publicly available statute may be sufficient to provide notice because individuals are presumptively charged with knowledge of such a statute.grayden,at citing reetz michigan.laramie land hoffman.texaco,short,d atkins parker,d.this line of cases,we asserted,culminated in the supreme court acknowledgment in west covina that notice of the right to a hearing can be provided by published,generally available statutes and case law,public sources,any publicly available document,and documents accessible to the public.see id.at citing west covina,at.at.we read west covina,moreover,as making clear that the sophistication of the affected individuals and the health and safety implications of the deprivation,standing alone,are not sufficient to impose an affirmative notice obligation on government officials.id.at based on this precedent,we determined the city made a compelling argument that the city code section,standing alone,provides contemporaneous notice to the tenants of their right to challenge the condemnation order and thus satisfies due process.id.at.
yet,our analysis did not end there.w hile west covina repudiates a general rule that the government always must provide affirmative notice of the right to and procedures for requesting a hearing,west covina does not stand for the converse proposition that statutory notice is always sufficient to satisfy due process.id.at.accordingly,we held the mullane standard still required us to consider whether,in light of all the circumstances,the city code was reasonably calculated to inform the tenants of their procedural rights.id.at.in conducting our mullane analysis,we recognized there is no presumption that all of the citizens actually know all of the law all of the time and citizens must educate themselves about the law before they can wield the rights dedicated to them under it.id.considering the tenants had less than hours to vacate their homes,make alternate arrangements for shelter,work,and school,and locate and read the city code section pertaining to hearings,we held the city code section,standing alone,was not reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to inform the tenants of their administrative remedies.id.
here,alabama statutes,regulations,and publicly available agency manuals provide custodial parents notice of their right to a hearing and the procedures for obtaining one.first,the alabama administrative procedure act aapa provide s a minimum procedural code for the operation of all state agencies when they take action affecting the rights and duties of the public.a.among the aapa basic procedural protections is the guarantee,i n a contested case,that all parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice in writing.a.as part of the alabama code,the aapa is publicly available at a variety of locations.see.
second,the alabama department of human resources child support division administrative code the administrative code sets forth the rules and procedures governing hearings related to dhr administration of title.see.admin.code.the administrative code stipulates a custodial parent request for a hearing must be filed in writing within days following the action or inaction with which he is dissatisfied or days following the claimant learning of said action.admin.code.it also sets forth the information custodial parents must provide and the format they must follow in their written request for a hearing.admin.code.under the aapa,dhr must keep a permanent register of its administrative rules open to public inspection.a.thus,the administrative code is publicly available.
third,dhr has adopted a child support policy and procedures manual csppm,which contains a section devoted to educating dhr employees about the agency administrative hearing policy.under alabama law,the csppm is available to the public.see every citizen has a right to inspect and take a copy of any public writing of th e state.similar to the city code section at issue in grayden,the relevant provisions of the aapa,administrative code,and csppm combine to notify title custodial parents of their right to a hearing and the procedures for obtaining one.
as in grayden,however,we can not end our analysis here.rather,under the mullane standard,we must also consider the adequacy,under all the circumstances,of this notice.unlike the tenants in grayden,alabama custodial parents have significantly more than hours to locate the relevant public documents and invoke their right to a hearing.from the time a custodial parent learns dhr has erroneously deprived her of a child support payment,to the time her right to a hearing expires,she has days in which to locate and read the statutes,regulations,and publicly available documents discussed above,and submit a written request for a hearing.we conclude this window constitutes a reasonable amount of time under the mullane standard.
moreover,dhr offers services to help custodial parents educate themselves about their right to a hearing and the procedures for requesting one.when dhr opens a child support case,for example,it sends the custodial parent a document entitled a child support client basic rights.among other things,this document alerts custodial parents to their right t o request a departmental hearing regarding actions in their case.custodial parents can also contact the csu to learn how to invoke this right if they suffer a deprivation of their child support payments.because the csu social workers must provide custodial parents a written statement concerning the right to appeal,and the methods by which these rights may be exercised when requested.admin.code,they can obtain the requisite information directly from dhr without having to research alabama statutes,regulations,and agency policy manuals independently.
in summary,custodial parents receive notice of their right to a hearing upon enrolling in dhr child support system can learn more about this right by calling the csu and have days after learning of a deprivation of their child support payments in which to locate and read the statutes,regulations,and public documents pertaining to dhr hearing process.based on these surrounding circumstances,we hold the relevant provisions of the aapa,administrative code,and csppm are reasonably calculated to provide custodial parents contemporaneous notice of their right to and the procedures for requesting a hearing.the arrington appellants procedural due process claim therefore also fails on this issue,and the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to dhr.
iv.conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,we conclude the district court did not err when it granted summary judgment to dhr and aoc.when congress enacted of title,it did not speak with a clear voice to unambiguously manifest an intent to create enforceable rights.pursuant to the precedent set forth in blessing,gonzaga,and foster children,appellants have thus failed as a matter of law to establish provides custodial parents individual rights,enforceable under,to distribution of their payments in strict compliance with.furthermore,under the standard set forth in grayden,the arrington appellants have failed as a matter of law to show a violation of their procedural due process rights.
for simplicity sake,we will refer to walley as dhr and helms as aoc.
although the named plaintiffs sought certification of their case as a class action,the district court ruled on the summary judgment motions before it considered the class certification issue.
to be precise,some of the arrington appellants received benefits under the afdc program,which prwora abolished and replaced with tanf.for purposes of simplicity,we refer to afdc payments as tanf payments.
the appellants eleventh claim for relief provides in relevant part plaintiff custodial parents who receive title services have a right under federal law to distribution of support as specified in and.if the statute at issue does not create rights enforceable under,then neither do the regulations adopted under that statute.harris james,cir.as explained below,we hold does not create enforceable rights under.thus,we need not address whether creates rights enforceable under.
the district court held the chapman appellants lacked standing to bring their procedural due process claims against aoc,and they failed to contest this holding on appeal.the party who invokes federal jurisdiction must establish that it has standing to assert its claim.alliance for the mentally ill,johns bd.of county comm rs,cir.in national alliance for the mentally ill,the district court held the failed to establish they had standing to sue.id.although federal rule of appellate procedure a a provides an appellant brief must contain appellant contentions and the reasons for them,with citations to the authorities and parts of the record on which the appellant relies,two of the neglected to cite anything in the record establishing their standing.id.at.accordingly,we stated the court has warned litigants that failure to comply with rule a a of the federal rules of appellate procedure may result in waiver or abandonment of issues on appeal.because the have not satisfied rule a a,the court deems them to have waived any claim concerning their individual.at citation omitted.similarly,the chapman appellants failed to satisfy rule a a by neither expressly arguing they have standing nor citing a single case or record excerpt to contradict the district court holding.in the statement of the issues section of their brief,the chapman appellants ask whether the district court erred when it held they lacked standing to sue aoc for allegedly violating their procedural due process rights.instead of pursuing the standing issue in the argument section,however,they merely reiterate their substantive claims.therefore,the chapman appellants violated rule a a with regard to establishing their standing.under national alliance for th
