this appeal concerns the scope of the antiattachment provision of the social security act the act,a.see.state dep t of soc.health servs.guardianship estate of keffeler,d describing a as the act antiattachment provision.section a states in relevant part that none of the moneys paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution,levy,attachment,garnishment,or other legal process.in robbins debuono,cir,our court held that it was a violation of a for new york state,when making certain medicaid eligibility determinations,to attribute the social security benefits of an institutionalized spouse to his or her community spouse,because this attribution effectively coerces the couple into using the benefits on behalf of the community spouse id.at.in our court view,such attribution subjected the institutionalized spouse social security benefits to other legal process within the meaning of a.see id.at.after our decision in robbins,new york stopped attributing the social security benefits of institutionalized spouses to community spouses.however,new york reverted to its prior practice after the supreme court issued an opinion in keffeler,which discussed at length the meaning of the term other legal process in a.
michael and lucy wojchowski contend that keffeler does not undermine our conclusion in robbins that the attribution of an institutionalized spouse social security benefits to a community spouse violates the act antiattachment provision.the commissioner of the new york state department of health and the commissioner of the monroe county department of health and human services argue that the analysis and outcome in robbins are inconsistent with keffeler interpretation of the antiattachment provision.we conclude that robbins holding can not survive and that new york attribution of an institutionalized spouse social security benefits to a community spouse does not violate a.
background 
medicaid budgeting and new york policy 
medicaid,which is jointly funded by the federal and state governments,is a medical assistance program authorized to pay for necessary medical care for those eligible individuals whose income and resources do not allow them to meet the costs of their medical needs.robbins,at quoting golf state dep t of soc.the new york state department of health doh,in conjunction with local social services agencies,administers medicaid in new york id.
medicaid covers,inter alia,nursing home care for medically needy older people who become eligible by incurring medical expenses that reduce their monthly income and assets below prescribed levels.in re estate of tomeck.as part of the medicaid catastrophic coverage act of mcca,congress established a complex set of standards governing the allocation of resources between the spouse residing in a nursing home the institutionalized spouse and the spouse residing in the community the community spouse.id.at,see.dep t of health family servs.blumer,d robbins,at.the purpose of these spousal impoverishment provisions was to protect community spouses from pauperization while preventing financially secure couples from obtaining medicaid assistance.blumer,at.quoting,pt,at,as reprinted in,see also robbins,at tomeck,at.
to that end,congress directed the states to establish a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance for each community spouse.d see blumer,at.robbins,at see also soc.serv.law h establishing new york allowance formula.this minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance mmmna is an amount deemed sufficient for the community spouse to live at a modest level after the institutionalized spouse becomes eligible for medicaid,subject to a statutory floor and ceiling.tomeck,at.congress also mandated that f or purposes of establishing the institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility,a portion of the couple assets is reserved for the benefit of the community spouse.blumer,at.footnote omitted citing c.this reserved share is known as the community spouse resource allowance csra.f see also soc.serv.law d defining new york csra formula.all of the institutionalized spouse countable resources and the community spouse countable resources exceeding the csra may be used to pay for nursing home care,and must be spent down in order for the institutionalized spouse to qualify for medicaid.tomeck,at.
the mcca provides for a fair hearing mechanism through which a couple may challenge the state determination of a number of elements that affect eligibility for,or the extent of assistance provided under,medicaid.blumer,at.citing e see also soc.serv.law setting forth new york fair hearing procedure.as relevant to the instant case,e c specifically provides that 
i f either the institutionalized or community spouse establishes that the csra in relation to the amount of income generated by such allowance is inadequate to raise the community spouse income to the mmmna,there shall be substituted for the csra under subsection f of this section,an amount adequate to provide the mmmna.
thus,in new york,either spouse can request a fair hearing at which a doh hearing officer may set a csra above the statutory amount to enable the assets to generate enough income to raise the community spouse income to the level of the mmmna.robbins,at see soc.serv.law c.
medicaid benefits may not be withheld from the institutionalized spouse in the event the community spouse declines to make spousal resources available to pay for medical expenses.tomeck,at,citing c and soc.serv.law a,b.under new york law,the state may recover from the community spouse the cost of medicaid assistance provided to the institutionalized spouse,if the community spouse has sufficient income and resources to provide medical assistance but such income and resources are not available because of the refusal or failure of the community spouse to provide the necessary care and assistance.soc.serv.law a discussing the creation of an implied contract between a responsible relative and the state in such circumstances.in the support recovery action contemplated by these statutes,the state may recover the cost of medicaid benefits paid for the care of the institutionalized spouse to the extent that the community spouse has available resources above the csra.comm r of dep t of soc.servs.of the city of spellman,app,see also tomeck,at,noting that the community spouse countable resources exceeding the csra may be used to pay for nursing home care emphasis added.thus,the higher the csra,the less the state can subsequently recover from a community spouse in a support recovery action.
new york applies an income first policy in determining whether a community spouse is entitled to an increase in her csra.robbins,at.see generally blumer,at.explaining the difference between and policies.this approach deems or attributes income from the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse.thus,the csra goes up only if the community spouse monthly income,including any sums that the institutionalized spouse is allowed to provide,still falls short of the mmmna.tomeck,at,see robbins,at.whether or not the institutionalized spouse contributes his excess income to his spouse,the state may sue the community spouse to recover the excess assets that the community spouse would otherwise use to generate income.robbins,at.
the question presented in the instant case is whether a prohibits new york from attributing an institutionalized spouse social security benefits to a community spouse when calculating the community spouse csra in robbins,we held that application of new york policy to social security benefits was a violation of a subsequent guidance from the supreme court requires us to revisit that holding.see boothe hammock,cir stating that our court was obliged to reassess its earlier holdings in light of an intervening supreme court decision.
factual and procedural background of the instant case 
the following facts are taken from the wojchowskis complaint and the documents referred to therein.we accept these facts as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the wojchowskis favor.see,mccarthy dun bradstreet,cir in reviewing a motion to dismiss under.b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted,we accept as true all factual statements alleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party.
the wojchowskis are a married couple living in monroe county,new york.at the time this action was commenced in october,wojchowski the institutionalized spouse for medicaid purposes was years old and resided in a nursing home.wojchowski the community spouse for medicaid purposes was years and resided in the couple marital home.wojchowski became her husband pursuant to a durable general power of attorney dated november.
in december,an application for medicaid was filed on wojchowski behalf with the division of social services dss of the monroe county department of human and health services.wojchowski filed a spousal refusal statement with the medicaid application,indicating that she would not make her assets available for her husband medical care.the dss issued a notice of decision on february.the dss determined that wojchowski was eligible for medicaid assistance in light of the spousal refusal statement,but that wojchowski had approximately of resources in excess of her csra,which in was.
the wojchowskis requested a fair hearing to increase wojchowski csra.they argued that wojchowski should be permitted to retain all of her assets in order to generate enough investment income to make up the shortfall between her personal monthly income and the applicable mmmna.administrative law judge alj john herriman issued a decision after fair hearing on october.alj herriman determined that wojchowski was entitled to an mmmna of and that her countable income,after deductions for health insurance premiums,was only per month.applying new york policy over wojchowski objection,alj herriman then attributed wojchowski social security benefits among other forms of income to his wife.plaintiffs allege that with this attribution,wojchowski income was less than the mmmna without this attribution,her income would have been approximately less than the mmmna.these calculations led alj herriman to conclude that while wojchowski was entitled to an increase in her csra that would generate of income per month,she was not entitled to retain all of her assets.alj herriman remanded the matter to the local social services district to calculate the precise increase.according to the wojchowskis,
whatever ultimately might be determined to be the amount of the csra increase,it will be about half what it would be if wojchowski social security benefits had not been taken into account.in turn,the amount of wojchowski resources subject to the support claim the dss could make against her will be inflated by the difference in the csra increase resulting from automatically her husband social security.
appellants br.in other words,if the state brings a support recovery action against wojchowski,fewer of her assets will be sheltered as her csra than would be the case if wojchowski social security benefits had not been attributed to her.
the wojchowskis then commenced this action against defendants,seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.they claimed,inter alia,that the attribution of wojchowski social security benefits to wojchowski violated a,because it subjected the benefits to other legal process.defendants moved to dismiss pursuant to.b,arguing in relevant part that application of new york policy to social security benefits during a fair hearing does not subject those benefits to other legal process within the meaning of a and thus is not prohibited.
the district court granted the motion to dismiss.it first observed that our court in robbins had held that automatic allocation of an institutionalized spouse social security benefits to the other spouse for purposes of determining the spouse income violated section a.wojchowski novello,wl,at july.but the district court then stated that the rationale upon which robbins was based was undermined by the more recent supreme court d ecision in keffeler.id.in light of the very narrow meaning given to a by keffeler,the district court concluded that 
b ecause the process of allocating wojchowski social security benefits to wojchowski for purposes of determining her income does not actually effect a taking of his benefits,nor wrest control over his benefits,the defendants practice of considering wojchowski benefits in determining wojchowski income does not constitute the use of other legal process as that term is used in the provision of the social security act,a,and therefor e,does not violate that provision.
id.a final judgment was entered on july.the wojchowskis timely appealed,arguing that robbins holding with respect to the act antiattachment provision remains good law in spite of keffeler.
discussion 
we review de novo the district court grant of defendants motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.see,peay ajello,cir.dismissal under.b is appropriate where,even if all of the allegations contained in a complaint are true,a claim fails as a matter of law.see,dow jones,int l sec,cir.
while as a general rule,one panel of this court can not overrule a prior decision of another panel,an exception to this general rule arises where there has been an intervening supreme court decision that casts doubt on our controlling precedent.meacham knolls atomic power,cir alteration and ellipsis in original quoting union of needletrades,indus.textile employees ins,cir.moreover,the intervening decision need not address the precise issue already decided by our court.union of needletrades,indus.textile employees,at.we agree with the district court that our holding in robbins was based on an interpretation of the social security act antiattachment provision that is inconsistent with the supreme court reading of a in keffeler.we therefore conclude that robbins holding concerning the scope of a is no longer good law and under keffeler,new york policy as applied to social security benefits does not violate a.
in robbins,our court began its analysis by noting that application of new york policy clearly did not execute on,levy,attach,or garnish the institutionalized spouse social security benefits.at.the dispositive question,therefore,was whether the benefits were subject to other legal process within the meaning of a.see id.at.the court set forth the following principles to guide its consideration of this question 
we have employed an expansive definition of legal process,kriegbaum katz,cir,which embrace s not only the use of formal legal machinery but also resort to express or implied threats and sanctions,fetterusso state of new york,cir.
our court then concluded that new york application of its policy to social security benefits violated a because it constituted a form of administrative coercion that limited a social security recipient discretionary authority over how to spend the benefits and there existed the prospect of a fair hearing and the threat of a support recovery action to give this coercion effect.see robbins,at.we found that the policy was coercive because it effectively compelled the community spouse acting as for the institutionalized spouse to spend the institutionalized spouse social security benefits on herself,rather than on the institutionalized spouse needs 
the community spouse,who has the institutionalized spouse power of attorney,has control over his check.if she pays over his social security benefits for his current care rather than applying them to her own needs,her future will be jeopardized because the dss will sue to obtain the assets she will need for her support in the future t he effect of the state policy in question is to force the to exercise that discretion in favor of herself.
see id.at fifth and sixth alterations in the original internal quotation marks omitted we further found that,even though the plaintiffs in robbins had not requested a fair hearing,the prospect of a fair hearing and the threat of a support recovery action sufficed to establish legal process under a 
t he use of express or implied threats falls within the meaning of legal process for purposes of section.because new york policy,which is implemented bo
