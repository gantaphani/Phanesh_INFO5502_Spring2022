we consider here whether an administrative law judge alj adjudicating a dispute over entitlement to benefits pursuant to the terms of an agreement between an enrollee and a medicare choice provider under medicare part c has statutory authority to hear a state law contract claim for damages independent of the alj determination of the enrollee entitlement to benefits pursuant to the agreement.we hold that an alj lacks statutory authority to entertain such a claim,and that the alj here properly declined to hear matthews claim for breach of contract damages.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york john curtin,judge awarding the secretary of health and human services the secretary judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c and dismissing plaintiffs claims.
we recount only those facts of the case that are necessary for resolution of this appeal.
william matthews,now deceased,was a medicare beneficiary enrolled in a medicare choice plan called senior choice,which was administered by excellus health plan,during the period between october,and march,matthews was hospitalized on three separate occasions,each of which was followed by a stay at a skilled nursing facility snf.see defining skilled nursing and skilled rehabilitation services.the first instance of hospitalization occurred on september,when matthews,who was suffering from septic arthritis with osteomyelitis,was admitted to buffalo general hospital.he was discharged on october,after having had a toe removed,and transferred to the hamburg health care snf,where he received treatment until october.the second instance of hospitalization occurred on october,when matthews was again admitted to buffalo general hospital,this time with dehydration and gastroenteritis.on november,he was discharged and transferred to garden gate manor snf.
on december,while at garden gate manor snf,matthews was informed by senior choice that it had made an organization determination that as of december,his stay at garden gate manor snf would no longer be covered because he would soon meet his rehabilitation goals.under the applicable regulations,such an organization determination regarding entitlement to benefits was binding unless reconsideration was sought.see repealed organization determinations binding unless reconsideration sought currently applicable analogous provision see also repealed providing right to seek reconsideration of organization determinations currently applicable analogous provision 
on december,matthews son sought expedited reconsideration,see repealed providing for expedited reconsideration a currently applicable analogous provision,with respect to matthews entitlement to snf services,and senior choice denied the request.matthews request for reconsideration was instead processed in the ordinary course,and on january,senior choice affirmed its decision to deny coverage.
the regulation that governed reconsideration of organization determinations also provided for mandatory review by the health care financing administration hcfa,see note,ante,of an adverse organization determination that had been upheld on reconsideration.see b repealed see also a currently applicable provision that mandates review by an independent,outside entity that contracts with centers for medicare and medicaid services.after senior choice denied matthews claim on reconsideration,his file was forwarded to the center for health dispute resolution chdr,an independent,entity under contract with the hcfa to provide automatic review on behalf of the hcfa.by letter dated april,the chdr notified matthews that it had reviewed his case file and that it had upheld the decision of senior choice to terminate matthews coverage for his stay at garden gate manor snf.
after an enrollee case was reviewed by the hcfa or its designee,he was entitled to a hearing before an alj if he remained aggrieved and there was a sufficient amount in controversy.see repealed a currently applicable analogous provision.on june,matthews wrote to chdr requesting a hearing before an alj.there is no indication in the record that a hearing before an alj was ever held in the wake of matthews request or that any further action was taken by the parties with respect to that request.
matthews third hospitalization occurred when he fell at his home,the day after being discharged from garden gate manor snf.he was taken to the lakeshore hospital emergency room for evaluation and then transferred to buffalo general hospital to be treated for a fractured wrist.on december,matthews was released and transferred to a third at he received physical and occupational therapy.on february,senior choice sent matthews a letter,informing him that pursuant to the terms of the senior choice subscriber agreement the subscriber agreement,which capped his snf coverage at days per spell of illness,he would exhaust that coverage as of february.matthews was not discharged until march,by which time he had spent days in the snf following the exhaustion of his coverage.
matthews requested reconsideration of senior choice determination that his snf coverage was exhausted.he conceded that he had spent the covered days in snfs during one spell of illness,but claimed that he was entitled to additional coverage because senior choice forced matthews to return home from his earlier stay at the garden gate manor snf before he was physically ready,which had,according to matthews,caused him to fall at his home and to require the third period of hospitalization and snf care.letter of damon gruber to rebecca ritchie,march,at.
senior choice upheld its denial of coverage on april.chdr reviewed senior choice decision and affirmed the denial of coverage on june.on july,matthews sought a hearing before an alj,claiming that a premature discharge from garden gate nursing home directly resulted in a fall and fractured wrist,requiring readmission to a hospital on december,and nursing home on december,prolonging matthews recuperation and forcing him to exhaust his day limitation of coverage,which,but for the discharge,would not have happened.letter of william berry to the chdr,july,at.
alj verner love of the social security administration office of hearings and appeals held a hearing on november.the alj repeatedly noted that matthews seemed to be asserting a medical malpractice claim and that a hearing before an alj was not an appropriate forum in which to advance such a claim.matthews counsel agreed that he could not pursue a malpractice claim before the alj,but argued that even though senior choice had satisfied the plain terms of its subscriber agreement by providing the full days of snf coverage required,that senior choice nevertheless breached its subscriber agreement because it improperly cut off matthews coverage when he had been at the garden gate manor snf,thereby causing him to be prematurely released,to fall,to be reinjured and to require additional snf care.
on april,the alj issued a decision in which he considered and rejected matthew argument that senior choice should be held responsible for the cost of the additional days that matthews had spent at gardens at manhattan snf because senior choice had allegedly provoked matthews prior,premature discharge from the garden gate manor snf.the alj concluded that senior choice had satisfied its obligations to matthews under the requirements of the medicare choice program and the subscriber agreement.the alj also noted that 
n either the further issue of careless negligence or unauthorized action on the part of senior choice in discharging the beneficiary from the garden gate manor on december,nor the issue of the forseeability of the alleged consequences thereof,is within the jurisdiction of this forum.these issues,in the nature of medical malpractice and any alleged damages arising therefrom,are appropriate to the civil courts of general jurisdiction.
in re william matthews,decision,at soc.sec.admin.office of hr gs and appeals.
on june,matthews sought appellate review by the medicare appeals council of the department of health and human services,see any party to a hearing,including the medicare choice organization,who is dissatisfied with the alj hearing decision,may request that the medicare appeals council review the alj decision or dismissal,which denied the request for review in a letter dated february.
matthews then filed an action in the united states district court for the western district of new york pursuant to g,contending that the alj erred in declining to exercise jurisdiction over common law breach of contract issues,compl,matthews theory that senior choice had breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the subscriber agreement by allegedly causing matthews premature release from the garden gate manor snf,see,state street bank and trust inversiones errazuriz limitada,cir under new york law,a covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied in all contracts.internal quotation marks omitted and that the secretary decision was not supported by substantial evidence,compl.defendant secretary moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure c,and the district court granted that motion in a thoughtful and careful opinion dated april.the district court found that although the alj never explicitly addressed matthews implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing contract law theory in his written decision,the alj made clear that he had considered all of the arguments that matthews counsel advanced,which included the argument that senior choice had denied matthews benefits to which he was entitled under the subscriber agreement with respect to his stay at gardens at manhattan snf by allegedly prematurely terminating coverage for his stay at the garden gate manor snf.the court also rejected the contention that the alj erred in failing to exercise jurisdiction over plaintiffs independent breach of contract claim for damages.in addition,the district court determined that substantial evidence supported the alj decision 
on appeal,matthews son and matthews estate collectively,the estate do not argue that senior choice provided coverage for fewer than the days required by the express terms of the subscriber agreement.instead,contending that senior choice breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in contracts under new york law,the estate urges that the alj should have assumed jurisdiction over matthews independent breach of contract action for virtually liquidated contract damages namely,the cost of days of additional skilled nursing care beyond the days,directly caused by the breach.appellants br.at.moreover,the estate maintains that there was not substantial evidence to support the alj determination.
we find that substantial evidence supported the alj decision of april,because the record plainly reveals,as the alj found,that plaintiff exhausted his limit for snf coverage during a single spell of illness.see g obliging a district court to abide by any factual finding of the secretary if supported by substantial evidence 
with respect to the estate claim that the district court improperly concluded that the alj did not err in declining to exercise jurisdiction over matthew independent breach of contract claim for damages,we hold that an alj has no statutory authority to entertain a state law breach of contract claim for damages,and we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
the estate maintains that g authorized the alj to hear the state law contract claim for damages.according to that provision,a n enrollee with a medicare choice plan who is dissatisfied by reason of the enrollee failure to receive any health service to which the enrollee believes the enrollee is entitled and at no greater charge than the enrollee believes the enrollee is required to pay is entitled,if the amount in controversy is or more,to a hearing before the secretary to the same extent as is provided in section b of this title.section b of title empowers the commissioner of social security to hold a hearing to make findings of fact and decisions as to the rights of any individual applying for a payment under this subchapter.that provision also grants the commissioner the authority to administer oaths and affirmations,examine witnesses,and receive evidence,and provides that e vidence may be received at any hearing before the commissioner of social security even though inadmissable under the rules of evidence applicable to court procedure.b.
the authority of an alj is circumscribed by the appointing agency enabling statutes and its regulations.in re marion citrus mental health ctr.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,no,decision at dep t of health and human servs.departmental appeals bd,see also bodimetric health,aetna life,cir a party can not avoid the medicare act jurisdictional bar simply by styling its attack as a claim for collateral damages instead of a challenge to the underlying denial of benefits.the estate points to no statement in the applicable statutory or regulatory scheme that empowers an alj to hear a state law breach of contract claim for damages.
the estate contends that because g provides that an alj may adjudicate an enrollee claim of entitlement to any health service,an alj can hear a breach of contract claim for damages.although the statutory language to which the estate refers presumably empowers an alj to determine,as the alj did here,whether a medicare part c enrollee is entitled to particular supplemental benefits under the terms of his agreement with his undertaking that may involve the application of state contract law does not provide for the adjudication by the alj of a state law breach of contract action for damages that is independent of the alj determination of entitlement to benefits under the terms of the applicable agreement.
the statutory framework plainly does not contemplate the litigation of ordinary state law causes of action for damages before aljs.for example,nothing in the statute provides that an alj may convene a jury.under new york law,a party is entitled to have a jury trial on a breach of contract claim for damages.see motor vehicle mfrs.ass of the state,a ll cases afforded a jury trial under the common law prior to come within the present constitutional guarantee of a jury trial in article i,of the new york constitution.see also atlas roofing occupational safety and health review comm n,d s uits for damages for breach of contract were suits at common law with the issues of the making of the contract and its breach to be decided by a jury.in addition,b expressly provides for the admission of evidence that would not be admissible in a court proceeding in any hearing before the commissioner emphasis added.it would be an anomalous result that a litigant could entirely sidestep the rules of evidence by asserting his breach of contract claim for damages before an alj,rather than bringing it in a court of competent jurisdiction.
for the foregoing reasons,we hold that an alj is not vested with authority to hear an ordinary breach of contract claim for damages independent of his determination of entitlement to benefits pursuant to the terms of a medicare choice agreement under medicare part 
we have considered all the estate arguments on appeal and find each of them to be without merit.accordingly,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
