wcab case nos,
labor code section,subdivision c provides that the california permanent disability rating schedule rating schedule is prima facie evidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to an employee injury in a workers compensation case.the core issue presented here is what showing is required by an employee who contests a scheduled rating on the basis that the employee diminished future earning capacity is different than the earning capacity used to arrive at the scheduled rating because we can not conclude on this record whether ogilvie effectively rebutted application of the rating schedule,we reverse the decision of the workers compensation appeals board wcab,annul the award of benefits to ogilvie,and remand for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
factual and procedural background 
ogilvie worked for the city and county of san francisco ccsf as a muni bus driver for years.on april,the bus ogilvie was driving broke down and needed to be towed back to the repair yard.ogilvie rode inside the bus while it was being towed.as a result of being jostled about during the ride,ogilvie hurt her back and right knee.after the condition of her knee continued to deteriorate,ogilvie underwent knee replacement surgery in may.a spine surgeon had also recommended that ogilvie undergo spinal fusion surgery,but ogilvie declined.she never returned to work.she filed for workers compensation benefits.
roughly three years after her injury,ogilvie applied for a disability retirement.in reviewing her application,the retirement office told ogilvie that taking a service retirement,rather than disability retirement,would be a better financial decision.so she took it.around this time,two qualified medical examiners,one selected by ogilvie and one selected by the ccsf,evaluated ogilvie to determine her permanent disability rating.as a compromise between the two medical examiners evaluations,the parties stipulated before the workers compensation judge 
in a trial before the wcj,ogilvie sought to rebut the percent scheduled rating.each party submitted an estimate of ogilvie diminished future earning capacity from a vocational rehabilitation expert who essentially compared ogilvie earnings before her injury with what she could be expected to earn after it.each expert considered his evaluation to be superior to the scheduled rating because he considered such things as ogilvie education,skills,motivation,local job market conditions,work history,and vocational testing in arriving at ogilvie loss of earning capacity.ogilvie contended that the opinions of both experts effectively rebutted the application of the scheduled rating and supported her claim to a permanent disability rating greater than percent.the wcj agreed based on the fact that the permanent disability indemnity associated with the percent rating was less than ogilvie actual diminished future earning capacity calculated by either vocational expert since a scheduled award of benefits would not sufficiently compensate ogilvie for her diminished future earning capacity,the wcj set about devising an alternative way to calculate ogilvie award.the wcj employed three different methodologies after considering these methodologies,the wcj settled upon a final permanent disability rating of percent after taking into account ogilvie prior and injuries.the ccsf filed a petition for reconsideration.
proceedings before the wcab 
on february,the wcab issued its en banc decision holding that ogilvie could rebut the diminished future earning capacity adjustment table that is part of the rating schedule referenced in section.the wcab reasoned that because the rating schedule is prima facie evidence of an injured employee disability,the diminished future earning capacity adjustment table must be rebuttable.but the wcab also observed that the diminished future earning capacity adjustment must be rebutted in a manner that comports with section.none of the methodologies used by the wcj were consistent with section,because none used a numeric formula based on empirical data and findings as section requires instead,the wcab created a new methodology that it considered consistent with section,and was intended to replicate the empirically based method used in the rand study that established the diminished future earning capacity adjustment in the rating schedule 
a dissenting member of the wcab concluded that the proper way for an injured employee to rebut the rating schedule would be to rely upon the percentage of lost future earning capacity determined by expert witnesses.the dissent supported its position by saying this approach is in line with the common practice of courts to use such experts to determine earning capacity in civil cases.the majority rejected the dissent methodology as subjective,nonempirical,and bear ing absolutely no relationship to the statutory scheme outlined in section,subdivision b 
on rehearing,the wcab clarified and affirmed its february,decision.in early october,both ogilvie and the ccsf filed the petitions for writ of review that are now before this court.while neither party is happy with the wcab decision,each party is unhappy for slightly different reasons.although ogilvie agrees that one means to rebut the rating schedule may be to challenge the diminished future earning capacity adjustment table,she asserts that another is to challenge the final overall permanent disability rating,which,she asserts,is most accurately done using vocational experts.the ccsf asserts that the wcab exceeded its authority when it allowed ogilvie to challenge the diminished future earning capacity adjustment table at all.since the diminished future earning capacity is defined by statute,the ccsf contends that only the final permanent disability rating may be rebutted by an employee,not one of its component parts like the diminished future earning capacity adjustment.
discussion 
the touchstone of the workers compensation system is industrial injury which results in occupational disability or death.livitsanos superior court cal th.california first adopted its system of workers compensation benefits in.larson workers compensation law.in,the system was modified to take into account a worker age and occupation when calculating permanent disability benefits.larson workers compensation law,supra.to this day,age and occupation remain factors in the permanent disability benefit formula,subd.a.employers are responsible to workers who sustain permanent disabling injuries that arise out of and in the course of their employment.
a permanent disability is the irreversible residual of a injury that causes impairment in earning capacity,impairment in the normal use of a member or a handicap in the open labor market.brodie workers comp.appeals bd.cal th.payments for permanent disability are designed to compensate an injured employee both for physical loss and reduction in earning capacity.ibid.but workers compensation benefits are not damages awarded due to injury,and are not designed to restore to the worker all he has lost.flores workmen comp.appeals bd.d,fn.benefits are designed to rehabilitate,not indemnify.ibid.t he workers compensation system is designed to compensate only for such disability or need for treatment as is occupationally related.livitsanos superior court,supra,cal th at.
permanent disability payments are calculated by first expressing the degree of permanent disability as a percentage and then converting that percentage into an award based on a table.brodie workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at.since,permanent disability awards have been assessed using a schedule that was always expressly intended to manifest prima facie evidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered by the schedule.subd.c.milpitas unified school dist.workers comp.appeals bd.th.
for many years,determining the degree of permanent disability sustained due to an injury involved consideration of the opinions of vocational rehabilitation specialists concerning the employee ability to compete in an open labor market.gill workers comp.appeals bd.d.the employee ability to compete was an explicit consideration expressed in section,subdivision a,which provided in determining the percentages of permanent disability,account shall be taken of the nature of the physical injury or disfigurement,the occupation of the injured employee,and his age at the time of such injury,consideration being given to the diminished ability of such injured employee to compete in an open labor market.stats,ch,eff.july.
in,the legislature enacted omnibus changes to california workers compensation system as an urgency measure designed to alleviate a perceived crisis in skyrocketing workers compensation costs.brodie workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at,bill reg.sess.among them were changes to section,subdivision a,to require that a permanent disability award give consideration to an injured employee diminished future earning capacity,rather than the ability of such injured employee to compete in an open labor market.compare,stats,ch,eff.april,with,stats,ch,eff.july.
in addition,section now requires the administrative director of the division of workers compensation to amend the schedule for determination of the percentage of permanent disabilities every five years,subd.c.the nature of the physical injury or impairment to be rated in the schedule is to be based upon the american medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment,and an employee diminished future earning capacity shall be a numeric formula based upon empirical data and findings prepared by the rand institute for civil justice,subds.b.the schedule is to promote consistency,uniformity,and objectivity,subd.d and the scheduled rating continues to be prima facie evidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered by the schedule,subd.c.
the question posed here is whether,in light of the amendments to section enacted in senate bill,it is permissible to depart from a scheduled rating on the basis of vocational expert opinion that an employee has a greater loss of future earning capacity than reflected in a scheduled rating.in order to answer this question,we must consider the effect of amendments to the workers compensation law contained in senate bill and the relevant case law that preceded its enactment.
in considering this issue,our goal is to divine and give effect to the legislature intent.brodie workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at.w e turn to the words in the statute and give effect to the statute according to the usual,ordinary import of the language used in framing it.klee workers comp.appeals bd.d.if the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous,then our inquiry goes no further than their plain meaning.lungren deukmejian cal d.if possible,we give effect to every word and phrase in order to discern legislative purpose,and we consider the statute in the context of its statutory framework.dubois workers comp.appeals bd.cal th.although our review is de novo,we will give great deference to the wcab interpretation of the law unless it is clearly mistaken.genlyte group,llc workers comp.appeals bd.th.
senate bill amended section in two ways that affect the issue presented in this proceeding.the statute now provides that an employee diminished future earning capacity shall be a numeric formula based upon empirical data and findings prepared by the rand institute for civil justice,subd.b.and a permanent disability award must now reflect consideration of an injured employee diminished future earning capacity,rather than the ability of such injured employee to compete in an open labor market.former,subd.a.this latter change is readily addressed.
an injured employee impaired future earning capacity has been a consideration in awarding permanent disability long before the phrase was substituted into section,subdivision a by senate bill.at the time senate bill was enacted,the established purpose of permanent disability was to indemnify for impaired future earning capacity or decreased ability to compete in an open labor market.livitsanos superior court,supra,cal th at.cases reported prior to senate bill enactment use the phrases interchangeably.ritchie workers comp.appeals bd.th,edgar workers comp.appeals bd.th,russell bankers life d,sidders workers comp.appeals bd.d,franklin workers comp.appeals bd.d.indeed,the terms diminished future earning capacity and ability to compete in an open labor market suggest to us no meaningful difference,and nothing in senate bill suggests that the legislature intended to alter the purpose of an award of permanent disability through this change of phrase.nor does its use suggest that a party seeking to rebut a permanent disability rating must make any particular showing.
the specification in section,subdivision b,that an employee diminished future earning capacity shall be a numeric formula based on empirical data and findings as developed by the rand institute presents a slightly more difficult question.the language of section provides no alternative means to take into account the diminished earning capacity of an employee as a factor in rating a permanent disability.while the rating schedule is to be prima facie evidence of the percentage of permanent disability to be attributed to each injury covered by the schedule,subd.c,there is no indication some other measure may be substituted for the earning capacity component in order to arrive at an overall rating most suitable for a particular employee.in considering the legislature intent to promote consistency,uniformity,and objectivity in permanent disability awards,we see nothing ambiguous or unclear in section directive that the earning capacity adjustment factor shall be the numeric formula based upon the rand institute report.it must be initially applied.
rather,the ambiguity lies in determining just how an employee overall rating and its component parts may be rebutted while remaining loyal to the legislature design to provide a system that is objective and uniform in application.looking back at over years of case law interpreting section,there appear to be at least two rebuttal methods that are unchanged by passage of senate bill.first of all,the cases have always recognized the schedule to be rebutted when a party can show a factual error in the application of a formula or the preparation of the schedule.see fidelity casualty workmen.bd.d,rebuttal based on one element of disability being included in the permanent disability rating that should not have been,and another not being included that should have been state of california industrial acc.com.d,schedule prima facie evidence was rebutted because the injured employee congenital was included in the rating as if he had lost his hearing and speech in the industrial accident in which he injured his hand young industrial acc.com.d,the schedule did not constitute prima facie evidence because the schedule did not cover the impairment involved national kinney workers comp.appeals bd.d employee duties required application of a different group.a challenge to an employee presumptive disability rating thus appears to remain permissible on the basis that the schedule,or one of its component factors,was incorrectly calculated or applied.nothing in senate bill leads us to conclude the legislature intended to alter the ways a party to a compensation proceeding may challenge a scheduled rating.as our supreme court recently remarked of senate bill,w e do not presume that the legislature intends,when it enacts a statute,to overthrow principles of law unless such intention is clearly expressed or necessarily implied.brodie workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at.
the possibility an employee can demonstrate such an error in the earning capacity adjustment factor is more than theoretical,particularly in cases like this one involving a back injury.the rand institute for civil justice released a working paper in that describes the methodology employed to arrive at empirical adjustments to disability ratings due to diminished future earning capacity.rand institute for civil justice,data for adjusting disability ratings to reflect diminished future earnings and capacity in compliance with sb working paper.the working paper places several caveats on the use of the empirical data relied upon by the rand institute in reaching the earning capacity adjustments.for example,one of the challenges faced by the rand group was that the data previously assembled to consider earnings loss attributable to certain injuries was categorized by descriptions used by the california permanent disability rating system,while senate bill requires injury descriptions based on the american medical association guides.working paper at.the descriptions are quite different in practice,and at the time the future earning capacity adjustments were established,there was no direct link between the data used by rand and the american medical association guides.ibid.an ideal system would combine information on earnings losses with actual american medical association guide ratings.id.at.the working paper also makes certain assumptions that are critical when the diminished earning capacity ratings are applied to back injuries.id.at.if any of the assumptions are incorrect,the estimated ratings could be biased.ibid.a challenge to the ratings schedule on the basis that there was a factual error in the calculation of one of its component factors,or it was incorrectly applied in a particular case does not undermine the schedule consistency,uniformity,and objectivity,subd.d.it merely serves to correct it or ensure its accurate application.
an interpretation that the diminished earning capacity adjustment factor must be applied as formulated by the administrative director in all cases irrespective of its accuracy would require us to read into section a conclusive presumption.such a restrictive interpretation of section would be inconsistent with the legislature clear expression that the rating schedule is rebuttable.see milpitas unified school dist.workers comp.appeals,supra,th.
another way the cases have long recognized that a scheduled rating has been effectively rebutted is when the injury to the employee impairs his or her rehabilitation,and for that reason,the employee diminished future earning capacity is greater than reflected in the employee scheduled rating.this is the rule expressed in leboeuf workers comp.appeals bd.cal d.in leboeuf,an injured worker sought to demonstrate that,due to the residual effects of his injuries,he could not be retrained for suitable meaningful employment.id.at.our supreme court concluded that it was error to preclude leboeuf from making such a showing,and held that the fact that an injured employee is precluded from the option of receiving rehabilitation benefits should also be taken into account in the assessment of an injured employee permanent disability rating.id.at accord,gill workers comp.appeals,supra,d.while some of the briefing provided to the court may be read to suggest that under leboeuf a disability award may be affected when an employee is not amenable to vocational rehabilitation for any reason,the most widely accepted view of its holding,and that which appears to be most frequently applied by the wcab,is to limit its application to cases where the employee diminished future earnings are directly attributable to the employee work related injury,and not due to nonindustrial factors such as general economic conditions,illiteracy,proficiency to speak english,or an employee lack of education.see james workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied espinoza workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied southern workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied gottschalks workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied avei workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied linam workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied.compare montiel workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied t d tile workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied university of california,berkeley workers compensation appeals bd.writ denied.
this application of leboeuf hews most closely to an employer responsibility under sections and to compensate only for such disability or need for treatment as is occupationally related.livitsanos superior court,supra,cal th at.employers must compensate injured workers only for that portion of their permanent disability attributable to a current industrial injury,not for that portion attributable to previous injuries or to nonindustrial factors.brodie workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at discussing apportionment.an employee effectively rebuts the scheduled rating when the employee will have a greater loss of future earnings than reflected in a rating because,due to the industrial injury,the employee is not amenable to rehabilitation.
the briefs and arguments of the parties and amici also point out a third basis for rebuttal of a scheduled rating that is consistent with the statutory scheme.in certain rare cases,it appears the amalgamation of data used to arrive at a diminished future earning capacity adjustment may not capture the severity or all of the medical complications of an employee injury.after all,the adjustment is a calculation based upon a summary of data that projects earning losses based upon wage information obtained from the california employment development department for a finite period and comparing the earnings losses of certain disabled workers to the actual earnings of a control group of uninjured workers.working paper at.a scheduled rating may be rebutted when a claimant can demonstrate that the nature or severity of the claimant injury is not captured within the sampling of disabled workers that was used to compute the adjustment factor.for example,a claimant who sustains a compensable foot fracture with complications resulting from nerve damage may have greater permanent effects of the injury and thereby disprove the scheduled rating if the sampling used to arrive at the rating did not include any workers with similar complications.in such cases,the scheduled rating should be recalculated taking into account the extent to which the claimant disability has been aggravated by complications not considered within the sampling used to compute the adjustment factor.in this way,the employee permanent disability rating gives consideration to an employee diminished earning capacity that remains based upon a numeric formula based upon empirical data and findings prepared by the rand institute,subds.a b.we leave it to the wcab in the first instance to prescribe the exact method for such a recalculation that factors the employee anticipated diminished earning capacity into the data used by the rand institute.see.
although senate bill enacted extensive changes to california workers compensation system,the rebuttable presumption in section was unaltered.given the apparent absence of any legislative intent to change the law in this regard,we have no occasion to resort to reliance on the statutory rule of liberality that is commonly employed to construe ambiguities in the workers compensation laws to favor the extension of benefits.brodie workers comp.appeals,supra,cal th at.the result we reach today furthers the legislature objectives by ensuring that an injured worker may dispute his or her scheduled rating on the grounds that it does not accurately reflect that worker true diminished earning capacity due to an industrial injury.
by requiring that a worker challenge to a scheduled award due to earning capacity be tied to an error in the formula or industrial factors and not other causes,we serve another important policy consideration.an employer who hires or promotes an employee to a position the employee would not appear qualified to perform will bear only the expense related to the employee future reduction in earnings due to an industrial injury.by ensuring the employer should bear no expense for general factors that may affect the employee future,there is no economic disincentive for an employer to either hire or promote an employee to a position that would appear to exceed the employee qualifications.were we to hold that an employer takes the employee as he is and is therefore responsible for any loss of earning capacity the employee m
