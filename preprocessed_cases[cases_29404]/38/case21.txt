an administrative law judge alj denied gloria gean fischer claim for disability insurance benefits dib under the social security act.the alj concluded that fischer was not disabled prior to the date on which her insured status expired and thus not eligible to receive benefits.on petition for judicial review,the district court found that the alj erred as a matter of law when he failed to consult a medical expert before reaching this conclusion.the district court relied upon social security ruling ssr,which instructs an alj to consult a medical expert when the alj must infer a claimant date of disability onset on the basis of ambiguous medical evidence.see ssr,wl,at,may soc.sec.admin.comm r,cir.per curiam unpublished table decision,wl,at.
carolyn colvin,acting commissioner of social security,challenges the district court interpretation of ssr and its application to the facts of this case.we find it unnecessary to resolve the parties dispute concerning the general applicability of ssr to the disability inquiry in this case.even assuming that the ruling applies here,the medical evidence was not ambiguous and thus the alj did not need to draw inferences as to whether fischer onset date preceded the expiration of her insured status.hence,ssr did not require the alj to consult a medical expert.we therefore vacate the judgment of the district court and remand for consideration of fischer remaining claims.
although our conclusion does not require us to determine the scope of ssr,we take this opportunity to highlight the analytical disarray surrounding the rule.we identify our concerns below so that the commissioner is aware of the need to clarify the ruling purpose and resolve the inconsistencies in her approach to its applicability.
background 
on february,gloria gean fischer applied for disability insurance benefits,alleging a disability stemming from a fall from a ladder in the late.fischer had previously worked as a hair stylist,a lingerie store owner,and operator of a gift basket company.she alleges a disability onset date of october.fischer date last insured dli was march.for fischer to be eligible for benefits,she had to demonstrate that her disability existed prior to her dli.see cruz rivera sec.of health human,cir.per curiam.
fischer first relevant medical records reflect that she visited the exeter hospital pain clinic in october,complaining of increasingly severe left buttock and leg pain,resulting from a june fall fischer reported that the pain worsened with standing and that it woke her up at night.an examination revealed that fischer had a full range of motion of the lumbar spine,good flexion and extension of the lower extremities,and that she was able to toe walk and heel walk.the examination also revealed that fischer had tenderness between vertebrae in both the lumbar vertebrae and the thoracic vertebrae regions of her spine and unusual paraspinal tenderness.a magnetic resonance imaging mri indicated a bulging disc in the lumbar vertebrae,and an admitting physician administered an epidural steroid injection,diagnosed fischer with sciatica secondary to a lumbar strain,and prescribed naproxen for six weeks.
in january,fischer underwent an mri after complaining of neck pain radiating to her left shoulder.the results of the mri were normal.three months later,on march,fischer insured status expired.in october,were taken of fischer pelvis and left hip to rule out either a bone abnormality or inflammation the imaging results were again normal.
the record contains no relevant medical reports for the next five and a half years.in march,fischer presented with sensitivity on her left side and hip joint pain.multiple and an mri did not reveal any hip or sacroiliac joint problems,but an mri of her lumbar spine suggested degenerative disc changes though no disc herniation.in may,fischer was treated for constant pain in her left buttock and down into her leg,as well as numbness and tingling in her left arm.after a series of mris in and,fischer underwent an operation in december to implant a spinal cord stimulator.as of,fischer reported to her treating primary care physician that she held two jobs and was happy and active.however,in and,fischer again sought treatment for pain in her left buttock,leg,and foot,and for pain in her lower back,which was aggravated by sitting.from through,fischer reported improvements in her pain followed by recurrences,which ranged from dull aching to significant limitations on her ability to stand or walk for more than two hours.
agency proceedings determinations 
in september,a state agency physician reviewed fischer application for benefits and determined that there was not enough evidence to support the conclusion that fischer was disabled between her alleged onset date of october,and her dli of march.fischer requested a hearing before an alj,which took place on may.at the hearing,fischer testified that she was working at her retail shop when she fell from a ladder in the late and this fall exacerbated injuries from a car accident that took place in the.she stated that after the fall,she had pain throughout her entire left side,including her back,arm,and leg,and she had to rely on her daughter and other employees to do most of the work at the shop.she testified that she then closed her shop in and later underwent the spinal cord stimulator implant procedure.fischer testified that after the implantation,she tried to return to work as a hair stylist,but she could not sustain the work because of the required grasping,standing,and bending.her pain worsened,and she now spends the majority of her time lying down or in bed for relief.she also testified that she developed depression during this time.
following the hearing,the alj issued an order denying fischer claim.the alj found that,although there is some evidence that corroborates the claimant testimony of a fall in,the medical evidence of record is insufficient to support fischer assertion that she had a severe impairment prior to her dli.
the appeals council denied fischer appeal,and she sought judicial review in district court.see g.
district court decision 
the district court vacated the commissioner decision and remanded the case for further administrative proceedings because the alj failed to comply with ssr and consult a medical advisor before concluding that fischer was not disabled as of her dli.the court first concluded that ssr application is not predicated on a finding of present disability.in so holding,the court relied almost entirely on its previous decision in wilson colvin,supp.
in wilson,the court refused to adopt the commissioner contention that an alj must first find a claimant presently disabled in order for ssr,and its medical expert requirement,to apply.id.at.in the court view,such a reading would permit,and possibly encourage,an alj to avoid the inconvenience of either calling a medical advisor or making a finding regarding present disability in a case in which the evidence of a claimant disability onset date is ambiguous.id.at.hence,the court concluded that the commissioner could not condition the application of ssr on a finding of present disability.id.in fischer case,the court then found that the record did not unambiguously establish that fischer was not disabled as of her dli,thus requiring the alj to consult a medical advisor under ssr.
