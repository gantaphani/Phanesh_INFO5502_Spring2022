petitioner byrdie turman kent seeks review of an order of the merit systems protection board dismissing her petition for review of the decision of an administrative judge on grounds of untimeliness.we affirm.
turman kent married jesse kent in.kent had previously retired unmarried under the civil service retirement system csrs and had elected to receive an annuity payable during his lifetime with no survivor benefits.kent died in,and turman kent later applied to the office of personnel management opm for survivor annuity benefits as kent widow.that request was denied because kent had never elected to provide a survivor annuity for turman kent.
turman kent asked opm to reconsider its decision based on a telephone conversation that she and her late husband allegedly had with an opm employee regarding kent election of survivor annuity benefits.after considering that new evidence,opm affirmed its determination that turman kent was ineligible for survivor annuity benefits.in a january letter,opm explained that a previously unmarried retiree such as kent could have elected to receive a reduced lifetime annuity with survivor benefits for a new wife only by notifying opm of his intentions in a signed writing within two years of his marriage.see k a.that letter also notified turman kent of her right to appeal opm decision to the board.
turman kent filed an appeal with the board contesting opm reconsideration decision.in may,the administrative judge who was assigned to her case upheld opm decision.the administrative judge explained that turman kent had provided the board with no basis for waiving the statutory time limit for election of survivor benefits.the administrative judge initial decision was sent to turman kent with the following notice 
this initial decision will become final on june,unless a petition for review is filed by that date or the board reopens the case on its own motion.this is an important date because it is usually the last day on which you can file a petition for review with the board these instructions are important because if you wish to file a petition,you must file it within the proper time period.
turman kent did not file a petition for review by the board before june,and the administrative judge initial decision therefore became the final decision of the board.
turman kent ultimately filed a petition for review with the board on august,more than six years after the initial decision became final.upon receiving her petition,the clerk of the board informed her that it was untimely filed and provided her with an opportunity to file a motion to accept the filing as timely or waive the time limit for good cause.in her motion,turman kent alleged that she had long suffered from and memory loss due to an intracerebral hemorrhage suffered in.she also represented that her illness had flare d out of control after may due to extreme stress,but that her medical condition had shifted and improved at some time after mid,when she moved to illinois.turman kent stated in her motion that her disability made it difficult to find her records in order to accurately chronicle events necessary to respond in a timely manner.she attached a letter from an illinois physician,jean cavanaugh,who stated that she had examined turman kent before she moved to georgia in and again after july for cognitive defects attributable to her intracerebral hemorrhage.cavanaugh described turman kent condition as stable but a major impairment since the late.cavanaugh stated that t here is no doubt in my mind that she was unable to process paper work after her husband death.
after considering turman kent motion,the board denied her petition for review as untimely filed.the board found the statement of cavanaugh insufficient to support turman kent claim because cavanaugh had not examined turman kent for several years during the period of delay in filing her petition for review.the board noted that cavanaugh did not allege that she reviewed turman kent medical records for that time period,and it observed that cavanaugh statement the filing of turman kent petition for review.finding no credible medical evidence regarding turman kent condition between june and july,the board determined that turman kent ha d not submitted sufficient evidence to support that her medical condition impaired her ability to timely file her petition for review,or to request an extension of time.
turman kent bears a heavy burden to overturn the board determination that good cause has not been shown for her untimely filing.zamot merit.prot,see mendoza merit.prot,en banc whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the board discretion.board regulations require tardy petitioners to file a specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing,accompanied by supporting documentation or other evidence.f.the board has held that when petitioners allege delay for medical reasons,they must affirmatively identify medical evidence that addresses the entire period of delay.jerusalem dep t of the air force,aff,app x.
turman kent did not provide the board with medical evidence that accounted for the entire period of delay at issue in this case.in particular,there was no medical evidence regarding her condition between june and july.the board found it probative that cavanaugh had not examined turman kent during the year prior to her husband death or for a period after his death.turman kent states that she saw two other physicians during that period when she lived in georgia,yet no evidence from either of those physicians was presented,nor did cavanaugh purport to rely on any such evidence in her evaluation of turman kent condition during that period.the dissent refers to a letter written by turman kent neurologist in.that letter,which predates the period in question by years,simply addresses the circumstances giving rise to turman kent illness and the fact that she would not be able to continue in her previous profession as an accountant.
we have recognized that the length of delay is an important factor for the board to consider in determining whether a petitioner has shown good cause for an untimely filing.walls merit.prot.the length of delay in this case six years is exceptional.even in cases of ongoing illness,the board has found the absence of medical evidence covering the entirety of a period to be fatal to a finding of good cause.see,wilson office of pers,noting that documentation of mental illness from to did not excuse absence of medical evidence from period between and phillips dep t of the army,evidence of recurrent major depressive disorder diagnosed in did not establish petitioner condition between and.the board did not abuse its discretion in demanding a explanation of the cause for turman kent delay in filing her appeal.
before this court,turman kent has submitted several pieces of medical evidence that were not presented to the board.that evidence includes several annual disability certifications issued to her by the social security administration,numerous pharmacy reports of medicines prescribed to her between and,and an additional letter from cavanaugh dated march that elaborates on turman kent condition.because those items were not presented to the board,they are not part of the record on appeal and are not properly before us.see mueller postal,because we are limited to reviewing decisions of the board based on the record before the deciding official,we decline to base our judgment on evidence that was not part of the record before the administrative judge.
the dissent relies on our decision in pyles merit systems protection board.the petitioner in pyles presented the board with a medical finding that she had increasingly severe dementia,a progressive organic brain disease defined by the loss of intellectual faculties.this court concluded that unrebutted medical evidence of dementia was sufficient to establish good cause for untimely filing.id.at.the dissent argues that because brain cell death caused by an intracerebral hemorrhage is permanent,pyles requires the board to adopt a presumption that turman kent cognitive function could not have improved at any point during her delay in filing a petition for review.however,our holding in pyles was predicated not only on the permanence of dementia but also on its very nature as a structurally caused permanent or progressive decline in several dimensions of intellectual function that interferes substantially with the individual normal social or economic activity.id.the medical literature cited by the dissent does not suggest that cognitive function never improves in persons who have suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage.
turman kent motion before the board states that her illness had temporarily flare d out of control,but that at some later time her condition had shifted and improved and she became better able to remember business details,at times.that statement conflicts with cavanaugh assessment of turman kent condition as stable throughout the period of delay.moreover,turman kent timely filed pleadings before opm in and before the board in.those filings were made during the multiyear period in which she was not under the care of cavanaugh,and they undermine her claim of an ongoing,irreversible medical condition suffered a ago that has permanently prevented her from timely filing paperwork in support of her claim.see ortiz dep t of justice,finding no good cause for delay due to ongoing illness where evidence did not explain change in circumstances between period in which appellant complied with board deadlines and period in which he failed to comply choco office of pers,rejecting appellant contention that he was precluded from timely filing a petition for review for more than five years,especially in view of the fact that he was able to file a petition for review with the board regional office four months before his petition for review was due for filing hawkins dep t of the navy,no good cause for delay in filing petition for review when appellant was capable of filing a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement early in that period sing dep t of the navy,finding appellant allegations of incapacity to file paperwork in a timely fashion undermined by timely filing of other papers during the period in question 
turman kent also alleges that she did not receive proper forms in a timely manner and was therefore unable to file a timely petition for review.the document that she references is the january opm reconsideration decision letter that denied her claim for survivor benefits.following her receipt of that letter,turman kent filed a timely appeal with the board contesting opm denial of her claim for benefits.the opm reconsideration letter is irrelevant to the timeliness of her subsequent petition for review by the full board of the administrative judge initial decision,which is the issue before us.turman kent has never alleged that she did not receive the administrative judge initial decision informing her of the deadline for submitting a petition for review to the full board.
finally,turman kent states that she was hospitalized for hallucinations and seizures during the period following her return to illinois.that allegation does not constitute evidence of her condition between june and july because she did not return to illinois until after that time period.her statement therefore can not undermine the board ruling.accordingly,we affirm the dismissal of turman kent petition for review as untimely.
years ago,turman kent suffered what is commonly known as a stroke.the cognitive deficits that resulted were devastating for turman kent,as they are for millions of stroke survivors.she has endured for decades what her doctor describes as a major disability.yet the merit systems protection board the board dismissed turman kent petition as untimely because she did not provide sufficient evidence showing good cause for waiving the filing deadline.the majority opinion.affirms the board decision,stating that there was no medical evidence regarding her condition during what it deemed the critical period in question.op.at.because binding case law exists that is directly on point and that requires us to presume the continuation of a permanent medical condition throughout the entire period of delay,and for other reasons set forth below,i respectfully dissent.
background 
on february,at years old,petitioner byrdie turman kent had a stroke.generally,strokes occur when the brain is deprived of oxygen due to an interruption of blood supply.the stroke turman kent suffered was secondary to an intracerebral hemorrhage.intracerebral hemorrhages account for just fifteen percent of all strokes,but they are very serious victims have a day mortality rate higher than percent and the possibility of disability for those that survive intracerebral hemorrhage is caused by a weakened blood vessel that ruptures and bleeds into the surrounding brain tissue.the blood pools and forms a clot,called a hematoma,which as it grows puts pressure on the brain.the area that the ruptured artery formerly supplied is deprived of blood.neurological deficits may result.quoting the national institutes of health,
s troke can cause damage to parts of the brain responsible for memory,learning,and awareness.stroke survivors may have dramatically shortened attention spans or may experience deficits in memory.individuals also may lose their ability to make plans,comprehend meaning,learn new tasks,or engage in other complex mental activities.
of health and human services,national institutes of health,national institute of neurological disorders and stroke,post stroke rehabilitation,nih publication,at 
according to one of her treating physicians,turman kent intracerebral hemorrhage was a consequence of increased blood pressure,likely brought on by intense work as an accountant.turman kent stroke was so severe as to leave her unconscious and paralyzed on the left side for a time.she improved initially for two years,but never to where she could return to her job.her cognitive deficits have persisted without improvement since.see infra.
despite these serious health issues,turman kent married jesse kent,a former federal employee in june.at,kent was older than his new bride at years old,but he was the one taking care of turman kent because of her medical problems.the following year,the couple moved from illinois to georgia.just before the move,turman kent was evaluated by jean cavanaugh,a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation who first began treating turman kent shortly after her stroke in and continues to do so to this day.cavanaugh observed no improvement in her cognitive deficiencies beyond the initial gains of.this evaluation occurred in,sixteen years after turman kent suffered her stroke.
when kent retired unmarried in,he elected to take a retirement annuity payable only during his lifetime.under the law,employees who were not married when they first retired are permitted to later elect to take a reduction in annuity in order to provide a survivor benefit for a spouse they later married.turman kent claims that she and her husband in made arrangements by phone to change his election to allow for a survivorship reduction in his annuity.
kent died on june,and turman kent sought survivor benefits as his widow.she was denied on grounds that the government records did not indicate that a written election of survivor benefits was filed before july,the deadline after the marriage date.turman kent requested reconsideration,and by letter of january,was again denied.that denial letter incorrectly stated that kent had in august,an error that made turman kent wonder if his file had been mixed up with some else the denial of the office of personnel management opm was affirmed in an aj initial decision dated may.the last page of the aj decision stated that the result would become final unless a petition for review was filed before june.
turman kent,however,did not file prior to june.she claims that by this point,many months after the death of kent,her primary caregiver,life had become very difficult.turman kent states that t he stress of trying to forestall foreclosure made my illness flare out of control.this lead sic to increased memory problems which caused a type of regression in my ability to function especially in the areas of handling business affairs and meeting deadlines.when she eventually lost her home,turman kent was forced to return to illinois with her sister who had been with her in georgia.turman kent recollects with the loss of my house and my move back to illinois,paperwork vital to my petition was misplaced and subsequently forgotten because of my memory issues trying to make sense of my husband death,bring his body back to illinois and deal with my own illness,made life a nightmare for a long time.id.
she was again evaluated by cavanaugh upon returning to illinois in.cavanaugh still saw no improvement in the baseline level of turman kent impairment she had,in fact,gotten worse.on top of her already diagnosed inability to function,her seizure medication had become ineffective.
upon her return to her family in illinois,the former aj decision was found.a form motion to accept filing as timely to ask the board to waive or set aside the time limit was filed with the board.turman kent explained under oath why good cause existed,writing that i have been diagnosed with an intracerebral hemorrhage with hematoma formation.i have both and memory loss.she further explained to the board that she suffered from health issues,stating i was medically unable to participate in a timely fashion prior to now due to events in,which left me with residual deficits.these deficits are permanent.as proof of their permanence,turman kent attached an august,letter from her physician,cavanaugh,explaining the lasting effects of her stroke after years.see infra.
ii.turman kent medical evidence 
in a letter contained in the record that expresses medical information and a medical opinion,turman kent doctor describes the cognitive deficits experienced by her longtime patient following her stroke.in sum,cavanaugh august,medical opinion specifies that turman kent suffered an r frontal intracranial hemorrhage.cavanaugh elaborates that from onward,turman kent condition became stable,but her cognitive deficits remained a major impairment.these cognitive deficits include decreased initiation of tasks,lose sic train of thought mid task sic,a decreased problem solving for anything higher than daily events and simple self care.see supra.cavanaugh noted that turman kent sister needs to remind her to take meds,her niece needs to take her to the grocery store,and a friend had to help turman kent understand and articulate what was required for her appeal.id.cavanaugh concludes that based on these ongoing and irreversible impairments,there is no doubt in my mind that she was unable to process paper work after her husband death.id.
iii.the board decision 
the board final order of february,however,rejected cavanaugh medical opinion.as the sole basis for its determination,the board noted that it would not rely on cavanaugh medical opinion for part of the delay period because cavanaugh had not seen turman kent during the time she lived in atlanta,cavanaugh did not indicate that she had reviewed medical files covering their four years apart,and cavanaugh letter the relevant time such that there is no contemporaneous medical evidence to show the status of appellant medical condition between june,and august,which is the entire period of delay.according to the board,good cause could not be established because the petitioner had not provided more comprehensive medical records covering two years,from june to july the only portion of the delay period that cavanaugh was not directly treating turman kent.the board concluded w e find that the appellant has not submitted sufficient evidence to support that her medical condition impaired her ability to timely file her petition for review,or to request an extension of time,and dismissed.turman kent,who has never been represented by counsel in any of these proceedings,appeals to this court pro se.
iv.discussion 
we affirm a decision of the board unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.the board necessarily abuses its discretion when it rests its decision on factual findings unsupported by substantial evidence.pyles merit.prot.
in my judgment,the board determination constitutes an abuse of discretion and is contrary to law for three reasons.first,cavanaugh medical opinion expressly covered the entire period of delay.second,the board ignored this court precedent created in pyles such that medical conditions that are permanent will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent rebuttal evidence of record to the contrary.id.at.third,the board should have remanded for a determination under french office of personnel management,because it is fundamentally unfair to require or allow an incompetent to act as an advocate for herself.
a.the medical evidence expressly covers the entire period of delay 
both the board and the majority agreed that no medical evidence regarding her condition was presented by turman kent for the relevant period.op.at.the record demonstrates that this finding is incorrect.the record contains medical evidence regarding turman kent condition during the period cited by the board and the majority.cavanaugh medical opinion covers the relevant period and more,reciting ongoing cognitive deficits that have been a major disability for turman kent since.see supra.in particular,cavanaugh unequivocal medical opinion is that turman kent suffers from brain damage that made her unable to process paperwork after her husband death.this conclusion alone established grounds for a good cause waiver spanning from to,which includes the entire period of delay.see pyles,at.hence,the board finding that there was no evidence covering the entire period of delay is unsupported by substantial evidence in the record and constitutes an abuse of discretion.
similarly,the board assertion that there is no indication cavanaugh reviewed medical evidence during the time period that appellant was in atlanta,is also incorrect.cavanaugh reported that she reviewed the electronic medical record of turman kent.see supra.the board did not inquire into whether the electronic medical records contained entries from this period.cavanaugh,moreover,confirms that she examined turman kent before she left for atlanta at sixteen years into the ailment and after she returned twenty years into the ailment,finding no change for the better during that period.id.any inference that petitioner chronic condition while briefly in georgia was improved or qualitatively different from the rest of the year history described in the letter is unsupported by substantial evidence.the board demand of contemporaneous evidence on the basis that cavanaugh letter the period in question is also erroneous.see pyles,at,first,fairly read,daniel unrebutted letter of november,effectively covers the entire period of delay ending november.
b.the board ignored applicable precedent 
this court has established precedent that addresses the issue of whether a good cause waiver can exist notwithstanding potential gaps of medical evidence.this court in pyles held that when a person is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature permanent in severity,the medical condition will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent rebuttal evidence to the contrary.id.at.in pyles,daniel treated the petitioner,margaret pyles,for dementia over seven months,from january to july of,but not thereafter.id.at.pyles filed her untimely appeal on november.id.the aj rejected a letter from daniel,written on november,as incapable of supporting a good cause waiver because daniel had not treated pyles during the sixteen months immediately prior to filing.id.this court reversed,holding 
where,as here,a party is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature permanent or progressive in severity,it will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent rebuttal evidence of record to the contrary.thus,the only finding the aj could reasonably have made on this record is that pyles suffered dementia from january to the time the appeal was filed.
pyles instructs that where a petitioner is diagnosed with a condition that by its nature is permanent in severity,and absent related evidence to the contrary,the board can not require additional medical evidence to cover gaps of medical evidence after diagnosis.id.at.as a matter of law,a petitioner permanent condition is assumed to continue unabated absent evidence rebutting the diagnosis.id.at accord frank office of personnel,although the appellant medical records do not document his mental condition after w here a party is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature permanent or progressive in severity,it will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent evidence to the contrary.
i also read pyles to hold that in order to overcome a presumption of a permanent medical condition,rebuttal evidence must be medical evidence 
because the record contains unrebutted evidence that pyles suffered dementia at least through july and no medical evidence whatsoever tending to show she improved after that time,the aj finding is flatly inconsistent with the very nature of dementia.it is unsupported by substantial evidence or,indeed,any at all,and the denial of the waiver based on this unsupported finding was an abuse of discretion.
pyles,at emphasis added.
i.the board failure to apply pyles 
the board failed to apply the pyles precedent.indeed,the board determination does not mention pyles,or otherwise indicate that any of the pyles criteria were considered.the fact that the board either overlooked pyles,or ignored it entirely,resulted in a determination that is contrary to law.
it is clear that pyles applies in this case for the following reasons.
first,turman kent was diagnosed with a medical condition that by its nature is permanent in its severity.the record shows that turman kent stroke was brought on by an intracerebral hemorrhage,the worst kind by certain metrics.see supra.she was unconscious and paralyzed.she improved initially over two years,regained consciousness and mobility,but the cognitive deficits that resulted from neurological damage remain.she requires assistance to take her medicine and to complete everyday tasks and functions.her doctor medical opinion is that her mental impairments prevent her from processing paperwork.cavanaugh confirmed that turman kent cognitive deficits are a major but stable disability since,permanent.see supra.the record evidence is consistent with medical literature concerning the permanent effects of intracerebral hemorrhage and the limited improvement prospects beyond a couple of years in particular with regard to the irreversible nature of turman kent cognitive impairments fifteen to years posthemorrhage 
second,the record does not contain medical evidence that rebuts the severity of an intracerebral hemorrhage and the resulting permanent neurological damage.there is no medical evidence that contradicts that turman kent suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage,or whether the neurological damage she suffered prevented her from processing paperwork.in sum,the record contains no medical evidence that rebuts the diagnosis of turman kent permanent condition persisting after so many years.
given turman kent permanent deficiencies,and absent rebuttal medical evidence to the contrary,the only finding the board could reasonably have made on the record before it was that turman kent suffered major cognitive deficits from june to the time the appeal was filed.the board finding that turman kent failed to establish good cause contravenes this court ruling in pyles and is therefore contrary to law.
ii.the majority renders pyles ineffective 
the majority believes that pyles does not apply in this case.first,the majority argues that the record shows turman kent condition was only temporary,citing turman kent personal statements regarding and noting other timely filings before the board.op.at.but none of the information relied on by the majority to show a temporary condition is medical evidence as this court in pyles noted,a finding of a tendency to improve absent medical evidence is flatly inconsistent with the very nature of a severe,permanent medical condition.at.there simply is no medical evidence in the record that the cognitive deficits suffered by turman kent as a result of an intracerebral hemorrhage were temporary in nature.stated differently,there is no evidence in the record that rebuts cavanaugh opinion that turman kent permanent condition made her unable to process paperwork following her husband death.because the record is devoid of medical evidence rebutting the diagnosis of a permanent condition,pyles is fully applicable to this case.see newell kenny,stating that prior decisions of a panel of the court are binding precedent on subsequent panels unless and until overturned in banc.
the majority evidence is nothing more than a strained attempt to find in turman kent submissions a basis for finding her competent to handle her own legal affairs,an approach roundly rejected by the court.pyles,at.that the majority seeks to distinguish pyles by relying on findings not made by the board amounts to judicial rationalization.burlington truck lines,united states,the agency must make findings that support its decision,and those findings must be supported by substantial evidence the courts may not accept appellate counsel post hoc rationalizations.our review must be limited to those grounds relied on and articulated by the board.see sec.exch.comm chenery,a reviewing court,in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency is alone authorized to make,must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency.if those grounds are inadequate or improper,the court is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or proper basis.see also in re hounsfield.in order to avoid pyles,the majority adopts findings that go beyond the grounds stated by the board.this court should not serve to supplement that which the board lacks in its determination.chenery,at.
the majority rewrites the pyles determination.according to the majority,the presence of a timely filing a layman statement by the petitioner and any purported gap in the record can defeat the presumption established in pyles.in making these arguments,the majority establishes a new rule of law and overrules pyles sub silentio.given the majority reliance on contrary evidence,petitioners with a permanent condition will be effectively foreclosed from the presumption of pyles.at minimum,the majority should have remanded with instructions that the board determine whether pyles applies.
french procedure determination 
in french,this court instructed the board to arrange representation for mentally incompetent pro se appellants seeking disability retirement benefits.at.the court agreed that french,proceeding pro se,had failed to make the requisite showing of mental incompetence to qualify for a waiver,but held that where there is an apparently nonfrivolous claim of past incompetence by one presently incompetent,the board must take an active role ensuring that the incompetent appellant not alone be charged with the task of establishing his case.id.
the board recently extended the fairness principles articulated in french to other types of claimants.specifically,in frank office of personnel management,the board applied french to a pro se appellant with mental impairment seeking entitlement to survivor annuities under.id.at we discern no reason why the french procedures should not be applied here.in frank,petitioner had failed to produce medical documentation covering the most recent nine years of his illness,so his claim was denied.id.frank subsequently filed a petition for review,but did so late.id.at.
citing pyles,the board determined that the timeliness requirement was waivable for good cause based on petitioner past mental incompetence,id.at,and remanded for further french consideration
