south carolina public employees commenced this class action challenging the constitutionality of the south carolina state retirement system preservation and investment reform act,acts the act.that act amended south carolina retirement laws by requiring public employees who retire and then return to work to make,beginning on july,the same contributions to pension plans as employees but without receiving further pension benefits.the plaintiffs claimed that the act effected a taking of their private property,in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment and the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.they named as defendants two pension plans,in which they are participants the south carolina retirement systems group trust the trust,which holds the pension plans assets and state officials serving as trustees and administrators of the pension plans.for relief,they sought repayment of all contributions withheld since july,and injunctive relief prohibiting the future collection of such contributions.
pursuant to the defendants motion,the district court dismissed the complaint on the ground that all of the defendants are entitled to sovereign immunity.
we affirm,albeit on reasoning slightly different from that given by the district court.we conclude,as did the district court,that the pension plans and the trust are arms of the state of south carolina and therefore have sovereign immunity.likewise,we conclude that the state officials sued in their official capacities for repayment of contributions have sovereign immunity.finally,we conclude that the state officials sued in their official capacities for prospective injunctive relief have sovereign immunity because their duties bear no relation to the collection of the public employees contributions to the pension plans,precluding application of ex parte young.in reaching these conclusions,we reject the plaintiffs argument that their claims under the takings clause of the fifth amendment are exempt from the protection of the eleventh amendment.
the plaintiffs are public employees and participants in two pension plans created by south carolina in the south carolina retirement system and the south carolina police officers retirement system collectively,the retirement system see ann.in their complaint,they alleged that they and others similarly situated are retired contributing members of the retirement system,who returned to work on or after july,when the act went into effect,and who are,by reason of the act,required to contribute a portion of their gross earnings to the retirement system without receiving any additional service credit or interest on their retirement accounts.before july,retired participants could return to work for a salary of up to without forfeiting the right to receive retirement benefits and without having to make further contributions to the retirement system.see ahrens state.but this changed with the enactment of the act,and retired participants who return to work are now required to make the same contributions to the retirement system as employees but without accruing additional service credit for pension benefits.see ann.c,c.the south carolina general assembly made the change to help fund the retirement system and,in particular,to secure future adjustments.
the plaintiffs commenced this class action in august on behalf of themselves and all other participating employees who returned to work on or after july,alleging that,by enforcing the act,the defendants confiscated their private property,in violation of the takings clause of the fifth amendment and their procedural due process rights under the fourteenth amendment.in addition to naming as defendants the two pension plans,the plaintiffs named the trust,which holds the assets of the retirement system,and a number of state officials in their official capacities who,as members or executive directors of the state budget and control board and the public employee benefit authority,serve as trustees and administrators of the retirement system.the state budget and control board and the public employee benefit authority are the statutorily designated of the retirement system.ann.a.
for relief,the plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment that the act is unconstitutional an injunction against its enforcement an accounting of all contributions they made to the retirement system since july,an injunction compelling the return of all such contributions and an order awarding them attorneys fees and costs 
the retirement system,the trust,and the state officials filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to federal rules of civil procedure b,b,and b,asserting numerous grounds for their motion,including sovereign immunity,claim and issue preclusion based on the prior state litigation,discretionary abstention,and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the district court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint,relying only on the defendants sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment.with respect to the institutional defendants,the court determined that the retirement systems should be considered an arm of the state such that eleventh amendment immunity applies to bar a federal court from hearing the claim.hutto ret,d.and b ecause plaintiffs seek monetary damages,it held that the claims against the individual defendants were similarly barred.id.at.having found that all of the defendants were immune by reason of sovereign immunity,the court declined to address the defendants remaining grounds for seeking dismissal of the action.
the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration under rule e,asserting that the district court erred in dismissing their claims for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief against the state officials serving in their official capacities.they relied on ex parte young,which created an exception to eleventh amendment immunity with respect to claims for prospective injunctive relief to remedy ongoing violations of federal law.the district court denied the motion because,in seeking to bar the enforcement of the act,which requires plaintiffs to pay into the retirement system,plaintiffs requested relief is undeniably monetary and because an injunction ordering the return of the contributions already withheld would ultimately impact the state treasury.
this appeal followed.
the eleventh amendment shields a state entity from suit in federal court if,in the entity operations,the state is the real party in interest,in the sense that the named party is the alter ego of the state.ram ditta.capital park planning comm n,cir.
the plaintiffs contend that the retirement system and the trust do not have the sovereign immunity afforded a state under the eleventh amendment because they are entit ies and that the district court contrary conclusion was based on an erroneous application of the factors articulated in ram ditta for determining whether an entity is an alter ego of the state.they argue,t he district court should have given effect to the express,unambiguous language of south carolina retirement laws and concluded that the retirement systems are independent corporate entities for which the state has no financial obligation as indemnitor.
the defendants contend that state law makes the financial obligations of the state retirement systems obligations of the state that the state controls the retirement system that the pension plans of the retirement system operate on a statewide basis and have statewide concerns and that south carolina law treats the pension plans as state agencies.the defendants thus maintain that the retirement system and the trust are arms of the state and therefore immune from suit.
whether an action is barred by the eleventh amendment is a question of law that we review de novo.cash granville cnty.bd.of,cir.
at the outset,we address which party has the burden of proof when sovereign immunity under the eleventh amendment is raised.while the supreme court has described sovereign immunity as a jurisdictional bar that can be raised for the first time on appeal,seminole tribe of florida,and a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in art.iii,pennhurst state sch.hosp.halderman,it ha s not decided whether eleventh amendment immunity goes to a court jurisdiction.dep t of corr.schacht.unlike jurisdiction,which can not be waived,a state can always waive its immunity and consent to be sued in federal court,atascadero state hosp.scanlon,and a court need not raise the issue on its own initiative.dep t of,at.because a defendant otherwise protected by the eleventh amendment can waive its protection,it is,as a practical matter,structurally necessary to require the defendant to assert the immunity.we therefore conclude that sovereign immunity is akin to an affirmative defense,which the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating.in so concluding,we join every other court of appeals that has addressed the issue.see woods rondout valley cent.sch.dist.bd.of,cir fresenius med.care cardiovascular,the caribbean cardiovascular ctr,cir gragg.cabinet for workforce,cir skelton.camp,cir christy.turnpike comm n,cir baxter vigo cnty.sch,cir,superseded by statute on other grounds as recognized in holmes marion cnty.office of family children,cir itsi tv,agric.ass ns,cir.
in analyzing whether entities such as the retirement system and the trust are arms of the state,the most important consideration is whether the state treasury will be responsible for paying any judgment that might be awarded.ram ditta,at.thus,if the state treasury will be called upon to pay a judgment against a governmental entity,then eleventh amendment immunity applies to that entity.cash,at.if,on the other hand,the state treasury will not be liable for a judgment,sovereign immunity applies only where the governmental entity is so connected to the state that the legal action against the entity would,despite the fact that the judgment will not be paid from the state treasury,amount to the indignity of subjecting a state to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties.id.at quoting seminole tribe,at.at bottom,even though state sovereign immunity serves the important function of shielding state treasuries and thus preserving the states ability to govern in accordance with the will of their citizens,the doctrine central purpose is to accord the states the respect owed them as joint sovereigns.fed.maritime comm state ports,internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
we address first the most important factor whether south carolina could be responsible for the payment of a judgment against the retirement system and the trust.a state treasury is responsible where the state is functionally liable,even if not legally liable.ex rel.oberg.higher educ.assistance agency,cir quoting stoner santa clara cnty.office of,cir internal quotation marks omitted see also ristow ports,cir holding that courts must c onsider the practical effect of a putative judgment on the state treasury emphasis added.
the plaintiffs argue that the retirement systems act insulates the state treasury from any judgment entered in this case because it provides that a ll agreements or contracts with members of the retirement system are solely obligations of the individual pension plan and that the full faith and credit of south carolina or its subdivisions is not,and shall not be,pledged or obligated beyond the state contributions as an employer of participating employees.ann.
this statutory language,however,must be read in the context of article x,section of the south carolina constitution,which provides that t he general assembly shall annually appropriate funds and prescribe member contributions for any retirement system which will insure the availability of funds to meet all normal and accrued liability of the system on a sound actuarial basis as determined by the governing body of the system.const.art.x,emphasis added.any possible ambiguity resulting from reading the retirement laws in the context of the south carolina constitution was put to rest by the south carolina supreme court in wehle south carolina retirement system,per curiam,where the court stated that,should the board determine that any retirement system is not funded on a sound actuarial basis,the general assembly must provide funding necessary to restore the fiscal integrity of the system.thus,in the event that a judgment in this case were to render the retirement system unable to meet its liabilities,the general assembly would be obligated to account for any deficiency by increasing appropriations to the retirement system or by requiring employers,including the state itself,to increase their contributions.
in addition,the state ultimate responsibility for the financial soundness of the retirement system is reflected by the fact that the retirement system actuarial valuation is relied upon in the preparation of the state annual financial statement and by outside entities in rating the state for purposes of issuance of bonds.wehle,at.thus,if a judgment in this case were to render the retirement system or the trust insolvent,that insolvency would harm the state credit rating,making it more expensive for the state to borrow money.
consequently,we conclude that south carolina remains functionally liable for any judgment against the retirement system and the trust,which is sufficient to make the retirement system and the trust arms of the state.see oberg,at.
we reject the plaintiffs various arguments to the contrary.first,they insist that article x,section of the south carolina constitution merely compels the state to comply with its funding obligations as an employer,a requirement that the general assembly could not have imposed on future legislatures by legislative act.and they complain that the district court unnecessarily construed the state constitution in a manner that rendered it irreconcilable with sections and.but the south carolina supreme court,which,of course,has the last word on the meaning of the south carolina constitution,rejected the plaintiffs posited construction of article x,section.see wehle,at.moreover,the plaintiffs argument that we must construe a constitutional provision so as not to conflict with a statute turns the concept of constitutional supremacy on its head.
second,the plaintiffs maintain that there is no evidence that a judgment in their favor would in fact create a shortfall in the retirement system funds.yet,given that the plaintiffs complaint alleges that the members of the proposed class will exceed tens of thousands of persons,it is surely plausible that a favorable judgment could create an actuarial deficit.more importantly,whether or not a judgment would render the retirement system insolvent is of little consequence to the analysis.as the supreme court held in regents of the university of california doe,it is the entity potential legal liability that is relevant.id.at emphasis added see also owens balt.city state att ys office,cir when an entity has both state and local characteristics,the entity potential legal liability is relevant to the eleventh amendment inquiry emphasis added quoting regents,at oberg,at i n assessing the state treasury factor,an entity potential legal liability is key emphasis added quoting regents,at.consequently,the proper inquiry is not whether the state treasury would be liable in this case,but whether,hypothetically speaking,the state treasury would be subject to potential legal liability if the retirement system did not have the money to cover the judgment.ernst rising,cir quoting regents,at see also pub.sch.ret.state bank trust,cir similar.here,as in ernst,the plaintiffs fail to come to grips with the fiscal reality that the state funding requirement assuredly could increase if the retirement system were to use its current and future funding to pay off a judgment against it.at emphasis added.
third,the plaintiffs read much into the fact that the funds and assets of the retirement system are not funds of the state,ann.c,but instead are held in a group trust under section a of the internal revenue code,id.c.section a of the internal revenue code requires that group trust funds not be used for,or diverted to,purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of employees or their beneficiaries in order to qualify as a group trust.a.while we have recognized that holding funds in a segregated account apart from general state funds does counsel against establishing status,oberg,at,that fact is not dispositive.the plaintiffs also argue that south carolina is violating a by diverting the contributions they made to the retirement system to benefit employees.but even if south carolina were indeed in violation of federal law by using funds contrary to a,that fact would be irrelevant to whether a judgment against the retirement system or the trust could potentially affect the state treasury.accord ernst,at.
fourth,the plaintiffs argue that courts generally,and the district court in particular,should wait until the completion of discovery and the development of a factual record before resolving the sovereign immunity issue.but we have often affirmed rule b motions to dismiss on the basis of eleventh amendment immunity.see,antrican odom,cir.in gray laws,cir,upon which the plaintiffs rely for their argument,we vacated the district court dismissal under the eleventh amendment not because the district court failed to conduct sufficient factfinding,but rather because the supreme court had changed the applicable eleventh amendment standard while the appeal was pending and the barrenness of the record rendered us to apply the new standard.
finally,the plaintiffs contend that we are bound by our earlier decision in almond boyles,cir.in almond,we rejected,for the reasons stated by the district court,a claim that the eleventh amendment barred a suit by a class of visually handicapped operators of vending stands to recover employer contributions to the north carolina teachers and state employees retirement system,which they claimed were collected in violation of federal law.id.at.the district court had found that a judgment against the retirement system would not come from state funds for three reasons,the most important of which was that the defendants had not shown the court that the relief requested by the plaintiffs would inevitably lead to an additional appropriation of state funds.almond boyles,emphasis added.but almond requirement that the defendants show that a judgment would inevitably be satisfied by the state is fundamentally at odds with regents subsequent less demanding standard of potential liability,and therefore almond framework is no longer applicable.
as the supreme court has framed the eleventh amendment inquiry,the question is whether,i f the expenditures of the enterprise exceed receipts,is the state in fact obligated to bear and pay the resulting indebtedness of the enterprise when the answer is no both legally and practically then the eleventh amendment core concern is not implicated.hess port auth.trans hudson,emphasis added.in light of wehle interpretation of article x,section,the answer to that question here is undoubtedly yes,and we therefore conclude that a judgment against the retirement system and the trust would implicate south carolina treasury.
in addition to south carolina potential funding obligation,we also conclude that factors weigh in favor of finding that the retirement system and the trust are arms of the state.see fed.maritime comm n,at.when assessing whether allowing suit against a state entity would offend a state dignity,we consider the degree of control that the state exercises over the entity or the degree of autonomy from the state that the entity enjoys the scope of the entity concerns whether local or statewide with which the entity is involved and the manner in which state law treats the entity.cash,at.
under the factor,we consider who appoints the entity directors or officers,who funds the entity,and whether the state retains a veto over the entity actions,oberg,at quoting ex rel.oberg.higher educ.student loan,cir internal quotation marks omitted,as well as whether an entity has the ability to contract,sue and be sued,and purchase and sell property,and whether it is represented in legal matters by the state attorney general,id.citations omitted.
in this case,the retirement system does have the power and privileges of a corporation.ann,including the powers to sue and be sued,to make contracts,and to buy and sell property,id.but,contrary to the plaintiffs argument,the designation of an entity as a corporation with the power to sue and be sued is not conclusive in establishing its autonomy.see oberg,at finding that the autonomy factor cut both ways,even though the entity had the power to enter into contracts,sue and be sued,and purchase and sell property in its own name see also state highway comm utah const,it is unnecessary for us to consider the effect of the general grant of power to sue or be sued this suit,in effect,is against the state and must be so treated.
and other factors point to state control.the means by which the entities officers are appointed suggest that the retirement system is beholden to the state.the state budget and control board and the public employee benefit authority,which are the of the retirement system,and the retirement system investment commission,which has exclusive authority to invest the trust assets,see ann.a,are comprised almost entirely of the governor of south carolina,the state treasurer,the comptroller general,the chairman of the senate finance committee,the chairman of the house ways and means committee,the president pro tempore of the senate,the speaker of the house of representatives,and persons appointed by these officials.id,b,a.although several of the appointees are required to be participants in the retirement system,even those members are selected by state officials.while the trustees and administrators of the trust are,of course,required to discharge their fiduciary duties solely in the interest of the retirement systems,participants,and beneficiaries,id,one would have to be naive to conclude that the state lacks any influence or control when it has the power of appointment.state control is further evidenced by the facts that the state treasurer is the custodian of the trust funds and has sole authority to issue payments from the funds,id,the retirement system investment commission must provide quarterly reports to,among others,the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate,id.a the state must defend and indemnify the members of the retirement system investment commission,id.and an entire title of the code of laws of south carolina is devoted to the extensive regulation of the retirement system and the trust.
in sum,because of the mixed indications as to control,we conclude that application of the control factor,if not favoring sovereign immunity,is inconclusive.accord oberg,at finding that the control factor present ed a close question in light of the fact that the board of directors was largely composed of state officials or gubernatorial appointees but also exercise d corporate powers including the capacity to contract and sue and be sued almond.at holding that the control factor did not weigh heavily in favor of either party,after noting the detailed statutory regime,the political nature of the appointment of the members of the board of trustees,the retirement system corporate status,and the board powers to sue and be sued and to buy and sell property.
turning to the factor considering whether the entities concerns are local or statewide,we conclude that this factor counsels in favor of sovereign immunity.in assessing this factor,courts must consider whether the entity has statewide or localized jurisdiction,cash,at,and whether an entity functions are classified as typically state or unquestionably local,harter vernon,cir quoting hess,at.the retirement system covers public employees throughout the state.and like educating the state youth.stadium auth.ellerbe becket,cir,providing for public employees many of whom work for the state upon retirement is an area of statewide concern.accord pub.sch.ret,at t he retirement systems do not furnish the type of local services that political subdivisions typically furnish,such as water service,flood control,or rubbish disposal quoting moor cnty.of alameda,ernst,at w hen,as in this case,the retirement system is funded by annual appropriations from the state legislature,operates in part through the michigan treasury and in part through the state department of management and budget,operates on a statewide basis and serves officials,it is fair to say that the retirement system performs a traditional state function mcginty new york,cir although the retirement system does not service state employees exclusively,it assists in the business of the state by enabling the state to meet its pension and benefits obligations.
finally,the factor assessing how south carolina treats the entities points strongly in favor of sovereign immunity.this factor requires courts to consider the relevant state statutes,regulations,and constitutional provisions which characterize the entity,and the holdings of state courts on the question.harter,at.title of the code of laws of south carolina repeatedly uses the term state agency to refer to the south carolina retirement system and the term state agent to refer to the director of the retirement system.ann,to.the code also describes the south carolina public employee benefit authority as an administrative agency of state government.id.h.similarly,in layman,the south carolina supreme court characterized the retirement system as a state agency for purposes of ann,which permits an award of attorneys fees to the prevailing party in an action brought by or against the state or any political subdivision thereof.at.and in ahrens,the court analyzed whether,as an agency,the retirement system created a contract with the working retirees.at.indeed,south carolina courts have frequently referred to the individual pension plans of the retirement system as agencies.see,kennedy ret,police officers ret.city of spartanburg.
at bottom,we conclude that the relevant indicators strongly indicate that the retirement system and the trust are arms of the state of south carolina and are therefore protected under the eleventh amendment.this conclusion is consistent with the holdings of the overwhelming number of federal courts that have held that similar retirement systems in other states are arms of the state.see pub.sch.ret,at ernst,at mcginty,at.state employees ret.credit suisse,branch,cv c nkl,wl,at,ex rel.educ.ass of austin capital mgmt,d,cal.pub.emps.ret.moody,nos.c si,c jcs,wl,at,turner.teachers ret.fund,cv dfh jms,wl,at.june,larsen state employees ret,d,jmb grp.trust iv.mun.ret,sculthorpe.ret,hair.consol.ret,mello woodhouse,reiger.pub.emps.ret,retired pub.employees ass of,chapter california,united states south carolina,romney.
turning to the claims against the state officials,the plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that a s a result of defendants deduction from plaintiffs earnings,plaintiffs and the class have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable and immediate harm and injury to their property and rights under the laws and constitution of the united states.accordingly,they requested,among other relief,injunctions compelling defendants to immediately return to plaintiffs and the class all monies defendants have deducted as contributions to the retirement systems since july,and preventing for all time enforcement of the act.the plaintiffs contend that their requests for injunctive relief against the state officials are excepted from eleventh amendment protection under ex parte young.
first,we interpret the plaintiffs request for an injunction compelling the return of all monies defendants have deducted as contributions to the retirement systems as a claim for money damages.state officials sued in their official capacities for retrospective money damages have the same sovereign immunity accorded to the state.see buckhannon bd.care home.dep t of health human,edelman jordan,martin wood,cir.therefore,as did the district court,we hold that the plaintiffs claim against the state officials for the return of their contributions is barred by the eleventh amendment.
second,we agree with plaintiffs that their claim for the second injunction to prevent for all time the enforcement of the act is prospective and seeks to remedy an ongoing violation of federal law.see verizon,pub.serv.comm n,in determining whether the doctrine of ex parte young avoids an eleventh amendment bar to suit,a court need only conduct a straightforward inquiry into whether the complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective first alteration in original quoting coeur tribe,at,concurring in part and concurring in the judgment see also.office for protection advocacy stewart,constantine rectors visitors of george mason,cir.
nonetheless,for a reason supported by the record but not relied on by the district court,we conclude that the district court was also correct in dismissing the claim seeking the second injunction against state officials.see greenhouse mcg capital,cir w e may affirm the dismissal by the district court upon the basis of any ground supported by the record even if it is not the basis relied upon by the district court quoting ostrzenski seigel,cir.
the ex parte young exception to eleventh amendment immunity applies only where a party defendant in a suit to enjoin the enforcement of an act alleged to be unconstitutional has some connection with the enforcement of the act.at see also wildlife fed limehouse,cir lytle griffith,cir.thus,we have held that a governor can not be enjoined by virtue of his general duty to enforce the laws,waste mgmt.holdings.gilmore,cir,and that an attorney general can not be enjoined where he has no specific statutory authority to enforce the statute at issue,mcburney cuccinelli,cir.in contrast,we have held that a circuit court clerk bore the requisite connection to the enforcement of state marriage laws to be enjoined from enforcing them,because the clerk was responsible for granting and denying applications for marriage licenses.see bostic schaefer,cir,cert.denied.
the requirement that there be a relationship between the state officials sought to be enjoined and the enforcement of the state statute prevents parties from circumventing a state eleventh amendment immunity.see mcburney,at lytle,at wilkinson,dissenting.as the court explained in ex parte young,if the constitutionality of every act passed by the legislature could be tested by a suit against the governor and attorney general,based upon the theory that the former,as the executive of the state,was,in a general sense,charged with the execution of all its laws,and the latter,as attorney general,might represent the state in litigation involving the enforcement of its statutes,it would eviscerate the fundamental principle that states can not,without their assent,be brought into any court at the suit of private persons.at quoting fitts mcghee.
in this case,the plaintiffs named as defendants members of the state budget and control board,the executive director of the state budget and control board,and the executive director of the public employee benefit authority,seeking to enjoin them from deducting from the plaintiffs paychecks the contributions mandated by the act.the state budget and control board and the public employee benefit authority serve as of the retirement system,ann,and south carolina law vests general administration and responsibility for the proper operation of the retirement system in the public employee benefit authority,id.but neither the state budget and control board nor the public employee benefit authority has responsibility for ensuring that employee contributions to the retirement system be deducted from the employees paychecks and transmitted to the retirement system.employers of covered employees are required to deduct the requisite contributions from the employees paychecks and furnish the withheld amounts to the retirement system,and any person who fails to remit withheld contributions to the retirement system is guilty of a misdemeanor and must be punished by fine or imprisonment,or both.id.see also id.a.the code of laws of south carolina nowhere gives the retirement system,the trust,or the trustees and administrators of the retirement system the authori
