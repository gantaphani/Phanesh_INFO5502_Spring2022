introduction 
after being admitted to stanford medical center stanford for treatment of a terminal illness,robert darrough darrough applied for benefits and appointed a law firm,health advocates,llp health advocates,to represent him in all matters relating to that application.following darrough death,his application was denied.health advocates requested an administrative hearing under welfare and institutions code section to contest that denial.the administrative law judge dismissed the request because health advocates had failed to comply with the requirement that it obtain authorization to pursue the matter from either darrough estate or his heirs.health advocates then obtained from the probate court the appointment of one of its attorneys as special administrator of darrough estate to pursue the claim.following that appointment,health advocates sought a rehearing of the decision dismissing its earlier request for an administrative hearing.the request for a rehearing was denied.health advocates responded by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court.the superior court issued the writ,ordering a rehearing on darrough application for benefits.
we reverse.darrough authorization of health advocates to act as his agent was revoked by his death.health advocates was required to obtain new authorization from either darrough estate or his heirs to contest the denial of darrough application.health advocates failed to obtain that authorization in a timely manner.therefore,the trial court erred in issuing the writ of mandate.
factual and procedural background 
application for 
on october,darrough,suffering from a terminal illness,was admitted to stanford.darrough completed an application for benefits on november,and on the same day signed a form appointing health advocates as his authorized representative regarding his application.in its writ petition,health advocates describes itself as a law firm that represents stanford with regard to collections.the form recites that darrough retains,authorizes and empowers health advocates to represent him and act on his behalf as his authorized representative regarding his application for eligibility and benefits,including completing and signing all application forms and related documents,and prosecution of all fair hearing and other administrative and judicial proceedings required for the enforcement of his rights.capitalization omitted.the form further provides that darrough consent s,authorize s and empower s health advocates to obtain and release all information from and to all private and public sources related to any benefits to which he may be entitled and that darrough agrees that the relevant public agencies would direct all telephone calls,notices,forms,documents,correspondence,medical records and reports to health advocates.capitalization omitted.
on november,the el dorado county department of social services county received darrough application.darrough died the next day,november.on december,county denied darrough application for benefits because he had failed to provide some required information.
administrative proceedings 
on march,health advocates filed a request for an administrative hearing.see welf.its letter states,in pertinent part the claimant darrough has authorized us to request a fair hearing on behalf.we disagree with the action taken by the county in denying our client claim and respectfully request that a fair hearing be scheduled forthwith.health advocates attached a copy of the november,form signed by darrough appointing it as his authorized representative.
however,shortly thereafter,health advocates,apparently recognizing that it could not rely upon darrough authorization to request the hearing,tendered another authorized representative form.this one,dated march,recited the applicant as david reil for robert darrough deceased.capitalization omitted.reil had been a friend of darrough who had provided him with room and board for the previous five years.in addition,reil had a durable power of attorney for the exclusive purpose of making health care decisions on darrough behalf.
on june,a hearing was conducted by an administrative law judge alj.county urged that health advocates lacked standing to request the hearing.county cited several regulations found in the manual of policies and procedures mpp promulgated by the california department of social services.
section of the mpp provides a state hearing shall be available to a claimant who is dissatisfied with a county action and requests a hearing in the manner set forth below.claimant is defined as the person who has requested a state hearing and is or has been any of the following a representative of the estate of a deceased applicant or recipient.c c.section goes on to state if the prospective claimant dies before filing a request for a state hearing,a request may only be filed by those individuals specified in section.italics added.section identifies those individuals as the executor or administrator of the estate if there is a probate proceeding or as an heir if there is no probate.
because darrough died before a request was made for a hearing to contest county denial of his application and because health advocates was not a proper representative of darrough interests as defined by section,county urged that health advocates lacked standing to request a hearing.a request for a hearing shall be dismissed by a written hearing decision when the person who requests the hearing does not have standing to request the hearing.
at the administrative hearing,health advocates acknowledged that in order to proceed with the request for a hearing,it would have to have a new ar authorized representative form dated on or after the date of the notice of action signed by somebody who has standing to appoint us as ar.health advocates explained that first it had unsuccessfully tried to contact darrough mother that next it had located one of darrough cousins but the individual was uncooperative and that finally it had obtained the authorization from reil health advocates stated that reil had informed it that darrough had left no estate.
the alj concluded that health advocates lacked standing,and,in an order filed on june,dismissed its request for a hearing.primarily,the alj relied upon the mpp regulations to conclude that when a prospective claimant dies before filing a request for state hearing,a request may only be filed by or on behalf of the decedent estate by either the legal representative of a decedent estate that is,the or or a relative.the alj found that the authorization form signed by reil did not meet this criteria because i t is undisputed that reil is neither a legal representative of darrough estate nor a relative.reil is therefore not a claimant under mpp sections.c and and can not appoint an authorized representative under mpp section.
in addition,the alj relied upon section of the mpp to find that the authorized representative form signed by darrough on november,did not confer standing upon health advocates.that regulation provides the claimant may authorize a person or organization to represent during all aspects of the hearing process by signing and dating a written statement to that effect if the claimant is not present at the hearing,the written statement authorizing a representative to act on behalf of the claimant for hearing purposes shall be signed and dated by the claimant on or after the date of the action or inaction with which the claimant is dissatisfied.the alj explained the date of the county denial of the application was december,and it is undisputed that the date of death was november,prior to that denial.the alj therefore reasoned that because the november authorization was not signed and dated on or after the date of the action or inaction with which the claimant is dissatisfied,as required by mpp section,the form could not confer standing on health advocates to request the hearing.
on june,health advocates filed a petition in the probate court to have jim smith one of its employees appointed as special administrator of darrough estate to pursue darrough claim for benefits,subd.r.a declaration from one of health advocates attorneys averred that a review of all relevant records indicated that darrough left no next of kin.
on june,the superior court granted the petition.it appointed smith as special administrator of darrough estate for the sole purpose of allowing him to perform those acts which would or could lead to obtaining health care benefits on behalf of darrough.smith is granted no authority to disburse property,nor take possession of any assets.special letters are issued for the limited purpose of obtaining benefits for darrough.
on july,health advocates sought a reopening of its request for a hearing on county denial of darrough application.health advocates urged that it had standing to do so because of the probate court appointment of smith as special administrator 
the department of health services department,now known as the department of health care services,denied the request by operation of law because it took no action within days of receiving the request 
trial court proceedings 
on march,health advocates,as counsel for smith in his capacity as special administrator of darrough estate,filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court.code civ.the petition contended that department abused its discretion in denying health advocates request for a rehearing because health advocates had produced important new evidence of standing the probate court appointment of smith as special administrator of darrough estate.the petition therefore sought a writ from the superior court directing department to grant a rehearing on darrough application for.
department opposed the petition.in particular,it urged that health advocates evidence to establish standing was actually evidence that,in the exercise of due diligence,health advocates could have produced when health advocates first requested a hearing.that is,department argued that health advocates should have sought smith appointment as special administrator from the outset.
in its reply to department opposition,health advocates urged it had reasonably believed that darrough november authorization permitted it to request the hearing in march and that once it learned that department position was that it lacked standing,it obtained the necessary authorization from the probate court.
the trial court issued a tentative ruling to grant the petition.it found that decisional and statutory law permitted health advocates,as darrough authorized representative,to request a hearing on department denial of his application.following a short hearing,the trial court granted department request to defer making its ruling and to permit supplemental briefing.
after receiving further briefing and conducting a second hearing,the trial court granted health advocates petition.it explained 
the alj decision is arbitrary and capricious and is not supported by law or by any evidence.
welfare and institutions code section states that any person who is refused the opportunity to apply for public social services may,through an authorized representative,request and be accorded an opportunity for a state hearing.
darrough was refused an opportunity to complete his application for such benefits because he was dead by the time department notified him that his application was incomplete.
health associates,as darrough authorized representative,has standing to request a hearing for him.welfare rights organization crison crisan cal d.
welfare and institutions code section contains no requirement that the authorized representative must be appointed after the applicant claim is denied.department would have no power to add a requirement to the statute by means of a manual of procedures,even if that manual had been adopted as a regulation.department,however,makes no showing that the manual was adopted as a regulation in the manner required by law.the manual,however,if it was in fact promulgated by the department of health services,constitutes evidence of an interpretation of the statute by the administrative agency that administers it.the interpretation,however,is not within the zone of reasonableness.it arbitrarily excludes the hospital that cared for darrough during his last illness from the right to be reimbursed for such care,even if darrough was indigent and therefore qualified under the program to receive such care.there is no evidence in the administrative record that the legislature intended such a result,and no reason is given by department why the legislature would do so 
the court does not believe that the legislature intended the result sought by department in this case.department position is that,because darrough died five days after he appointed an authorized representative pursuant to welfare institutions code section,and one day after he applied for benefits,the hospital in which he died can not be reimbursed for the cost of caring for him before his death unless it commences a probate proceeding to obtain the appointment of a special administrator to apply for such reimbursement.
to be eligible for benefits,a patient must be indigent,and by definition must not have an estate that requires probate.to require the patient duly appointed representative to commence such a proceeding for the sole purpose of permitting a live person to complete the patient application and to pursue the patient administrative remedies to get it approved,serves no useful purpose that the court can see,and therefore was not intended by the legislature.the argument by department that the statute is for the benefit of patients,not providers,is sophistry.the statute demonstrates in numerous ways that the legislature realizes that it can deliver medical care to the indigent only by encouraging doctors and hospitals to provide it.by interpreting the statute to allow the state to stiff the hospital because of a contingency,the death of the patient during the application process,that there is no evidence that the hospital could have either foreseen or prevented,does not facilitate the delivery of healthcare to the indigent,nor does it responsibly control the cost of such care.such interpretation only encourages hospitals to deny admittance to critically ill patients who are indigent,by increasing the cost of providing care to such patients because,if the patient dies,the hospital will have to hire a lawyer to commence a probate proceeding in order to obtain reimbursement 
nothing in this decision is meant to suggest that department does not have the discretion to determine in the first instance whether darrough was eligible for benefits and whether the medical services provided to him by the hospital were medically necessary.
a writ will issue commanding department to determine those issues,and not to refuse to do so because health advocates do not have standing to present them.
this appeal by department follows.
discussion 
the standard of review 
the nature of a petition under section is to challenge a specific decision in an administrative hearing as to a particular individual.conlan bontá th,d.the inquiry in such a case shall extend to the questions whether among other things there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.abuse of discretion is established if the respondent here,department has not proceeded in the manner required by law,the order or decision is not supported by the findings,or the findings are not supported by the evidence.code civ,subd.b.the trial court determined that department had abused its discretion in refusing to grant health advocates request for a rehearing.in making that determination,the relevant facts were not disputed.the parties disagreed,instead,about the proper interpretation of darrough november,authorization form,the regulations in the mpp,and the relevant statutory law.department appeal of the trial court issuance of a writ of mandate therefore presents questions of law.accordingly,we exercise de novo review of the trial court decision granting relief to health advocates.professional engineers in california government kempton cal th,d.as we now explain,the trial court erred in finding that department denial of health advocates rehearing request was an abuse of discretion.
the authorized representative form created an agency relationship 
to put the trial court ruling in proper context,we begin with darrough november,designation of health advocates as his authorized representative.this designation included broad grants of authority to health advocates.through it,darrough created an agency relationship health advocates became his agent in applying for and obtaining benefits,an agent is one who represents another,called the principal,in dealings with third persons.an agent power,unless coupled with an interest in the subject of the agency,is terminated by the death of the principal,subd.a.consequently,darrough death on november,ended the agency relationship and any authority health advocates had to act on his behalf.
health advocates argues that the authorized representative form did not create an agency relationship.health advocates relies upon the rule that one essential characteristic of an agency relationship is that the principal has the right to control the agent conduct concerning the matters entrusted to the agent.see,garlock sealing technologies,llc nak sealing technologies th,d.according to health advocates,darrough did not have the power to specifically direct health advocates as to how it should make application for his benefits,deal with the agency and carry out legal remedies in court to attain that end.instead,darrough simply sought the assistance of an advocate that could help him obtain his benefits.he had no expertise at all as to the regulations and he had no expertise as to how court proceedings were to be carried out.
we are not persuaded.in neither the administrative hearing nor the mandate proceeding did health advocates claim that it had no agency relationship with darrough.accordingly,it never produced any evidence to support the argument it now advances,and thus has forfeited the claim on appeal.in fact,at the administrative hearing,health advocates implicitly recognized that darrough death terminated its authority because it tendered the authorization form signed by reil in an effort to establish its authority to request a hearing on county denial of darrough application.
in any event,health advocates argument fails.if accepted,it would mean,for instance,that a client does not create an agency relationship when retaining counsel because the client,in health advocates words,does not have the power to specifically direct counsel as to how it should carry out legal remedies in court and has no legal expertise in the subject matter of the representation.the law does not have such a crabbed view of agency.a principal right to control the agent is a constant across relationships of agency,but the content or specific meaning of the right varies.thus,a person may be an agent although the principal lacks the right to control the full range of the agent activities,how the agent uses time,or the agent exercise of professional judgment.rest d agency,com.in sum,the november,authorized representative form created an agency relationship that terminated when darrough died five days later 
in the alternative,health advocates argues that concluding that death terminated the agency relationship contravenes the federal regulations governing.the regulations,however,do not address that question.rather,they provide that death does not terminate an applicant claim and that a third party can continue to pursue the claim.department does not disagree with that proposition.the point of contention is,instead,the nature of the authorization required for health advocates to continue to present the claim when,as here,the applicant dies before the claim is denied.the relevant federal regulations anticipate that if an applicant dies and the claim continues to be pursued,there will be compliance with applicable state law.for instance,effect of initial determination and right to reconsideration speak in terms of the right of the individual applicant or,if such individual is deceased,the right of the representative of such individual estate.as explained below,in the next section of our opinion,state law provides for a procedure to be followed in that situation,a procedure health advocates failed to follow in a timely manner.
in a similar vein,health advocates argues that department wishes to preclude a hospital from serving as authorized representative for a applicant.the assertion mischaracterizes department position.department agrees such representation is proper,and insists only that specific protocol be followed when the applicant dies.
welfare and institutions code sections and 
because darrough death terminated his agency relationship with health advocates,the trial court erred in relying upon welfare and institutions code section to support its ruling.the statute provides,in relevant part if any applicant for public social services is dissatisfied with any action of the county department relating to his application,he shall,in person or through an authorized representative,upon filing a request with the department which administers the public social service,be accorded an opportunity for a state hearing.this statutory language uses the present tense and therefore presupposes that the aggrieved applicant is alive at the time the request for a hearing is made,whether made personally or through an agent.
the trial court concluded that department,through section of its mpp,arbitrarily imposed a requirement that another individual a representative of darrough estate or one of darrough heirs reappoint health advocates to continue to pursue the application.this requirement,however,is necessitated by the principle that death terminates an agency relationship.therefore,absent such a reappointment,health advocates was no longer darrough legal representative.
further,section is consistent with statutory law.welfare and institutions code section provides nothing in this chapter governing administrative hearings on applications shall prevent the filing of the request for a hearing by the legal representative,or,if there is no authorized legal representative,by an heir of a deceased applicant or recipient,in behalf of the decedent estate,to the end that rights not determined at the time of death shall accrue to the estate of the applicant or recipient.thus,contrary to what health advocates suggests and the trial court found,neither the applicant estate nor the health care provider is left without a remedy when the applicant dies before a hearing can be requested to contest a denial of benefits.rather,the estate or provider may secure the appointment of a legal representative who can request a hearing.we therefore conclude that the trial court erred when it held that department position that health advocates must follow the protocol set forth in section was not within the zone of reasonableness.department position,in fact,reflected the pertinent legal principles and rules.
gatica illinois of public aid does not support health advocates 
health advocates reliance upon gatica illinois of public aid d,gatica to support the trial court judgment is misplaced.while gatica is superficially similar to this case,there are significant differences.
the factual similarities are the following.gatica was admitted to the hospital and applied for medical aid from the illinois department of public aid idpa.gatica died before his application could be completely processed.after his death,idpa denied the application.the hospital requested a hearing to contest that denial.the hospital relied upon the fact that gatica had orally authorized one of its employees to represent him in all matters relating to his application for medical aid.the hearing officer dismissed the hospital claim,finding the hospital had insufficient authorization to contest idpa denial of gatica application.id.at.here the similarities between the two cases end.
unlike this case,illinois had no administrative regulation or statute providing how to proceed if the patient died before an application for medical aid was denied.id.at.further,there was evidence that prior to that particular case,idpa had customarily permitted the hospital to pursue an appeal without written authorization when
