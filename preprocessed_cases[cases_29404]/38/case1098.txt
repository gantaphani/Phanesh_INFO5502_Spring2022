this third appeal by the united states,see united states gupta gupta ii,cir united states gupta gupta i,cir,involves fundamental errors about the resentencing of mahendra gupta,who was convicted a decade ago of medicare fraud involving millions of dollars,and an overarching issue about whether to reassign the case to a different district judge to conduct a fourth sentencing hearing.the united states argues that the district court erred in applying the sentencing guidelines,abused its discretion when it declined to order restitution,and imposed an unreasonable sentence,and the united states,for the second time,see gupta i,at,urges us to reassign the case to preserve the appearance of impartiality.because we agree with the united states about the procedural errors in applying the guidelines,the statutory mandate of restitution,and the need for reassignment,we need not evaluate the substantive reasonableness of gupta sentence.we vacate gupta sentence and remand for resentencing with an instruction that the case be reassigned to a different district judge.
background 
in september,a federal grand jury in the district of montana indicted gupta,three other persons,allegheny management company,and ten home healthcare agencies on counts stemming from medicare fraud.gupta i,at.the indictment charged that the defendants violated the regulation,which required home healthcare agencies to report services provided by related companies and provided that,subject to cost caps,medicare would reimburse the agency for only the cost,not the profits,to the related company.
gupta fraud was complicated and extensive.by using false claims,straw owners,and other deceptive actions to conceal the close relationship between the various persons,gupta i,at,gupta positioned himself on both sides of consulting contracts between allegheny and the home healthcare agencies,charged the agencies a higher price for the contracts and services he provided through allegheny,and obtained reimbursement of that profit from medicare.see gupta ii,at.
edward quinlan,one of the other individual defendants,was the putative owner of allegheny,but gupta created,funded,and profited from the management company.id.through allegheny,gupta was able to charge medicare between and per hour for the employees services as opposed to approximately per hour.in the first six months of allegheny business operations,it billed health care agencies more than million for consulting.id.at.between and,the home healthcare agencies claimed reimbursement for gupta and allegheny consulting fees without disclosing the relationships between the parties.id.at.from to,medicare reimbursed corporate defendants and one of the dismissed corporate defendants more than million in allegheny fees.id.some of gupta straw owners were family members,including gupta father,chandra shekhar his brother,vijay gupta and his brother,dev raj and shanno devi,who may have supported gupta in exchange for immigration assistance.see id.
in july,the case was transferred to the southern district of florida.gupta i,at.the district court severed the trial of one individual defendant and the three home healthcare agencies he owned,and the government later dismissed the charges against those four defendants.id.at.the district court also dismissed all charges against two other home healthcare agencies.
gupta,quinlan,kuldeep hajela,allegheny,and five home healthcare agencies proceeded to trial.the district court dismissed counts of the indictment,which left only one count of conspiracy to defraud medicare,and two counts of mail fraud,id,for trial.gupta i,at.before trial,the government submitted an expert report prepared by federal auditor gary young,who opined that allegheny received approximately six million dollars in profits over a period from consulting fees paid by related agencies.trial commenced in october.at the close of the government case,all nine defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal.the district court granted hajela motion and reserved ruling on the motions of the other defendants.id.
on november,the jury acquitted quinlan and convicted gupta,allegheny,and the five home healthcare agencies.id.gupta,allegheny,and the home healthcare agencies requested an extension of at least three weeks to file motions,and the district court granted their request.id.on november,allegheny again moved for a judgment of acquittal,and on december,gupta and the home healthcare agencies moved for a judgment of acquittal or,in the alternative,for a new trial.id.at.on january,the district court denied all pending motions.id.
the presentence investigation reports also were disclosed in late january,but sentencing was continued several times.id.gupta report assigned a base offense level of six,with an additional levels because the loss,according to the young report,was more than five million dollars but not more than ten million dollars,united states sentencing guidelines b o,two levels because the offense involved more than minimal planning,id.b a,and four levels because gupta was an organizer or leader in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive,id.a,for a total offense level of.the report stated that the guideline range was to months of imprisonment with two to three years of supervised release and that gupta could afford to pay a fine and restitution.because allegheny and the home healthcare agencies had repaid medicare million dollars,the report deducted that amount from the loss to medicare calculated by young and stated that r estitution is owed to medicare in the amount of.gupta was years old when the report was disclosed and disclaimed any history of mental or emotional problems,although he complained of anxiety and nausea.
gupta objected to the calculation of the loss that formed the basis for the enhancement and the enhancements for more than minimal planning and a leading role in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.gupta submitted an expert report prepared by stanley foodman,a certified public accountant,to substantiate his objection to the loss amount.foodman opined that medicare was not owed restitution because it did not reimburse the home healthcare agencies for any allegheny profits.gupta also objected to the lack of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and argued that a downward departure is warranted because a level severely the seriousness of the offense,the loss calculations vastly overstate the seriousness of the offense,the offense in which he was convicted is no longer a crime,and he offered extraordinary service to others.
on january,gupta and the five home healthcare agencies asked the district court to reconsider its denial of their motions for judgment of acquittal or a new trial.the government responded that the motion was untimely.the district court did not rule on that motion until more than a year and a half later.
on january,the district court held its first sentencing hearing.the district court stated that it would not allow the enhancement for a leading role in a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive because the fraud may have extended across the country but it was a very simple thing with regard to whether you check off the,whether it is a related company.the district court did not impose any sentence and took the motions for judgment of acquittal under advisement.the government submitted a sentencing memorandum and moved the court to appoint an independent auditing expert.the district court did not appoint the expert and continued sentencing again,until september,and then again,until the next month.
on october,almost three years after the original motions were filed,the district court entered judgments of acquittal for gupta and the five home healthcare agencies.for reasons that remain unclear,the district court also entered a judgment of acquittal for allegheny even though allegheny had never asked the district court to reconsider the earlier denial of its motion.gupta i,at.the government appealed and argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motions because they were untimely under federal rules of civil procedure and.id.the government also requested a reassignment to a different district judge.id.at.
in march,we ruled that the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider the late motions,vacated the judgments of acquittal,reinstated the jury verdicts,and remanded the case for resentencing,but we declined to order a reassignment on remand.id.at.we rejected the argument of the government that a supposedly sentence would be preordained and stated that there is no reason to doubt the judgment or impartiality of the district judge.id.at.we concluded that reassignment would require significant and unnecessary use of judicial resources.id.
on remand,the government filed a second sentencing memorandum and expert reports about loss prepared by jeff litvak and shirill garvey.gupta ii,at.litvak calculated the profits allegheny received from the home healthcare agencies.he opined that the loss to medicare was million dollars.id.at.
on november,the district court held a second sentencing hearing.the district court sentenced gupta to three years of probation on each conviction,to run concurrently,and fined him.id.at.the district court sentenced the five home healthcare agencies to three years of probation.the district court fined only two of the agencies,marshal medical and cardinal care,because the other three businesses were closed.id.gupta and the five agencies were excluded from medicare programs for five years.id.
the district court imposed these sentences reluctantly and restated its view that no wrongdoing had occurred.the district court expressed concern that the hospital that provided some of the same services the gupta agencies had provided charged more for those services 
a ll you did was throw out a home provider that charged less for us and got somebody who charged more.and if the government is concerned about it,i do think anybody suffered any loss,certainly not the government because they do mind paying more money than they were paying before.
the government argued that the measure of the loss was the profit for which allegheny was reimbursed by medicare and offered testimony from litvak to that effect,but t he district court denied the government request to include the litvak loss report in the sentencing record,id.at,and again stated that there was no loss to the government.the district court also stated,well,i been through this before.and i made a decision back then.and i said i not going to find any loss.and i stand by that t he circuit can sort it all out for us.the government urged the district court to impose a sentence that included some confinement to deter other potential fraudsters from using false invoices and false letters and straw people to take very deceptive actions that hid e the relationship between these parties.the district court reiterated its view that no crime has been committed and stated that it amazing to me that somebody could be convicted of a felony based upon a bureaucratic regulation.now i know you say,well,he made a false statement mail fraud or something.
gupta and the home healthcare agencies appealed their convictions and the government the sentences.id.the government challenged the sentences on three grounds the district court failed to consider and enhance gupta sentence on the basis of gupta leading role in the extensive fraud the district court failed to calculate loss and the sentences were substantively unreasonable.the government did not request restitution.gupta responded that an enhancement for a leading role in extensive criminal activity was unwarranted because the fraud was not extensive the district court correctly calculated a loss of zero and the sentences were substantively reasonable because the cost of the consulting services was below the medicare cost caps and the regulation no longer exists.
we affirmed all of the convictions and some of the sentences,but we granted the request of the government to vacate and remand the sentences for gupta and two home healthcare agencies,marshal medical and cardinal care.id.at see also id.at.we ruled that the district court erred when it declined to apply a enhancement to gupta sentence on the ground that gupta scheme was not otherwise extensive.id.at.we stated that,c ontrary to gupta assertions,the criminal activity was quite complex and is not susceptible to simple categorization as the failure to check a box on a medicare form.id.at.we remanded for the district court to determine whether gupta was the leader or organizer of the scheme.
we ruled that the finding of zero as the amount of loss was error for all defendants.id.at.we stated that the district court erred when it found that the loss was determined as the amounts by which each of the corporate defendants exceeded the applicable medicare reimbursement caps,which was equal to zero as such companies operated below the applicable caps.id.at.we rejected the reasoning of the district court that the government did not mind paying up to such caps because a no harm,no foul argument was an insufficient rationale by which to calculate loss.id.at.we stated that the amount the government paid in response to the false claims is an appropriate measure of damages.id.at.we remanded for the district court to award damages.
on remand,the government argued that the district court should calculate loss by determining the amount of profit to allegheny that the regulation prohibited.the government argued that litvak estimation of loss was reasonable and that the report prepared by foodman was inaccurate because foodman did not attend the trial,used figures from internal revenue audits that did not consider the fraud in the case,and included as expenses fraudulent transfers from allegheny to other companies.the government also contested foodman conclusion that the government sustained no real loss because allegheny was paid the market rate on the grounds that market rates are irrelevant in fraud cases and the assumption that allegheny provided only legitimate services is unsound.the government urged the district court to impose a sentence within the guidelines range of to months of imprisonment because other potential fraudsters would not be deterred if gupta received only probation for his complex scheme.
gupta argued that we misapprehended the basis for the district court finding that there was no loss to medicare in this case,and that no loss occurred because allegheny made no profit on the work it did for gupta agencies.gupta urged the district court not to adopt an unfair focus on loss and to err on the side of caution.gupta argued for a downward departure from the guidelines range on the grounds that the loss calculations vastly overstate the seriousness of the offense,he did not personally profit from the violations,and his personal characteristics warrant a downward departure.gupta also argued that a downward variance was warranted because the violations in this case took place more than a decade ago a new rule promulgated by a federal agency abolished the related party regulation letters provided a glowing tribute to his extraordinary service to others he suffers from bipolar mood disorder,alcohol dependency,depression,hypertension,hypothyroidism,gastritis,and other physical and emotional ailments a custodial sentence was not necessary to protect the public from businesses that had closed and he,at almost years of age,would be deterred without going to jail.gupta urged the district court to impose a sentence of probation.
in march,the district court held a third sentencing hearing.the district court stated that gupta base offense level was six with a enhancement for more than minimal planning and a enhancement for a leading role in an extensive offense.the district court stated that t here a lot of leeway going either way between the litvak and foodman reports about loss and that we have this range of million down to zero between people who i assume all have good credentials and have made an analysis.the district court stated that it detect ed advocacy on both sides.
the district court could not recall whether it had sentenced allegheny and,upon being told that it had,suggested that it was confused about the moniker defendant for the purposes of the loss calculation.although the district court was supposed to be sentencing gupta,the parties were calculating loss by determining the gain or loss to allegheny.the government explained,with no objection from gupta counsel,that we had upheld the finding of the jury that gupta exercised control over allegheny profits,see gupta ii,at,and that gupta,for example,once used those profits to pay a personal debt to a diamond merchant.
after litvak testified,the district court expressed frustration and adopted a solomonic approach of splitting the baby to fix the amount of loss 
you know,this is going to help me a whole lot.i read these reports and figures until my eyes are going blind trying to understand all of this.i sure there advocates on both sides.the court says the guidelines do say court has to make a reasonable estimate of the loss.i sure there was some loss.i think the government has overstated it.the defense has probably understated it.it not a matter of restitution in this court.i not going to award restitution.i going to let the board decide those issues.
i just going to pick a figure,like any jury would,about half way in between.and i pick million,and that will be the amount that is a reasonable estimate,i guess,that i make.
the district court used the sentencing guidelines to calculate an enhancement for the amount of loss,for a total offense level of.
the district court sua sponte asked defense counsel whether gupta would accept responsibility the appellate court has now determined that this was a related company.does he wish to accept responsibility at this time he has no other place to go.defense counsel replied,i mean,in hindsight now,since there has been a determination by the jury and by the circuit that they were related parties,then i think it fair to say he accepts responsibility for that.
the government stated that an acceptance of responsibility here is absurd,but the district court disagreed because it thought during earlier proceedings that there might not be a crime.the district court reduced gupta offense level by two points,to.the government asked that gupta personally articulate his acceptance of responsibility,but the district court declined the request.the district court stated that the guidelines range was to months of imprisonment.
the district court next considered gupta request for a downward departure.the district court stated that it must determine what a fair and reasonable sentence would be under the governing statute,a.the district court recalled that there had been two refusals to prosecute this by other attorneys,one in chicago and one in montana,and the regulation that was so do remember which one it was that was written by some bureaucrat.and they said it ought to be clarified.and the government said,do clarify.it gives us more flexibility that way.defense counsel reiterated that the regulation was withdrawn in,the government recalled testimony from trial that gupta knew that he was committing a crime,and the district court stated that it could consider the abolition of the regulation as part of the nature and circumstance of the offense factor under section.the district court stated that it s aw that,this was not an act of greed because gupta could have made these charges a lot more and still been within the cap.and the government would have willfully paid it.the district court recalled testimony that gupta had not controlled allegheny and stated,but the court of appeals said that he did control it.so we have to deal with that.
the district court reiterated its belief that gupta criminal activity had been overstated 
i would find that i think that the amount of money overstates the seriousness of this particular crime.i think you see what a mess we had trying to even figure it out.and i even have accountants who are willing to come in and say that there was no loss.obviously,the circuit is saying you ca find that there was no loss.there had to be some loss.so i taken my best estimate,a reasonable estimate based upon the wide disparity of opinions.and i still think that the amount of loss overstates the seriousness of the crime.
the district court stated that it really d id see what can be accomplished with a man of this age,putting him in jail and mentioned an appeal involving a child pornography conviction in which we rejected a sentence of probation because,in the words of the district court,there are some real victims there.
the district court stated that a reasonable downward departure would be to about a level and first considered a sentence of probation with home confinement.upon determining that incarceration is required for offenses,the district court next considered a sentence of imprisonment for ten months.before the district court imposed sentence,defense counsel suggested that the district court depart an additional two levels downward,which would permit a sentence of probation with home confinement.the district court heard testimony from david rooney,gupta psychiatrist,about how gupta had been hospitalized,possibly for problems related to his alcohol dependency,and how incarceration would have a negative affect on his well being with regards to his need for treatment of bipolar mood disorder.the district court fe lt that due to the nature of this thing,that confinement would just be very hazardous to gupta health and departed downward to a level ten.
the district court imposed a sentence of three years of probation,including months of home confinement,and fined gupta.the government requested restitution,but the district court stated that r estitution is going to be decided by the provider reimbursement review board.
the government appealed.although the government designated gupta,cardinal care,and marshal medical as appellees,it says nothing in its brief about the sentences of the home healthcare agencies.the government has abandoned any argument about those sentences,and we need not review them.united states,cir.
ii.standards of review 
we review findings of fact for clear error and application of the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states jackson,cir.a factual finding is clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it,the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.united states robertson,cir internal quotation marks omitted.although review for clear error is deferential,a finding of fact must be supported by substantial evidence.id.when a defendant challenges one of the factual bases of his sentence the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.this burden must be satisfied with reliable and specific evidence.united states sepulveda,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.we review a decision not to award restitution for abuse of discretion.united states remillong,cir per curiam.
iii.discussion 
our discussion of this appeal is divided in three parts.we first discuss the failure of the district court to calculate the guidelines range correctly we next discuss restitution and we then discuss reassignment of this case to a different district judge.because we conclude that a remand is necessary to correct procedural errors,we decline to evaluate the substantive reasonableness of gupta sentence.see united states collins,cir.we do not know what sentence the district court will impose on remand.thus,we would be rendering an advisory opinion if we were to pick a sentence and declare it to be reasonable.id.
