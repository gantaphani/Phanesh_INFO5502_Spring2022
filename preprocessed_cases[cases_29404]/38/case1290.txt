mary reeves reeves,the surviving spouse of veteran corby reeves reeves,appeals a judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court that rejected reeves assertion of clear and unmistakable error cue in an april decision of the board of veterans appeals board.see reeves shinseki,wl.vet.claims lexis veterans court decision.because we conclude that the veterans court misinterpreted b when it rejected reeves cue claim,we reverse and remand.
background 
reeves served in the united states army from june until november.he worked as a heavy mortar crewman during several combat offensives and was awarded three bronze stars.in september,reeves filed a claim seeking disability benefits for bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.reeves stated during my service i experienced a hearing loss due to firing an mm mortar and from treatment of malaria with quinine my hearing,especially the right ear,has been deteriorating ever since my active duty.reeves also submitted a medical opinion from his physician,dunlap,who stated that he had diagnosed reeves with bilateral,hearing loss in and that he attributed this hearing impairment to noise exposure or to treatment with quinine for malaria in addition,reeves submitted records of an audiogram,conducted soon after his claim was filed,which indicated that he suffered from severe bilateral hearing loss.
at a hearing before a department of veterans affairs va rating board in may,reeves testified that he had first noticed his hearing loss in the summer of when he could not hear a watch tick.reeves also testified at the hearing,averring that when she married reeves in she had noticed that he suffered from hearing loss.
in addition,reeves submitted statements from officers with whom he had served during world war ii.these officers stated that he had been exposed to noise from mortar fire and that he had been treated for malaria while in service.major robert mcgraw,who served with reeves in company d of the infantry,stated that reeves had to be with his mortars during training exercises and during several combat offensives.mcgraw further asserted that b eing so close to these guns during the extensive firing they received over such a long period of time,the ear could be easily damaged from the muzzle blast of the mm mortar.
in april,the board denied reeves claim.although it acknowledged that he was exposed to mortar fire and had been treated for malaria while in service,the board noted that the earliest clinical recording of hearing impairment was by reeves private physician in november.the board concluded that the hearing loss that had been documented in was too remote from reeves active service to be caused by either his exposure to mortar fire or treatment for malaria while in service.the board decision became final when reeves did not file an appeal.
in,the board granted reeves application to reopen his claim.see providing that a claim will be reopened if new and material evidence is presented or secured.the board cited to new evidence from a physician who stated that he had treated reeves from to and that reeves had experienced hearing difficulties during this time period.the physician further asserted that reeves hearing problems could have resulted from his military service,the firing of the mm mortar and the treatment of malaria with quinine.the board also cited to a july statement from another physician,as well as a may statement from a va medical examiner,both of which indicated that reeves hearing loss was likely due to noise exposure while in the military.accordingly,the board determined that the record contained sufficient evidence to establish that reeves hearing impairment was incurred during his military service.it therefore awarded him disability benefits,with an effective date of june,the date he filed his application to reopen his claim.
in december,reeves filed a motion for revision of the board decision,arguing that he was entitled to an earlier effective date for the award of disability benefits.he asserted that the decision contained cue because the board had failed to apply the combat presumption contained in section b.the board rejected this argument,however,stating that the application of the combat presumption was unnecessary because the decision accepted the fact that reeves had suffered acoustic trauma in service.the board explained that s ince actual evidence of noise exposure in service was available,the board had no need to apply the combat presumption.
the board acknowledged that the decision was not a model of legal and factual exposition,at least by current standards.it noted that in evaluating whether there was a nexus between reeves injury and his subsequent hearing disability,the board reached a conclusion on nexus which might have been based on the expertise of one of the three signatory board members,who was a medical doctor.while relying upon the medical expertise of a board member would be highly improper under current law,the board determined that current standards were not applicable in the context of a claim alleging cue in an earlier board decision.
on appeal,the veterans court affirmed.it rejected reeves assertion that the evidence of record in was such that the board had no choice but to resolve in his favor any doubt on the question of whether his hearing disability was incurred in service.veterans court decision,wl,at.vet.claims lexis,at.the court also determined that under the law extant in,the board was not precluded from relying upon its own medical judgment in concluding that reeves hearing loss had not been incurred in service.id.at.vet.claims lexis at.the court stated,moreover,that a mere disagreement with how the facts were weighed or evaluated is not enough to substantiate a cue claim.id.at.vet.claims lexis at.
on february,reeves filed a notice of appeal with this court.he died three days later.on april,reeves filed a motion to be substituted for her husband on appeal.this motion,which included a copy of reeves certified death certificate,stated that reeves was entitled to receive any benefits that were due and payable to her husband as of the date of his death.on june,this court granted reeves motion to substitute for her husband on appeal,without prejudice to the government ability to make arguments in its appeal brief on the question of whether substitution was appropriate.
discussion 
this court authority to review decisions of the veterans court is circumscribed by statute.see.although we have no authority to review challenges to factual determinations or the application of a statute or regulation to the facts of a particular case,w e have recognized that where adoption of a particular legal standard dictates the outcome of a case based on undisputed facts,we may address that issue as a question of law.halpern principi.
the government makes two principal arguments.first,it contends that reeves has no standing to be substituted for her husband on appeal because she has not filed a claim for accrued benefits with the.second,it argues that there is no cue in the board decision because the failure to apply the combat presumption contained in section b was harmless error.we find neither of these arguments persuasive.
substitution 
pursuant to rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure,if a party dies while his appeal is pending before an appellate court,his personal representative may be substituted for him if a party dies after a notice of appeal has been filed or while a proceeding is pending in the court of appeals,the decedent personal representative may be substituted as a party on motion filed with the circuit clerk by the representative or by any party.fed.a.there is no dispute that reeves died after he had filed his notice of appeal with this court.there is likewise no dispute that reeves is her husband personal representative as his surviving spouse,and that she filed a timely motion to be substituted for him on appeal.reeves,therefore,meets the prerequisites for substitution under rule a.
as the government correctly notes,however,t he question of substitution is separate from that of standing.richard west.procedural rules,such as rule a,simply describe the manner in which parties are to be substituted in federal court once it is determined that the applicable substantive law allows the action to survive a party death.robertson wegmann,d citations and internal quotation marks omitted.the government argues that reeves has no standing to be substituted for her deceased husband.it asserts that mere eligibility for accrued benefits is not enough to confer standing and that the filing of an claim is required before a survivor can be substituted on a pending appeal.we disagree.even assuming arguendo that standing can be established only if a surviving spouse files an claim,reeves motion to be substituted for her husband qualifies as an informal claim for accrued benefits see kelsey west,explaining that a notice of appeal,which contained a veteran death notice,constituted an informal,derivative,claim for accrued benefits by the veteran surviving spouse landicho brown,concluding that the filing of a motion for substitution,which was accompanied by the veteran death notice,qualified as an informal claim for accrued benefits.indeed,the va current practice is to treat motions for substitution and claims for accrued benefits as one and the same.substitution of party in case of claimant death,va fast letter,to request substitution,an eligible survivor may file either a claim for accrued benefits or a request for substitution.accrued benefits claims and requests for substitution shall be treated as one and the same.
as we explained in rodriguez west,any communication can qualify as an informal claim if it is in writing indicates an intent to apply for veterans benefits and identifies the particular benefits sought.see.here,reeves motion for substitution,which was filed on april,stated that her husband,a claimant seeking va disability benefits,had an appeal pending before this court when he died on february,and she,as reeves surviving spouse,was eligible to receive the accrued benefits due as of the date of his death pursuant to a.reeves attached a certified copy of her husband death certificate to her motion seeking substitution.because reeves motion for substitution clearly evinced an intent to obtain the benefits due and payable to her husband as of the date of his death,it qualifies as an informal claim for accrued benefits.
the supreme court allows substitution in situations analogous to that presented here.recently,in henderson shinseki,the court granted the motion of a surviving spouse to be substituted for her veteran husband who died while his case was pending before the court,d.significantly,the surviving spouse was allowed to substitute notwithstanding the fact that she had not yet filed an claim with the.we see no reason why this court should not follow a similar approach.
in henderson,the surviving spouse motion to substitute stated that she intend ed to submit all necessary materials to obtain accrued benefits with the va,but did not indicate that she had previously filed an claim.the government attempts to distinguish henderson by arguing that reeves might have had standing to substitute if her motion to substitute had stated that she intended to file an claim with the va in the future.we do not find this reasoning persuasive.standing is determined based upon the facts as they exist at the time the motion to substitute is filed.see paradise creations,u v sales,article iii standing,like other bases of jurisdiction,generally must be present at the inception of the lawsuit.see also keene united states,d the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the state of things at the time of the action brought.citations and internal quotation marks omitted.accordingly,whether or not a survivor states that he or she intends to file an claim with the va at some point in the future is not dispositive on the question of whether the survivor has standing to substitute on a pending appeal.see park forest,cir explaining that events occurring after the filing of a complaint can not be used to establish standing.
the government argues that a survivor should be required to file an claim with the va before being allowed to substitute on appeal because this court is not permitted to make factual findings on the issue of whether a particular individual qualifies as an appropriate claimant.in situations in which the appropriate beneficiary is in dispute,it might be appropriate to remand for a resolution of this issue.see zevalkink brown.here,however,there is no dispute that reeves,as the surviving spouse,is entitled to any benefits due and unpaid to her husband at the time of his death.see a a see also bailey principi,w hen the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of the claim,this court has treated the question as a matter of law that we are authorized by statute to address.texas instruments,united states,explaining that there is no need to remand a case to determine an issue which legally could be decided in only one way citations and internal quotation marks omitted.because there is no dispute that reeves is entitled to receive any benefits due and payable to her husband at the time of his death,we see no reason that she should be required to file a separate claim with the va before being allowed to substitute for her husband on appeal 
the government argument that reeves must file a motion for accrued benefits with the va before this court can allow her to substitute is an attempt to superimpose the va claim processing requirements upon this court rules for substitution.the va,quite clearly,has no authority to dictate to this court the procedures that must be followed when allowing a claimant to substitute on a pending appeal.
the va disability compensation system is not meant to be a trap for the unwary,or a stratagem to deny compensation to a veteran who has a valid claim comer peake,see also barrett nicholson,the government interest in veterans cases is not that it shall win,but rather that justice shall be done,that all veterans so entitled receive the benefits due to them.notwithstanding the recent death of her husband,reeves filed a timely motion to substitute which clearly indicated an intent to seek accrued benefits and has diligently prosecuted her appeal before this court.under such circumstances,her failure to file an additional claim with the va should not result in the forfeiture of her right to the compensation due to her husband at the time of his death significantly,the government has suffered no prejudice as a result of the failure to file a claim with the va because reeves motion to substitute clearly put it on notice that she intended to seek accrued benefits.
ii.section 
congress recently enacted legislation expressly authorizing an claimant to substitute for a deceased veteran 
if a claimant dies while a claim for any benefit under a law administered by the secretary,or an appeal of a decision with respect to such a claim,is pending,a living person who would be eligible to receive accrued benefits due to the claimant under section a of this title may,not later than one year after the date of the death of such claimant,file a request to be substituted as the claimant for the purposes of processing the claim to completion.
any person seeking to be substituted for the claimant shall present evidence of the right to claim such status within such time as prescribed by the secretary in regulations.
substitution under this subsection shall be in accordance with such regulations as the secretary may prescribe.
under this provision,an claimant can be substituted for a veteran who dies while a claim or an appeal of a decision with respect to such a claim is pending.id.in breedlove shinseki,the veterans court determined that while section authorizes substitution in proceedings at the va,it does not directly authorize substitution in cases in which a veteran dies while his case is pending before a court,per curiam.in support,the court noted that the statute refers to a claimant and processing the claim,and that t his language indicates persons and events at the agency level,not parties to litigation in an appellate court.id.at.in addition,the court pointed to the fact that section explicitly provides that substitution will be governed by regulations prescribed by the secretary of veterans affairs and reasoned that i t would be incongruous to charge the secretary with promulgating regulations that would potentially affect whether substitution was available in a pending court proceeding.breedlove.at.
we need not decide whether the veterans court correctly determined that section does not directly authorize substitution in court proceedings.that issue is moot at least for purposes of the present appeal given that we agree with the court alternative holding,which is that even if section directly applies only to actions pending before the va,its enactment nonetheless undercuts the rationale for previous decisions that refused to allow a survivor to substitute when a veteran died while his appeal was pending before a court.see breedlove.at since congress has now created an avenue for an claimant to continue to pursue a veteran claim after the veteran death,the court henceforth will consider substitution,if requested,in all cases pending before the court regardless of the stage of briefing at the time of a veteran death.
prior to,the veterans court routinely allowed an claimant to be substituted for a veteran who died while his appeal was pending before the court.id.at.in landicho,however,the court reversed course and determined,based upon its interpretation of the overall statutory scheme for veterans benefits,that congress did not intend to permit substitution 
the overall statutory scheme creates a chapter disability compensation benefit that does not survive the eligible veteran death.it is only in the provisions in section that congress has set forth a procedure for a qualified survivor to carry on,to the limited extent provided for therein,a deceased veteran claim for va benefits by submitting an application for accrued benefits within one year after the veteran death.
at.in the court view,congress intended that a veteran claim would be extinguished upon his death.id.emphasizing that the statutes authorizing disability compensation for veterans make no provision for survivors.because a veteran claim died with him,a survivor could not be substituted on that claim,but was instead required to begin the lengthy claims process anew by filing his or her own claim for accrued benefits.id.at.
we sanctioned this approach to substitution in zevalkink.there we held that a surviving spouse had no standing to be substituted for a veteran who died while his appeal was pending before the veterans court.at.we concluded that the surviving spouse claim for accrued benefits was distinct from the veteran claim for disability compensation,and that a ny delay inherent in pursuing a separate claim does not constitute the kind of actual or threatened injury that confers standing.id.at.
subsequently,however,we refined our approach to substitution,concluding that a survivor had standing to be substituted for a deceased veteran in situations where substitution was required to protect the survivor legal interests.see padgett,at.in padgett,a veteran died after his appeal had been submitted to the veterans court,but before issuance of the court judgment in his favor.id.at.we determined that it was appropriate to allow the surviving spouse to substitute for her deceased husband and to give her the benefit of the veterans court judgment by issuing that judgment nunc pro tunc to the date of the veteran death.id.at.we explained that failure to give effect to the veterans court judgment would be improper because it would disregard the otherwise final determination of issues relating to the claim.id.we concluded,moreover,that the surviving spouse had standing to be substituted on the veteran appeal because of the continuing relevance and preclusive effect that the issues decided in his appeal would have on her own claim for accrued benefits.id.at.
in the wake of padgett,we observed that the right to substitute on appeal was not available in all circumstances.unless the refusal to allow substitution would adversely affect the claim,a survivor could not substitute for a deceased veteran,but had to begin the claims process anew by filing a separate claim.see phillips shinseki,concluding that substitution was appropriate where it would remove a significant roadblock from the survivor path to obtaining benefits.in hyatt shinseki,we concluded that a surviving spouse had no standing to substitute for her husband who died while his appeal was pending before the veterans court because her claim for would not be negatively impacted by the refusal to allow substitution.we explained that regardless of whether or not substitution were allowed,the surviving spouse would not be permitted to rely on evidence not already in her husband claims file when pursuing her claim for accrued benefits.id.at.
the enactment of section mandates a shift in our approach to substitution in veterans cases,because congress has deemed it both unfair and inefficient to require an claimant to restart the claims process after a veteran death,at.congress emphasized that a llowing substitution prevents unnecessary reworking of the same claim,allowing it to move forward from its current state of development to appropriate finality and saves families from facing unnecessary administrative hurdles.id.significantly,section specifically provides that an claimant can be substituted on a deceased veteran claim for the purpose of processing the veteran claim to completion.the statute thus makes clear that a veteran claim is not extinguished by his death.instead,it survives so that it can be processed to completion,thereby allowing the claimant to obtain any benefits due and payable to the veteran at the time of his death.see padgett shinseki.as discussed above,the premise of previous decisions refusing to allow substitution was that congress did not intend for a veteran claim to survive his death.because section rejects that premise,there is no continuing justification for refusing to allow an appropriate claimant to be substituted for a veteran who dies while his appeal is pending before this court.see phillips,at stating,in dicta,that section allows an claimant to be substituted on a deceased veteran appeal as a matter of course breedlove.at congress has indicated in enacting section that the veteran disability benefits claim does not die with the veteran and the claim by a survivor no longer represents a separate interest that must be separately pursued apart from the veteran underlying claim for benefits.
iii.cue claim 
turning now to the merits of the appeal,we reject the government contention that there is no cue in the board decision because the failure to apply section b was harmless error.that statute provides 
in the case of any veteran who engaged in combat with the enemy in active service with a military,naval,or air organization of the united states during a period of war,campaign,or expedition,the secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of of any disease or injury alleged to have been incurred in or aggravated by such service satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease,if consistent with the circumstances,conditions,or hardships of such service,notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation in such service,and,to that end,shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran.
congress enacted section b because of its concern that combat veterans faced major obstacle s when seeking to assemble the medical records necessary to establish that they suffered an injury or disease while in service,at.in many instances,medical records do not survive combat conditions.id.furthermore,due to the exigencies of battle,soldiers may not immediately seek medical treatment for injuries.id.accordingly,section b allows a combat veteran to use satisfactory lay or other evidence to establish that he was injured or incurred a disability while on active duty,even in cases where there is no official record that such injury or disability occurred.b.the statute,moreover,specifically provides that the va must resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran when determining whether a combat veteran incurred a particular injury or disability while in active service.id.
reeves argues that if the board had properly applied section b,her husband would have been entitled to a finding that the injury to his hearing occurred during combat with the enemy.she further asserts that the board erred by failing to resolve every reasonable doubt in her husband favor when denying his claim for benefits.
in response,the government acknowledges that the board failed to apply the section b presumption.it argues,however,that the board was not required to apply that presumption because the board was able to determine that reeves acoustic trauma was incurred in service by examining official records and lay statements showing that he was a mortarman subject to noise exposure in service.
the fundamental flaw in the government argument is that it conflates the question of whether reeves was exposed to acoustic trauma with the issue of whether he suffered permanent hearing loss while on active duty.when reeves filed his application for disability compensation,he asserted not only that he had suffered acoustic trauma,but also that this acoustic trauma led to hearing loss while he was in active service accordingly,even though the board accepted that reeves had suffered acoustic trauma,it was nonetheless required to apply the section b presumption to the separate question of whether he also suffered permanent hearing loss while on active duty.in short,although the record contained evidence of the cause of reeves disability acoustic trauma from mortar blasts and the drugs used to treat malaria he still had the right to invoke the section b presumption in order to show that he incurred the disability itself while in service.see shedden principi,emphasizing the distinction between the cause of a veteran disability and the disability itself.the board erred,therefore,in concluding that since evidence of reeves noise exposure was of record,use of the combat presumption was unnecessary.
the situation here parallels that presented in dambach gober.there,a combat veteran service medical records showed that he had been treated for tonsillitis and other infections while serving in vietnam,but he sought to rely upon the section b presumption to establish that he had also suffered from another condition,myocarditis,while in service.at.on appeal to this court,the veteran contended that the veterans court had misinterpreted section b by refusing to apply it to any of his illnesses because there was documentation in the record of some of his illnesses.id.at.we agreed,explaining that a combat veteran will receive the benefit of section b when seeking to establish that he suffered from a particular disease or condition while in service,even if the record contains evidence demonstrating that he was treated for other conditions while on active duty.id.
a similar analysis applies here.simply because the board accepted the fact that reeves suffered acoustic trauma in service does not mean that it was not required to apply the section b presumption to the separate issue of whether he suffered hearing loss while on active duty.if reeves had been able to use the section b presumption to show that he incurred a permanent hearing disability in service,it presumably would have been far easier for him to establish that there was a nexus between his military service and the severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with which he was afflicted after leaving the military.instead of attempting to establish that the acoustic trauma he suffered while in the military led to hearing loss following his service,reeves would only have had to show that the hearing disability he incurred in service was a chronic condition that persisted in the years following his active duty.we reject,therefore,the government argument that the failure by the board to apply the section b combat presumption was merely harmless error.
finally,we must emphasize that s ection makes it abundantly clear that special considerations attend the cases of combat veterans.jensen brown.in denying reeves disability claim,we see no evidence that the board afforded him the benefit of every reasonable doubt on the question of whether his hearing loss was incurred in service.see b requiring that the va resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of a combat veteran when determining whether he incurred an injury or condition in service.of record before the board were several pieces of evidence indicating that there was a nexus between reeves hearing disability and the injury to his hearing.this evidence included statements from both reeves and his wife asserting that he had exhibited noticeable hearing impairment soon after he left the military statements from reeves military comrades asserting that he had to be with his mortars during several combat offensives and that his hearing could easily have been damaged from the muzzle blast of the mm mortar and a statement from reeves physician,dunlap,who stated that he had diagnosed reeves with bilateral,hearing loss in and that he attributed this hearing impairment to noise exposure or treatment with quinine for malaria.on remand,the veterans court will have the opportunity to reevaluate,using a correct application of section b,whether the board decision denying reeves disability compensation contains cue.
conclusion 
accordingly,the judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
reversed and remanded 
appellant shall have her costs.
because i do not agree with the court that the board of veterans appeals decision denying compensation for reeves hearing loss contained clear and unmistakable error,i respectfully dissent 
the court concludes that the board in committed clear and unmistakable error because it improperly failed to apply the predecessor of b to reeves claim of injury.i disagree.section b eases the requirements for a combat veteran to prove an injury,but it does not alter the separate requirement that the veteran establish a nexus between his injury and his current disability.because the board based its decision on the lack of proof of nexus,rather than the absence of evidence of inservice injury,section b had no application to the board decision,and the board failure to apply section b therefore did not constitute clear and unmistakable error.
to establish entitlement to compensation for a present disability,a veteran must demonstrate the existence of a present disability incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury and a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.shedden principi.the third element is the nexus requirement.fagan shinseki.
section b can assist the veteran in satisfying the second prong of the test that his or her initial injury was indeed incurred in service by liberalizing the methods of proof allowed.jensen brown.for veterans who engaged in combat with the enemy in active service with the military,the statute directs the dva to 
accept as sufficient proof of of any disease or injury alleged to have been incurred in or aggravated by such service satisfactory lay or other evidence of service incurrence or aggravation of such injury or disease notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of such incurrence or aggravation in such service,and,to that end,shall resolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran.
b emphasis added.
the statute addresses the manner in which a veteran may prove that he incurred an injury or disease during service.it does not address the question whether that injury or disease is causally related to the veteran current disability.as both this court and the court of appeals for veterans claims have repeatedly held,section b does not serve to show nexus,a causal relationship between an injury and a subsequently diagnosed disability.davidson shinseki,secti
