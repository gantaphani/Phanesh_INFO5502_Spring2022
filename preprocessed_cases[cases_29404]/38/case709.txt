background 
masterson medical reports show a history of arrhythmia,hyperglycemia,hypercholesterolemia,a small disc herniation at without nerve impingement,hypertension generally controlled with medication,mild venous insufficiency,osteoarthritis,and fibromyalgia.various physicians treated masterson over the course of her claimed disability period beginning september.the trial record contains numerous medical records,and we summarize the significant reports herein.masterson saw mark greenfield,on november,complaining of back pain.an mri revealed degenerative disc disease from through,central disc bulging at,and a small central disc herniation at without nerve impingement.greenfield treated masterson with a series of steroid nerve blocks and pain medication.
masterson saw lisa mcpeak,on february,for a consultative examination at the direction of the missouri office of disability determination.masterson mainly complained of arthritic problems in her back,neck,shoulders,hands,hips,and knees.masterson reported that she lived with three grandchildren ages ten,eleven,and fourteen.she was able to care for herself independently and assist in the care of her grandchildren.she could cook,perform light cleaning,and lift objects weighing ten to twenty pounds.on examination,masterson was able to sit,stand,walk,handle items,hear,and speak without significant problems.she was also able to get on and off the examination table,which required her to step up on a stool and then lay down from a seated position.her joint ranges of motion and palpation did not reveal significant joint swelling or warmth,but she did have crepitus in her knees and wrists.masterson reflexes and general strength were normal.mcpeak noted that masterson experienced generalized joint tenderness,muscle tenderness,and some limitations due to her arthritic complaints.mcpeak reported that masterson appeared to have functional mobility skills,although they were slow.mcpeak determined that masterson experienced probable osteoarthritis,a history of syndrome an arrhythmia,controlled hypothyroidism,and hypertension.mcpeak also noted that masterson heart and thyroid problems appeared fairly well controlled.later ab and rheumatoid factor testing was negative.
finally,a medical record dated december,indicated that a physician diagnosed masterson with fibromyalgia,and prescribed exercise and medication to control the condition.this diagnosis was repeated in two additional records the first in a letter written by a nurse used to excuse masterson from jury duty,and the second in a report wherein masterson reported the prior diagnosis.
at the administrative hearing,masterson testified that she was years old and had completed two years of college.she lived with and was the sole caretaker of her three grandchildren.regarding her daily activities,masterson testified that she woke her grandchildren in the morning for school,made herself breakfast,showered,washed dishes,helped her grandchildren with homework,and went to church.on good days,she completed household chores,including laundry,and cooked simple meals.she also went to the store but took along one of her grandchildren to do the lifting.
masterson past relevant work was as a property manager for an apartment building.this job required her to sit at a computer and type,perform inspections,file,deal with residents,decorate for holidays,work with vendors,clean,and make small repairs.masterson claimed that she became disabled on september,when she was no longer able to perform this job due to pain and an inability to walk.she testified that she was disabled due to insomnia and severe pain in her shoulders,back,neck,ankles,hips,and knees.masterson stated that a rheumatologist told her that she had fibromyalgia,and that she heard about it on television and believed that she had similar symptoms.masterson testified that she could stand for fifteen to twenty minutes before her legs hurt,walk one to two blocks before tiring,sit for fifteen to forty minutes until she experienced neck,back,and hip pain,lift five to ten pounds,and hold a pen for fifteen to twenty minutes before experiencing cramps.masterson testified that she could not squat due to pain in her hips,back,and knees,and that she occasionally experienced shortness of breath and chest pain.she claimed that her left leg had given out about five times since september.masterson also claimed that she sometimes experienced difficulty thinking,expressing her thoughts,and remembering things.
lynn allen curtis,testified as a medical expert at the administrative hearing.curtis testified that the medical evidence confirmed the diagnoses of arrhythmia,a history of hyperglycemia,hypercholesterolemia,a herniated nucleus pulposus or herniated disc at,hypertension,mild venous insufficiency,osteoarthritis,and fibromyalgia.curtis stated that she saw one diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the record.curtis testified that masterson arrhythmia was controlled with medication.there was no muscle atrophy or spasm,and no evidence of any impingement on the spinal cord due to masterson herniated disc.curtis believed that masterson hypertension was sometimes controlled with medication and her thyroid levels improved with therapy.curtis testified that the doctors gave no restrictions to masterson for her spurring.based on the medical evidence,curtis opined that masterson could stand and walk six hours per day and sit for six to eight hours per day if she could get up every twenty minutes.curtis further determined that masterson had no lifting restrictions,but she should not use her arms above her head on her right side.curtis gave no opinion regarding masterson abilities to bend,twist,squat,and climb because the record contained little medical evidence related to her back.
lesa keen,a vocational expert,also testified.keen testified that masterson only past relevant work as a property manager was typically considered skilled and light exertionally.however,masterson described it as heavy work.keen testified that a position typically allows for alternating among sitting,standing,and walking depending on the specific job duty,but not necessarily at will.
the alj posed a hypothetical question to keen based on an individual of masterson age,education,and past work experience with the residual functional capacity rfc to perform light work with a option.in response,keen testified that that person could perform work as a cashier,machine operator,and bench assembler.keen also identified sedentary jobs such as receptionist and order clerk,which did not include a option but included typical rest periods of a break,a lunch,and a break.keen stated that the jobs of cashier,machine operator,bench assembler,receptionist,and order clerk typically would not involve working above shoulder level.
following the hearing,the alj denied masterson claim after finding that her complaints of disabling pain were not credible when compared to masterson daily activities and the lack of medical evidence detailing objective findings.the alj determined that masterson could perform light or sedentary work without overhead work,including her previous work as a property manager as it is generally performed in the economy.thereafter,the appeals council denied masterson request for review.thus,the alj decision stands as the commissioner final decision.
ii.analysis 
masterson argues that the alj erred in determining that she retained the rfc to return to her past relevant work.she argues that the alj failed to fully investigate and make findings regarding the demands of her past work or her capabilities.
