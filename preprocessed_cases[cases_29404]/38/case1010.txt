carl edlund appeals from the denial of his application for social security disability and supplemental benefits.edlund has not engaged in substantial employment since june,claiming both physical and mental impairments dating back to.an administrative law judge alj denied his application for benefits,and the social security appeals council declined to review the alj decision.edlund then filed a complaint in the district court,which ruled in favor of the commissioner.edlund now appeals that decision.
because we believe the alj erred in finding that edlund failed to demonstrate a severe mental impairment under step of the evaluative framework,we reverse the district court decision upholding the commissioner denial of benefits and remand to the alj for a new step and step determination.
the appellant,carl edlund,is a fifty former sawmill laborer who left school after the eighth grade.edlund has also worked at various times as a dishwasher,leather cutter,cat loader,and dump truck driver.however,he has remained largely unemployed since june.
from december to june,and again from may until the time of his administrative hearing in june edlund was examined by a series of doctors following an initial knee injury and subsequent complaints of hip and lower back pain.in addition,in september,edlund was treated several times for a fractured rib,for which he was given various pain medications.virtually all of the doctors who examined edlund over the years concluded that,apart from the rib fracture and in spite of his subjective complaints,there was little objective evidence of physical abnormalities or damage,nor was there any evidence of edlund inability to work.however,one physician,lance christiansen,found that based on his observations over a period beginning in april,edlund was probably suffering from a herniated disk in his lower back.on the assumption that an mri scan would confirm his diagnosis,christiansen stated that edlund was probably a candidate for surgery on his lower back.in addition,christiansen opined that edlund did not ha ve a chance of getting back to meaningful work without getting this fixed.
edlund was also examined by a psychologist,jeff bremer,in november and march based on the november evaluation,bremer described edlund as markedly depressed and anxious and in need of supportive counseling and psychiatric evaluation.all told,edlund was found to meet the state criteria as seriously disturbed and to be at high risk of relapse.in march,bremer diagnosed edlund with atypical agitated depression,alcohol dependence,and prescription drug valium abuse in addition,based on the results of a battery of tests,bremer estimated edlund general learning ability in the low average range,based on a full scale iq at,with reading and spelling skills at the level,and arithmetic skills at the level.bremer reported these results as being reasonably valid and reliable.other results showed that edlund was significantly below average on the delayed recall index,although bremer observed that emotional and motivational factors likely affected this score.finally,bremer noted that with respect to a comprehensive personality test,edlund appears to have attempted to portray himself in an especially negative or pathological manner test results,therefore,are considered to involve considerable distortion and are invalid.he sees his life as severely disrupted by a variety of physical problems,depressive symptomatology,high anxiety,and suspiciousness and hostility with his relationships with others.
as for activities,bremer determined that edlund had only a fair ability to relate to,deal with the public,exercise judgment,interact with supervisors,remember and carry out complex job instructions,and function independently.he was deemed to have only fair or poor to no ability to deal with work stressors.on the other hand,edlund was assessed to have good ability to follow work rules and carry out simple job instructions,and good to fair ability to maintain concentration.finally,bremer determined that while edlund could satisfactorily maintain his personal appearance,he had only fair ability to behave in an emotionally stable manner,to relate predictably in social situations,and to demonstrate reliability.in sum,bremer concluded 
carl edlund impressed me as a markedly depressed and anxious,separated,man of low average intelligence with learning disabilities in reading and writing,who is dependent on street valium and has little social support.he could benefit from timely concurrent and chemical dependency counseling.it would be futile,i believe,to address one without the other.
multiple disabilities,discussed above,lead to restriction of activities of daily living judged to be currently moderate moderate to marked difficulties maintaining social functioning frequent deficiencies of concentration,persistence and pace and repeated episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or settings are anticipated,without comprehensive treatment 
in january and april,edlund applied for disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act,and supplemental security income under title xvi of the social security act,respectively following the denial of his applications,he requested reconsideration in october.his applications were denied once again,and on april,he filed a request for a hearing.an administrative law judge alj reopened edlund applications for good cause and conducted a hearing on june.
edlund,his girlfriend kim lay,and a vocational expert testified at the hearing.in his testimony,edlund maintained that he suffered from concentration problems as well as depression and anxiety.he also testified that he had reduced his alcohol and valium intake.critically,however,edlund also admitted that he continued to abuse drugs and alcohol and that his addiction caused him to exchange his prescription painkillers probably obtained from christiansen for valium on the street.finally,edlund also stated that he could lift up to fifteen pounds without significant pain in his shoulder or back,and that he could be up on his feet for minutes at a time.for approximately two to four days per month,edlund stated that he needed to lie down five to six hours during the day.
the alj subsequently rendered an adverse decision denying benefits on december.citing his apparent ruse to obtain prescription drugs for trade,the fact that he did not seek treatment from until,and the absence of severe objective medical findings supporting the existence of severe pain,the alj discredited edlund subjective complaints of pain.the alj also refused to credit edlund girlfriend testimony regarding edlund pain symptoms and diminished substance abuse due to a perceived conflict of interest.significantly,citing bremer observations about probable distortions in edlund psychological evaluation due to emotional and motivational factors as well as possible substance abuse,the alj f ou nd that the claimant has no severe mental impairment which would limit his capacity to perform substantial gainful work activity.finally,the alj adopted the vocational expert opinion regarding the existence of and assembler positions that edlund could perform even with his impairments.in sum,despite finding that edlund suffered from severe orthopedic impairments and was unable to perform his past work as a sawmill laborer,the alj denied his application for benefits on the grounds,inter alia,that none of his impairments qualified as a per se disability under step of the evaluating criteria the objective findings of any disability were minimal and edlund subjective complaints were not credible and that with his residual functional capacity,edlund could perform jobs that existed in significant numbers in the regional and national economy.
edlund asked the social security appeals council to review the alj decision.in a letter dated february,the appeals council stated that even after receiving christiansen letter,it found no basis for reviewing the alj decision.in particular,the appeals council cited the fact that no mri scan had ever been conducted to confirm edlund complaints as well as christiansen diagnosis.furthermore
