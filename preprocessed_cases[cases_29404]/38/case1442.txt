background 
on july,a veterans administration regional office varo awarded bowyer a disability rating for thrombophlebitis of both lower extremities and the right arm,effective may.at annual review on june,the varo reduced the disability rating to,effective september.bowyer did not then appeal this reduction.
starting in bowyer sought to reestablish the total disability rating,on the ground that his condition was such that he was unable to achieve employment.he brought a claim for disability based on individual unemployability.after various proceedings,the board of veterans appeals denied the claim on december,and again on june,upon reconsidering its decision in light of a new va examination conducted in february.throughout these proceedings bowyer was not represented by counsel.
bowyer then obtained the assistance of attorney carpenter.va form was duly filed,appointing carpenter to present and prosecute my claim for any and all benefits from the veterans administration.a fee agreement dated december,provided that carpenter would provide legal representation to bowyer for appeal of the board decision to the veterans court,at a contingent fee of of the total amount of any benefits awarded on the basis of the client claim with the veterans administration.
carpenter appealed the board decision to the veterans court,and that court on january,granted a joint motion,filed by counsel for the secretary of veterans affairs and bowyer,agreeing that the board decision should be vacated for error and the matter remanded to the board for redetermination.bowyer and carpenter then entered into a representation agreement in connection with the further proceedings related to the claim or claims previously decided by the board of veterans appeals 
t his agreement shall include representation of the veteran by the attorney at both the board of veterans appeals as well as any regional office of the department of veterans affairs if the attorney determines that the case should be reopened this agreement shall include services rendered in connection with the reopening of an issue previously denied by the board of veterans appeals.
agreement dated june.
carpenter efforts on remand were successful,and on july,the board awarded bowyer the disability rating.on august,the varo assigned this rating an effective date of january,the date of a va examination.by claim filed in december carpenter raised the issue of the effective date,arguing to the varo that the error in the disability rating extended back to the varo june decision that reduced bowyer original disability rating he argued that should be the effective date because there was clear and unmistakable error cue in the varo decision.on april,the varo denied the date,and carpenter appealed to the board.on october,the board accepted carpenter position,and held that there was cue in the varo decision.carpenter returned to the varo,which restored the disability rating as retroactive to and continuous from the initial effective date of may.this was the complete relief sought by bowyer.
on june,the board sent a letter to carpenter stating that he is not entitled to a fee for his services performed before the board october,decision establishing the effective date,because that decision was the first final decision in the case,c.carpenter demurred,and on october,the board reviewed the fee agreement in accordance with c the board then held that the fee agreement was per se unreasonable under c because carpenter was not eligible to charge a fee for legal services provided before october,the date of the board ultimate decision.thus,the board held that carpenter legal services were not compensable.
the veterans court agreed.the court rejected the position that the case began when the board in denied the veteran claim for disability,and held that there was no final decision in the case until the board decision of october.the veterans court remanded,and the board determined that carpenter had performed no legal services on or after october,the first final decision and therefore that no fee was payable under the fee agreement.
carpenter again appealed,arguing that the board and the veterans court had not correctly interpreted the fee statute.the veterans court then held that it did not have jurisdiction over the appeal.the veterans court explained its lack of jurisdiction as follows 
in the instant appeal,the court finds that,based on the evidence of record,the june fee agreement does not extend to services provided in connection with the veteran december cue claim.in this regard,the court notes that the services provided by the appellee with respect to the december claim for cue do not relate specifically to the claim previously decided by the board in its june decision.because there is no applicable fee agreement for the court to review,the court lacks jurisdiction to review this appeal.
carpenter,wl,at internal citations omitted.carpenter appeals to this court,arguing that the veterans court incorrectly interpreted the fee statute and this court precedent.

the secretary challenges the federal circuit jurisdiction to receive this appeal,arguing that the basis of the veterans court decision was its factual finding that carpenter work was not related to a claim or claims previously decided by the board of veterans appeals,the words of the fee agreement,and that findings of fact are excluded from our purview.carpenter responds that the veterans court misconstrued the statutory provision first final decision in the case,c,when the court determined that the case in,when the veteran obtained the claimed disability retroactive to when the rating was initially reduced,was not the same case as that in which the board rejected the claim in.carpenter argues that this was an incorrect interpretation of c.
