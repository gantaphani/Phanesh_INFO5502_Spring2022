plaintiff,lawrence wade,filed an application for a disability pension with defendant,the city of north chicago police pension board board.at the commencement of plaintiff hearing before the board,plaintiff counsel requested limited consideration for a disability pension only,pursuant to section of the illinois pension code code ilcs west.following a hearing,the board denied plaintiff a disability pension on three independent bases,concluding that plaintiff did not incur a disability from the performance of an act of duty,his condition does not render it necessary for his suspension or retirement from police service,and three doctors selected by the pension board did not certify the applicant as disabled,after conducting examinations of plaintiff pursuant to section of the code ilcs west.plaintiff thereafter filed an action for administrative review in the circuit court of lake county,and the circuit court ultimately confirmed the board decision.plaintiff then appealed to the appellate court,arguing that the board had denied him a fair and impartial hearing because it had relied solely on the medical report of one physician james milgram in denying him a disability pension the board decision was contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence and the board improperly interpreted section of the code to mandate that all three examining physicians selected by the board certify the applicant disabled as a prerequisite to a disability award.the appellate court initially found that the board had correctly interpreted section and had properly denied plaintiff application for disability pension benefits on that basis alone.thus,the appellate court did not reach the other issues raised by plaintiff.
plaintiff thereafter petitioned this court for leave to appeal.in conjunction with a denial of leave to appeal,we issued a supervisory order,directing the appellate court to vacate its judgment in wade city of north chicago police pension board,d,and remanding to that court,in light of turcol pension board of trustees of matteson police pension fund,to resolve the issue of whether the board determination that plaintiff had not proven his disability was against the manifest weight of the evidence.see wade city of north chicago police pension board,supervisory order.on remand,the appellate court found that the board determination was indeed against the manifest weight of the evidence however,the appellate court adhered to its earlier interpretation of section,and again upheld the denial of disability benefits on that basis.d.we granted plaintiff petition for leave to appeal.a.
if the appellate court is correct in holding that the board determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence,then the question of section proper interpretation is squarely before us if the appellate court is incorrect,we need not address the interpretational issue.therefore,we first consider whether the board decision on disability was in fact against the manifest weight of the evidence.to that end,we set forth a summary of the evidence bearing upon that issue,consisting of plaintiff testimony before the board,his medical records,and the reports of examining physicians selected by the board.
plaintiff testified he was working full duty as a patrolman for the city of north chicago on april,when he responded to the scene of an arrest to assist other officers in transporting an arrestee.as plaintiff was bringing the handcuffed prisoner from the scene of the arrest and down a steep,rocky embankment,the prisoner stumbled and began to fall.plaintiff tried to keep the arrestee from falling,the two became entangled,and both tumbled to the bottom of the hill.plaintiff testified when he stood up he felt pain in his right knee immediately.when he got back to the police station,he noticed,in addition to the pain,some slight bruising of the knee and swelling.from the police station,he was taken to the hospital,where an was taken,an immobilizer was applied to his leg,and he was given crutches.
plaintiff was subsequently seen by christ pavlatos,who ordered magnetic resonance imaging mri of plaintiff knee.according to plaintiff,pavlatos later told him the mri had revealed two tears of the inner and outer portion of the right knee and,consequently,surgery would be required.surgery was in fact performed,and plaintiff thereafter underwent eight weeks of physical therapy.plaintiff recalled that,at some point during his postoperative recovery,t here was some swelling and some fluid built up on the knee again.in response,his doctor drained fluid from the knee and on two occasions administered cortizone injections.plaintiff testified that,after his may knee surgery,he worked in a sedentary capacity for the city of north chicago until february of.plaintiff stated at that point i had my knee drained for the second time,another ccs of fluid was taken out and two more injections.and at that point my doctor said,this knee is just not responding and you just not able to work,period.plaintiff never returned to full duty as a patrolman.
plaintiff testified,as of the time of the june,hearing,pursuant to doctors orders,he was restricted to a permanent sedentary type of work situation,a job.no doctor had released him to go back to work as a patrolman.plaintiff acknowledged receipt of a letter,dated september,from the deputy chief of operations for the city of north chicago,advising him that the city of north chicago did not have a permanent sedentary position for a police officer,and informing him he had two options retire or apply for a disability pension.he obviously chose the latter course.
at the hearing,plaintiff testified that he experiences pain just walking.he rated his pain as on a scale.he said his knee is weak and sometimes locks or buckles.he stated he sometimes experiences a grinding sensation in the knee.he claimed he could only sit for about minutes,stand for about to minutes,and walk for about minutes,before he had pain in the knee.plaintiff reiterated that he was working full duty prior to the april injury.
plaintiff acknowledged preexisting problems with his knee in the fall of,noting the pain,the discomfort,the problems getting in and out of his squad car.he stated he saw pavlatos for that condition on december.plaintiff said he could not recall missing work for any reason between that office visit and his april injury.
the board had before it plaintiff rather extensive medical records,most notably those evincing plaintiff medical treatment with roger collins.an early entry in that file,dated july,indicates that plaintiff reported a injury to his right knee,sustained while playing football.according to plaintiff,the knee became painful and later became swollen.also in that entry,plaintiff reported knee pain after participating in basketball games in november of.with respect to his knee complaints,the file indicates that plaintiff reported pain in both knees with prolonged sitting.he stated the first few steps after prolonged sitting might be quite painful.at that time,he informed collins that he had not experienced locking of the knees,but he had occasionally had bilateral buckling since.he said he also occasionally had pain in the knees during sleep.taken in revealed scant early degenerative changes in plaintiff knees.
the next entry in collins records is dated august.according to collins file,plaintiff was seen on that date for an evaluation of his right knee.plaintiff stated he had been running bases when he felt a pop in his right knee accompanied by immediate pain.the entry notes 
he recalls that he injured his knee in the past when he was about years of age.he was playing football.he was on the ground and another player fell on his knees causing him to go into hyperextension.he developed immediate swelling.
plaintiff reported having had problems with his knees for a number of years.some symptoms were similar to those mentioned in the entry,such as pain and stiffness after sitting.collins noted swelling of the right knee on the date of examination.after further assessment,collins discussed the risks and benefits associated with surgery.
plaintiff opted for surgery.postoperative file entries dated august,august,and september,indicate,at the time of surgery,a grade ii chondromalacia or thinning on the surface of the medial and lateral femoral condyles was noted.plaintiff was found to have torn medial and lateral menisci and a defect on the patellofemoral groove.collins performed partial medial and lateral meniscectomies and a lateral release.collins noted the findings of plaintiff arthroscopy were more consistent with what we would see with someone in their,rather than someone who is years of age.
plaintiff recovery from the surgery was problematic.a march,file entry indicates plaintiff had developed discomfort in the knee and was having difficulty with stairs.he had a persistent and significant swelling of his knee.collins speculated it was possible that plaintiff had torn more of the lateral meniscus.he noted t he posterior portion perhaps could have completely torn and displaced slightly,but he observed plaintiff did not have mechanical symptoms.collins decided to aspirate fluid from the knee,and followed that with an injection of cc depomedrol and cc marcaine.in a subsequent entry,dated january,collins reported that plaintiff was seen in the office reporting a fair amount of swelling over the previous month.in the assessment portion of that entry,collins noted that plaintiff articular cartilage is probably progressively flaking off.collins concluded i suspect in the long run,he will continue to have problems because he does have a fair amount of pathology within the knee.
it appears that plaintiff next consulted a physician for his knee problems on december,when he saw christ pavlatos.at that time,plaintiff reported he had been having bilateral knee pain for the past years.he complained of discomfort and occasional swelling.pavlatos examination of plaintiff revealed a little patellofemoral pain and trace medial joint line pain.pavlatos stated we are probably dealing with patellofemoral pain with mild early degenerative arthritis.pavlatos recommended therapy and directed plaintiff to return in six weeks.the file evinces a phone consultation on january,in which plaintiff reported mild improvement,though he still had discomfort in the knee.pavlatos recommended light duty until plaintiff improved his quad strength.a notation dated march,indicates that plaintiff had reported he was doing much better,although he occasionally had some discomfort.on that date,pavlatos stated plaintiff could return to work at full duty.
after plaintiff reported knee injury of april,he again consulted with pavlatos.on april,plaintiff reported having sustained a twisting injury to his knee and complained of significant pain and swelling.pavlatos file entry of that date states pain is along the medial and lateral aspect of his right knee.nis sic history of a pop noted.pavlatos physical examination revealed effusion in plaintiff right knee,mild patellofemoral pain,and flexion limited by pain.showed evidence of patellofemoral and medial compartment arthritic changes.after reviewing plaintiff mri,pavlatos observed what he believed to be a medial and lateral meniscus tear.in pavlatos opinion,plaintiff had sustained a new tear of the lateral side and possibly the medial side.pavlatos recommended right knee arthroscopy to address a new lateral meniscus tear and probable recurrent medial meniscus tear.as far as work was concerned,pavlatos prescribed a sit down job with no more than hrs.per day working.
surgery was performed on may.pavlatos operative report noted,inter alia,a posterior horn tear of the medial meniscus and a degenerative flap tear of the lateral meniscus.
a postoperative notation dated may,states that plaintiff was doing well,but had some mild discomfort.already,on that date,pavlatos notes indicate that he did not believe plaintiff could ever return to full duty i do feel this patient will require a permanent position that involves no running or excessive standing and a sit down job would be my preference for this patient because of the degree of arthritis he has at this young age.plaintiff returned for another appointment with pavlatos on june.pavlatos noted,he a little over four weeks post knee arthroscopy for an arthritic knee.plaintiff continued to complain of occasional pain.pavlatos examination showed plaintiff still had a trace of effusion and limited flexion.pavlatos aspirated ccs of clear yellow fluid from plaintiff knee and a cortisone injection was given.at a subsequent office visit on august,plaintiff again reported discomfort,especially after prolonged periods of standing or excessive walking.trace effusion was still noted,as was patellofemoral pain.under the category of impression,pavlatos wrote patient with degenerative arthritis with persistent patellofemoral pain.under the heading,recommendation,pavlatos noted 
at this point i do feel that this patient will require permanent job modifications where he will need to have an office or desk type job because of the degree of arthritis that he does have in his knee.i do feel the arthritis was present prior to his accident,although it certainly could have been aggravated by his accident at work.
plaintiff was seen by pavlatos again on september,having been previously engaged in sit down work pursuant to pavlatos recommendation.still,plaintiff reported having significant pain over the anterior medial aspect of his knee,with an occasional catching sensation.plaintiff said his pain was sometimes disabling to the point that he walked with a limp.pavlatos examination again revealed patellofemoral and medial compartment pain,and pain limiting flexion.pavlatos impression was flare up of some arthritic changes in plaintiff knee.the same impression was noted in entries dated september and november.on the latter date,which was subsequent to the filing of plaintiff october application for disability pension benefits,plaintiff reported periodic pain with sitting and walking.in his examination of november,pavlatos noted no effusion,good flexibility,and good strength in the knee.nonetheless,pavlatos concluded that plaintiff needed to limit his activity to office type work and determined he could not work in the field as a police officer.
the record also shows that plaintiff was evaluated on september,by mark levin.it appears that levin conducted an extensive and thorough examination of plaintiff and a meticulous and comprehensive review of his records.
levin listed plaintiff main complaint as right knee pain that goes up to a.plaintiff stated he experienced pain over the lateral aspect of his knee while walking and got some locking and occasional buckling.plaintiff said he had been told by pavlatos that he had bone on bone contact in the knee.he informed levin he could sit for minutes,stand for minutes,walk for minutes and had no problem with driving.he could walk stairs,but experienced discomfort when doing so.
levin noted that plaintiff had a previous history of right knee pain dating back to.although plaintiff did relatively well following his knee surgery,he again developed knee pain in december of.levin notes indicate that plaintiff initially saw a sommerville for his knee and was diagnosed with arthritis.he subsequently saw pavlatos,who prescribed a regimen of physical therapy.levin entry states that plaintiff was off work,due to his knee problem,from december of to february of however,he did work from february of until april.
levin examination of plaintiff revealed trace effusion of the right knee and full extension and flexion.there was no tenderness of the knee,though plaintiff complained of pain over the hamstrings.levin review of plaintiff standing revealed arthritic changes both over the medial and lateral compartments.although there was still joint space maintained,levin noted signs of degenerative findings.plaintiff april sitting also showed arthritic changes of the right knee with some minimal spurring of the patella and spurring of the medial femoral condyle and medial tibial plateau.plaintiff april mri was consistent with contemporaneous insofar as it disclosed arthritic changes of the knee.the mri also showed a medial meniscal tear.operative photos from plaintiff knee surgery confirmed that plaintiff had a tear of the posterior horn of the medial meniscus as well as a tear of the lateral meniscus.levin also reviewed plaintiff postoperative progress reports and physical therapy records.
based upon plaintiff history,physical exam,radiographic studies and medical records,levin diagnosed plaintiff with arthritis of the right knee which would be chronic and longstanding and noted that condition would an injury from april.levin observed the patient was symptomatic per his own report prior to that but had been working as a patrol officer from february to april.
levin concluded that plaintiff appeared to be at maximum medical improvement but did not appear to have the abilities to return back to work as a patrol officer because of the underlying arthritis of his right knee.levin report later reiterated that the need for work restrictions is coming from his underlying knee arthritis,but immediately followed that observation with this statement it would appear that there was an aggravation from the episode of april which is now preventing this patient from returning back to work.levin stated that plaintiff would be capable of working on a permanent basis at a sedentary position.
plaintiff was subsequently advised that the north chicago police department had no permanent sedentary position for a police officer,and,on october,he filed an application with the board for a disability pension.at that time,plaintiff did not specify whether he was seeking a see ilcs west or a nonduty ilcs west disability pension.however,he subsequently indicated that he was seeking a disability pension only.pursuant to section of the code ilcs west,three physicians were selected by the board to examine plaintiff john dwyer,christopher reger,and james milgram.
dwyer and reger found plaintiff to be disabled from a injury and each signed a physician certificate,checking the disabled option on the certificate.we note there was also a not disabled option on the certificates utilized in this case as a means to address both alternatives on the issue of disability.though both doctors believed plaintiff was disabled from a injury,they acknowledged,in their accompanying reports,that he had preexisting problems with his right knee.
dwyer accompanying report evinced an extensive examination of plaintiff with very specific findings regarding range of motion,appearance and function.dwyer noted visible swelling about the right knee.he stated that plaintiff demonstrated post arthroscopy knee with residual impairment there,chronic synovitis with instability.according to dwyer report,plaintiff said he had surgery on his right knee in and returned to work on full duty with no problem until the incident of.he denies any other serious illness or injury.dwyer notes that plaintiff had reported 
b y the time he prepares a meal for himself standing the whole knee is sore.prolonged walking also increases pain.he stated the pain radiates up into the right thigh.if he sits too long the knee locks.the knee swells and he ices it.
dwyer concluded that plaintiff could not perform the duties of a street officer and noted that his history certainly delineates a work related condition.significantly,dwyer noted that plaintiff had surgery on his knee prior to the injury at issue in these proceedings,and a successful return to his normal occupation as a police officer was seen.
reger also conducted an extensive examination and,in his words,a meticulous evaluation of records,and review of plaintiff mri and imaging studies.reger observed there were mild to moderate osteoarthritic changes about the right knee,which were most likely present prior to this injury.reger also noted both plaintiff prior injury in and his subsequent surgery.reger examination of plaintiff revealed some mild swelling of the right knee and mild medial joint tenderness upon palpation.plaintiff complained of some discomfort in his knee as it was manipulated during the examination.in the report accompanying his certificate,reger concluded that plaintiff was permanently disabled and stated his belief that the cause of plaintiff disability was a injury.he observed that plaintiff did have a timely work up after his injury,and it did show a new meniscal tear.given plaintiff previously repaired meniscal tear,reger believed plaintiff was at a higher risk for reinjury,which did occur in this case.
in his report,milgram acknowledged the medical history plaintiff reported to him,but his recitation makes clear that he did not commit to that history as verified.he noted that plaintiff has had no repeat mris or since the surgery.he brought with him no tests.in his examination of plaintiff,milgram observed full range of motion,no swelling,no fluid accumulation,no marked tenderness,and good alignment and extension.milgram took of plaintiff knees and determined that bilateral three compartment disease was present in both knees.milgram concluded that plaintiff had degenerative bilateral arthritis in both of his knees and that condition preexisted any incident.milgram felt,if plaintiff were so motivated,he could return to work as a police officer at the present time without restriction.consistent with the skeptical tone that pervades milgram report,he states 
i have reviewed the medical records and in no area that i have reviewed is there a history given by the patient to his treating physician that his knee popped when he fell down the embankment.therefore,this is a new history that the patient is giving to me.the records do not show that type of an injury.he was diagnosed by his own doctor as having bilateral arthritis of both knees and the doctor felt that he might have tears of his cartilage.indeed he did have tears of the cartilage,but as described in the operative note,they appear to be degenerative type of tears and chronic.they certainly do not appear to be like a new tear that just occurred and i think there is a significant likelihood that the tears treated by pavlatos are disease and not traumatic tears caused by a new injury.i think the patient does not have also a degree of arthritis which is disabling from work as a police officer.
thus,milgram did not find plaintiff to be disabled,much less disabled from a injury.
following plaintiff hearing,the board denied plaintiff a disability pension on three independent bases,concluding that plaintiff did not incur a disability from the performance of an act of duty,his condition does not render it necessary for his suspension or retirement from police service,and three doctors selected by the pension board did not certify the applicant as disabled,pursuant to section of the code ilcs west.in its analysis,the board found milgram more credible than the other physicians and assigned greater weight to his opinion.the board also relied on levin report and plaintiff extensive prior medical treatment and injuries.
as noted,the circuit court confirmed the board decision upon administrative review,and the plaintiff appealed.although the appellate court initially found it unnecessary to address the evidentiary sufficiency of the board decision,given the court determination that a disability pension was properly denied because three physicians had not certified plaintiff disabled,upon remand we directed the appellate court to address the evidentiary question.in doing so,the appellate court framed the issue,and summarized the evidence,as follows 
it is undisputed that plaintiff has preexisting arthritis of his right knee.the dispute focuses on whether the april,accident caused a new tear to plaintiff knee or whether the tear preexisted the accident.four of the five physicians who examined plaintiff concluded that plaintiff was disabled as of the date of the accident.pavlatos believed that the accident caused a new tear.levin concurred in this conclusion.milgram on the other hand believed that any tears preexisted the accident,and the board found milgram more credible,assigning more weight to his opinion.thus,this case turns on whether the record contains any evidence to support milgram finding that plaintiff did not suffer a new tear to his knee when he fell down the embankment.d at.
plaintiff argued below that,given the evidence,milgram finding was baseless and unreliable and that the board therefore erred in assigning so much weight to milgram opinion.the appellate court agreed with that assessment.see d at.
the appellate court noted that milgram had concluded the accident did not cause a new tear to plaintiff knee,in part,because plaintiff did not report to his doctor that his knee had popped when he tumbled down the embankment.however,as the appellate court observed,the record indicates that plaintiff did in fact report to pavlatos that he felt his knee pop at the time of the accident.d at.the court concluded that milgram misstatement of the evidence showed that milgram either selectively disregarded,failed to recall,or never reviewed portions of plaintiff medical records and he disregarded evidence that supports the finding that plaintiff suffered a new tear.d at.the court also found it particularly troubling that,although he stated that he reviewed plaintiff medical records,nowhere in his report did milgram indicate that he specifically examined the mri taken by pavlatos following plaintiff accident.d at.
moreover,the court observed 
milgram based his finding that plaintiff is not disabled on his beliefs that plaintiff does not have a degree of arthritis which is disabling from work as a police officer and that he lacks motivation.this lack of motivation analysis is vague and has no scientific basis in fact because the report does not consider,as the other examining physicians did,plaintiff current symptoms regarding the use of his knee,that his knee locks occasionally,that he experiences some pain in his knee when he climbs up and down stairs,and that his knee swells and feels tender when he does any strenuous activities.milgram opinion also fails to account for how these symptoms might affect plaintiff work as a police officer.d at.
the court determined that milgram was not credible,because his conclusions were inconsistent with the facts available to him,and concluded that the board erred in assigning greater weight to milgram opinion,because he failed to consider or to base his opinion on relevant,material evidence that was key under the circumstances of this case.d at.thus,the appellate court held that the board determination on disability was against the manifest weight of the evidence.d at.
the court then went on to address the issue of statutory construction,ultimately determining,as it had in its prior disposition,that section of the code requires that a pension board deny disability benefits unless all three examining physicians selected by the board certify that the applicant is disabled.d at.the court concluded with a quote from justice cardozo we do not pause to consider whether a statute differently conceived and framed would yield results more consonant with fairness and reason.we take this statute as we find it.d at,quoting frankfurter,some reflections on the reading of statutes,colum,quoting anderson wilson.
we begin our analysis with the issue of evidentiary sufficiency,and the standards of review applicable thereto.in administrative cases,we review the decision of the administrative agency,not the determination of the circuit court.marconi chicago heights police pension board.section of the code ilcs west provides that judicial review of the decision of the board is governed by the administrative review law ilcs et.west,pursuant to which,our review extends to all questions of fact and law presented by the entire record.ilcs west marconi,at,international union of operating engineers,local illinois department of employment security.
rulings on questions of fact will be reversed only if they are against the manifest weight of the evidence.marconi,at,comprehensive community solutions,rockford school district.an administrative agency decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident.abrahamson illinois department of professional regulation.in contrast,we review questions of law de novo branson department of revenue,and a mixed question of law and fact is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard marconi,at.in marconi,we applied the manifest weight standard to the the question of whether the evidence of record supports the board denial of plaintiff application for a disability pension,noting that is a question of fact.marconi,at.that standard applies here as well.under any standard of review,a plaintiff in an administrative proceeding bears the burden of proof,and relief will be denied if he or she fails to sustain that burden.see marconi,at,citing miller hill,d.
as appellate panels have observed,a disability pension may be based upon the aggravation of a preexisting physical condition.see alm lincolnshire police pension board,d,barber board of trustees of village of south barrington police pension fund,d,there is no requirement that the incident be the originating or primary cause of the injury,although a sufficient nexus between the injury and the performance of the duty must exist.
with these precepts in mind,we turn again to the evidence adduced in this case,and the board decision,based on that evidence.other than the opinion of milgram,there is no medical evidence whatsoever to support a finding that plaintiff was not disabled for full duty as a police officer,and there was abundant medical evidence that he was disabled.as previously noted,pavlatos,levin,dwyer and reger all found plaintiff to be disabled such that he was unable to perform in a capacity as a police officer.pavlatos and levin specifically found that the april injury aggravated plaintiff preexisting condition,rendering him disabled.the reports of these doctors evince examinations more thorough than that conducted by milgram,and analyses that were more complete and better substantiated.we note that we have before us the same records and reports examined by the board the doctors did not testify,and thus factors such as the demeanor of testifying witnesses does not figure into an assessment of credibility.having thoroughly examined those records,we find it,frankly,incomprehensible that the board would credit the opinion of milgram and reject the opinions of the other doctors.
as the appellate court noted,milgram misstatement of the evidence shows that he either selectively disregarded,failed to recall,or never reviewed portions of plaintiff medical records.see d at.milgram claimed that he had reviewed plaintiff medical records and in no area that he had reviewed was there a history given to plaintiff treating physician that his knee had popped when he fell down the embankment.milgram found that omission significant,and he observed,this is a new history that the patient is giving to me.the is consistent with the skeptical tone that pervades milgram that the plaintiff was making things up as he went along.milgram misconception may well have led to his otherwise unsupported conclusion that,if plaintiff were so motivated,he could return to work as a police officer without restriction.in fact,the record indicates that plaintiff did make a report of a knee pop to his treating physician,pavlatos,on april,five days after his injury.
more evidence of milgram cursory review of the record can be found in his blanket statement that the tears of plaintiff cartilage,as described in the operative note,appear to be degenerative type of tears and chronic.while pavlatos did describe one tear of the meniscus as a degenerative flap tear,he did not so characterize the other.even if he had,that description would not necessarily impose any chronology with respect to the date of the tear,as milgram would suggest.furthermore,milgram himself never addressed pavlatos preoperative assessment of plaintiff mri that milgram apparently never pavlatos stated his belief that plaintiff had at least one new tear of his meniscus.in short,milgram provides no factual basis for his conclusion that the tears treated by pavlatos were disease and not traumatic tears caused by a new injury.
finally,as the appellate court notes,milgram report fails to consider,as did the reports of the other examining phy
