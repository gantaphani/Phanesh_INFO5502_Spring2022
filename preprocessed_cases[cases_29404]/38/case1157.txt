appellant felix bloch was a member of the senior foreign service when he resigned in,after the department of state initiated proceedings to remove him from the service on national security grounds.in,the department notified bloch that the secretary of state had decided to withhold consent to bloch receipt of an immediate retirement annuity.bloch then withdrew the compulsory retirement contributions he had made to the foreign service retirement system.bloch argues that the secretary lacked discretion to withhold the immediate annuity,and that the denial of an immediate annuity constituted a deprivation of property without due process of law.bloch also contends that his withdrawal of retirement contributions can not be construed as a waiver of his right to a deferred annuity,because the department did not inform him at that time that a deferred annuity was an available option.the foreign service grievance board held that the secretary had the discretion to withhold the immediate annuity,that such action did not violate due process,and that bloch had waived the deferred annuity when he elected the withdrawal.the district court found that the board decision was not arbitrary or capricious.we affirm.
bloch,who joined the foreign service in,was suspended without pay in february when the federal bureau of investigation provided the department of state with information indicating that his continued employment might not be consistent with national security.in a letter to bloch,the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security explained that bloch,while serving overseas,had transferred national security information to an unauthorized individual,had undertaken measures when traveling to meet with the individual,and had given false information to fbi agents conducting a national security investigation.letter from sheldon krys to felix bloch,at ja,sa.no criminal charges were brought against bloch,but the department initiated a removal proceeding under.that statute provides that the head of a federal agency may suspend an employee without pay when he considers that action necessary in the interests of national security,id.a,and may subsequently remove the employee after providing notice and an opportunity to respond including a hearing,at the request of the employee if the agency head determines that removal is necessary or advisable in the interests of national security.id.b see also id.c.
bloch requested the hearing to which he was entitled under the statute,but on july,one week before the scheduled hearing date bloch tendered a letter of resignation to the secretary.on the same day,bloch withdrew his request for a hearing and submitted an application for voluntary retirement,including a request for payment of an immediate retirement annuity.on july,the department notified him by letter that his offer to resign had been taken under advisement pending review by the secretary.on november,the department wrote to bloch to inform him that the secretary had determined that it was necessary and advisable to remove bloch in the interests of national security,and that his removal from the foreign service would be effective that day.
by the summer of,the department had not yet responded to bloch application for an immediate annuity,and he renewed his request.in a letter dated april,the department notified bloch that the secretary had decided to withhold consent to his voluntary retirement and receipt of an immediate annuity.letter from john rogers,under secretary of state for management,to felix bloch,at ja.as authority for the secretary right to withhold consent,the letter cited section of the foreign service act of codified as amended at,which provides 
any participant who is at least years of age and has years of creditable service,including at least years of service credit toward retirement under the foreign service retirement system excluding military and naval service,may on his or her own application and with the consent of the secretary be retired from the service and receive retirement benefits 
the department indicated two reasons for withholding consent in bloch case that his removal from the foreign service in november was an involuntary separation rather than a voluntary retirement under section and that the serious national security reasons underlying his removal furnish ed sufficient ground to withhold consent.letter from john rogers,supra,at ja.the letter also stated that persons separated from the service without benefit of an annuity are entitled to receive a refund of contributions made to the retirement system during the period of employment,and indicated that department staff would contact bloch about completing the paperwork needed to receive the refund.id.
on august,bloch applied for the refund of his retirement contributions in october of that year he received a lump sum of approximately.some two and a half years later,in march,he initiated a grievance with the department alleging that the secretary april decision to withhold consent to his retirement and immediate annuity was arbitrary and capricious,violated pertinent statutory provisions,and contradicted a decision of the foreign service grievance board fsgb.the department rejected his grievance on february,holding that there is nothing in section which would suggest that removal on national security grounds could not serve as a basis for the withholding of the consent of the secretary.letter from ruth whiteside,deputy assistant secretary for personnel,department of state,to herbert rubenstein,counsel for felix bloch,at ja.the letter referenced and attached the april,letter to bloch from under secretary rogers,explaining the bases for the secretary decision to withhold consent.id.at ja.
having thus disposed of the question of bloch entitlement to an immediate annuity,the department letter went on to address whether he was entitled to a discontinued service annuity pursuant to section of the act codified at.section provides that any foreign service member who voluntarily separates from the service after at least years of service credit can withdraw his contributions to the pension fund or leave them in place and receive an annuity beginning at age.unlike section,section does not require the consent of the secretary for the disbursement of an annuity at age often a deferred annuity,as it would have been for bloch,who was years old when he left the foreign service.the department concluded that bloch was not entitled to a section annuity because he had waived his right to it when he withdrew his contributions in august.as the department emphasized,the form that bloch submitted to request his refund included a prominent section entitled notice to applicant stating that i f you have five or more years of federal civilian service you may be entitled to an annuity which will be forfeited by payment of this refund.application for refund of compulsory retirement contributions,ja.even in the absence of such a waiver,the department noted,bloch would not be entitled to a deferred annuity under section because the statute applied only to voluntary separations,and his separation in november was involuntary.
bloch then filed a grievance with the fsgb.he relied principally on the board decision in a redacted and thus untitled case,no.fsgb,which interpreted a department regulation contained in foreign affairs manual fam.the regulation governs separation for cause defined as separation from the service because of the unsatisfactory performance of duties or for such other cause as will promote the efficiency of the service,id.i,and states that a n employee is free to resign or retire at any time on a mutually agreed effective date,and to have the employee reasons for resigning or retiring entered on the employee personnel record.id.a.in fsgb,the board considered the interplay between fam and the requirement in section that the secretary consent to voluntary retirements.the case involved an employee who had sought to retire after removal proceedings had been initiated pursuant to section of the act codified as amended at,a general provision that establishes procedures for separating employees for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.id.a.in fsgb,the board determined that i t is not necessary to decide in this case whether the statute section imposes any limits on the agencies power to grant or withhold consent to early retirement,because the agencies,by regulation,have imposed such limitations on themselves.fsgb at citing fam ja.the board concluded that,given the section regulation,the employee could resign even without the secretary consent,and even though removal proceedings were pending against him under section.id.at ja.
bloch argued that because the board had concluded that an employee will be permitted to resign in the face of a proposed separation for cause,the secretary had no authority to withhold consent to bloch retirement or his receipt of an immediate annuity.as for the deferred annuity,bloch argued that his application for the refund of his contributions could not be read as a waiver of his right to such an annuity,because he did not know that there was any right to waive he applied for the refund after assuming based on the fact that the april letter described him as an employee separated from the service without benefit of an annuity,see letter from john rogers,supra,at ja that he was not entitled to any annuity.
the fsgb denied bloch grievance.as an initial matter,the fsgb held that bloch resignation was effective on the day it was tendered july,and that his separation from the service occurred on that day,rather than in november when the department purported to remove him from the service.in re bloch,fsgb case,at ja initial board decision.such a result,the board stated,was compelled by fam,which provides that a n employee is free to resign at any time and to propose the effective date of resignation.id.in a brief footnote,the board described fsgb as holding that an employee can resign even when removal proceedings are in progress.initial board decision at ja.the board added,however,that resignation does not trigger entitlement to an annuity.id.at ja.but the board opted not to define the scope of the secretary authority to withhold consent to the annuity under section of the act,reasoning that s uch a definition would have profound implications.id.at ja.instead,it focused on whether bloch had waived his right to an annuity.the board first noted that the form bloch used when he applied for the refund of his retirement contributions gave him clear notice that a refund would forfeit any entitlement to an annuity and expressed no limitation on the type of annuity being waived.id.at,ja.moreover,the board observed that bloch was an experienced,very senior officer who was presumably able to make informed and competent choices.id.at ja.it also pointed out that even during the two months between applying for the funds and receiving the refund check,bloch could have changed course and filed a grievance,but did not.id.the board concluded that bloch waiver and forfeiture of any entitlement to an annuity was unambiguous,valid,and binding.id.
bloch sought review of the board decision in the district court for the district of columbia,see,arguing that the fsgb had erred in failing to consider the question whether the secretary had discretion to withhold consent to the immediate annuity.he pointed out that if he were eligible to receive an immediate annuity when he applied for the refund,then section a d of the act codified as amended at a d which bars such refunds if the recipient becomes eligible for an annuity within days of filing the refund application raised a legal bar to the disbursement of the refund.under such circumstances,the refund and thus,he argued,his waiver of any entitlement to an annuity would have been unlawful and therefore invalid.the district court did not reach the merits of this argument,but held that it was an argument that the board should have addressed before reaching its conclusion that bloch waiver was valid and binding,bloch albright,d,and thus remanded to the board.
on remand,the board resolved the issue that it had left open in bloch first grievance the scope of the secretary authority under section of the act.the board concluded that the plain language of section confers broad discretionary authority upon the secretary of state to grant or withhold consent to the benefits available under that section.in re bloch,fsgb case,at ja decision on remand.it then examined the two reasons for withholding consent that the department had listed in its april letter to bloch the fact that he had been removed from the service involuntarily in november,and the fact that his removal was based on national security concerns.the board concluded that the first reason was insufficient to warrant withholding consent to bloch retirement and annuity,because as the board had found in its previous ruling bloch separation from the service occurred immediately upon his resignation in july.id.at,ja.but the second reason was sufficient,in the board view t he serious national security concerns which prompted the filing of charges against bloch constitute legitimate and rational grounds to support and justify the secretary withholding of consent to an immediate annuity.id.at ja.
this holding defeated bloch section argument because the secretary had validly denied an immediate annuity for bloch,he was not eligible to receive an annuity within days of when he applied for his refund,so the refund was not in violation of section.id.at ja.the board noted,however,that bloch had remained entitled to a deferred annuity under section of the act,even after the secretary had withheld consent to the immediate annuity.id.at citing fam ja see also id.at ja the department regulations make it clear that a withholding of secretarial consent to voluntary retirement status with a consequential immediate annuity does not extinguish a right to a deferred annuity under section.the board then restated its earlier conclusion that bloch had waived his right to this deferred annuity by submitting the refund application with its clear warning language,together with the receipt of his mandatory contributions,bloch forfeited any entitlement to an annuity.id.at ja.the board finally discussed the argument that the secretary decision deprived bloch of property without due process of law that argument failed,concluded the board,because the discretion accorded the secretary in section precluded the creation of a constitutionally protected property right to an immediate annuity.id.at ja.
bloch again sought review in the district court,which entered summary judgment in favor of the department.bloch powell,d,a ccording due deference to the fsgb,this court determines that the fsgb decision is not arbitrary or capricious and that the department did not deny bloch right to due process.this appeal followed.we review the fsgb decision directly,according no particular deference to the district court judgment.holland national mining ass n.
a.the secretary discretion to withhold consent 
the crux of bloch argument is that the secretary did not have the discretion to withhold consent to bloch receipt of an immediate annuity.bloch concedes that section of the act vests the secretary with significant discretion as indeed he must.the statute is perhaps a paradigmatic vesting of unfettered discretion,placing no constraints on the secretary authority to withhold consent other than to require that consent be withheld if an employee has served fewer than five years,see.but bloch argues that the department regulations and its decision in fsgb have cabined the secretary discretion.
as to the regulations,bloch argues that fam an employee is free to resign at any time and to propose the effective date of resignation.and a an employee is free to resign or retire at any time on a mutually agreed effective date limit the discretion of the secretary to setting a date for retirement,and eliminate any authority to withhold an immediate annuity.the first provision concerns only resignation,not retirement,and there is no longer any dispute that bloch resignation was effective despite the absence of secretarial consent.as for the second provision,the department correct
