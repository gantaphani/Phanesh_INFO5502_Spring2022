background 
estremera was the owner,sole stockholder and director of a grocery store in milwaukee called pago poco,store.the store accepted food stamps.in september,fns sent estremera a letter notifying her that there was evidence that the store violated food stamp program regulations by exchanging food stamp benefits for cash and ineligible items.according to estremera,unbeknownst to her,a former employee had sold illegal items to undercover usda officers on six occasions.
on october,fns notified estremera by letter that she was immediately and permanently disqualified from accepting food stamps at the store.the letter explained that,in the event estremera sold the store,she would be subject to a civil monetary penalty pursuant to f.
estremera filed an administrative appeal challenging her disqualification from the food stamp program.the administrative review branch of fns affirmed the disqualification decision.estremera did not appeal from that decision.
in february,estremera may have sold the store to sousa investment.estremera claims she did not sell it the government claims she did.on february,estremera signed a consent action agreement to sell the store to sousa investment,a bill of sale for the store,a real estate closing statement confirming the sale to sousa investment,and an affidavit attesting to the sale of the store.also on february,sousa investment signed a mortgage note payable to pago poco,requiring sousa investment to pay pago poco the principal sum of and interest per year on the unpaid balance.additionally,on that date estremera and sousa investment signed a lease march,to february,requiring sousa investment to pay plaintiff per month.
in a letter dated march,joao desousa of sousa investment informed fns that estremera does not have a financial interest in the store,except that she receives rent for the space and operates and retains control of the liquor department.
on april,fns sent estremera a letter notifying her that,due to her sale of the store,she was required to pay as a civil monetary penalty for her past violations of food stamp program regulations.the penalty was based on six counts of food stamp fraud.fns assessed the maximum fine available for each violation.see b i and g.estremera appealed the fine to the administrative review branch of the fns,which upheld the imposition of the penalty.
estremera brought suit in federal district court under a challenging the penalty.the government filed a motion for summary judgment.the district court granted the motion and dismissed estremera complaint.estremera then filed a rule e motion to alter or amend the judgment,which the district court denied.the district court found that estremera used the motion improperly to advance a new legal theory,that the agency imposition of the civil penalty was arbitrary and capricious,and to rehash arguments already decided on the motion to dismiss.estremera appeals.
ii.discussion 
estremera raises three errors on appeal.first,she maintains that she never sold the store to sousa investment and that the district court erred by determining that a sale occurred.second,she argues that the district court applied the wrong standard of review to several aspects of the agency decision to fine her in the amount of.third,estremera asserts that the district court erred by determining that the agency calculated her fine correctly.as explained below,we are not persuaded by these arguments.
sale of pago poco.
according to estremera,summary judgment was inappropriate in this case because substantial facts remain in dispute regarding whether estremera actually sold the store to sousa investment.estremera maintains that she did not.according to her,the parties agreed that she would retain ownership of the store until sousa investment paid the remaining on the mortgage note.sousa investment made only five payments on the note beyond its down payment.thus,according to estremera,the sale was never completed.
estremera also argues that the sale was a sham or aborted transaction,because sousa investment never intended to pay off the mortgage note.she maintains that sousa investment bad faith is evidenced by the fact that it made only five payments on the note beyond the down payment.sousa investment actions,estremera implies,rendered the sale void or voidable.estremera further argues that even if sousa investment did not act in bad faith,the sale was a legal nullity,because the sale was not completed and the business was turned back over to estremera.
additionally,estremera argues that there was no sale because she did not make an informed consent to the sale.she claims that her attorney in the real estate transaction failed to inform her of the likelihood that she would be required to pay a monetary penalty if she sold the store.estremera attorney in this action who had nothing to do with the real estate transaction signed an affidavit stating that he had on a review and analysis of the documents involved in the sale of the estremera former attorney did not warn estremera of the looming transfer of ownership penalty.
estremera admits that she signed an admission stating that she sold the store to sousa investment.she argues,however,that she was confused over the meaning of the word sold when she made that statement.estremera subsequently amended the admission to state that a sale did not legally occur.
the government argues that estremera has failed to offer any evidence or legal authority in support of her argument that there was not a sale.the government also emphasizes that there is ample evidence that there was a sale a signed consent agreement to sell the store a signed bill of sale a signed real estate closing confirming the sale a signed affidavit from estremera attesting to the sale a signed mortgage note and lease a signed personal guarantee of the mortgage note and lease and a signed letter from the purchaser stating that estremera did not have a financial interest in the store except for the rent she receives.
the district court considered these arguments and found that estremera sold the store to sousa investment.we agree.all of the documents offered by the parties,including the bill of sale,consent action agreement,real estate closing statement,and estremera affidavit attesting to the sale,demonstrate that there was a sale.for instance,the real estate closing statement records pago poco,as the seller and sousa investment,llc as the buyer.the real estate closing statement also records the balance owed to estremera,the seller,as o as of the february,closing date.additionally,there is nothing in the mortgage note to indicate that the sale was not final until the note was fully paid.the mortgage note shows simply that estremera provided a mortgage to sousa investment.under the terms of the mortgage note,if sousa investment defaulted on its payments,estremera could require sousa investment immediately to pay off the entire balance owed to her.
estremera other arguments fail as well.estremera asserts that the sale was void or voidable because sousa investment never intended to pay for the store.however,she offers no legal or factual support for this argument.the documents provided by the parties indicate that the sale was complete on february.although sousa investment still owed payments to
