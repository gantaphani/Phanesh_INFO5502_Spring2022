the alj undertook the familiar test to determine whether tilley was disabled as of september,the alj found that tilley met the first two steps of the analysis she had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset of disability date,and her impairment was severe.because her impairment did not meet or equal those listed in the social security regulations,the alj proceeded to the fourth step,which asks whether tilley could perform her past relevant work.the alj found that tilley had the residual functional capacity to perform light as of the date last insured and thus could have returned to her work in food services.accordingly,the alj determined that she did not meet the social security act definition of disabled and denied her claim for benefits.
in concluding that tilley could perform her past relevant work,the alj rejected ragland opinion,discrediting it based on tilley activities prior to and immediately following the last date of insurance coverage.
