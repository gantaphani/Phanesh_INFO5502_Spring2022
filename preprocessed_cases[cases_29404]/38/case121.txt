felipe oteze fowlkes fowlkes appeals from a march,judgment of the united states district court for the northern district of new york thomas mcavoy,judge dismissing his civil rights action,which alleges improper suspension of his social security benefits,and declining to treat the action as a petition for review of a decision of the social security administration ssa or the commissioner.for the reasons stated below,we remand this action to the district court with instructions to treat fowlkes complaint as a petition for review of the commissioner suspension of fowlkes benefits and to remand to the commissioner to examine whether fowlkes benefits were suspended as of the date of a warrant or order issued by a court or other authorized tribunal on the basis of a finding that fowlkes fled or was fleeing from justice,pursuant to e a and b.
facts and procedural background 
in,fowlkes applied for and was granted supplemental security income ssi benefits after an administrative law judge alj determined that he was disabled based on a mental illness.on september,fowlkes was indicted by a grand jury in nottaway county circuit court in virginia for felony larceny,and on november,fowlkes was indicted in the same court for making a false material statement on a voter registration form.
on march,the ssa informed was then residing in schenectady,new he had been determined to be a fugitive felon ineligible for ssi benefits on the basis of the virginia indictments.the notice stated that fowlkes benefits were being suspended retroactively to september,although fowlkes had already been paid for months between september and march the ssa considered the benefits to be an overpayment.
fowlkes requested a hearing to challenge the suspension of his benefits,and testified before an alj on november.in ruling after the hearing,the alj noted that the issue under consideration was whether fowlkes continue d to be ineligible for ssi benefits pursuant to e a because of an outstanding warrant for arrest on felony charges.the alj concluded that because the nottoway county sheriff verified that two felony charges were pending against fowlkes,he was a fugitive felon.on april,fowlkes filed a request for review by the ssa appeals council,which denied his request.
on april,fowlkes filed the instant action pro se in the united states district court for the northern district of new york.the complaint named as defendants john adamec and paul officials from the schenectady,ssa district the alj who had affirmed the ssa decision,joseph gibbons,claimed that his right to due process had been violated,and requested an injunctive order reinstating fowlkes benefits and granting him compensatory and punitive damages.
fowlkes argued in his complaint that the defendants wrongly determined that he was a fleeing felon under e a because,although fowlkes was informed by the nottoway county sheriff department that he would be arrested if found in virginia,the sheriff department declined to issue an extradition warrant outside virginia.fowlkes argued that without an order of return to virginia,he was not a fugitive from justice and thus could not be deemed a fleeing felon.
the district court sua sponte dismissed the case against alj gibbons under the doctrine of immunity,and referred the motion to dismiss to magistrate judge david homer.the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation on march,in which he recommended that fowlkes civil rights claim be dismissed,but that the action be converted into an appeal of an adverse decision of the ssa pursuant to g,with commissioner joanne barnhart substituted as defendant.the magistrate judge held that a person is fleeing under e a and when he hides or absents himself with the intent to frustrate prosecution.fowlkes adamec,and order,slip,at,quoting united states,cir.the magistrate judge found that there was no evidence that fowlkes knew of the charges prior to march,nor that he had fled the jurisdiction in an attempt to avoid prosecution.therefore,the magistrate judge held that no evidence supported the alj finding that fowlkes was a fleeing felon prior to march.the magistrate judge further held that there existed some evidence that fowlkes was a fleeing felon after march.accordingly,the magistrate judge recommended that the decision of the commissioner be reversed as to the effective date of the suspension and remanded for a recalculation of benefits,if any,to which fowlkes was entitled for the period from september to march.
in march,fowlkes filed pro se objections to the magistrate judge report and recommendation.fowlkes objected to the magistrate judge conclusion that evidence existed that he was a fugitive felon as of march.he asserted that he did not actually receive notice of the basis for the suspension from the ssa until he voluntarily went to the schenectady police department on april.fowlkes also asserted that the ssa did not have the authority to deem him a fugitive felon absent a finding of such status in an extradition proceeding.finally,fowlkes stated that he had already received ssi benefits for the period between september and march,and therefore did not wish for a remand to recalculate benefits,but appears to have been seeking a finding that he had never been a fleeing felon and thus that his benefits should be restored completely.
on march,the district court adopted the recommendation of the magistrate judge only inasmuch as it recommended the dismissal of fowlkes civil rights claim.addressing fowlkes claim as a fifth amendment due process claim pursuant to bivens six unknown fed.narcotics agents,d,the district court noted that courts should decline to create a remedy for constitutional violations where there is an explicit congressional declaration that injured parties should be remitted to another remedy,equally effective in the view of congress.fowlkes adamec,decision order,slip,at,quoting bivens,at.the district court then noted that g provided for judicial review of disability benefit determinations.the district court also held that even assuming fowlkes claim was actionable under bivens,fowlkes had failed to state a due process claim,as he was afforded an alj hearing that satisfied the fundamental requirement of due process that he have notice and the opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time in a meaningful manner.id.at internal quotation marks omitted.
the district court also stated that the magistrate judge recommendation to convert the action and remand it back to the commissioner for further determination was the only avenue available to fowlkes.id.at.the district court however,declined to adopt this recommendation because it found that fowlkes clearly does not want that relief.id.the district court therefore did not convert fowlkes action to a petition for review.judgment was entered on march.
fowlkes filed a timely notice of appeal on april.on january,this court sua sponte appointed counsel to represent fowlkes for this appeal,and directed the parties to brief whether,under e a,fowlkes was fleeing to avoid prosecution,or custody or confinement after conviction what standard of review applies and what standard of deference,if any,is appropriate to applicable regulations or other interpretive authority of the ssa and what relief,if any,fowlkes is entitled to if we determine that he was not statutorily ineligible for ssi benefits.see fowlkes adamec.cir.
in his counseled brief,fowlkes argues that he was not a fugitive felon ineligible for ssi benefits under e a as of september because the statute requires he have an intention to flee,which fowlkes argues that he lacked prior to march because he was not aware of the indictments against him in virginia,and after march because an intent to flee can not be inferred where a petitioner was financially unable to return to the charging state and the regulations require a court order finding that fowlkes was a fleeing felon before the ssa can suspend benefits,and no such court order existed here.the commissioner responds that e a does not require a showing of intent,that the regulations do not require a court order,and that these interpretations are entitled to deference und
