opinion of the court 
the pennsylvania pharmacists association and pharmacies operating in southeastern pennsylvania brought this action under against feather houstoun,the secretary of the pennsylvania department of public welfare the department,to challenge the reimbursement rates paid to pharmacies under pennsylvania medicaid program.the plaintiffs claimed that the department,in administering its healthchoices southeast program healthchoices,was violating provisions of title xix of the social security act the medicaid act,a v.the plaintiffs principal claim was based on a section a.in accordance with its interpretation of prior circuit precedent,the district court held that the plaintiffs could assert their section a claim under,but the district court nevertheless granted summary judgment against the plaintiffs.we now hold that the plaintiffs,as medicaid providers,may not assert their claims under,and we therefore affirm the order of the district court on this alternative ground.
medicaid is a cooperative program under which the federal government furnishes funding to states for the purpose of providing medical assistance to eligible persons.see rite aid of pennsylvania,houstoun,cir.if a state chooses to participate in the program,it must comply with the medicaid act and implementing regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services hhs.see wilder virginia hosp.ass,d.in order to participate,a state must submit a medical assistance plan to the secretary of hhs and obtain approval of the plan.see.with further administrative approval,a state may amend a previously approved plan.see.
under the medicaid act,a state is required to pay for certain enumerated services and may choose to pay for certain additional services.a a.pennsylvania includes prescription drugs among its optional services.see a a.
until,pennsylvania compensated participating pharmacists directly under a program.payments to these pharmacies generally consisted of two components ingredient cost reimbursement and a dispensing fee.pharmacies were compensated for drugs based on the estimated acquisition cost of the drugs plus a reasonable dispensing fee.see a a et.pharmacists were compensated for generic drugs using acquisition cost limits established by hhs plus a reasonable dispensing fee.
in,the pennsylvania department of public welfare began to implement its healthchoices program,a mandatory managed care program operated in five counties in the southeastern part of the state pursuant to an hfca waiver from certain provisions of the medicaid act the department contracted with four health management organizations hmos to administer healthchoices.three of the four hmos administer pharmacy benefits through contracts with pharmacy benefits managers.when an hmo contracts with a pharmacy benefits manager,the hmo and the pharmacy benefits manager set the rates at which pharmacies are reimbursed.the pharmacy benefits manager then contracts directly with the participating pharmacies to provide outpatient pharmacy services to eligible beneficiaries.
in order to participate in healthchoices,the named pharmacy plaintiffs entered into standardized medical assistance provider agreements with the department.the agreements cover the provision of and generic prescription drugs to eligible beneficiaries and obligate the department to reimburse the contracting pharmacies in accordance with state and federal law.
in january,the plaintiffs commenced this action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and requested declaratory and injunctive relief.the plaintiffs principal claim was that the new payment rates violate section a,which requires a state medicaid plan to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.the plaintiffs alleged that the pharmacy benefits managers,without oversight from the department,had decreased the outpatient pharmacy benefit rates so much that they were below the cost of acquiring and dispensing the drugs.
the district court certified a class of pharmacy plaintiffs and denied the department motion to dismiss the complaint,holding that the plaintiffs had a private right to enforce section a.pennsylvania pharmacists ass houstoun,no.october.as support for its holding on this point,the court cited a footnote in a prior panel opinion of this court.see rite aid of pennsylvania,houstoun,cir.
the district court subsequently granted the defendant motion for summary judgment.pennsylvania pharmacists ass houstoun,no,wl,at.june.the court held that the department,in implementing its new program,had properly considered efficiency,economy,and access to quality pharmacy services,that its procedures were neither arbitrary nor capricious,and that the resulting payment rates did not violate section a.pennsylvania pharmacists ass n,wl,at.
the plaintiffs appealed,and their arguments were heard before a regular panel.under a longstanding practice of our court,a panel may not overrule another panel decision.a footnote in the panel opinion in rite aid appeared to hold that a provider may assert a section a claim under,but the footnote provided no elaboration by the time of the panel argument in this case,the other courts of appeals were divided on this issue.prior to the issuance of a panel decision,we granted rehearing en banc primarily for the purpose of considering the issue.
the threshold issue that we must consider is whether the plaintiffs,as medicaid providers as opposed to medicaid recipients,may assert a section a claim under.section provides a private right of action against any person who,acting under the color of state or territorial law,abridges rights,privileges,or immunities secured by the constitution and laws of the united states.see also maine thiboutot,d.in order to seek redress under,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,and not merely a violation of federal law.golden state transit city of los angeles,d.thus,a plaintiff alleging a violation of a federal statute may not proceed under unless the statute creates enforceable rights,privileges,or immunities within the meaning of and congress has not foreclosed such enforcement of the statute in the enactment itself.wright roanoke redevelopment and housing,d.
in considering the first of these the statute must create an enforceable right,privilege,or must determine whether the three conditions identified by the supreme court in wilder and blessing freestone,d,are satisfied.first,the provision in question must have been intend ed to benefit the putative plaintiff.wilder,at.quoting golden state transit,at.brackets added in wilder see also blessing,at.second,the right allegedly protected by the statute must not be so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.blessing,at.wilder,at.finally,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states,and thus the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.blessing,at.
once these requirements are the existence of a federal right is rebuttable presumption arises that the right is enforceable under.blessing,at.this presumption may be rebutted by showing that congress expressly or impliedly foreclosed an action under.see also livadas bradshaw,d.
in the present case,the focus of our inquiry is the requirement that the provision in question must have been intended to benefit the plaintiffs.blessing,at.wilder,at.golden state transit,at.wright,at.it is important to keep in mind that the question whether a statute is intended to benefit particular plaintiffs is quite different from the question whether the statute in fact benefits those plaintiffs or even whether congress knew that the statute would benefit those plaintiffs.in the present case,it may well be that section a in fact benefits pharmacies in some states and that congress realized this in enacting that provision.for example,if section a were not on the books,a state plan might provide lesser access to pharmacy services than section a requires.in any such state,section a presumably has the effect of increasing drug sales,and these increased drug sales presumably benefit well as drug wholesalers,drug manufacturers,many other businesses,lessors of pharmacy premises,cleaning service firms retained by pharmacies,trash collection companies retained by pharmacies,private security firms retained by pharmacies,employees of all of these businesses.congress undoubtedly realizes that federal subsidies have such ripple effects,but it would be outlandish to argue that the requirement permits all of these businesses and individuals to assert section a claims in federal court.our inquiry,consequently,is quite narrow did congress,in enacting section a,intend to benefit providers 
in attempting to answer this question,the supreme court has instructed us to pay careful attention to the way in which the statutory provision at issue is framed.in cannon university of chicago,d,the court wrote that the question whether a statute is enacted for the benefit of a particular class of plaintiffs is answered by looking to the language of the statute itself.the court noted the importance of any right or language in the statute.id.at.moreover,in holding that the statute in that case was intended to benefit the plaintiffs,the court observed that the statute was phrased in terms of the persons benefited and was draft ed with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.id.at.more recently,in alexander sandoval,d,the court again commented on the importance of the particular phrasing of a statute in this regard.
while cannon and alexander concerned the implication of a private right of action under a statute,rather than the assertion of a statutory claim under,the tests applied in these contexts partially overlap and both tests ask whether the statute at issue was intended to benefit the putative plaintiff or plaintiffs.see wright,at,dissenting.thus,in cases applying the test,the court has also relied on the terms in which the statute is drafted.
wilder itself is illustrative.in wilder,a hospital filed a action asserting a violation of the boren amendment to the medicaid act,a repealed.the boren amendment required a state medicaid plan to provide a class of providers with payments that were reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities that comply with applicable state and federal laws and standards.id.holding that there was little doubt that the boren amendment was intended to benefit these providers,the supreme court stressed the boren amendment language,at,and noted that the amendment establishe d a system for reimbursement of providers and was phrased in terms benefit health care providers.wilder,at.emphasis added.thus,the court relied on language in the boren amendment that measured the adequacy of payments in relation to the economics of providers,their need to cover their reasonable costs.as the court later emphasized in suter artist,d,wilder took pains to analyze the statutory provisions in detail.
with these standards in mind,we focus on the language of section a.section a provides that a state plan for medical assistance must 
p rovide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
because this language put it,it is helpful to break it down.under section a,a state must provide methods and procedures.these methods and procedures must assure that payments to providers produce four outcomes efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access to providers by medicaid beneficiaries 
it seems clear to us that the first two required outcomes efficiency and economy relate to the state program,not providers,section a requires that a state program set payments at levels that make the program efficient and economical what sort of payments would make a program inefficient and uneconomical payments that are too high.accordingly,the directive to achieve efficiency and economy was obviously not intended to benefit providers.
that leaves the directives to provide quality of care and adequate access.these directives are draft ed with an unmistakable focus on medicaid beneficiaries,not providers.cannon,at.they are phrased in terms benefiting medicaid recipients,wilder,at,and these are the persons that congress intended to benefit.if congress had wanted to look after pharmacies,it would hardly have framed section a in the terms it chose.
the language of section a contrasts sharply with that of the boren amendment,which was interpreted in wilder as intended to benefit the relevant providers.as previously noted,the boren amendment required a state medicaid plan to provide payments to providers that were reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities that comply with applicable state and federal laws and standards,a,stat.it was thus phrased in terms benefitting providers and measured the sufficiency of payments by reference to the economics of providers.it plainly manifested concern for the economic of providers.section a,unlike the boren amendment,does not demand that payments be set at levels that are sufficient to cover provider costs.unlike the boren amendment,it evinces no direct concern for the economic situation of providers.instead,it demands that payments be set at levels that are sufficient to meet recipients needs.it is phrased in terms benefitting recipients,and the adequacy of payments is measured in relation to the health needs of recipients.it manifests concern solely for the of recipients.it is therefore apparent from the statutory language that the intended beneficiaries of section a are recipients,not providers.
the principal dissent disagrees with this analysis and maintains that the boren amendment and section a confer nearly identical rights on providers.principal dissent at.the principal dissent makes two principal points.first,it dismisses the significance of the presence in the boren amendment and the absence from section a of language focusing on provider costs.second,it argues that quality of care played essentially the same role in the boren amendment as it does in section a.neither point is well taken.
the language in the boren amendment focusing on provider costs is telling because it manifests a clear congressional concern for the economic plight of providers and an intent to benefit them.we are convinced that this statutory language was the basis for the wilder court statement that the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefit providers.at.the principal dissent interprets this statement to mean simply that the boren amendment required states to establish a scheme for provider reimbursement.see principal dissent at.but if this interpretation were correct,the supreme court full sentence the provision establishes a system for reimbursement of providers and is phrased in terms benefit health care providers would say exactly the same thing twice the provision establishes a system for reimbursement of providers,at,and require s states to establish a scheme for provider reimbursement,principal dissent at.we therefore disagree with the principal dissent and believe that the reference to phrasing pertains to the boren amendment language.
this language is also of particular significance in,to use the principal dissent phrase,the dynamic of the real world of healthcare.principal dissent at.cost reimbursement schemes are generally favorable to providers and greatly disliked by those required to do the reimbursing the house committee report recommending repeal of the boren amendment cited a congressional budget office estimate that its elimination would save billion over four years and the national governors association provided even higher estimates we take no side in the policy debate about cost reimbursement,but we think that it is highly unrealistic to minimize the significance of the presence in the boren amendment of language.this language was plainly a boon for providers congress surely understood its implications and its inclusion in the boren amendment was an unmistakable sign of a congressional desire to benefit providers.
the principal dissent also misinterprets the boren amendment as containing a requirement similar to that in section a.see principal dissent at boren amendment mandates minimum reimbursement rates defined by reference to quality of care id.at rates must be sufficient to ensure quality of care id.at same.in fact,however,quality of care played a decidedly secondary role in the boren amendment.whereas quality of care is a primary benchmark for setting payments in section a,the boren amendment simply provided that reimbursements were to be calculated by reference to the reasonable costs of providers that were operating in compliance with other applicable legal the precise language of the amendment,with applicable state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards a a repealed.thus,for example,in determining the reasonable costs of a nursing home,the boren amendment looked to nursing homes that were complying with state fire safety laws rather than those that cut costs by doing without fire escapes,smoke detectors.the principal dissent obscures this point by repeatedly eliding the reference to state and federal laws and regulations and referring only to quality and safety standards.see principal dissent at.
in attempting to point out what we view as the critical differences between the boren amendment and section a,we do not dispute the obvious point that these provisions have other features in common,as the principal dissent points out.for instance,the principal dissent is correct in noting that b oth the boren amendment and section a require states to reimburse providers for services rendered.principal dissent at.but as we began by cautioning,the inquiry mandated by wilder and congress intended for section a to benefit providers as opposed to simply knowing that providers would be for us to draw a fine line and to take into account the precise statutory language adopted by congress.after considering the language of the boren amendment and section a,we remain convinced that there are critical differences and that section a,unlike the boren amendment,was not intended to benefit providers.
we have examined the legislative history of section a and have found nothing inconsistent with our reading of the statutory language.the plaintiffs note that when section a was originally enacted in,see social security amendments of,stat,it differed in two respects from the current version it required a state plan to assure that payments were not in excess of reasonable charges,and it lacked the adequate access requirement that the current version contains in,congress changed these features.
nothing in the amendments suggests that the current version of the statute is intended to benefit providers.on the contrary,the effect of the amendments was to sharpen the focus on medicaid beneficiaries.language referring to providers charges was removed,and language providing a further protection for beneficiaries was added.
the plaintiffs note,however,that the house committee report on the amendments observed that in instances where the states or the secretary fail to observe these statutory requirements,the courts would be expected to take appropriate remedial action,vol.ii,at.this statement certainly suggests that the committee anticipated that some class of plaintiffs would be able to sue to enforce section a,but it does not show that the committee anticipated that medicaid providers,as opposed to recipients,would be able to do so.it is thus of little value for present purposes.
the plaintiffs rely,finally,on certain hhs regulations that the plaintiffs view as showing that hhs has interpreted section a as intended to benefit providers.we have examined these regulations,and we do not believe that they evidence any such interpretation.the most pertinent of the current regulations cited by the plaintiffs establish upper limits on what a state program may pay for drugs.see.section b,which applies to brand name drugs duly certified by a physician to be medically necessary for a particular recipient,is illustrative.this provision states that a state agency payments for such drugs 
must not exceed in the aggregate,payment levels that the agency has determined by applying the lower of the 
estimate acquisition costs plus reasonable dispensing fees established by the agency or 
providers usual and customary charges to the general public 
these regulations do not assist the plaintiffs here for the obvious reason that they merely set a ceiling,but no floor,on what providers must be paid.any payments below the ceiling,no matter how low,would satisfy the regulation.accordingly,the regulations do not show that the secretary has interpreted section a as intended to benefit providers nor can they be viewed as themselves intended to benefit providers 
in sum,we are convinced that section a is not intended to benefit providers and that therefore providers may not assert a section a claim under.
of the other courts of appeals that have considered the question whether providers may assert a section a claim under,the fifth circuit opinion contains the most thorough analysis of the requirement.see evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir see also walgreen hood,cir.in evergreen presbyterian ministries,the fifth circuit wrote 
section a focuses on recipients in that it is directly keyed to the recipients access to medical care,and as a result,the recipients are the direct intended beneficiaries of the section i n contrast to the boren amendment,section a does not create an individual entitlement in favor of any provider.the section benefits recipients by ensuring there is an adequate number of providers in the marketplace.therefore,it may be true that health care providers as a group are indirectly benefitted by section a because the section requires that the payments to providers be sufficient to ensure that medicaid recipients have equal access to medical care.but it can not be said that section a necessarily confers upon each provider an individual right to a particular payment because the section does not focus directly on providers.
at emphasis in the original.we agree with the fifth circuit analysis and holding.
prior to the decision in evergreen presbyterian ministries,the first,seventh,and eighth circuits had held that providers may pursue a section a action under,but we decline to follow these decisions.see visiting nurse ass of north shore,bullen,cir methodist hospitals,sullivan,cir arkansas med.soc y,reynolds,cir 
in arkansas medical society,the eighth circuit reasoned as follows 
the question of whether the medicaid providers are intended beneficiaries is easily resolved.wilder concluded that institutional providers were intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment because the amendment concerned their reimbursement.wilder,at.at.similarly,the equal access provision of section a addresses payment for care and services provided by noninstitutional providers.the providers here are beneficiaries for the same reason that the providers in wilder were beneficiaries.
at emphasis added.
this analysis pays little attention to the differing terms of the boren amendment and section a and is thus inconsistent with the reminder in suter to examine each particular statutory provision in detail.at.arkansas medical society fails to note that the boren amendment was keyed to providers costs,whereas section a focuses on the care and services available to recipients.moreover,while arkansas medical society read wilder to mean that the boren amendment was intended to benefit providers simply because it concerned their reimbursement,at,wilder actually relied on the fact that the boren amendment establishe d a system for reimbursement of providers and was phrased in terms benefit health care providers.wilder,at emphasis added.as we have noted,the same can not be said of section a.
in methodist hospitals,sullivan,supra,the seventh circuit held that medicaid providers may assert section a claims under,but the opinion provides no indication that the seventh circuit was presented with the question whether section a was intended to benefit providers.instead,the opinion merely district court holding that providers could not sue under section a because the term geographic area is so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.methodist hospitals indiana family and social services.
in visiting nurse ass of north shore,bullen,supra,the argument presented to the first circuit regarding the requirement was notably different from the argument presented to us.in visiting nurse ass n,it was argued that section a,unlike the boren amendment,is not intended to benefit providers because section a does not list specific categories of health care providers,hospitals,nursing facilities,and intermediate care facilities.at.the first circuit rejected this attempted distinction and wrote 
the wilder court first observed that the statute is phrased in terms benefit health care providers,and leaves little doubt that health care providers are the intended beneficiaries,then proceeded to illustrate how the plain language of the boren amendment establishes a system for reimbursement of providers through its listing of specific types of health care providers.nowhere did the court indicate that the more general term providers would not suffice,however,or that a listing of specific types of providers is a sine qua non without which a congressional intent to benefit health care providers could not be inferred.as long as the two statutory provisions evince a congressional concern for preserving financial incentives to ensuring adequate reimbursement payment are appropriately considered intended beneficiaries.see arkansas med.soc y,at.
at italics in quotations from wilder added by first circuit.to the extent that the first circuit rejected the particular argument advanced to it,its decision has no bearing on the issue we address here.and to the extent that the first circuit simply adopted the reasoning of arkansas medical society,we find that reasoning unpersuasive for the reasons already explained.
after considering all of the decisions of other courts of appeals on the question before us,we agree with the fifth circuit analysis in evergreen presbyterian ministries,and we respectfully decline to follow the contrary courts of appeals,decisions.
our conclusion that providers may not assert section a claims under does not mean that section a important quality of care and access requirements will go unenforced.not only is hhs responsible for ensuring that state plans are administered in accordance with these requirements,see,but medicaid recipients plainly satisfy the requirement and are thus potential private plaintiffs.in other parts of the country,recipients have sued to enforce section a,and the other courts of appeals have uniformly held that recipients may assert such claims under s.see evergreen presbyterian ministries,at visiting nurse ass n,at arkansas medical society,at.if,as the plaintiffs in this case allege,the rates set under the healthchoices program are so low that compliance with the quality of care and access requirements is threatened,we see no reason to believe that recipients in the affected area of the commonwealth will not seek legal redress to ensure that these critical mandates are met.
for the reasons explained above,the order of the district court is affirmed.
the focus of the majority opinion,quite properly,is on whether section a is intended to benefit the provider plaintiffs.to reach the result that it was not,the majority must distinguish the case central to the outcome,wilder virginia hospital association,d,which held that the boren amendment,a statute that by its express terms required states to establish a scheme for reimbursement of medicaid healthcare providers,is intended to benefit providers.the majority attempts to do so by reasoning that the boren amendment and section a contrast sharply.op.at.i disagree,for as i will explain,the two statutes confer nearly identical rights on providers.hence this case is squarely controlled by wilder,which compels the conclusion that healthcare providers may sue under to enforce their rights under section a.the clear majority of circuits to address the question whether healthcare providers may sue under s to enforce their rights under section a have resolved that question in the affirmative,and my views are in accord.
as the majority observes,the boren amendment and section a differ textually insofar as the boren amendment reference to provider costs in its definition of reimbursement rates is absent from section a.the rationale of wilder,however,renders this difference immaterial,since wilder nowhere relied on the boren amendment reference to provider costs in concluding that providers were intended beneficiaries of that statute.rather,wilder clearly explained that the reason providers were intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment is that the provision by its express terms required states to establish a scheme for provider reimbursement.see wilder,at.similarly,section a expressly requires states to establish a system for reimbursing providers for services rendered.
much of the majority opinion is devoted to explaining why medicaid recipients are among the intended beneficiaries of section a.i agree,but a statute can have more than one class of intended beneficiaries and hence the mere fact that congress intended section a to benefit medicaid recipients has no bearing on whether congress also intended section a to benefit medicaid providers.by its own terms,section a is addressed to both healthcare providers and medicaid recipients,for,like the boren amendment,it expressly requires states to establish a scheme for provider reimbursement and mandates minimum reimbursement rates defined by reference to quality of care and recipients access to care and services.hence,wilder controls.
while this brief introduction sets up the analytical core of this opinion,it is deficient to the extent that it lacks dynamic of the real world of healthcare.unfortunately,so does the majority opinion,which,while commendably terse,is short on realpolitik.i will therefore supply that broader context,which implicates the relationship between provider costs and the availability of services to medicaid recipients.the background of this case is the recent change in the medicaid system in the philadelphia metropolitan area from to managed care.the plaintiffs have adduced evidence designed to demonstrate that the hmos,in administering medicaid,have squeezed the pharmacies and reduced provider reimbursement rates to levels that,according to the plaintiffs,are below any reasonable measure of the cost of providing care and services.as a practical matter,if the hmos set provider reimbursement rates too low,providers will simply refuse to render services to medicaid recipients,and recipients will go without adequate access.in fact,of the pharmacies that participated in medicaid in the five county area have dropped out since.the plaintiffs also produced evidence that no pharmacy within fifteen contiguous zip codes in bucks and montgomery counties participates in medicaid,and that among those pharmacies in the area that continue to participate in medicaid,quality of care has suffered as a result of inadequate reimbursement rates.
while the plaintiffs submissions in this area are contested,and failure to establish that the challenged reimbursement rates violate section a quality of care and adequate access mandates would be fatal to their case,they demonstrate a nexus between the interests of providers and the interests of recipients,which is recognized by the express terms of section a.moreover,given the financial straits of medicaid recipients and providers access to information on the relationship between reimbursement rates and provider participation in medicaid,healthcare providers may be better able to enforce recipients and providers shared interest in assuring that provider reimbursement rates comply with the mandates of section a.
i thus respectfully dissent from the conclusion that does not grant providers a cause of action to sue for violations of section a.since the court has not gone beyond the threshold issue of whether grants providers a right of action to enforce section a,i would reconstitute the original panel so that it may resolve the merits of the department summary judgment motion,which requires determining whether plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the challenged reimbursement rates violate section a quality of care and adequate access mandates,an issue on which i express no opinion.
the managed care program at issue is healthchoices,under which the pennsylvania department of public welfare has contracted with four hmos to administer the medicaid program in the area.the department agrees to pay the hmos on a basis,and permits the hmos to set pharmacy reimbursement rates.the plaintiffs allege that the pharmacy reimbursement rates set by the hmos are below any reasonable estimate of pharmacies costs,and that unless rates are at least adequate to cover providers costs,they can not be consistent with quality of care or sufficient to induce enough pharmacies to participate in medicaid so that medicaid recipients have the same access to pharmacies as members of the general population,as is required by section a.
in support of their claim that current rates are inconsistent with quality of care,the plaintiff pharmacists produced evidence that low reimbursement rates prevent them from dispensing or stocking certain drugs low reimbursement rates require them to cut back on services provided to customers,such as counseling customers about how to use their medication administrative problems with the healthchoices hmos prevent their customers from obtaining medication healthchoices hmos force their customers to change repeatedly their medication,causing delays and leading to health problems when the new medication is ineffective healthchoices hmos restrict the formularies that may be used to fill customer prescriptions,causing delays in customers prescriptions being filled,often to the detriment of customers health and healthchoices hmos make medical judgments on a daily basis over the phone and deny medications that they know nothing about.
in support of their allegation that the reimbursement rates fall below the minimum rates mandated by section a access requirement,plaintiffs produced evidence showing a precipitous drop in the number of pharmacies in the area who participate in medicaid since the inception of healthchoices.in particular,of the pharmacies that participated in medicaid have dropped out since.plaintiffs also produced evidence that the healthchoices reimbursement rates are the lowest rates in the area,and that whereas the blue cross network has participating pharmacies in the area,the four healthchoices hmos have only,and pharmacies each participating in their networks.moreover,there are no pharmacies that participate in medicaid in fifteen contiguous zip codes in bucks and montgomery counties.consequently,according to the plaintiffs,medicaid recipients lack access to pharmacies to the same extent as the general population.
whether this evidence is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the current rates violate section a quality of care and adequate access mandate is,of course,disputed by the department.my purpose in summarizing this evidence is not to express a view as to whether this evidence is sufficient for plaintiffs claims to survive summary judgment,but rather to provide concrete evidence of the common interest shared by providers and recipients in enforcing the provider reimbursement rates mandated by section a.
on its face section a is addressed to both healthcare providers and medicaid recipients,as it expressly requires states to establish a scheme for provider reimbursement and mandates minimum reimbursement rates defined by reference to recipients quality of care and access to care and services.in particular,section a requires states to provide methods and procedures relating to the payment for care and services available under the plan and to reimburse providers at rates that are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
the house report on the amendment to section a confirms congress recognition that because healthcare providers participation in medicaid is voluntary,medicaid recipients access to healthcare will suffer if provider reimbursement rates are too low to induce a sufficient number of providers to participate in medicaid 
there is no doubt that medicaid reimbursement rates have not kept pace with average community rates the committee believes that,without adequate payment levels,it is simply unrealistic to expect physicians to participate in the program t he committee bill would require that medicaid payments for all practitioners be sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and service are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
at,reprinted in.as the majority notes,section a legislative history also indicates that congress intended section a to be enforced through private actions.see,at i n instances where the states or the secretary fail to observe these statutory requirements,the courts would be expected to take appropriate remedial action.
the evidence we have described illustrates the manner in which the interests of healthcare providers and medicaid recipients are inextricably intertwined.as we noted in west virginia university hospitals,casey,cir,aff on other grounds,d 
we recognize,of course,that the primary purpose of medicaid is to achieve the praiseworthy social objective of granting health care coverage to those who can not afford it.it does not necessarily follow,however,that title xix grants substantive rights only to medicaid patients.although the broad purpose of the medicaid act as a whole is to help the poor attain medical care,the specific purpose of section a a is to assure state compliance with some federal standard of hospital reimbursement.the section sets up a plan for the adequate and reasonable reimbursement of hospitals which serve medicaid patients,and thus hospitals are the section beneficiaries.their interests and the interests of medicaid patients are bonded by a common goal,the delivery of adequate health care by the hospitals to state medicaid patients and the enjoyment of such care by the patients.the interests of both are intertwined and hospitals have a concrete stake in reimbursement in accordance with the federal statute and regulations.
id.at.against this backdrop,i now turn to the doctrinal question whether grants healthcare providers a cause of action to enforce section a.
until now,nearly every circuit to consider the issue has held that whether providers may bring actions under to enforce the mandates of section a is squarely controlled by the supreme court decision in wilder,which of course remains binding on this court unless the supreme court overrules it.see state oil khan,d i t is this court prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.the first court of appeals to consider the issue was the eighth circuit in arkansas medical society,reynolds,cir,which concluded that section a is indistinguishable from the boren amendment,which the supreme court in wilder held was enforceable by providers under 
our analysis in this case is greatly simplified by the wilder opinion.although focusing on a different subsection,wilder addressed the same statute facing us in this case.suter urges a careful scrutiny of the exact legislation at issue and wilder has already done that t he equal access provision is very analogous to the boren amendment examined in wilder they are similar not only in function but also in the specific language employed.
id.at.with regard to the particular question whether providers are among the intended beneficiaries of section a,the court determined that 
the question of whether the medicaid providers are intended beneficiaries is also easily resolved.wilder concluded that institutional providers were intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment because the amendment concerned their reimbursement.similarly,the equal access provision of section a addresses payment for care and services provided by noninstitutional providers.the providers here are beneficiaries for the same reason that the providers in wilder were beneficiaries.
id.at internal citations omitted.
the first circuit and the seventh circuit have also easily resolved the issue whether providers may bring s actions to enforce section a by noting that the question is squarely controlled by wilder.in visiting nurse association of north shore,bullen,cir,the first circuit concluded that providers are among the intended beneficiaries of section a for the same reason that the supreme court held that they were among the intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment 
the wilder court first observed that the boren amendment is phrased in terms benefitting health care providers,and leaves little doubt that health care providers are the intended beneficiaries,then proceeded to illustrate how the plain language of the boren amendment establishes a system for reimbursement of providers as long as the two statutory provisions evince a congressional concern for preserving financial incentives to ensuring adequate reimbursement payment are appropriately considered intended beneficiaries.
id.at emphasis and internal citations omitted.similarly,the seventh circuit observed that because wilder had not been overruled,wilder holding binds us,and consequently held that providers have a private right of action under s to enforce section a.see methodist,sullivan,cir we therefore hold that providers of medical care have a private right of action,derived through,to enforce a.thus,most courts have found that whether grants providers a cause of action to enforce section a is an issue that is easily disposed of by wilder.until now,the only circuit to hold otherwise is the fifth circuit in evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir,which i discuss in section iv,infra.
the majority holds that providers may not sue under to enforce section a because they are not among the provision intended beneficiaries like most courts of appeals to consider the issue,i believe that the inquiry into whether providers are among the intended beneficiaries of section a begins and ends with wilder.
the boren amendment,which was the statute that providers sought to enforce in wilder,provided,in relevant part 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide for payment of hospital services,nursing facilities,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan through the use of rates which the state finds are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards and to assure that individuals eligible for medical assistance have reasonable access taking into account geographic location and reasonable travel time to inpatient hospital services of adequate quality 
a a repealed.
the text of section a is strikingly similar.it provides,in relevant part 
a state plan for medical assistance must provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area 
a a.comparing the two statutes,i can find no principled basis for holding that providers are intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment,as the supreme court held in wilder,but are not intended beneficiaries of section a,as the majority holds today.in particular,i can not accept the majority contention that t he language of section a contrasts sharply with that of the boren amendment.op.at 
both the boren amendment and section a require states to reimburse providers for services rendered.see boren amendment a state plan for medical assistance must provide for payment of services provided under the plan section a a state plan for medical assistance must provide methods and procedures relating to payment for,care and services available under the plan.and both the boren amendment and section a define reimbursement rates by reference to efficiency and economy.see boren amendment defining rates by reference to efficiently and economically operated facilities section a requiring states to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency and economy.
both the boren amendment and section a require states to reimburse providers at rates that are sufficient to ensure quality of care.see boren amendment requiring that reimbursement rates be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred in order to provide care and services in conformity with quality and safety standards section a requiring states to assure that payments are consistent with quality of care.and both the boren amendment and section a require states to reimburse providers at rates that are sufficient to guarantee medicaid recipients adequate access to healthcare.see boren amendment requiring rates which are reasonable and adequate to assure that individuals eligible for medical assistance have reasonable access to inpatient hospital services section a requiring states to assure that payments are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.
thus,far from contrast ing sharply,as the majority contends,see op.at,the boren amendment and section a confer on providers nearly identical rights to be reimbursed for services provided and to be reimbursed at a minimum rate that is defined by reference to quality of care and adequate access.see.med.soc y,reynolds,cir t he equal access provision of section a is very analogous to the boren amendment examined in wilder they are similar not only in function but also in the specific language employed.this case is therefore squarely controlled by wilder,and i would hold that healthcare providers may bring actions to enforce the rights conferred on them by section a 
the majority rationale relies heavily on the fact that section a is addressed in part to recipients,since it defines provider reimbursement rates by reference to quality of care and adequate access.see op.at section a directives to provide quality of care and adequate access are drafted with an unmistakable focus on medicaid beneficiaries,not providers.id.at section a demands that payments be set at levels that are sufficient to meet recipients needs.id.t he adequacy of payments under section a is measured in relation to the health needs of recipients.id.at section a focuses on the care and services available to recipients.id.at it is therefore apparent from the statutory language that the intended beneficiaries of section a are recipients,not providers.
to rely on the quality of care and adequate access guarantees as a basis for holding that section a was not intended to benefit providers,however,would require overruling wilder,which squarely held that a statute that defines provider reimbursement rates by reference to medicaid recipients quality of care and medicaid recipients access to care and services may nonetheless be intended to benefit providers.nowhere in wilder did either the majority or the dissent even hint that the boren amendment reference to quality of care and adequate access should give the court pause before concluding that the boren amendment was intended to benefit providers.as such,for purposes of determining whether providers are intended beneficiaries of section a,wilder renders irrelevant the fact that section a includes quality of care and adequate access guarantees.
inexplicably,then,the majority makes the adequate access and quality of care guarantees that are found in both the boren amendment and section a the cornerstone of its analysis in holding that providers are not intended beneficiaries of section a.to be consistent with wilder,which held that providers are intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment,however,a rationale leading to the conclusion that providers are not intended beneficiaries of section a must rest not on similarities between the boren amendment and section a,as does the vast bulk of the majority opinion,but rather on differences.
the only difference between the boren amendment and section a that the majority relies on is the boren amendment reference to providers costs,which is absent from section a.for the reasons discussed below,however,the reference to providers costs in the boren amendment and the absence of such a reference in section a are immaterial for purposes of determining whether providers are among the intended beneficiaries of section a.
first,the language of the boren amendment did not create any independent right on the part of providers to be reimbursed for their costs without reference to quality of care,as the majority maintains.the majority repeatedly quotes the language in the boren amendment requiring payments to be reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities,op.at,but neglects to quote the remainder of the clause,which goes on to expressly define costs in terms of quality of care.in fact,the boren amendment required payment for the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards.emphases added.the plain language of the boren amendment thus explicitly defined costs by reference to quality of care,and created no independent right of providers to be reimbursed for their costs beyond that conferred by the quality of care requirement,such as exists in section a.
i acknowledge that quality of care guarantees in the two statutes are not completely boren amendment requires rates that meet the costs which must be incurred to provide care and services in conformity with quality and safety standards,while section a requires rates that are consistent with quality of care.i can not agree with the majority conclusion,however,that this difference is so significant that quality of care played a decidedly secondary role in the boren amendment,but is a primary benchmark in section a.op.at.indeed,the majority never explains how a reimbursement rate could be so low that it violates the boren amendment requirement that rates meet the costs which must be incurred by efficiently and economically operated facilities in order to provide care and services in conformity with applicable state and federal laws,regulations,and quality and safety standards,yet nonetheless be consistent with quality of care,as mandated by section a.
even assuming,arguendo,that the majority is correct that the boren amendment created an independent right on the part of providers to be reimbursed for their costs without reference to quality of care,the plaintiffs in wilder were suing to enforce both their right to be reimbursed at rates that covered their costs,as well as their independent right under the boren amendment to be reimbursed at rates that are sufficient to ensure adequate access.see wilder,at.respondent contends that virginia plan for reimbursement violates the act because the rates are not reasonable and adequate to meet the economically and efficiently incurred cost of providing care to medicaid patients in hospitals and do not assure access to inpatient care.emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted.had wilder holding rested on the boren amendment reference to provider costs,as the majority contends,then the court would have permitted the providers to sue under to enforce only their right to be reimbursed for their costs,and not their additional right under the boren amendment to be reimbursed at rates sufficient to ensure recipients adequate access to care and services.
the plain language of creates a cause of action not for a violation of a statute as an undifferentiated whole,but rather for a violation of a right secured by the constitution or laws of the united states.see blessing freestone,d in order to seek redress through,a plaintiff must assert the violation of a federal right,not merely a violation of federal law.id.at.it was incumbent upon the respondents to identify with particularity the rights they claimed,since it is impossible to determine whether title,as an undifferentiated whole,gives rise to undefined rights.by permitting the providers suit to proceed,the supreme court necessarily held that providers are among the intended beneficiaries of not only the boren amendment requirement that reimbursement rates be sufficient to cover provider costs,but also the boren amendment requirement that reimbursement rates be sufficient to ensure recipients adequate access to care and services.
finally,and most importantly,the supreme court rationale in wilder made clear that in concluding that providers were intended beneficiaries of section a,it was relying not on the boren amendment reference to providers costs,as the majority asserts,but rather on the boren amendment express requirement that states establish a scheme to reimburse providers for services rendered.in attempting to distinguish section a from the boren amendment,the majority repeatedly quotes wilder conclusion that the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefitting health care providers,see op.at,but conspicuously omits the rest of the sentence,in which the wilder court explained why it concluded that the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefitting health care providers.the remainder of the sentence,which the majority never fully quotes,makes clear what particular statutory language in the boren amendment the court in wilder was in fact relying on in concluding that the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefitting providers 
there can be little doubt that health care providers are the intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment.the provision establishes a system for reimbursement of providers and is phrased in terms benefitting health care providers it requires a state plan to provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan.a a,supp.v 
wilder,at.internal alterations omitted emphasis added.
the majority is convinced,op.at,that when the wilder court stated that the boren amendment is phrased in terms benefitting health care providers it requires a state plan to provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan,the court was relying on language in the boren amendment other than the language it directly quoted.it is difficult to imagine how a judicial opinion could be more clear about what particular statutory language it is relying on to establish a given proposition than by expressly quoting that language immediately following the proposition,as the supreme court did in wilder.the majority conclusion that the court quoted only a portion of the statutory language that it relied on in concluding that the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefitting health care providers is particularly puzzling given that,according to the majority,that portion of the boren amendment that the court actually quoted in the passage above was insufficient to establish the proposition for which it was cited,while that portion of the boren amendment that the court neglected to quote the boren amendment reference to provider costs was,according to the majority,plainly a boon for providers,and an unmistakable sign of a congressional desire to benefit providers.op.at.
indeed,by the majority reasoning,it is hard to see why the wilder majority,in concluding the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefitting health care providers,would even bother to quote the particular language in the boren amendment requiring payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan,given that,according to the majority,the nearly identical language in section a requiring payment for care and services available under the plan,manifests concern solely for the of recipients.op.at emphasis added 
given that the excerpt quoted above contains the wilder court entire discussion of whether providers were intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment,the majority is plainly incorrect when it asserts that the supreme court in wilder stressed the boren amendment language,and that the court relied on language in the boren amendment that measured the adequacy of payments in relation to the economics of providers,their need to cover their reasonable costs.op.at emphases added.nowhere in its analysis did the court rely on the boren amendment reference to provider costs,much less stress such language,as the majority contends.and whatever this court may think about the breadth of the supreme court rationale,it is not our function to rewrite a supreme court opinion to narrow its holding by imputing to the court reliance on a fact that played no role in the court rationale.rather,the scope of the wilder court holding must be determined by reference to the wilder court ratio decidendi as articulated by the wilder court.
as is readily apparent from the analysis quoted above,the wilder court made perfectly clear that in concluding that there can be little doubt that healthcare providers are the intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment,it was relying on the language in the boren amendment requiring a state plan to provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan.see.med.soc y,reynolds,cir wilder concluded that institutional providers were intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment because the amendment concerned their reimbursement.see also evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir t he wilder court concluded that there was little doubt that the providers were the intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment because it established a system for reimbursement of providers and was phrased in terms benefitting health care providers,in that it required a state plan to provide for their payment.internal quotations and alterations omitted visiting nurse ass of shore,bullen,cir the wilder court observed that the statute is phrased in terms benefitting health care providers,and then proceeded to illustrate how the plain language of the boren amendment establishes a system for reimbursement of providers.emphasis omitted.
thus,for the same reason that the wilder court concluded that the boren amendment was phrased in terms benefitting health care providers it requires a state plan to provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan,at.quoting the boren amendment,i would conclude that section a is phrased in terms benefitting health care providers it requires a state plan to provide for payment for care and services available under the plan.see.med.soc y,at t he equal access provision of section a addresses payment for care and services provided by noninstitutional providers.the providers here are beneficiaries for the same reason that the providers in wilder were beneficiaries.visiting nurse ass n,at cir as long as the two statutory provisions evince a congressional concern for preserving financial incentives to ensuring adequate reimbursement payment are appropriately considered intended beneficiaries.
in sum,although there are differences between the specific language of the boren amendment and the specific language of section a,as there inevitably will be between any two statutes,these differences are immaterial in light of wilder rationale,and the supreme court in wilder gave no indication that its rationale was good for this day and train only.county of washington gunther,d rehnquist,dissenting.
until now,the only court of appeals to hold that providers may not bring actions to enforce their rights under section a was the fifth circuit in evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir,which i would decline to follow.in holding that providers are not among the intended beneficiaries of section a,the fifth circuit in evergreen relied heavily on the supreme court decision in blessing freestone,d,which held that a plaintiff may sue under for a violation of a federal statute only if the statute creates an individual entitlement,and not simply a systemwide guarantee.id.at.in blessing,the plaintiffs were mothers whose children were eligible to receive child support services from the state pursuant to title of the social security act.id.at.plaintiffs brought a action seeking to enforce,which authorizes the secretary of the department of health and human services to penalize a state if it is not in substantial compliance with title.id.at.
the blessing court held that a does not create an individual right,enforceable under,to have states achieve substantial compliance with title.first,the court noted that the plaintiffs had failed to identify a particular provision of title that grants them an individual entitlement,and may not simply sue to enforce substantial compliance with title as a whole.see blessing,at.it was incumbent upon respondents to identify with particularity the rights they claimed,since it is impossible to determine whether title,as an undifferentiated whole,gives rise to undefined rights.second,the court reasoned that because a substantial compliance requirement would be satisfied if the state provided the mandated services in only of the cases reviewed during the federal audit period,even when a state is in substantial compliance with title,any individual plaintiff might still be among the or percent of persons whose needs ultimately go unmet.id.at.thus,f ar from creating an individual entitlement to services,the standard which plaintiffs seek to enforce under is simply a yardstick for the secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a state title program.id.at.
in view of the supreme court rationale in blessing,plaintiffs claims in this case are easily distinguishable from plaintiffs claims in blessing.first,unlike the plaintiffs in blessing,the plaintiffs in this case have identified with particularity the right claimed,since they allege that the reimbursement rates violate section a quality of care and adequate access mandates.blessing,at.distinguishing wilder on the ground that in wilder,we held that health care providers had an enforceable right to reimbursement as required by a particular provision in the medicaid statute emphasis added.this case is therefore distinguishable from blessing for the same reason that the blessing court concluded that wilder was distinguishable from blessing.
blessing is further distinguishable on the ground that in that case,the plaintiffs would not necessarily have obtained any benefit had they succeeded on the merits of their claim,since the provision that they sought to enforce under required only substantial compliance with title.see blessing,at.e ven when a state is in substantial compliance with title,any individual plaintiff might still be among the or percent of persons whose needs ultimately go unmet.by contrast,in this case each individual plaintiff will necessarily benefit if they succeed on the merits,since they would each be individually entitled to reimbursement at higher rates.
i therefore disagree with evergreen reliance on blessing in concluding that section a creates only a guarantee,not an individual entitlement on the part of providers.the fifth circuit in evergreen illustrated its reasoning with the following example 
assume we have a nursing home in baton rouge with residents,which,following the rate reduction at issue,is forced into bankruptcy and then liquidation.assume further that the district court decides that the relevant geographic market to measure the access of recipients is the baton rouge market for nursing home care and also that the district court concludes that the recipients are entitled to the same access to nursing home care in baton rouge as that of recipients.finally,assume that,once the nursing home closes,all residents are able to fill vacant beds in other facilities in baton rouge.under this scenario,there is no violation of the recipients equal access rights,despite the fact that the bankrupt nursing home was put out of business.
from this example,it is apparent that while recipients have an individual entitlement to equal access to medical care,any benefit to healthcare providers is indirect at best.the statute does not confer any direct right upon the individual provider because,as the above example illustrates,even if an individual provider is forced to liquidate,the recipients right to access is not necessarily violated.
at.i find this reasoning unpersuasive.
first,the fifth circuit put the rabbit in the hat when it reasoned from a hypothetical example in which section a is not violated.see evergreen,at under this scenario,there is no violation of the recipients equal access rights.of course providers will have no individual entitlement under section a to increased reimbursement rates under a factual scenario in which section a is not violated.but in a factual scenario where reimbursement rates are so low that section a adequate access guarantee is violated,every provider who participates in medicaid would be individually entitled to reimbursement at the higher rate mandated by section a.
second,evergreen incorrectly assumed that unless a statute requiring providers to be reimbursed at a given rate ensures that no providers will ever be put out of business,the statute does not create any direct right on the part of providers.see evergreen,at the statute does not confer any direct right upon the individual provider because,as the above example illustrates,even if an individual provider is forced to liquidate,the recipients right to access is not necessarily violated.under any statute addressed to provider reimbursement,however,it will almost always be the case that some providers may go out of business notwithstanding the statute.but this possibility does not mean that the statute creates no individual entitlement on the part of providers.
consider,for example,a statute that expressly requires states to reimburse pharmacies at least each time they dispense a given dosage of a particular prescription drug to a medicaid recipient.a reimbursement rate might force certain providers out of business,but it is hard to imagine a statute that more directly confers an individual entitlement on providers.similarly,there was no guarantee in the boren amendment that no provider would ever be put out of business,but the court in wilder nonetheless held that the boren amendment conferred on providers rights that are enforceable under.
finally,the evergreen court mistakenly reasoned that because the minimum reimbursement rate mandated by section a is defined by reference to the criterion of medicaid recipients access to healthcare,it does not confer an individual entitlement on providers.see evergreen,at section a does not create an individual entitlement in favor of any provider.the section benefits recipients by ensuring there is an adequate number of providers in the market place.that section a defines the mandatory minimum provider reimbursement rate by reference to the number of providers in the market place,however,does not make the rate any less mandatory or any less of a minimum.as long as a statute expressly requires providers to be reimbursed at rates that are at least equal to a defined minimum,then the statute creates an individual entitlement on the part of every provider to be reimbursed at that minimum,regardless whether the minimum is defined by reference to providers costs,recipients access,quality of care,market rates,or a fixed sum.
thus,contrary to the fifth circuit conclusion that it can not be said that section a necessarily confers upon each provider an individual right to a particular payment,section a clearly does confer upon each provider an individual right to be paid at rates that are at least equal to the statutory minimum.see wilder,at.there can be little doubt that health care providers are the intended beneficiaries of the boren amendment.the provision establishes a system for reimbursement of providers and is phrased in terms benefitting health care providers it requires a state plan to provide for payment of the hospital services,nursing facility services,and services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded provided under the plan.internal alterations omitted,casey,cir,aff on other grounds,d who else is more aggrieved by the absence of an adequate or reasonable hospital reimbursement rate than a disadvantaged hospital and who has a more compelling interest to press for a correction.
finally,although one can find isolated instances of medicaid recipients suing to enforce section a,see,evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir.med.soc y,reynolds,cir,i do not share the majority optimism that lawsuits brought by medicaid recipients will provide sufficient private enforcement.see op.at if,as the plaintiffs in this case allege,the rates set under the healthchoices program are so low that compliance with the quality of care and access requirements is threatened,we see no reason to believe that recipients in the affected area of the commonwealth will not seek legal redress to ensure that these critical mandates are met.medicaid recipients are,by definition,people facing severe financial hardship,and therefore are unlikely to have the same access to legal services as healthcare providers 
moreover,section a,by its express terms,uses provider reimbursement rates as the means of ensuring recipients quality of care and adequate access,and healthcare providers are more likely than medicaid recipients to possess information about the relationship between current provider reimbursement rates and recipients quality of care and access to care and services.indeed,few if any medicaid recipients will even be aware of current provider reimbursement rates,much less have an idea of how a particular rate compares with provider costs and the reimbursement rates offered by healthcare plans.nor are medicaid recipients likely to have ready access to statistical information on the extent to which healthcare is available to the general public,for purposes of determining whether current reimbursement rates comply with section a adequate access mandate.by contrast,professional associations such as the pharmacists association plaintiff in this case are more likely to possess the market data necessary to determine whether a colorable claim under section a exists.
in sum,because section a is expressly addressed to the financial incentives of healthcare providers to participate in medicaid,healthcare providers are to vindicate recipients and providers shared interest in ensuring that provider reimbursement rates are consistent with quality of care and sufficient to guarantee medicaid recipients access to care and services to the same extent as the general public.these practical considerations further support the result compelled by wilder.
because i believe that the question whether providers may bring actions to enforce section a is squarely controlled by wilder,i would decline to follow evergreen presbyterian ministries,hood,cir,and would join those circuits that,relying on wilder,have permitted providers to bring such claims.see visiting nurse ass of shore,bullen,cir w e conclude that plaintiffs possess standing to enforce section a methodist,sullivan,cir we therefore hold that providers of medical care have a private right of action,derived through,to enforce a.med.soc y,reynolds,cir t he equal access provision of section a may be enforced by medicaid recipients and providers using.i thus respectfully dissent.
to hold as have these other courts would not of course be the end of the case,for the plaintiffs would still have significant hurdles in the next phase.in particular,plaintiffs would have to demonstrate that they have produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the current reimbursement rates are so low that they violate either the quality of care or adequate access mandate contained in section a,a question on which i express no opinion here.since the court has not gone beyond the threshold issue of whether grants providers a right of action to enforce section a,i would reconstitute the original panel so that it may resolve the merits of the department summary judgment motion,which requires determining whether plaintiffs have produced sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that the challenged reimbursement rates violate section a quality of care and adequate access mandates.
i join in chief judge becker thoughtful dissenting opinion and write separately only to offer a permissible reading of the statutory language different from that urged by the majority.the majority terms the language complex and breaks it down.however,i see it as fairly least regarding what we need to properly parsed.if we were to parse the statute at issue in grammarian fashion,we would note that the state plan is the noun,must provide,the verb,and methods and procedures,the object.then comes the descriptive phrase relating to the utilization of,and payment for,care and services available under the plan.the methods and procedures must relate to the use of care and individual the care and services.
what then follows in the by as may be necessary is no more than a further descriptive phrase setting forth the barometer or standard against which the utilization and payment methods and procedures are to be measured.why should only the users be able to challenge a plan that must pass muster not only in terms of the methods and procedures for utilization,but also the methods and procedures for payment 
i think it eminently reasonable to conclude that both and foci,and that both constituencies can speak to whether the statutory requirement as may be necessary to has been fulfilled,and both should have the right to complain that in fact it has not.
also,in response to the majority footnote,i submit that i am not ignoring the second part of the provision,and i do not view the provision as hopelessly vague.rather,i see no need to mention it because it sets forth a standard that is quite susceptible to proof.i have little difficulty imagining the gist of the testimony of recipients,providers,and state administrators as to how the procedures in place impact the sufficiency of payment and quality of service,so that judicial decision making can be exercised.i do,however,continue to have difficulty in understanding why there can not be two intended beneficiaries,especially if the statute is designed to benefit one the providers in order to provide the desired level of services to the other the recipients.
further,i suggest that the fact that the language of boren continues to reference rates is actually quite insignificant.in repealing boren,congress replaced the standard for the rates reasonable and adequate with the requirement that the state provide for a public process for determination of rates.what is significant,however,is the fact that the boren amendment language that had been held to afford a cause of action required that rates be reasonable and adequate,and the language we are quibbling over similarly describes a standard for payments to providers.i see no meaningful distinction between the two and therefore respectfully dissent.

if the requirement could be satisfied simply by showing that a plaintiff in fact benefits from the law in question,the requirement would be superfluous.no plaintiff may assert a claim in federal court without establishing article iii standing,and this demands,among other things,that the plaintiff demonstrate injury in fact.see,lujan defenders of wildlife,d.a plaintiff asserting a claim based on an alleged violation of a federal law can not demonstrate injury in fact unless proper enforcement of the law would benefit the plaintiff.therefore,if the requirement could be met simply by showing that the plaintiff would benefit by proper enforcement,that requirement would add nothing to the test.
in determining whether a statute creates an implied right of action,the supreme court uses the test of cort ash,d,to determine whether congress intended to create a private remedy.under this test,the court considers whether the plaintiff is within the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted,whether there is any indication of legislative intent,explicit or implicit,either to create such a remedy or to deny one,whether a private remedy would be consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme,and whether the cause of action is one traditionally relegated to state law,in an area basically the concern of the states.id.at.citations omitted.a plaintiff need not prove that congress specifically intended that a particular statutory right be enforceable under s but instead need only meet the test outlined above.wilder,at.
namely,hospitals and nursing and intermediate care facilities.see wilder,at.
we use the phrase adequate access simply as shorthand for the statutory requirement that providers be available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area.we do not suggest that adequate access in the lay sense of the term will or will not meet this statutory requirement.
