background 
statutory and regulatory background 
this case involves proper calculation of a hospital compensation or reimbursement under part a of medicare,the federally funded and administered health insurance program for the eligible elderly and disabled established by title xviii of the social security act and codified as amended at supp.the program can make direct payment to providers of inpatient hospital services,a,including psychiatric hospitals.id.c.the statute describes hospitals eligible to participate,including psychiatric hospitals,e f,and permits a distinct part of an institution to qualify as a psychiatric hospital.id.f.the statute also defines,and limits payment to,reasonable costs.v,b.the statutory distinction between a generic hospital general hospital hereinafter and a psychiatric or other special purpose hospital is material to the controversy before us because congress has chosen different means to attempt to limit the rise in reasonable costs allowed for general hospitals than for specialty hospitals.
congress enacted a limitation on the extent to which medicare part a hospital insurance could recognize an increase in a hospital otherwise reasonable costs in the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of,a codified at b supp tefra.this approach allowed a percentage increase in reasonable costs each year.the percentage was specified in the statute the base of costs to which the percentage applied,or target amount,was a figure equal,for the hospital first cost year under the statute,to its actual operating costs in the preceding cost year.each year thereafter,the target amount for that hospital increased from its base year target amount by the percentage specified in the statute,even if the hospital actual cost experience differed.the target amount used in the statutory formula for a particular hospital for a particular subsequent year,in effect,was simply the product of that hospital base year costs and the cumulative statutory percentages.the next year,congress partially replaced the tefra limitation with a prospective payment system pps applicable to general hospitals but not to psychiatric hospitals,distinct part psychiatric units,and other specialty hospitals and distinct part units.see d a b.
congress directed the secretary to provide exemption from the tefra limit for events beyond a hospital control,and authorized such other relief from the tefra limit as the secretary deemed appropriate.b a.pursuant to that discretionary authority,the secretary promulgated the predecessor to in and subsequently amended relevant portions of those regulations.the present controversy relates to these regulations and amendments as in effect for.
the secretary regulations provided a short term exemption for a new hospital,which the regulations defined at the pertinent time as 
a provider of inpatient hospital services that has operated as the type of hospital for which hcfa granted it approval to participate in the medicare program for less than three full years.
f i.hcfa stands for health care financing administration,an agency under the secretary.in the context of this opinion,distinctions between the secretary and hcfa are immaterial and not observed.the regulation tethered this paragraph f exemption period to admission of the hospital first patient.id.paragraph b of the same regulation provided that the base year of a hospital or a distinct unit continued in effect unless the hospital qualifies as a new hospital.b rebase provision.
in,the secretary amended these paragraph f exemption and paragraph b rebase provisions.changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems.the paragraph f new hospital exemption provision was changed by shortening the period and,more relevant to this controversy,by adding a second,has provided criterion to the existing has operated criterion 
for purposes of this section,a new hospital is a provider of hospital inpatient services that 
a has operated as the type of hospital for which hcfa granted it approval to participate in the medicare program,under present or previous ownership or both,for less than full years and 
b has provided the type of hospital inpatient services for which hcfa granted it approval to participate in the medicare program,for less than years.
f.the amendment also added the following sentence to the existing rebase provision 
when the operational structure of a hospital or distinct unit changes that is,a freestanding hospital becomes a distinct part unit or vice versa the base period would be the first full cost reporting period effective with the revised medicare certification classification.
b.with subsequent minor changes in wording and format not material to this dispute,these provisions persist to the present.see.
factual background 
plaintiff michigan city,formerly known as kingwood hospital,of michigan city,indiana kingwood hereinafter,was an existing hospital that began participating in medicare in as a general,acute care hospital of beds.by,kingwood converted of its beds to psychiatric use and medicare certified kingwood as a general hospital subject to pps payment regulation with a distinct part psychiatric unit subject to tefra limit payment regulation.by september,kingwood had expanded its psychiatric unit to of its beds.by may,kingwood psychiatric unit engulfed the remainder of its beds.medicare recognized kingwood as a psychiatric hospital effective june.
accordingly,when the secretary applied kingwood tefra limit to its cost year to deny kingwood full recovery of its costs,kingwood applied timely for recognition of exempt new hospital status under paragraph f of,or at least a change in its tefra limit base year from to under b.the provider reimbursement review board rejected both requests.see a hearing decision,kingwood hospital,provider reimbursement bd,reprinted in medicare medicaid guide cch board decision hereafter.as the secretary declined to review the matter further,kingwood recourse was to the courts.f.
kingwood filed a civil action in the district court seeking recognition of exempt new hospital status or alternatively a new base year.both kingwood and the secretary moved for summary judgment.the district court denied kingwood motion,granted the secretary,and dismissed kingwood complaint.order,michigan city,shalala.the district court held that the secretary interpretations of the applicable regulations were reasonable and her decisions supported by substantial evidence.
ii.analysis 
plaintiff appeal presents the same alternative issues as were before the secretary and the district court first,whether kingwood was entitled to a new tefra base cost reporting period beginning june,under b as in effect june,taking into account any retroactive amendments thereto,if any,and evidence of the secretary interpretation thereof.alternatively,whether kingwood was entitled to a exemption as of june,under f as in effect june.
the standards for our review are well known.we review the district court application of law de novo.as did the district court,we review the secretary interpretation and application of her regulations for reasonableness and the secretary findings for substantial support in the record.see,allentown mack sales service,nlrb,d.
new base period 
kingwood argues that it is entitled to a more or less automatic change of its base period,under authority of b,from calendar year to the fiscal year june,through may,by reason of operational changes that led to its june,change in medicare certification from a general hospital subject to pps with a psychiatric unit subject to tefra to an exclusively psychiatric,hospital.according to kingwood,granting such a change of base year following such a change in operations and certification was the policy of the secretary,as evidenced,first,by the secretary amendment to clarify paragraph b,see,june,by adding the language quoted in part,supra,and second,by the secretary slightly earlier may letter decision allegedly granting just such a new base year to dallas rehabilitation institute dri.
the review board rejected kingwood argument.the review board began by searching the regulations for language that supported an automatic change in base year,but it found none in effect for a cost year beginning when kingwood did.that decision evidences a reasonable interpretation by the board,because the language of paragraph b as it existed in,prior to the and later revisions,appears to refer only to change of base year in paragraph f new hospital circumstances.kingwood,of course,seeks that paragraph f exemption as well,but asserts in this argument that it has a right to paragraph b relief as of independently of whether it obtains paragraph f relief.nor does kingwood appear fundamentally to disagree with the review board conclusion on this particular point,as kingwood counsel conceded at oral argument that kingwood did not rely on the plain language of the text.
the review board did note,further,that the secretary had added a provision relating to changing base years in paragraph j,j now paragraph i,but that provision became effective too late to benefit kingwood,a point kingwood concedes.the review board noted,finally,kingwood argument that the amendment to paragraph b was intended to clarify the existing paragraph b.the preamble language upon which kingwood relies states 
therefore,to preclude hospitals from qualifying for a new hospital exemption based solely on such operational reorganizations,we are proposing to revise f to specify that a hospital will qualify as a new hospital only if it has not previously provided the type of hospital inpatient services for which hcfa granted it approval to participate in the medicare program.
however,we also recognize that it would not be appropriate to subject these types of hospitals or units to the tefra limit that applied before the hospital reorganization.therefore,when the operational structure of hospital or distinct unit changes that is,a freestanding rehabilitation hospital becomes a distinct part or vice versa,we are proposing to revise b to clarify that the base period would be the first full period effective with the revised medicare certification.
at emphasis supplied by kingwood.kingwood argues that the secretary styling of the new language as clarification must mean that the effect of the amended regulation is the same as the prior language,and that therefore,the language,applicable to kingwood,must reach the same result as would prevail after the amendment.the review board rejected that retroactivity argument on the grounds that the same preamble expressly provided that the regulations proposed had an effective date of october.accordingly,the review board dismissed kingwood view that the single use of the word clarify in the regulation preamble mandated retroactive application of that portion of the regulation,notwithstanding the effective date clause.this final conclusion is not unreasonable,particularly as the usage cited by kingwood is in the context of an integrated discussion of the reasons for the third proposed change to the new hospital exemption regulations,which kingwood expressly argues is not retroactive.see generally.at.finally,the review board observed that kingwood was not entirely without relief under the regulations because the version of paragraph h,h codified as revised at g,provided a mechanism for adjustment to cost period data,including data in the base year itself,and that in fact kingwood had received some relief under that provision.yet again the review board interpretation of the regulations is reasonable.
unfortunately,the review board does not directly address the dri letter decision in this analysis.the review board did discuss that letter as the last item in the immediately preceding section of its opinion,but only in discussing the paragraph f exemption.the dri letter decision in question is a response to an equally short inquiry by dri financial intermediary as to whether dri might be eligible for a new base period because of its june,change in certification from an exclusively rehabilitation specialty hospital to a general hospital with a distinct part rehabilitation unit.a rehabilitation hospital or unit is subject to tefra limits,but a general hospital is subject to the pps regime.the director of the office of payment policy,a of hcfa,replied that it would not be appropriate to continue use of the tefra base period formerly established for the rehabilitation hospital for the rehabilitation unit because of an unspecified change in methodology in determining medicare share of the costs of the different levels of patient care services,and authorized a base period of june,to may.letter from charles booth,director,office of payment policy,health care financing administration to gene brock,senior audit reimbursement representative,medicare administration,aetna life insurance may,administrative record at.the short letter says little else.
as noted above,the review board did not deal with this letter at all in the portion of its opinion discussing this paragraph b issue.the board entire treatment of the dri letter in the last two sentences of the preceding section,dismissing kingwood request for a paragraph f new hospital exemption,is curt and cryptic.the board disregards the letter because the facts in the texas case can be distinguished from the facts in the current issue.board decision at.at oral argument,neither counsel for kingwood or for the secretary was able to provide content for this statement with support in the record,and we have found none in the record.
however,although it is incumbent on an agency to explain itself,it is also incumbent on an appellant complaining of inconsistency and capriciousness in the agency explanation of its treatment to bring before the reviewing court sufficient particulars of how the appellant was situated,how the allegedly favored party was situated,and how such similarities as may exist dictate similar treatment and how such dissimilarities as may exist are irrelevant or outweighed.kingwood on the sparse record before us has failed to establish convincing inconsistencies between the secretary treatment of kingwood and other facilities.lomak petroleum,federal energy regulatory commission.the dri letter does not come close to filling this gap.the burden of proof lays the consequences on kingwood.see id.in these circumstances,the treatment of the dri letter is not a fatal flaw in the review board otherwise adequate rejection of kingwood arguments on this issue.
new hospital exemption 
we now turn to kingwood alternative argument,that,if not entitled to a new base period,it must certainly be entitled to a exemption.as noted earlier,a new hospital is one that has operated as the type of hospital for which hcfa granted it approval to participate in the medicare program for less than three full years.f i.kingwood argues that,by this language,the secretary adopted a bright line test based on the date of hcfa approval.in kingwood view,the regulation is clear that an institution can not have operated as a psychiatric hospital until medicare had recognized it as such.kingwood supports this position by drawing to our attention the additional operational standards for records and staff that medicare requires for its recognition,not just as a hospital,but as a psychiatric hospital.f.kingwood also relies upon the preamble to the original exemption from in which the secretary offered as a reason for the exemption that new hospitals commonly have unusually high operating costs per case in the first year of operation.at.kingwood argues that an institution like itself which changes its nature i
