the merits of this appeal present a novel issue of first impression under title ii,of the social security act act and its applicable regulations,and the merits of the federal law issue presented in this case are juxtaposed against the backdrop of a state statute,florida workers compensation law.stat.ch.
the commissioner of social security commissioner appeals from an handwritten order of the district court.by this squib notation,written in the margin of the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,the district court rejected the,finding that the court had subject matter jurisdiction and that the plaintiff corporations could intervene as proper parties to an individual claimant social security disability hearing for the following reasons,we reverse the decision of the district court.
factual background 
the underlying facts are not in issue and are pertinent only to set the stage for this appeal.in,deborah scott,while employed by fleetwood homes of florida fleetwood as an assistant foreman,was injured on the job in,scott filed an application for federal social security disability insurance benefits and an application for supplemental security income she also filed a state claim in florida for workers compensation seeking permanent total disability ptd benefits.
ii.procedural background 
the underlying procedural background of this appeal is germane.in,fleetwood,and crawford company,crawford,described as fleetwood workers compensation insurance carrier,filed a motion to intervene in scott social security disability case,pending before an administrative law judge alj.they contended that their rights would be adversely affected by the decision of the alj making them proper parties to the hearing under b they argued that scott might,without their presence in the federal forum,receive a finding of catastrophic injury from the alj.this ruling could in turn be relied upon by the florida judge of compensation claims jcc to support an award of ptd benefits in the state forum,payable by responsible parties fleetwood and crawford to scott,perhaps for the rest of her life 
using a rationale supported by,the alj found that fleetwood and crawford were not proper parties to scott hearing,and denied their motion to intervene he reasoned that,under florida law,it was not mandatory,only discretionary,for a jcc to consider a decision by an alj.therefore the outcome of scott federal case was not legally binding,nor necessarily even considered,in her state case.the alj concluded that fleetwood and crawford would have an opportunity to protect their interest in scott state case this was their sole remedy.
fleetwood and crawford then filed its first petition in district court challenging the alj ruling.the magistrate judge dismissed their petition for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that there was no final decision to review upon motion for reconsideration,the magistrate judge reconfirmed its original disposition,granting fleetwood and crawford leave to seek review by the appeals council of the social security administration ssa in order to exhaust their administrative remedies and to obtain a final decision of the commissioner.
so fleetwood and crawford filed a petition for review with the appeals council.finding that fleetwood and crawford had not claimed any benefits or other rights provided under title ii or xvi of the act and ha d not established that such rights would be adversely affected,the appeals council dismissed their request for review because they were not a proper party under the regulations.see 
now armed with a final decision,fleetwood and crawford returned to district court with a second petition for review pursuant to g the commissioner filed a motion to dismiss the petition for lack of standing and lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the magistrate judge recommended that the motion be granted on the basis that g did not confer jurisdiction upon the court.
citing b,he stated 
petitioners are corporations,not individuals.congress has taken great care to specifically name each individual who may seek an administrative determination of entitlement to disability benefits because congress limited benefit determinations to individuals congress had no need to allow anyone other than an individual to seek judicial review of the commissioner final decision it did not allow corporations to seek judicial review from the commissioner decision that fleetwood and crawford are not proper parties to a hearing because congress envisioned only listed individuals as requesting,or intervening in,hearings.
in a footnote,the magistrate judge noted that,from examining the record,there was no indication that the florida jcc would be bound to follow the determination of the commissioner,nor that the florida jcc would not allow fleetwood and crawford an opportunity to present their evidence in the state workers compensation proceeding.
the district court rejected the by this handwritten notation the recommendation is rejected.the court finds that plaintiffs are proper parties and therefore have subject matter jurisdiction.in response to the commissioner motion to clarify,the district court again made a handwritten notation across the top of the motion granted.the court decision was based on the memo in opposition to the magistrate filed by fleetwood and crawford and treated as a motion for rehearing.six weeks later,the alj determined that scott was entitled to social security disability benefits.the district court fleetwood and crawford motion for final judgment,with the notation across the top final judgment.petitioners are proper parties.the commissioner filed this appeal.
iii.issues on appeal 
three issues are presented on appeal 
whether the final judgment of the district court finding that fleetwood and crawford are proper parties to scott social security disability hearing is immediately appealable 
b.if the order is immediately appealable and this court has jurisdiction,whether this appeal is moot,as scott state workers compensation proceeding is now final 
c.if this appeal is not moot,whether fleetwood and crawford are proper parties under the act and applicable regulations to scott social security disability hearing before the alj 
iv.standard of review 
the decisions by the district court that subject matter jurisdiction was present,g,to review the final decision of the commissioner that fleetwood and crawford were not proper parties to scott social security disability hearing,b,raise pure questions of law that we review de novo.federal reserve bank of atlanta thomas,cir.
discussion 
jurisdiction 
we raised the issue of jurisdiction sua sponte.the parties responded in supplemental briefings.
the jurisdiction of this court in social security proceedings is limited to final orders of the district courts.a final order is one that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute its judgment.huie bowen,cir citations omitted.generally,an order of a district court remanding a case to the commissioner is not an appealable order id.however the supreme court has held a judgment of the district court that reverses the decision of the commissioner and orders a remand to the ssa is final and appealable under when entered under the fourth sentence of g forney apfel,d.
the commissioner argues that jurisdiction is present under the fourth sentence of g.fleetwood and crawford argue it is not,although both sides appear to agree that this is an jurisdictional issue of first impression we need not address whether jurisdiction is present under g,as we conclude,after reviewing the briefs of the parties,that the precedential authority of this circuit establishes that the judgment of the district court,even if not final per se,is reviewable under the collateral order doctrine of cohen beneficial indus.loan.huie,at.t he cohen doctrine allows appeals to be taken from orders that finally determine claims entirely collateral to and separable from the substance of other claims in the action,require review because they present significant,unsettled questions,and can not be reviewed effectively once the case is finally decided.id.
this appeal satisfies all three prongs of cohen.first,the issue of whether corporations not claiming benefits may participate in an individual claimant disability hearing is a structural matter unrelated to the merits of the individual disability claim.id.second,the issue is important as the broad mandate of the district court would create a fundamental change in the social security disability hearing and would be unprecedented in nature.id.third,the issue would be otherwise unreviewable id.we therefore find jurisdiction present under the cohen collateral order doctrine.
we now turn to the issue of mootness.again sua sponte,during oral argument the court inquired as to whether or not this appeal was now moot,as scott workers compensation claim had concluded.the parties also addressed the issue in supplemental briefings.
as we know,scott filed a claim under florida workers compensation law seeking ptd benefits.the jcc in the state proceeding awarded ptd benefits to scott.fleetwood and crawford appealed the decision of the jcc to the florida first district court of appeal.on june,the first district court of appeal affirmed the order of the jcc per curiam without opinion.crawford scott,so d dca.
the decision by the florida district court does not moot the merits of this appeal as florida law provides for modification of a jcc order.under.stat,at any time prior to two years after the date of the last payment of compensation made pursuant to the compensation order a party seeks to modify,on the ground of a change in condition or because of a mistake in a determination of fact,a jcc may review a compensation case and issue a new compensation order which may terminate,continue,reinstate,increase or decrease the award also,scott social security disability case is still in active status,as the alj recommended that she be reevaluated in one year although this time has now passed and referred for vocational rehabilitation services.and.hence the claim of fleetwood and crawford is not moot and the issue of intervention continues.
c.the merits of the appeal 
we now turn to the underlying merits of the case.the net effect of the district court order will be to require scott case to be reopened by the alj,in order to conduct a second hearing.the commissioner contends that this rehearing will be adversarial in nature,with fleetwood and crawford as opposing parties to scott.fleetwood and crawford argue that although their rights are adversely affected by scott social security disability hearing,their intervention would not render the hearing adversarial.on the contrary,they claim it would develop and supplement the record in order to promote fair and objective evaluation of claims,and efficient determination of eligibility for benefits 
social security disability proceedings are inquisitorial rather than adversarial.see sims apfel,d citing richardson perales,d.the ssa is perhaps the best example of an agency that is not based to a significant extent on the judicial model of decisionmaking.it has replaced normal adversary procedure with an investigatory model,where it is the duty of the alj to investigate the facts and develop the arguments both for and against granting benefits review by the appeals council is similarly broad.id the regulations also make the nature of the ssa proceedings quite clear.they expressly provide that the ssa conducts the administrative review process in an informal,nonadversary manner.b.the commissioner has no representative before the alj to oppose the claim for benefits neither is there is any indication that he opposes claimants before the appeals council.sims.at citing dubin,torquemada meets kafka the misapplication of the issue exhaustion doctrine to inquisitorial administrative proceedings.
next,the commissioner contends that the statute and regulations should be construed to limit participation to individuals and not corporate entities and that his reasonable interpretation is entitled to deference.see thomas jefferson shalala,d.as the regulations speak in terms you and other parties in referring to individual human beings,the term any other person should be similarly construed.this conclusion is buttressed by the use of the terms his and her.see city of delray beach,agricultural ins,cir applying the doctrine of statutory construction ejusem generis.
fleetwood and crawford assert that the commissioner statutory interpretation of the word individual to mean only human beings and not businesses is incorrect.they claim they have a right to be a party in scott hearing because they are any other person who shows that his or her rights may be adversely affected by the hearing,are parties to the hearing.b emphasis added 
under the act,the statutory provisions governing hearings in disability cases contemplate participation by only individuals with a stake in obtaining benefits the statute speaks in terms of individuals applying for a payment,his or her rights,such individual or upon request by a wife,divorced wife,widow section b.the applicable regulations governing who may request a disability hearing are a and a the applicable regulations governing who are parties to a disability hearing are b and b as corporate entities,it is clear that fleetwood and crawford are not the individuals or specified persons enumerated by the act or regulations with a potential stake in the award of social security benefits to a particular claimant.as a result,under the law,they are not proper parties to scott federal hearing.id.
fleetwood and crawford suggest,that in,when the florida legislature changed the standard for awarding ptd benefits to include any catastrophic injury that would otherwise qualify of a nature and severity that would qualify an employee to receive disability income benefits under title ii.stats.f,employers and insurance carriers alike recognized the importance of the claimant award or denial of social security benefits by an alj.it was then,fleetwood and crawford contend,that employers and carriers began filing motions to intervene with aljs 
the jcc in this case held that she had considered whether the claimant has sustained a catastrophic injury which would entitle her to receive disability income benefits under title ii or supplemental security income benefits under title xvi social security act she found that the claimant injuries are of such a nature and severity that they would qualify this claimant to receive disability income benefits under either title.in her opinion,the jcc makes no reference to the prior decision of the alj to award benefits.it appears clear from the record that the jcc applied social security standards yet made her own independent findings.this is in accordance with florida case law most recently,in florida distillers rudd,so d dca,the court stated 
nevertheless,despite the statutory intent to render ptd status comparable to disability under the social security act,we have been cited to no requirement in chapter that a jcc is bound by the grant or denial of a claim for social security disability benefits.the legislature could have easily included such a requirement when chapter was substantially amended as a result of chapter,laws of florida,but it did not do so.furthermore,given the fact that the evidence may vary between a workers compensation proceeding and a proceeding on a claim for social security disability benefits through no fault of the claimant,it would be unjust to view federal disability determinations as carrying binding precedential authority in a proceeding under chapter,florida statutes.
evaluating credibility of witnesses,conflicts of evidence,weight to be given testimony,physical evidence,and expertise,all to determine where the preponderance lies is no small task.those charged with doing so ought not be tempted to abdicate the responsibility to the conclusions of another.traditionally the temptation has been disallowed.on a retrial,the jury is not told the verdict of the first jury an investigator,appearing as a trial witness,is rarely permitted to testify that he or she believes one side or another has the better case.see,john strong et,mccormick on evidence at ed opinions on the u
