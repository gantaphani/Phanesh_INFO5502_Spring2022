in recent years society has begun to recognize smoking as an important issue.the historic agreement between most of the states and the major tobacco companies was a milestone in the ongoing attempt to address this issue.as part of a broad settlement of the states claims,the tobacco companies agreed to pay over time hundreds of billions of dollars to the states.in view of the enormous amount of money at stake,it is perhaps not surprising that there has been considerable controversy about the status of the settlement funds.
in this case,a recipient of medicaid benefits for illnesses seeks a share of the settlement funds.he argues that when he applied for medicaid benefits from colorado,he assigned to the state his right to sue the tobacco companies for the injuries he has suffered from their products.he asserts that the state comprehensive settlement covered his individual claims,and that under federal medicaid law,after the state has reimbursed itself for the benefits it has paid out it must then turn over the excess funds attributed to the medicaid settlement to the individuals whose claims were settled.
contrary to a number of district courts that have considered similar cases,we hold that this suit is not barred by the eleventh amendment.it seeks prospective relief for an alleged ongoing violation of federal law,and the requested relief does not implicate special sovereignty interests.on the merits,however,we find the suit foreclosed by a recent federal law amending the medicaid statute.we hold that this law,passed in response to similar controversy over the federal government right to control part of the tobacco settlement funds,releases the state from having to reimburse individual medicaid recipients.we therefore affirm the district court dismissal of the complaint in this case.
background 
medicaid is a cooperative program that provides medical services to those without resources to pay for them.see generally.the federal government provides funding to a state medicaid program if it meets various statutory and regulatory requirements.at issue in this case is the requirement that the state condition eligibility for medicaid benefits on recipients assigning to the state any claims they have to support and to payment for medical care from any third party.a a.the state program must also provide that when a third party is found to be legally liable for the costs of a recipient medical care,the state will seek reimbursement to the extent of such legal liability,so long as the amount the state can reasonably expect to recover exceeds the costs of recovery.b.part of any money the state collects under this assignment 
shall be retained by the state as is necessary to reimburse it for medical assistance payments made on behalf of an individual with respect to whom such assignment was executed with appropriate reimbursement of the federal government to the extent of its participation in the financing of such medical assistance,and the remainder of such amount collected shall be paid to such individual.
b emphasis added.colorado administers a medicaid program and requires that an applicant assign to the state all rights the applicant may have to medical support or payments for medical expenses from any other person.
in,colorado sued several major tobacco companies in colorado state court for a number of violations of state law related to the manufacturing and marketing of tobacco products such as cigarettes,including false representations,restraint of trade,and racketeering.although the complaint did not set forth a separate cause of action under medicaid law,it requested among other relief damages including treble damages in the amount of increased health care costs paid by the state,including increased medicaid payments.
in,colorado and most other states settled their lawsuits with the tobacco companies in what is called the master settlement agreement.it released the companies from past,present,and future claims by colorado,including all claims.the settlement required the tobacco companies to comply with various conditions,such as limitations on advertising.it also required the companies to make regular payments into an escrow fund,the amounts of which are subject to adjustment as market conditions change.once the settlement agreement was finalized through a consent decree,colorado became entitled to a share about of these funds.the complaint estimates colorado share over the next years at about billion.
wilfred harris is a recipient of colorado medicaid program who has been treated for illnesses he filed this action under,alleging that he assigned his right to sue the tobacco companies to colorado colorado settled his individual claims against the tobacco companies in its broad release in the master settlement agreement part of the settlement funds therefore are subject to the distribution requirements of b and consequently he is entitled to some portion of the funds once the state reimburses itself for its medicaid expenses the complaint asked for declaratory and injunctive relief against governor bill owens and jim rizzuto,executive director of the colorado department of health care policy and financing.in particular,harris sought to enjoin defendants from depositing the settlement funds into the state treasury until entitlement to the funds was resolved.
defendants moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction due to eleventh amendment sovereign immunity and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.a magistrate judge recommended dismissing on both grounds.over harris objection,the district court dismissed the case on both grounds.
similar cases have been filed in at least other states.twelve of these states have joined an amicus brief filed in this case.virtually every court,state or federal,that has considered one of these cases has dismissed it either because of sovereign immunity or because the master settlement agreement was not a medicaid settlement subject to b,watson texas,cir merits floyd thompson,cir merits cardenas anzai,d eleventh amendment strawser lawton,d merits skillings illinois,d merits martin new mexico,eleventh amendment barton summers,d eleventh amendment state superior court,th,d merits.the sole exception of which we are aware is lewis state,no.iowa.july,an unreported decision denying iowa motion to dismiss with little discussion.

order of issues 
we first address the threshold question whether we must decide the eleventh amendment issue before we reach the merits of this case.in similar cases in other states,two federal courts have bypassed the eleventh amendment and dismissed on the merits.see floyd thompson,cir strawser lawton,d.although we agree with the seventh circuit that the merits of this case are more easily resolved than is the eleventh amendment issue,see floyd,at,we are compelled by our precedent to decide the eleventh amendment issue first.see martin kansas,cir because the state assertion of eleventh amendment immunity challenges the subject matter jurisdiction of the district court,the issue must be resolved before a court may address the merits of martin underlying ada claim,overruled on other grounds by bd.of trustees of the of garrett,d.once effectively raised,the eleventh amendment becomes a limitation on our jurisdiction,and we may not then assume hypothetical jurisdiction to reject a plaintiff claim on the merits.fent.water res,cir holding that a proper eleventh amendment challenge strips the courts of jurisdiction for the purposes of the removal statute,c.
some statutory questions are both logically antecedent to and similar in scope to the eleventh amendment inquiry.in those circumstances,it is appropriate for us to address the statutory question first.for example,the supreme court has held that we can address whether a statute permits a suit against the state before deciding the eleventh amendment question.agency of natural res.united states,d.defendants do not dispute that they can be sued under 
unlike the question whether a statute authorizes a suit against a state,the question whether the suit states a claim upon which relief can be granted is neither logically antecedent to nor coincident in scope with the eleventh amendment inquiry.agency,at.distinguishing between whether the statute authorizes a suit against the state and the broader questions whether it authorizes a private cause of action at all or whether the complaint states a claim.though it is generally our practice to avoid difficult constitutional questions when a case can be resolved on simpler statutory grounds,we decline to follow the seventh circuit floyd thompson.
in strawser,the district court partly circumvented the eleventh amendment analysis in a somewhat different manner.the court concluded that because the plaintiffs claim failed on the merits,there was no ongoing violation of federal law,and so the ex parte young exception to sovereign immunity was inapplicable.id.at.we have held,however,that at this stage,the question is not whether the state officials actually violated federal law rather,it is whether the plaintiffs have stated a,substantial claim for relief under federal law.elephant butte irrigation dist.dep t of interior,cir.this is congruent with our practice under,the statute conferring jurisdiction if the federal claim is not wholly frivolous,it suffices to establish federal jurisdiction even if it ultimately is rejected on the merits.martinez united states olympic,cir.harris has alleged a violation of b,which states that the state shall reimburse itself and the federal government for medicaid expenses and pay the remainder to the medicaid recipient.while we ultimately reject harris claim on the merits,it should not be characterized as frivolous.brown state,upholding the dismissal of a similar lawsuit but reversing the district court award of sanctions against the plaintiffs attorneys,cert.denied,brown minnesota,d.indeed,the congressional record reports that three states florida,louisiana,and massachusetts treated their settlement with the liggett corporation,a tobacco company,as medicaid settlements and reimbursed the federal government for its share of costs.cong.rec.daily ed,statement of specter.if this settlement was treated as including medicaid settlements under b,it is not unreasonable for harris to argue that the master settlement agreement is also subject to b.we therefore decline to follow strawser.
sovereign immunity 
the eleventh amendment states,the judicial power of the united states shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,commenced or prosecuted against one of the united states by citizens of another state,or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state.because the amendment stands not so much for what it says,but for the presupposition which it confirms,it has been interpreted much more broadly than its text would suggest.anr pipeline,at quotation marks and alterations omitted.among other things,it generally bars suits brought by individuals against state officials acting in their official capacities.elephant butte,at.this bar does not apply,however,if the state waives its sovereign immunity,if congress validly abrogates the state immunity,or if the suit falls within the legal fiction of ex parte young.anr pipeline,at.harris argues only that this case falls within the ex parte young doctrine.a suit within the ex parte young doctrine is not considered a suit against the state rather,it is a suit against individual state officers who are stripped of their official character.elephant butte,at.
for the purposes of this case,the relevant features of the ex parte young doctrine can be summarized as follows the eleventh amendment does not bar a suit against state officials in their official capacities if it seeks prospective relief for the officials ongoing violation of federal law.see generally elephant butte,at anr pipeline,at.even if these requirements are met,the suit will be barred either if the relief requested implicates special sovereignty interests and is the functional equivalent of relief that would otherwise be barred or in cases involving only statutory rights,if congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for enforcing the right against a state.anr pipeline,at.defendants do not contend that congress has created a detailed remedial scheme to supplant ex parte young in this case,so we consider only whether this suit seeks prospective relief for an ongoing violation of federal law and whether the requested relief implicates special sovereignty interests and would otherwise be barred.
defendants authority 
defendants argue that they lack authority under colorado law to pay any portion of the settlement funds to harris.in particular,citing sections and of article v of the colorado constitution,they argue that state funds can be disbursed from the treasury only through an appropriations bill passed by the state legislature.if they lack authority to provide the relief harris seeks,they argue,they are not acting in violation of federal law and can not be enjoined under ex parte young.
this contention is irrelevant in this case.defendants misconstrue the nature of the relief harris seeks.harris seeks a declaratory judgment that once the state reimburses itself for its medicaid expenses,he is entitled to a portion of the tobacco settlement funds that are to be paid to the state,and an injunction preventing the state from depositing these funds into the state treasury until the court determines what amount is due to the smokers.the money harris seeks has not yet been paid into the state treasury.since the state can not authorize the officials to violate federal law,elephant butte,at,if some of the money truly belongs to harris under federal law,the officials may not turn it over to the state treasury.
in addition,we are satisfied that the named officials have the authority to comply with federal law here.defendant owens wields the supreme executive power of the state and is charged with tak ing care that the laws be faithfully executed.const.art.iv.defendant rizzuto is charged with administering colorado medicaid law,the colorado medical assistance act.see.c.as such,he appears to be empowered to take actions necessary to comply with federal medicaid requirements.see.defendants can be enjoined to prevent the state from appropriating funds that belong to harris or other medicaid recipients.
prospective relief 
as noted above,harris seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.this suit is not prospective merely because the requested relief is framed in equitable terms rather than as a request for damages.see anr pipeline,at citing edelman jordan,d.nor is it dispositive that the requested relief is likely to burden the state treasury to some degree.elephant butte,at.the overriding question is not whether the relief will require the payment of state funds,but whether the relief will remedy future rather than past wrongs.id.quotation marks omitted nelson miller,cir whether a suit against state officials in their official capacity is deemed to be against the state depends on whether the plaintiff seeks retroactive or prospective relief.although the eleventh amendment bars compensatory relief for past injuries,relief that serves directly to bring about an end to a present violation of federal law is not barred by the eleventh amendment even though accompanied by a substantial ancillary effect on the state treasury.papasan allain,d.
applying these principles,we conclude that at least part of harris suit is not barred by the eleventh amendment most of the tobacco settlement funds due to colorado have not yet been paid.harris asserts that some of these funds belong to him under b and seeks to prevent the state from depositing his portion into the state treasury.the alleged violation of federal law here is the appropriation that has yet to take place.thus,with respect to these funds,harris is seeking prospective relief from an ongoing violation.as such,his claim appears to fall within the ambit of ex parte young.
we disagree with those district courts that have found it wholly irrelevant that payments under the master settlement agreement will be made in fixed future installments rather than a lump sum.floyd thompson,d,aff on other grounds,cir accord martin new mexico,barton summers,d,strawser lawton,d,plaintiffs proposed result would permit,by analogy,any seeker of state funds to look for accounts receivable of the state and then attempt to garnish them before their purely ministerial transmission to the treasury.from a purely economic perspective,it may be irrelevant that the settlement funds are to be paid over time rather than all at once the future amount can be reduced to a present value.for the purposes of the eleventh amendment,however,the difference is highly relevant.in elephant butte,we held that the eleventh amendment did not bar a suit seeking an injunction reforming a contract to prevent the state from taking the profits of a lease b ecause the lease agreement allegedly conflicted with federal law at its inception,the state officials acts of signing the lease and subsequently accepting benefits under the assignment provision may constitute an ongoing violation of federal law.at.similarly,in johns stewart,cir,we held that the plaintiffs could not seek retroactive monetary reimbursement for federal supplemental security income benefits that had been withheld by the state,but could seek prospective injunctive relief against future withholdings.
as in elephant butte and johns,in this case the state officials acceptance of the settlement funds solely for the state may constitute an ongoing violation of federal law.with respect to funds that have not been received,the officials have not yet violated federal law.the alleged harm to harris is entirely in the future.the relief he seeks is therefore prospective in character and addressed to an ongoing violation of federal law 
defendants seek to analogize this case to papasan allain,d,but the foregoing discussion shows why that case is readily distinguishable.in papasan,the supreme court held that the eleventh amendment barred a suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for breach of trust against state officials whose alleged mismanagement of school trust lands in the had led to significantly lower funding for certain school districts.id.at.at the same time,however,the court held that the eleventh amendment did not bar an equal protection claim challenging the disparity in school funding,because this claim sought relief from an alleged ongoing constitutional violation.id.at.the claims barred in papasan concerned alleged violations of federal law that were wholly in the past for these,the courts could not provide relief even if styled as prospective.in this case,as explained above,the alleged violation of federal law is ongoing.harris requested relief would serve directly to bring an end to a present violation of federal law any effect it would have on colorado state treasury would be purely ancillary to the state compliance with federal law.id.at.
in sum,harris seeks prospective relief for an alleged ongoing violation of federal law.while this suit,if successful,might deprive the state of future funds,that effect would be ancillary to compliance with federal law,not compensatory for past injuries.
special sovereignty interests 
the courts may not award relief against the state that implicates special sovereignty interests and is the functional equivalent of relief that would otherwise be barred by the eleventh amendment.anr pipeline,at.for example,the eleventh amendment bars a suit against a state that would divest it of sovereign control over some submerged lands because historically,these lands are tied in a unique way to sovereignty.idaho coeur tribe,d.it also bars a suit seeking an injunction against a state system because it is impossible to imagine that a state government could continue to exist without the power to tax.anr pipeline,at.on the other hand,the eleventh amendment does not extend to every situation where a state property interest is at issue coeur represents an extreme and unusual case.elephant butte,at coeur,at.referring to the particular and special circumstances of the case.
defendants and amici argue that the relief harris seeks implicates four special sovereignty interests the state interest in mak ing determinations about the nature and extent of its various educational and social services programs its revenue regardless of its source its appropriation prerogatives and its authority to fashion an appropriate remedy in law enforcement actions.none of these qualifies as a special sovereignty interest in this case.
the first two asserted interests can be dismissed straightforwardly on the basis of our precedent.first,the state has no special sovereign interest in ordinary aspects of its social programs,because most government policies do not affect core aspects of a state sovereignty.buchwald of sch.of,cir branson sch.dist.romer,cir holding that the state has no special sovereign interest in managing lands held in trust.more to the point,a state interest in administering a welfare program at least partially funded by the federal government is not such a core sovereign interest as to preclude the application of ex parte young.valdez,cir.second,the state has no special sovereign interest in future sources of revenue.see elephant butte,at.
the third and fourth asserted interests may be more plausible in the abstract,but neither is sufficiently implicated by harris lawsuit to merit extensive discussion.whatever the state interest in its appropriations prerogatives,the relief harris requests will not impermissibly intrude upon the state dignity and status as a sovereign government.elephant butte,at quotation marks omitted.contrary to defendants apparent belief,harris is not asking the legislature to pass an appropriations bill giving him money from the state treasury.rather,he seeks to prevent defendants from turning the tobacco settlement funds over to the treasury before he and the other smokers receive their portion.the state interest with respect to these future funds is not related to appropriations but to revenue sources,an interest we have rejected as sufficiently special to serve as an exception to ex parte young.see elephant butte,at.
similarly,even assuming the state has a special sovereignty interest in shaping remedies,harris suit does not impermissibly intrude on this interest.harris would not require the state to demand more or less money in its settlement with the tobacco companies,for example.the state and the tobacco companies have already determined how much money will be paid to the state harris merely seeks his portion if any of these funds.in that regard,harris claim is more analogous to the revenue interest we have already rejected.
in sum,we can not say the relief plaintiffs request is as or intrusive as that sought in coeur tribe and anr pipeline.elephant butte,at.as in elephant butte,the remedy in this case only presents the possibility of a readjustment of priorities for the distribution of profits from,in this case,certain settlement funds.id.at.it will have minimal effect on the sovereignty and autonomy of colorado,particularly since the interest s of vindicating the federal rights and answering the federal questions involved substantially outweigh the state sovereign interests.id.at.
conclusion 
harris seeks prospective relief for defendants alleged ongoing violation of federal law.this relief does not implicate the state special sovereignty interests.we thus conclude that his suit is not barred by the eleventh amendment.because we have jurisdiction over this case,we turn now to its merits.
