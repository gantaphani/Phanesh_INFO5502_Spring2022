the issue in this appeal concerns the proper interpretation of the statute of limitations for a qui tam action brought by appellant robert hindin hindin under the provisions of the california false claims act california act,et we conclude that the limitations period of government code section,subdivision a commences in accord with the statutory language when the claim is discovered by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,not by a qui tam plaintiff such as hindin.the statute of limitations has therefore not run in this case,and we reverse the judgment that dismissed the action as.
facts and procedural history 
facts underlying this lawsuit 
hindin worked for eight years as an engineer at respondent company in,hindin discovered that was engaged in improper activities in connection with the marketing of defective medical devices,such as cardiac defibrillators,electrodes,pulse oximeters,ultrasound imaging equipment,and equipment for monitoring the administration of anesthetics.
hindin brought to the attention of his supervisors and ultimately the president of the fact that these medical devices were defective and unsafe.did not take action to stop marketing the defective devices,and instead subjected hindin to threats and reprimands.shortly after hindin complained about the defective medical equipment,a concealed video camera was secretly installed above his desk.hindin ultimately brought the defects in these medical devices to the attention of the federal food and drug administration fda for corrective action.the fda investigated,determined that hindin allegations were valid,and ordered to take corrective action.subsequently,continued to harass hindin,retaliated against him,and ultimately forced him out of his employment at after he filed a lawsuit against in federal court.
litigation history 
the federal action 
in,hindin filed,under seal,a lawsuit against in federal district court in massachusetts.this federal action asserted qui tam or whistle blower claims,alleging that had submitted false or fraudulent claims to the federal government regarding the safety of its medical devices,in violation of the federal false claims act the federal act.et in july,the united states formally intervened in the federal action,and the complaint was unsealed.the government ultimately settled the case against for million,apparently over hindin objections.
the state action

background regarding the california act 
the california act,set forth in sections through,is intended to supplement governmental efforts to identify and prosecute fraudulent claims made against state and local governmental entities.american contract services allied mold die,th,d rothschild tyco internat.us,th,d.in general,the california act permits a governmental agency,or a qui tam plaintiff bringing an action on behalf of the governmental agency,to recover civil penalties and damages from any person who,for example,knowingly presents to the state or one of its political subdivisions a false claim for payment or approval,subd.a.the california act was patterned in part after the federal act.see rothschild,supra,at,d.
section sets forth three ways in which a lawsuit under the california act may proceed.first,the attorney general shall diligently investigate false claims involving state funds and may bring an action against violators,subd.a.second,the prosecuting authority of a political subdivision shall diligently investigate false claims involving political subdivision funds and may bring an action against violators,subd.b.third,a private person may bring an action,on behalf of himself as well as the state or political subdivision,subd.c.the private party is referred to as the qui tam plaintiff.ibid.
where,as here,a qui tam plaintiff has initiated the lawsuit,the complaint is sealed until the attorney general or political subdivision decides whether to intervene and proceed with the case,subd.c.specifically,the qui tam plaintiff serves the attorney general with a copy of the complaint,along with a written disclosure of material evidence and information in support of his contentions,subd.c.if the matter involves only state funds,the attorney general decides whether to intervene and proceed with the action.if the matter involves political subdivision funds,the attorney general forwards a copy of the complaint and evidence to the political subdivision,which decides whether to intervene and proceed with the action,subd.c.if the attorney general or political subdivision,as applicable,declines to intervene,the complaint is unsealed and the qui tam plaintiff may conduct the action,subd.c d ii,d iii.the complaint is then served on the defendant,subd.c.the qui tam plaintiff is entitled to a percentage of any recovery obtained in the litigation,subd.g.
c.the statute plain language indicates the action is not barred 
the relevant statute of limitations for hindin claim under the california act is found in section,subdivision a,which provides a civil action under section may not be filed more than three years after the date of discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances or,in any event,no more than years after the date on which the violation of section is committed.
contends,and the trial court ruled,that this action was barred under the rule in section,measured from discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.maintains that hindin himself is the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances and that hindin obviously knew the relevant facts more than three years before he filed this action.by contrast,hindin contends the action is not barred because he is only a private individual,and not the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.
in determining what the legislature intended in section,subdivision a,we must first look to the words of the statute because they generally provide the most reliable indicator of legislative intent.hsu abbara cal th,d.if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,our inquiry ends if there is no ambiguity in the language,we presume the legislature meant what it said and the plain meaning of the statute governs.people snook cal th,d,diamond multimedia systems,superior court cal th,d,ailanto,supra,th at,d.
in reading and interpreting statutory provisions,we are mindful that the words are to be given their plain and commonsense meaning.lungren deukmejian cal d,lungren.only when the statute language is of more than one reasonable the court turn to extrinsic aids to assist in interpretation.people jefferson cal th,d,jefferson.
the plain and commonsense meaning of the relevant words in section,the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,italics added refers to a public official such as the attorney general,not a private individual such as hindin.as an individual employee of,hindin obviously was not a public official who had any responsibility to act in the circumstances to safeguard public funds from the depredations of.therefore,although hindin knew about the relevant facts more than three years before bringing this action,his knowledge did not trigger the limitations period,and the action is not barred under section.this plain and commonsense reading of the statutory language contains no ambiguity,and it must govern in this case.see lungren,supra,cal d at.
our conclusion is buttressed by the fact that language in other subdivisions of section explicitly refers to the qui tam plaintiff as a person distinct from a state entity.subdivision c of section reads in any action brought under section,the state,the political subdivision,or the qui tam plaintiff shall be required to prove all essential elements of the cause of action,including damages,by a preponderance of the evidence.italics added.thus,where the legislature wanted to specify that a requirement applied to a qui tam plaintiff such as hindin,it explicitly did so,in the very statute now under review.section does not equate the term qui tam plaintiff with the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,and in fact such a reading would be contrary to the plain meaning of the statutory language differentiating between the two.
the plain meaning of section,subdivision a is that the limitations period begins to run when a public official discovers the facts underlying the claim.because this plain meaning governs,it is not necessary to consider extrinsic aids such as the statute legislative history.jefferson,supra,cal th at,d.in fact,the legislative history is consistent with the statute plain meaning and confirms the propriety of our conclusion 
legislative history 
the legislative history of section indicates that the phrase the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances was intended to apply to a public official such as the attorney general,who has responsibility to act to protect the public fisc from false claims.
as originally proposed,the california act did not have its own statute of limitations.this gap was soon filled by the inclusion of a limitations period in section.because the period was apparently considered to be too long if the public officials had already been aware of the facts relevant to the alleged false claims,a limitations period was added to address that circumstance.see debro,supra,th at,d.as modified by amendment,the statute reads in its present form a civil action under section may not be filed more than three years after the date of discovery by the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances or,in any event,no more than years after the date on which the violation of section is committed,subd.a,italics added.
in explaining the proposed amendment,the legislature expressed its understanding that the limitations period would be triggered by the knowledge of the public agency amendment would provide for a shorter statute of limitations of years,instead of years,when the violation is known to the public agency defrauded by the false claim.policy,off.of floor analyses,on assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.in addition,the september,concurrence in the senate amendments to the legislation referred to the entity or individual bringing the claim as the initiating person,but expressly stated that amendment would e stablish a three year statute of limitations from date of discovery of the false claim by the state or local official,concurrence in,assem.bill reg.sess.as amended,italics added not the initiating person.
by contrast,nothing in the legislative history demonstrates that the knowledge of a private qui tam plaintiff was ever intended to commence the limitations period.refers to snippets of legislative history to argue that the intent of the amendment was to prevent a party from pursuing an action,after there had been knowledge of the facts underlying the claims for a period of more than three years from the fact that hindin is a party to the action,argues the action is barred because he knew of his claims more than three years before filing suit.
the phrase a party,however,never found its way into section in this regard.the statute does not provide that the knowledge of a party commences the limitations period,but the knowledge of the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.it thus appears that the phrase a party in summaries of the legislative proceedings was used merely as a shorthand version of the much longer,cumbersome,and detailed statutory phrase,the official of the state or political subdivision charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances.
also relies on quotes taken out of context from decisions of our high court,stating that the california act deputiz ed citizens to join the fight to protect the public treasury state of california altus finance cal th,d,altus and that a qui tam plaintiff stands in the shoes of the government wells learning foundation cal th,d,wells.we have no quarrel with the quoted language as it pertains to the actual holdings of altus and wells however,those holdings did not relate to the statute of limitations under section,but to collateral issues such as whether a claim pertained to money issued from the state altus,supra,at,d,or whether a qui tam plaintiff must file an administrative claim with the government under the tort claims act before filing suit wells,supra,at,d.those cases did not consider,and are simply not relevant to,the question before us.
e.the other cases cited by do not support its interpretation 
argues that certain federal cases,and a passage from our decision in debro,demonstrate that its view of section is correct.is mistaken.
federal cases analyzing the federal act are inapposite 
relies on federal authorities,decided under the federal act,in an attempt to show that hindin claims should be barred under the california act.under the federal act,the false claim action must be brought by the later of six years after the violation,or years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the united states charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,but in no event more than years after the date on which the violation is committed.b.
in particular,refers us to ex rel.hyatt northrop cir northrop.there,a qui tam plaintiff filed a lawsuit nearly seven years after he became aware of the claim.id.at.he argued that the federal statute of limitations did not bar his case,because the limitations period was tolled until the government learned of the fraud underlying his claim,pursuant to the provision allowing suit within years after the material facts are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the united states charged with responsibility to act.b.the court disagreed,concluding that the tolling period began when the qui tam plaintiff knew or should have known of the facts material to his claim,because he had the responsibility to act in bringing the lawsuit.northrop,supra,at.therefore,the government ignorance of the material facts did not,under federal law,toll the limitations period.in a footnote,the court stated although it may seem incongruous to hold that a qui tam plaintiff could be considered an official of the united states charged with responsibility to act,it is in view of the federal fca statutory scheme.id.at,fn,italics added.
northrop is not helpful to our analysis of section,subdivision a.northrop addressed whether the limitations period in the federal act was tolled by the government ignorance of
