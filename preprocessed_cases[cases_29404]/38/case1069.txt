oklahoma has elected to provide prescription benefits to advantage participants as well as residents in nursing homes.until recently,advantage participants were entitled to an unlimited number of medically necessary prescriptions paid for by the state.however,in september,the state notified participants that it would impose a cap of five prescriptions per month on advantage participants,effective october,while continuing to provide unlimited prescriptions to patients in nursing facilities.this decision was based on a budgetary shortfall defendants anticipated that capping the number of prescriptions available would save the state million.
on the same day that the cap came into effect,plaintiffs katherine fisher,earlee heath,and karol loy,participants in oklahoma advantage program,filed suit in federal court against the ohca and its ceo,mike fogarty.in their complaint,plaintiffs allege that defendants cap violates the integration requirements of the ada,et,and section of the rehabilitation act ra,because it will force them out of their communities and into nursing homes in order to obtain the care that is medically necessary plaintiffs further assert that the cap violates title xix of the social security act,et.all three plaintiffs meet the medical and financial requirements for nursing facility care and would be eligible for admission to a nursing home.

defendants contest these figures.according to defendants,adjusting the schedule under which medication is purchased and eliminating drug interactions could reduce the amount plaintiffs would have to pay under the cap by rescheduling and eliminating drugs that have adverse interactions with other drugs defendants argue that fisher monthly cost could be reduced to per month heath monthly cost could be reduced to per month and loy monthly cost could be reduced to an admittedly still high two hundred dollars.appellees br.at.because the plaintiffs do not contest these projected cost savings,we assume that defendants projections are correct.
plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction,which the district court converted into a motion for a permanent injunction.after receiving briefing and conducting a hearing on the matter,the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants,concluding that the plaintiffs could not maintain a claim under the ada because they are not presently institutionalized and face no risk of institutionalization.this appeal followed.

under title ii of the ada,a public entity may not discriminate against qualified individuals based on a disability 
n o qualified individual with a disability shall,by reason of such disability,be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,programs,or activities of a public entity,or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.
pursuant to congressional authority,the attorney general issued regulations implementing provisions of title ii,including the discrimination proscription of.olmstead,at.central to the instant case are two such regulations.the first,known as the integration regulation or integration mandate,provides that a public entity shall administer services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities,d emphasis added in olmstead,the supreme court construed the ada integration mandate and concluded that the discrimination forbidden under title ii of the ada includes u njustified isolation of the disabled.at.thus,the ada and its attendant regulations clearly define unnecessary segregation as a form of illegal discrimination against the disabled.helen didario,cir.
although public entities are required to make reasonable modifications in policies,practices,or procedures in order to avoid the discrimination inherent in the unjustified segregation of the disabled,the second regulation at issue,the fundamental alteration regulation,relieves a public entity of its duties under the ada integration mandate if the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity.b emphasis added see townsend quasim,cir.thus,under olmstead and the applicable ada regulations,when treatment professionals have determined that community placement is appropriate for disabled individuals,those individuals do not oppose the placement,and the provision of services would not constitute a fundamental alteration,states are required to place those individuals in community settings rather than institutions at.
arguing that the integration regulation,as interpreted in olmstead,renders the imposition of the cap a violation of the ada because it will force them to enter nursing facilities in order to obtain necessary prescriptions,the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief before the district court.rejecting this argument,the district court held that olmstead is factually and materially distinguishable from the instant case,in that,unlike the plaintiffs in olmstead,fisher,heath,and loy are not presently living in an institution and are free to remain in the community.fisher.health care authority,c,slip op.at.
upon de novo review,we conclude that the district court was incorrect in its reading of olmstead and the integration mandate.first,there is nothing in the plain language of the regulations that limits protection to persons who are currently institutionalized.the integration regulation simply states that public entities are to provide services,programs,and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate for a qualified person with disabilities.d.those protections would be meaningless if plaintiffs were required to segregate themselves by entering an institution before they could challenge an allegedly discriminatory law or policy that threatens to force them into segregated isolation.second,while it is true that the plaintiffs in olmstead were institutionalized at the time they brought their claim,nothing in the olmstead decision supports a conclusion that institutionalization is a prerequisite to enforcement of the ada integration requirements.although no circuit court appears to have addressed the issue,we find makin,d,to be instructive.in makin,the district court rejected the argument that olsmstead is inapplicable in situations where the plaintiffs are not institutionalized,observing that this argument is misplaced since the only alternative for plaintiffs presently is institutionalization if they seek treatment under the statute.id.at.we agree,and conclude that olmstead does not imply that disabled persons who,by reason of a change in state policy,stand imperiled with segregation,may not bring a challenge to that state policy under the ada integration regulation without first submitting to institutionalization.
as we have elaborated,under olmstead,the failure to provide medicaid services in a setting may constitute a form of discrimination.because the ohca does not allow the plaintiffs to receive services for which they are qualified unless they agree to enter a nursing home,the plaintiffs have presented a genuine issue of material fact as to whether they can prove that the defendants have violated the integration requirement of title ii of the ada.however,our conclusion that the cap may violate the ada integration regulation does not end our inquiry,for t he state responsibility,once it provides treatment to qualified persons with disabilities,is not boundless,olmstead,at,and states are permitted to resist modifications that entail a fundamenta l alter ation of the state services and programs,id.quoting b.
in expounding upon the meaning of fundamental alteration,the olmstead court rejected a construction of the defense that required only a comparison of the cost of the community services for the plaintiffs with the state budget.rather,courts are to consider whether in the allocation of available resources,immediate relief for the plaintiffs would be inequitable,given the responsibility the state has undertaken for the care and treatment of a large and diverse population of persons with disabilities.id.at.with this standard in mind,we proceed to consider whether the plaintiffs have created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether elimination of the cap would constitute a fundamental alteration.
recognizing that the regulation can serve as a defense to the requirements of the integration regulation,the district court noted two things the waiver program is optional and g iven the state financial crisis,d efendants have made a reasonable move to reduce the optional program rather than eliminate it altogether as the state could.fisher,c,slip op.at.regarding the fact that the advantage waiver program is optional,we note that,under title ii of the ada,a state may not amend optional programs in such a way as to violate the integration mandate.see,helen.at,requiring the requested service,attendant care,even though it is an optional medicaid service.thus,the mere fact that a program is optional does not support a defense rather,it merely begs the question whether provision of that service would constitute a fundamental alteration.
as to the second factor cited by the district court,that the decision to reduce the optional program rather than eliminate it altogether was reasonable because of the reality of oklahoma financial crisis,fisher,c,slip op.at,we note that public entities have a defense when a modification would fundamentally alter the nature of the service,program,or activity,d that their actions were merely reasonable does not constitute a defense.moreover,the fact that oklahoma has a fiscal problem,by itself,does not lead to an automatic conclusion that preservation of unlimited prescription benefits for participants in the advantage program will result in a fundamental alteration.see townsend,at.in passing the ada,congress was clearly aware that w hile the integration of people with disabilities will sometimes involve substantial burdens,both financial and administrative,the effects of integration will benefit society as a whole,pt,at,reprinted in.if every alteration in a program or service that required the outlay of funds were tantamount to a fundamental alteration,the ada integration mandate would be hollow indeed.
the district court appears to have found oklahoma decision reasonable,and,by implication,that the elimination of the cap would constitute a fundamental alteration,because the alternative to the imposition of the cap was to eliminate the entire hcbs waiver program.however,there is no evidence in the record to suggest that the state considered eliminating the entire program.fogarty testified that the agency is absolutely committed to the waiver program it a program that needed.joint app.at.given that the cost of institutional care is nearly double that of care,it seems unlikely that the option cited by the district co
