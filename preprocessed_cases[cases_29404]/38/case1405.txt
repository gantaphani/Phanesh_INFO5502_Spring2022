woodrow sanders appeals an august,decision by the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court that affirmed a decision by the board of veterans appeals board denying sanders claim for service connection for choroidoretinitis of his right eye.sanders nicholson.because the veterans court incorrectly required sanders to establish that an error in a notice the department of veterans affairs va is required to give claimants was prejudicial,we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
sanders served in the united states army from may to september.although his service medical records do not indicate that he suffered an eye trauma or abnormality and no eye abnormalities were recorded in his separation medical examination,sanders asserts that on september,while serving in france,a bazooka exploded near him,burning the right side of his face.in december,sanders was diagnosed with chronic,choroidoretinitis,an inflammation of the choroids and retina.believing his choroidoretinitis was caused by his injury in,sanders submitted a claim for service connection for a disability to the.the va regional office varo denied his claim in february.
approximately forty years later,sanders filed a statement attempting to reopen his claim for service connection for his choroidoretinitis.in support of his claim,sanders submitted a statement from a va ophthalmologist,dated december,and a statement from a private ophthalmologist,dated september.the va ophthalmologist reported that sanders stated that he was injured in a bridge explosion,rather than a bazooka explosion,and that he had experienced vision loss in his right eye ever since.the va ophthalmologist went on to diagnose right and left macular chorioretinal scars and stated that i t is not inconceivable that these macular and retinal lesions in each eye and particularly the right could have occurred secondary to trauma.
sanders private ophthalmologist also reported that sanders indicated that his injury occurred during a bridge explosion and that he had experienced vision loss in his right eye since then.the ophthalmologist diagnosed large chorioretinal scars in both eyes and opined that t his type of macular injury in his right eye can certainly be concussive in character and his history supports the visual acuity loss from his injury in world war ii.
sanders later stated that both the va ophthalmologist and his private ophthalmologist were incorrect in reporting that his eye injury occurred during a bridge explosion.instead,sanders reiterated that his injury occurred when the right side of his face was burned by a bazooka explosion.according to sanders,this injury went unreported because there were no medics to whom he could report his injury and because most of his fellow soldiers were wounded or killed.nonetheless,in july the varo found sanders had failed to present new and material evidence to reopen his claim.sanders appealed to the board,but the board denied his claim for service connection in a decision dated november.in january,however,the veterans court remanded sanders case for further development and adjudication.
in june,the board found that new and material evidence had been presented to reopen sanders claim for service connection and remanded sanders claim for a va ophthalmologic examination to determine the etiology of his condition.
in december,sanders had a comprehensive eye examination by a va optometrist.the optometrist diagnosed decreased vision in the right eye due to a macular scar and a small chorioretinal scar in the left eye,but stated that,based on the fact that sanders visual acuity in the right eye was on may,and on september,when he was discharged from the army,it is unlikely that the decrease in vision was related to sanders september trauma.the optometrist also noted that there was no documented evidence of reduced vision until.according to the optometrist,i t is certainly possible for there to have been damage to the retina in that then hemorrhaged in,but there are no other signs of ocular trauma.the optometrist concluded that t he chorioretinitis is most likely infectious in nature,although the etiology at this point is impossible to determine.although he noted it was possible sanders contracted some infection during his military service,the optometrist stated that there is no way to prove this either.
in august,sanders was also examined by another va ophthalmologist,who diagnosed dense macular scarring of the right eye and early macular degeneration of the left eye.the ophthalmologist stated that sanders decreased vision was consistent with these clinical findings,but that the etiology of sanders macular scar is more difficult to ascertain.according to the ophthalmologist,i f sanders vision had been normal in the right eye prior to the reported injury,then it is possible that the macular scar could be related to the injury.the ophthalmologist further stated that d ue to the fact that sanders does have the additional punched out chorioretinal scars in both eyes,the possibility of an infection as the etiology of the macular scar could also be entertained.
the varo issued supplemental statements of the case in and discussing this additional medical evidence.the varo also sent sanders a letter stating that it had all the information it needed to decide his claim,but that he could submit any additional evidence he wanted considered.
in october,the board denied sanders claim for service connection for his choroidoretinitis.the board found that the opinion of the va optometrist was more probative on the issue of whether sanders choroidoretinitis was and concluded that the preponderance of the evidence weighed against the claim.sanders appealed to the veterans court.
on appeal to the veterans court,sanders argued that the va failed to provide notice as to who was responsible for obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim,as required by the notice provision of the veterans claims assistance act of vcaa,a,and failed to provide this notice prior to the initial denial of his claim.
in a decision dated august,the veterans court found that there was a plausible basis in the record for the board decision denying service connection.the veterans court also found that sanders did not allege any specific prejudice resulting from the va alleged failure to notify him about who would ultimately be responsible for obtaining the evidence necessary to substantiate his claim,and to provide notice before the initial unfavorable decision by the varo.because sanders did not meet the burden of showing how such errors affected the fairness of the adjudication,the veterans court stated that it need not consider whether any error occurred.sanders appeals to this court.we have jurisdiction over appeals from the veterans court pursuant to.

history of the vcaa 
at the center of sanders appeal are the notice requirements of the vcaa.the vcaa was enacted in november to ensure that the va assisted veterans claiming va benefits.the legislation was passed in response to concerns expressed by veterans,veterans service organizations,and congress over a july decision of the veterans court,morton west,which held that the va did not have a duty to assist veterans in developing their claims unless the claims were.put another way,prior to the vcaa,the va only had to assist in the full development of a veteran claim if the veteran first provided enough information for the va to determine that the claim was plausible.the vcaa eliminated this requirement.see cong.rec,explanatory statement by the house and senate committees on veterans affairs.instead,congress noted that under the va claimant friendly and adjudicative system,the va must provide a substantial amount of assistance to a claimant seeking benefits.cong.rec.at citations omitted.
under the legal framework of the vcaa,there is generally no prerequisite to receiving va assistance the va is simply required to assist a claimant at the time that claimant files a claim for benefits.see a c.as part of this assistance,the va is required to notify claimants of what they must do to substantiate their claims.a.if the va denies a claim,it must provide the claimant with a statement of the reasons for the decision and a summary of the evidence considered.b.if a claimant files a notice of disagreement,the va must issue a statement of the case summarizing the reasons for the va decision on each issue,the evidence considered,and the relevant statutes and regulations.d.all claimants are entitled to appear at their hearings for the purpose of presenting evidence,and va personnel conducting hearings are instructed to suggest the submission of evidence which the claimant may have overlooked and which would be of advantage to the claimant position.c.
as mentioned above,sanders appeal focuses on the notice requirements of the vcaa.these notice requirements are contained within a,which states 
upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application,the secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant representative,if any,of any information,and any medical or lay evidence,not previously provided to the secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.as part of that notice,the secretary shall indicate which portion of that information and evidence,if any,is to be provided by the claimant and which portion,if any,the secretary,in accordance with section of this title and any other applicable provisions of law,will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.
the purpose of a notification is to ensure that the claimant case is presented to the initial decisionmaker with whatever support is available,and to ensure that the claimant understands what evidence will be obtained by the va and what evidence must be provided by the claimant prior to the initial adjudication of his claim.mayfield nicholson,mayfield ii.moreover,the va duty to notify can not be satisfied by various communications from which a claimant might have been able to infer what evidence the va found lacking in the claimant presentation,as such notices do not contain the same content or serve the same purpose as a notification.see also pelegrini principi.
the statutory notice requirement of a is implemented in b,which provides,in pertinent part 
when va receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits,it will notify the claimant of any information and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim.va will inform the claimant which information and evidence,if any,that the claimant is to provide to va and which information and evidence,if any,that va will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.va will also request that the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant possession that pertains to the claim.
accordingly,the notice required by the vcaa can be divided into four separate elements notice of what information or evidence is necessary to substantiate the claim notice of what subset of the necessary information or evidence,if any,that the claimant is to provide notice of what subset of the necessary information or evidence,if any,that the va will attempt to obtain and a general notification that the claimant may submit any other evidence he or she has in his or her possession that may be relevant to the claim.errors with regard to these elements are referred to as,and notice errors,respectively.
this court has previously held that such vcaa notice errors are reviewed under a prejudicial error rule.conway principi.this is consistent with b,which states that the veterans court shall take due account of the rule of prejudicial error when reviewing the record of proceedings before the secretary and the board of veterans appeals.the court in conway,however,did not express an opinion as to what it means for the veterans court to take due account of the rule,nor did it define what constitutes prejudicial error.conway,at.
lacking specific guidance from this court,the veterans court took it upon itself to address how to apply the rule of prejudicial error in mayfield nicholson.mayfield i,rev on other grounds.as an initial matter,the veterans court in mayfield i held that an appellant asserting a vcaa notice error bears the burden of convincing the court that a notice error has,indeed,been committed,by referring to specific deficiencies in the documents in the record on appeal,including any documents that may have been relied on as satisfying the notice requirements of a.id.at.
next,the court addressed what was meant by prejudicial error.id.at.after analyzing supreme court and federal circuit precedent,as well as interpretations of the prejudicial error rule under the administrative procedure act apa the court concluded that an error is prejudicial if it affects the substantial rights of the parties in terms of the essential fairness of the adjudication.id.at quoting mcdonough power,greenwood,d.as stated by the court,this did not require an outcome to have been different to have been prejudicial.see also kotteakos united states.the inquiry can not be merely whether there was enough to support the result,apart from the phase affected by the error.it is rather,even so,whether the error had substantial influence.that said,a demonstration that the outcome would not have been different in the absence of the error would demonstrate that there was no prejudice.mayfield i.at.
according to mayfield i,congress,in b,provided the veterans court with considerable discretion in determining what burdens should be carried by the parties regarding its taking due account of the rule.id.at.after analyzing supreme court precedent in other contexts,see id.at,the court concluded that 
in the section a notice context an appellant generally must identify,with considerable specificity,how the notice was defective and what evidence the appellant would have provided or requested the secretary to obtain,a nexus medical opinion had the secretary fulfilled his notice obligations further,an appellant must also assert,again with considerable specificity,how the lack of that notice and evidence affected the essential fairness of the adjudication.
id.at.however,if the asserted error is found to exist and to be of the type that has the natural effect of producing prejudice,an appellant need not have pled prejudice.id.instead,it is the secretary burden to demonstrate lack of prejudice in terms of the fairness of the adjudication.id.to do this,the secretary is required to persuade the court that the purpose of the notice was not,by demonstrating that any defect in notice was cured by actual knowledge on the part of the claimant,that a reasonable person could be expected to understand from the notice provided what was needed,or that a benefit could not possibly have been awarded as a matter of law.id.with this in mind,the veterans court defined the roles of the claimant and the secretary in connection with the court taking due care of the prejudicial error rule in the context of the various types of notice element and timing errors.
with respect to the first notice element,notice regarding the information and evidence necessary to substantiate the claim,the court held that the natural effect of such an error would constitute a failure to provide a key element of what it takes to substantiate the claim,thereby precluding the appellant from parti
