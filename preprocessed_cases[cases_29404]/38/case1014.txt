bradley lewis appeals the magistrate judge affirmance of a final decision of the commissioner of social security,which denied his application for disability insurance and supplemental security income benefits under titles ii and xvi of the social security act.he alleges that he was disabled by several conditions a seizure disorder,drowsiness from his medications,mild mental retardation,and an organic personality disorder that caused him to act inappropriately in work and social situations.an administrative law judge determined that he had the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work as a attendant or,in the alternative,to perform various jobs identified by a vocational expert.the magistrate judge then dismissed lewis suit challenging the alj determination.because the alj decision is not supported by substantial evidence,we reverse the judgment of the magistrate judge and remand with instructions to direct the commissioner to calculate lewis benefits.
background statement 
bradley lewis suffers from a seizure disorder,with which he was diagnosed as a child.two types of seizures afflict him petit mal and grand mal.petit mal seizures are less serious but more frequent.they last for seconds and do not cause him to lose consciousness.grand mal seizures do and,though less frequent,last for two to five minutes.medications for his disorder,he alleges,make him groggy.lewis is also mildly mentally retarded,with a verbal and iq of and a performance iq of.
lewis was hospitalized for grand mal seizures in april,september,and december may and november.lewis also reported or was treated for seizure episodes in november,march,august,and july.many of these episodes,according to his treating physicians notes,followed lewis failure to comply with his prescribed therapy.lewis family members testified that lewis had nightly petit mal seizures.lewis brother testified that he had about daytime petit mal seizures in.his family members all testified that he suffered from severe fatigue.in the opinion of his treating psychologist,he had poor social perception,which caused him to act inappropriately and often led to problems in both work and social life.
lewis has worked on and up to twenty hours per week,but never full time.in the mid to,he worked as a laborer in his sister construction company she testified that,despite his willingness,he could not complete his work such as sweeping floors without her assistance or supervision.lewis worked as a box boy at a supermarket five days a week in,and as a wrapper at a red lobster restaurant three days a week in.
starting in june,lewis worked at a mcdonald as a attendant,cleaning tables,floors,and the parking lot.he worked eighteen to twenty hours a week for about two months before his hours were cut back.by june,at the time of the hearing,he was working only to five hours per day,one or two days a week,for a maximum of ten hours per week.lewis testified that,although the mcdonald owner had told him that the restaurant needed to cut back,lewis believed that the decrease in his hours was because of his seizure disorder.
lewis first applied for social security benefits in.the commissioner denied the application without an administrative hearing on june,lewis did not appeal.he next applied for benefits in september,claiming that he had become unable to work on september.after the commissioner denied this application,lewis was granted a june hearing before an administrative law judge.five witnesses testified lewis,his brother,his sister,his mother,and a vocational expert.the record included documentation of emergency room visits and hospital stays,and notes and reports from three treating.dauben,halcrow,and duggan.lewis later supplemented the record with medical records made after the hearing.
to decide if a claimant is entitled to benefits,an alj conducts a inquiry.the alj first considers whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity if not,the alj asks in the second step whether the claimant has a severe impairment,one that significantly affects his or her ability to function if so,the alj asks in the third step whether the claimant condition meets or equals one of those outlined in the listing of impairments in appendix of the regulations if not,then in the fourth step the alj asks whether the claimant can perform his or her past relevant work if not,finally,the alj in the fifth step asks whether the claimant can perform other jobs that exist in substantial numbers in the national economy.b f b f.
ten months after the hearing,in may,the alj issued a decision that lewis was not disabled.the alj found in favor of lewis at step one,concluding that his ten hours per week at mcdonald did not constitute substantial gainful activity.likewise,at step two he found that lewis seizure disorder and mild mental retardation in combination were severe as of september.at step three,however,the alj determined that lewis impairments,either alone or in combination,did not meet or equal any of the conditions outlined in the listing of impairments.at steps four and five,the alj determined that lewis,despite limits on his working abilities,could perform his work as a mcdonald lot attendant with increased hours,and could perform the jobs cited by the vocational expert,including office helper.the alj rejected the family members testimony that lewis medications made him chronically groggy and fatigued.he concluded that lewis has not been disabled,as defined in the social security act,at any time through the date of this decision.he thus denied lewis application for benefits.lewis asked the appeals council to review the alj decision,but it declined.
with his administrative remedies exhausted,lewis filed suit in the central district of california.after consenting to have magistrate judge groh decide the case,the parties filed for summary judgment.magistrate judge groh granted the commissioner motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice.in so doing,magistrate judge groh concluded sua sponte that the application had res judicata effect on the issue of disability through june,and that it created a presumption of continuing thereafter.this timely appeal followed.

lewis raises five issues on appeal did the alj and the magistrate judge err about the relevant time period from which to assess his disability did the alj make adequate credibility findings about the testimony of lewis family members did the alj adequately explain his determination that lewis impairments did not meet or equal any listed in appendix did substantial evidence support the alj determination that lewis could perform his work at mcdonald for more hours and did substantial evidence support the alj determination that there were jobs that lewis could perform.
period of alleged disability 
lewis contends that the appropriate starting point for assessing his disability was march july,as the magistrate judge concluded,or september,as the alj concluded lewis alleged in his application that the onset date of his disability was september.at his hearing,he moved to change the onset date to march.the alj denied the motion,although he considered evidence of disability from before september.the magistrate judge sua sponte held that the denial of lewis earlier application was res judicata on the issue of disability up to the date of denial.
on appeal,lewis argues that the denial of his application is not res judicata on the issue of disability because his notice of denial was defective under gonzalez sullivan,cir.gonzalez held that the commissioner form notice of an adverse initial determination violated the due process clause because it did not clearly indicate that if no request for reconsideration was made,the determination was final.id.at to comply with gonzalez,the social security administration and the department of health and human services issued acquiescence ruling,applicable only in the ninth circuit,and only to adverse initial determinations made before july,acquiescence ruling required the commissioner to reopen an adverse determination upon the request of the recipient of a defective notice.
the parties agree that lewis received the notice of denial of his application before july,but there is no evidence that his notice was defective.the notice is not a part of the excerpts of record before this court nor was it a part of the administrative record filed with the district court.lewis is therefore entitled to acquiescence ruling relief only if there is a presumption that notices of denial issued before july,were defective 
although gonzalez likely does not preclude the magistrate judge res judicata reasoning,this court nonetheless concludes that the magistrate judge erred in holding that res judicata barred evidence of disability before june.res judicata does not apply when an alj later considers on the merits whether the claimant was disabled during an period.lester chater,cir.when an alj de facto reopens the prior adjudication in that manner,the commissioner decision as to the prior period is subject to judicial review.ibid.the alj knew of the june denial of lewis application.yet he considered evidence of disability from as early as,and he accepted without comment the alleged onset date of september.under these circumstances it is appropriate for the court to treat the alj actions as a de facto reopening,and assume a disability onset date of september,as the alj did.
lewis also argues that the alj erred in not allowing him to amend his alleged onset date.lewis first asked to amend his onset date to august,the onset date alleged,lewis claimed,in the application.lewis next asked to amend the alleged onset date to march,a month before lewis turned,so that lewis could apply for child benefits on his deceased father account number.both requests were made at the hearing.
in his written decision,the alj denied the requests to amend on the ground that counsel did not inform the alj before the hearing of any change in alleged onset date.the alj stated that the necessary development of lewis case relating to the requested onset dates had not been completed,and that the record was devoid of a pattern of medical treatment for any complaints from to.lewis cites no authority suggesting that the alj abused his discretion in denying lewis request,or that the court may even review such a decision.the record,moreover,does not support an onset date of either august or march.the alj did not err in denying lewis requests to amend the alleged onset date.
credibility findings about the testimony of lewis family members 
lewis contends that the alj failed to make adequate credibility findings in rejecting lewis family members testimony,which described lewis severe fatigue and limited ability to function socially and in work settings.lay testimony as to a claimant symptoms is competent evidence that an alj must take into account,unless he or she expressly determines to disregard such testimony and gives reasons germane to each witness for doing so.nguyen chater,cir citing dodrill shalala,cir.one reason for which an alj may discount lay testimony is that it conflicts with medical evidence.vincent heckler,cir.the alj decision in this case met these standards.
lewis mother testified that,from to the time of the hearing,lewis would fall asleep during the day.after daytime petit mal seizures,she testified,lewis was very groggy and disoriented.she described how his habitual extreme grogginess was beyond that of a simply tired person 
he come over to the house or we go someplace together or we go in the car someplace and he fall asleep.he sleep.he eyes are very,very groggy.like first of all,like sometimes he up and you look at him and say,oh,he going to have a good day.and then as the day goes on,within hours,he more lethargic.he dragging his feet.last week,he came with me around my dad house,dusting and stuff,and he was pretty good.then by the time we finished the dusting and we went to see my dad and then we went to have dinner at coco,by the time dinner was over with,he got up,stood up,was so dizzy i had to help him out of the restaurant.he was like dragging his legs.he went right home and slept.and this is the type of thing that happens i would say daily.he gets very,very lethargic and dizzy.i mean it not like just tired.you can see the way he kind of shuffles.it not like a tired person.
lewis sister described how lewis,in,was lethargic and detached 
very slow.very slow,lacking energy,lethargic.he does function well.his body does move like you would person functioning well would.he walks strangely and has his head down.he is really aware of what going on around him.
when lewis awoke after having had a petit mal seizure in his sleep,she testified,his eyes would be half closed,and he would slouch when he walked.she also testified that when she hired him to do small jobs for her construction company,he had trouble with sequential tasks and could not work independently.
lewis brother testified that lewis had petit mal seizures every night.afterwards,he told the alj,lewis would have problems with alertness and balance 
it makes him very groggy when he wakes up from a sleep or a nap,he is not fully alert for a period of time.i noticed he would get up from a sleep and walk across the apartment to answer the phone or something and he would would have his balance.he would walk,you know,he would have to hold himself up on the wall sometimes.
lewis brother observed that lewis would suffer from lethargy four or five days per sometimes seven.
the alj,however,expressly disregarded the family members testimony 
i have carefully considered the testimony of the claimant and the family members in which they indicated that the claimant has been constantly groggy and fatigued since.however,the documented medical history and findings and prior recorded statements are contrary to the testimony.
the alj analyzed the documented medical history to a limited extent,noting only that during the period of to,the claimant disorder was relatively well controlled when he complied with medications,and he had no significant adverse side effects.although the alj did not cite the record,it appears that he was alluding to seven medical reports prepared by dauben,one of lewis treating physicians,in.each report said that lewis suffered no side effects of medication.none of the reports mentioned fatigue or grogginess.the absence of any mention of fatigue,along with the no side effects observations in lewis medical reports,supported the alj rejection of the family members testimony that lewis had suffered chronic fatigue since.
while the alj,in dismissing the family members testimony,did not specify any inconsistent prior recorded statements,he did note some arguably contradictory testimony at other points in his decision.he observed,for example,that lewis jogged,golfed,bicycled,played softball once a week,attended church,occasionally bowled with friends,cleaned,and vacuumed.when asked if he was restricting the hours he worked for health reasons,lewis replied that his hours had been restricted by his employer,and that he was willing to work more.the alj also noted inconsistent testimony about lewis sleep lewis claimed to have insomnia,his mother testified that he slept through the night.in all,the alj at least noted arguably germane reasons for dismissing the family members testimony,even if he did not clearly link his determination to those reasons.substantial evidence supported the alj decision to discount the family members testimony.
c.the alj explanation of his determination that lewis impairments did not meet or equal any of those listed in appendix 
if a claimant has an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or equals a condition outlined in the listing of impairments,then the claimant is presumed disabled at step three,and the alj need not make any specific finding as to his or her ability to perform past relevant work or any other jobs.d.an alj must evaluate the relevant evidence before concluding that a claimant impairments do not meet or equal a listed impairment.a boilerplate finding is insufficient to support a conclusion that a claimant impairment does not do so.see marcia sullivan,cir holding that alj erred by failing to consider evidence of equivalence.
during the hearing,the alj noted his impression that lewis condition had worsened since,and said that he was not at that time foreclosing any meeting or equalling sic the level of severity of the listed impairment.nevertheless,in his written decision,the alj concluded that lewis impairments did not meet or equal a listed impairment 
as of the claimant alleged onset date,his disorders in combination were severe mild mental retardation and seizure disorder.he does not have an impairment or combination of impairments listed in or medically equal to one listed in the regulations.
lewis contends that the alj erred under marcia by failing to elaborate on his determination that lewis seizure disorder and mental retardation did not meet or equal an impairment listed in appendix 
epilepsy is a listed impairment evaluated according to the type,frequency,duration,and of seizures pt,subpt.p,app.the alj did not make findings,as lewis correctly notes,as to the nature and extent of each type of seizure noted in lewis medical records.nor did he make findings as to whether lewis had nighttime seizures that affected his daytime activity.finally,the alj did not make findings as to the average frequency of lewis grand mal or petit mal seizures.these omissions might have required reversal or remand under marcia were it not for the alj finding that lewis seizures were largely a result of noncompliance with his prescribed therapy.
a claimant impairment does not meet the epilepsy listing unless it persists despite the fact that the individual is following prescribed anticonvulsive treatment.pt,subpt.p,app,a.an alj can ordinarily determine whether a claimant is adhering to his or her prescribed therapy from objective clinical findings in the treating physician report.ibid.an alj can not allow a claim under the epilepsy listing without a record of anticonvulsant blood levels.social security ruling.the alj must evaluate blood drug levels along with all other evidence to determine the extent of the claimant compliance with treatment.pt,subpt.p,app,
the alj concluded that when lewis took his medication,his condition was well controlled.although he did not recite it in his decision brief findings,the alj did note in his statement of the case repeated evidence that lewis did not comply with his prescribed treatment.during lewis april hospitalization,the alj noted,testing disclosed that he had a low tegretol level of only.the alj relied on similar evidence of subtherapeutic drug blood levels for seizures in may and november.
the alj also noted other evidence of noncompliance.before his april hospitalization,lewis had been drinking beer,contrary to prior medical instructions.lewis himself reported that he had not taken klonopin for several days before his hospitalization in september,and that he had missed medications in march.in,dauben noted that when lewis takes his medication he is under good control.he has had several episodes where he missed medication and had seizures.in march,halcrow,another treating physician,reported that lewis had a recurrent problem with compliance 
there apparently had been a recurrent problem with good patient compliance.at one point,it became evident that dexedrine which had been prescribed for the patient,had been sold by the patient roommates.nevertheless,the seizures have been under reasonable control in the immediate past.
the alj thus discussed and evaluated evidence supporting his conclusion that lewis symptoms did not persist when he took his medication.marcia simply requires an alj to discuss and evaluate the evidence that supports his or her conclusion it does not specify that the alj must do so under the heading findings.
as lewis correctly points out,the alj did not mention that dauben commented in a july,letter that u nfortunately this patient seizures have not been fully controlled despite therapeutic levels of tegretol,depakote,and klonopin.this omission did not rise to the level of error.because the evidence of lewis compliance conflicted,the alj could conclude that lewis failed to take his medications,so long as substantial evidence supported that conclusion,as it did.moreover,dauben had not made his july,statement in the course of was in a to whom it may concern letter that did not address whether lewis consistently complied with his prescribed regime of therapeutic levels of medication.the alj found,with adequate explanation and record support,that lewis did not consistently comply with his regime,and that his seizures tended to occur when he did not comply.
the alj also sufficiently discussed and evaluated the evidence before concluding that lewis did not meet the listing for mental retardation.a claimant can only meet that listing if he or she has verbal,performance or full scale iq of or less along with some additional impairment,or a full scale iq of or less.pt,subpt.p,app.the alj noted that lewis had a full scale iq of,and a performance iq of.these scores were well above the maximum iq of allowed by the listing.this alone,apart from the alj discussion of lewis practical capabilities,sufficed to explain his conclusion.
the next issue is whether the alj adequately explained his finding that lewis impairments did not equal a listed impairment.if a claimant impairment does not meet the criteria specified in the listings,he or she is still disabled if the impairment equals a listed impairment.d.if a claimant has more than one impairment,the commissioner must determine whether the combination of the impairments is medically equal to any listed impairment.a.the claimant symptoms must be considered in combination and must not be fragmentized in evaluating their effects.lester chater,cir citations omitted.a finding of equivalence must be based on medical evidence only.d.
the alj did not discuss the combined effects of lewis impairments,or compare them to any listing.unlike the claimants in lester and marcia,however,lewis has offered no theory,plausible or otherwise,as to how his seizure disorder and mental retardation combined to equal a listed impairment.nor has he pointed to evidence that shows that his combined impairments equal a listed impairment.he has shown no evidence that his seizures had even a temporary effect of lowering his iq.he might have argued that grogginess from his medications and seizures exacerbated the effect of his mental retardation,but the alj explicitly rejected lewis claim of grogginess.likewise,lewis has pointed to no evidence that his mental retardation exacerbated his seizure disorder.nothing in the regulations,moreover,says a claimant may circumvent the compliance requirement of the epilepsy listings by equaling rather than meeting the listing.the alj did not err in concluding that lewis conditions did not equal a listed impairment.
lewis also argues that the alj erred when,after having commented that he had not ruled out the possibility that lewis impairments met or equaled a listed impairment,he did not seek additional medical evidence.the authorities cited by lewis are not on point.in smolen chater,cir,an alj erred by rejecting a physician opinions for lack of foundation instead of further developing the record so that he could properly evaluate the opinions.here,the alj did not indicate that he found the record insufficient to properly evaluate the evidence.
