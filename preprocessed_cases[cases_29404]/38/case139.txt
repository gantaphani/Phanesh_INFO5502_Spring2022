community health center,chc provides medical services to the needy pursuant to the federal medicaid statute.chc is reimbursed for its efforts according to a formula established by the state of connecticut and superintended by the federal centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.connecticut formula demands that,in the absence of a waiver,each facility of chc variety must conduct at least patient visits per physician per year,and reduces payments to any facility that fails to meet this threshold.chc had fewer than visits per physician in both and.it therefore brought suit in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,seeking an injunction barring connecticut use of the standard as incompatible with governing federal law.the district court janet bond arterton,concluded that,in order to be consistent with the applicable medicaid statute,bb any state medicaid payment formula must mirror an existing federal payment formula under the medicare program,see.since it also concluded that the medicare regulation providing for the visit minimum was invalid,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of chc.for the reasons stated below,we reverse the judgment of the district court,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
a.the medicaid statute 
the united states subsidizes health care for persons other than its own employees principally through a pair of vast programs,medicare and medicaid.medicare is generally designed to provide health insurance coverage to the elderly and disabled,see,and is administered,for the most part,by intermediaries,who must apply a uniform set of standards established by federal law,see.medicaid,on the other hand,is designed to partially compensate states for the costs of providing health care to needy persons of modest income.see.dep t of health family servs.blumer,d wilder.hosp.ass n,d harris mcrae,d.although constrained by federal requirements and ongoing cms oversight,states generally have some measure of discretion in choosing how to expend medicaid funds.see schweiker gray panthers,d.indeed,states have the option of opting out of the medicaid program entirely.see schweiker hogan,d.
states electing to participate in medicaid must submit a plan detailing how the state will expend its funds.see.the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs reviews each plan to assure that it complies with a long list of federal statutory and regulatory requirements.see a.the secretary has delegated his power to review and approve plans to cms regional administrators.id.b.each state plan must include,among its numerous details,a provision for payments to health centers,or fqhcs.bb more specifically,the state plan must provide that it will pay for covered services provided at an fqhc 
in an amount calculated on a per visit basis that is equal to percent of the average of the costs of the center or clinic of furnishing such services during fiscal years and which are reasonable and related to the cost of furnishing such services,or based on such other tests of reasonableness as the secretary prescribes in regulations under a.
connecticut state plan 
in,connecticut enacted legislation providing that,in the determination of rates for federally qualified health centers,the commissioner of social services of connecticut shall apply medicare productivity standards.a productivity standard,sometimes also known as a productivity screen,imposes a requirement on affected providers.that is,if a health care provider does not meet or exceed the minimum number of patient visits per year,its reimbursement is reduced in proportion to the amount by which the provider fell short of the minimum in short,connecticut reduces medicaid payments to unproductive fqhcs to the same extent that cms would reduce its medicare payments to those providers.
medicare productivity screens are authorized by,but not defined in,formally promulgated hhs regulations.the medicare statute provides for payment of the reasonable cost of services rendered,b,and directs the secretary to define reasonable in regulations,see v a.the secretary regulations,in turn,delegate to cms the power to establish tests of reasonableness,includ ing screening guidelines.c.when the health care financing administration hcfa,the predecessor to cms and hhs issued in,a preamble to the rule noted that hcfa planned to use a productivity screen of per physician.see medicare program payment for federally qualified health center services,june.
although the number does not appear in the cfr,cms uses that figure as a productivity screen for fqhcs.see centers for medicare medicaid services,rural health clinic and federally qualified health center manual.consistent with the regulation,cms permits waiver of the productivity screen requirements where a provider has demonstrated reasonable justification for not meeting the standard.see d.
connecticut law,therefore,incorporated both the productivity screen and the relevant waiver provision beginning in when the state enacted connecticut department of social services cdss has applied the productivity screen since that time,although the record does not clearly indicate whether cdss also made waivers available.connecticut did not amend its state regulations to reflect these changes until.see.agencies regs.cms approved the corresponding connecticut state plan amendments on june,
parties and procedural history 
the plaintiff,chc,is an fqhc operating in the state of connecticut.in both and,chc just missed meeting connecticut productivity screen,recording visits per physician in and visits per physician in because the present medicaid statute makes future rates dependent upon a provider reasonable and related costs for and,bb,chc shortfalls in that period will result in a reduction in the amount of money it receives in the future for each visit,from to.chc alleges that this reduction will cost it approximately per year.
on january,chc filed suit,in the united states district court for the district of connecticut,pursuant to,challenging cdss productivity screen as inconsistent with federal law.chc amended its complaint on may.the amended complaint names as the sole defendant patricia,the cdss commissioner,who is sued only in her official capacity.
chc and subsequently each moved for summary judgment.in a thoughtful opinion,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of chc on november.see cmty.health,d.the district court first determined that the medicaid statutory phrase,reasonable and related to the cost of furnishing such services,or based on such other tests of reasonableness as the secretary prescribes in regulations under medicare,can only be read to mean that any state method for determining costs that are reasonable and related must mirror existing federal medicare regulations.id.at quoting bb.the court next concluded that its search for underlying federal regulations must be limited to regulations.id.at.it therefore went on to consider whether the productivity screen contained in cms rural health clinic and federally qualified health center manual was validly promulgated.id.at.the district court concluded,ultimately,that the federal productivity screen was invalid,and therefore that connecticut identical screen was contrary to federal law.id.at.
this appeal followed.the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,a.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
discussion 
this case begins and,for our purposes,ends,with the meaning of the federal medicaid statute.again,the district court held that any reasonable understanding of the phrase,percent of the costs which are reasonable and related to the cost of furnishing medicaid services,or based on such other tests of reasonableness as the secretary prescribes in regulations under medicare,bb,limits the meaning of reasonable and related to whatever definition the secretary has validly prescribed under medicare.although the statute may not be a masterpiece of draftsmanship,we think that when read in context,and with due regard for the expert opinion of the administering agency,it may offer rather more flexibility than the district court found 
to begin with,it is
