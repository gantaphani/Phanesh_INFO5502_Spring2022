individual defendant mahendra pratap gupta,a private health care consultant,appeals from a criminal conviction for conspiracy to submit false claims to the united states,and two convictions for mail fraud.several corporate defendants operating as home health care agencies,cardinal care,marshal medical services,atlantic health care services,west coast healthcare services,treasure coast health care services,collectively the health care agencies will be referred to as corporate defendants,and defendants when including gupta,also directly appeal their convictions for conspiracy to submit false cost reports to medicare.allegheny management company,a health care consulting company,was also convicted but did not appeal.
the district court sentenced gupta to three years probation on each conviction to run concurrently and fined him.it sentenced marshal medical,cardinal care,west coast,treasure coast,and atlantic health to three years probation.it also fined marshal medical and cardinal care each but did not fine the remaining defendants because they were no longer in business.the imposed sentences also resulted in all defendants exclusion from medicare programs for a period of five years.the united states the validity of the sentences.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm all convictions.however,we vacate and remand for with respect to gupta,marshal medical,and cardinal care because the court clearly erred in its application of united states sentencing guidelines ussg a and b.
regulatory scheme 
the medicare program is a federal health insurance program for persons years old and older and for certain disabled persons.under the medicare program,a home health agency may seek reimbursement for necessary reasonable costs related to patient care.such reimbursement is administered through fiscal insurance companies such as blue cross and blue contract to manage the medicare program.fiscal intermediaries review bills and make payments.the providers,at the end of the year,file cost reports seeking settlement of all annual costs.
under the medicare regulations,if a provider receives services from a related organization,its reimbursement is limited to the supplier cost rather than the amount paid by the provider.provides 
a principle c osts applicable to services,facilities,and supplies furnished to the provider by organizations related to the provider by common ownership or control are includable in the allowable cost of the provider at the cost to the related organization 
b definitions 
related to the provider.related to the provider means that the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the organization furnishing the services,facilities,or supplies.
common ownership.common ownership exists if an individual or individuals possess significant ownership or equity in the provider and the institution or organization serving the provider.
control.control exists if an individual or an organization has the power,directly or indirectly,significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.
the provider reimbursement manual,published by the health care financing hcfa,explains the purpose of the related party regulation to avoid the payment of a profit factor to the provider through the related organization whether related by common ownership or control,and to avoid payment of artificially inflated costs which may be generated from less than arm length bargaining.provider reimbursement manual.
at year end,health care agencies would submit reimbursement forms in which they answered question.of hcfa form,the provider cost report reimbursement questionnaire,requiring the disclosure of goods or services purchased from a related party.that form states 
the provider,members of the board of directors,officers,medical staff or management personnel are associated with or involved business transactions with the following related organizations,management contracts and services under arrangements as owners stockholders,management,by family relationship,or any other similar type relationship 
this form is submitted to the fiscal intermediary with each cost report.in section of each cost report,the home health agencies were asked,are there any costs included on worksheet a which resulted from transactions with related organizations as defined in hcfa pub,chapter in addition,during routine audits of health care agencies,auditors inquired if there were any related party transactions as defined by medicare regulations.
the parties 
all the corporate defendants except allegheny were home health agencies,or providers of care to homebound medicare beneficiaries.allegheny operated as a health care management consulting firm,owned by edward quinlan,and provided business management consulting to the home health bills,payroll,and medicare cost reports,and supplying accounting,computer and clerical services.
procedural posture 
this case began in september when a federal grand jury in montana returned a indictment against defendants gupta,three other natural persons,allegheny,and ten other companies involved in providing home healthcare services and supplies.in essence,the indictment charged the named defendants with having created a scheme to defraud medicare based upon violations of the related party regulation by use of false claims,straw owners,and other deceptive actions to conceal the close relationship between the various persons.see.
in,the case was transferred to the southern district of florida pursuant to rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.the district court then severed the trial of four from the trial of gupta and the six companies.after the district court dismissed thirteen counts of the indictment,the case proceeded to trial on october,against the remaining,quinlan,and kuldeep hajela,and the remaining six companies,allegheny,cardinal,marshal,atlantic,west coast,and treasure the three remaining counts conspiracy to submit false claims,and two counts of mail fraud.
at the close of the government case,the district court granted defendant hajela motion for a judgment of acquittal and reserved ruling pursuant to rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure on the motions of the remaining eight defendants.on november,the jury acquitted quinlan,but convicted gupta and the six companies,finding them guilty as charged.
finally,on october,the district court granted the rule and motions to reconsider its previous denial of their original motions for acquittal or for a new trial.it granted acquittals for allegheny,gupta,marshal medical,cardinal care,atlantic healthcare,treasure coast healthcare,and west coast healthcare or,in the alternative,granted a new trial.
the government appealed,arguing first that the district court had no jurisdiction to entertain the motions for a judgment of acquittal or for a new trial because of the time limits contained in rules and,and that,in any event,the court erroneously granted the motions on the merits.we vacated the orders as untimely and remanded for sentencing.see united states gupta,cir.
the government case 
the government alleged that gupta created allegheny for the purpose of collecting an additional layer of reimbursable costs from the medicare program that increases his home health agencies reimbursable costs closer to medicare cost caps.subject to the cost caps,medicare reimburses each home health agency for the costs necessary for the treatment of medicare beneficiaries.as long as the consultant is not related to the agency by ownership or control,and as long as the agency acts as a prudent consumer in hiring the consultant,medicare will reimburse the agency for the amount of its consulting contract.see.conversely,related party contracts are not negotiated at arm length and are treated as if the health provider is dealing with itself.
the government alleged that gupta realized that he could make more money from medicare if he could charge his home health agencies with consulting fees.with quinlan help,gupta set up allegheny to provide management services to help run the corporate defendants as home health care agencies.under the plan,quinlan would act as the figurehead owner of allegheny in order to increase the amount billable to medicare.allegheny only employees came from one of the corporate defendants 
the government focused on the activities occurring in montana to demonstrate the relationship between gupta,the corporate defendants,and allegheny.in,gupta purchased another home health agency,independent home health care ihhc,a home health care agency,and arranged partly through funds obtained from corporate defendants,for allegheny to effectively become a majority owner of ihhc.in addition,a,private pay home health agency,independent home services ihs,was sold in the same transaction.
in,gupta traveled to montana to purchase ihhc and ihs.the total purchase price was,with allocated for the price of ihhc and for the purchase of ihs.on june,gupta wired from florida to complete the payment of the purchase of ihs.ihs was purchased in gupta father name,chandra shekhar.gupta also arranged for his brother,vijay gupta,to wire to cover part of the purchase price for ihhc.one day after wiring the to montana,vijay gupta received a check from mahendra gupta wife.all compensation recited in the sales contracts for the ihhc and ihs came either directly,or indirectly,from gupta or the corporate defendants.
gupta still owed on the purchase price of ihhc.he negotiated to hire two of the sellers of ihhc,william anderson and matthew komac,to work for allegheny.the contracts were guaranteed for each for the remainder of.the contracts specified some duties but required little more than their being available.the employment contracts had no connection to the sales contracts even though they satisfied of the purchase price for ihhc.
one week after the purchase,allegheny was hired as ihhc management consultant,charging between and per hour for services that were reimbursed by medicare.the sellers described that they also required further assurances for payment of the.allegheny guaranteed the fulfillment of the employment contracts with an escrow of.however,at the time the escrow was created,allegheny did not have.gupta and corporate defendants loaned allegheny the necessary,which was used to purchase two certificates of deposit to fund the escrow.therefore,allegheny guaranteed the purchase price of one of its future clients with money borrowed from gupta.
on paper,a newly formed montana corporation,capital city health services,held all of the ihhc stock.it was owned by gupta friend,alok mittal,who had entrusted only for gupta to invest.mittal actions were consistent with those of a minority investor,because he left operations of capital city entirely to gupta.he expressed that he had no idea that allegheny purchased most of ihhc and that he did not know anything about allegheny.over the years,gupta and allegheny billed ihhc for more than million in consulting fees.
ihhc requested interim rate payments and established cash flow from medicare.at the end of the fiscal year,ihhc reported to medicare that it had no related party contracts to reveal.when the fiscal intermediary followed with a cost report audit,it asked ihhc if it shared any common relationship with its consultants.consistent with its cost reports,ihhc denied any related party relationship.
in,a friend of gupta brother,vyas,invested for of capital city stock and replaced jean komac as ihhc administrator.like mittal,vyas had no apparent knowledge that he was only a figurehead.gupta told vyas and mittal that he wanted to renew the consulting contract with allegheny,and it was renewed.mittal did not know anything about the hiring of consultants,but assented with vyas.
gupta ran ihhc and directed it to retain allegheny as a consultant.in essence,allegheny and gupta owned ihhc.a week after the purchase,allegheny became ihhc management consultant,charging between and per hour for services reimbursable by medicare.gupta also became a consultant to ihhc.vyas stated that he stayed at ihhc for a short time but wanted to leave.he expressed that he only signed paperwork to appease gupta and get his initial investment back.
in,gupta arranged for the sale of ihhc to peter hospital in montana and deposited much of the proceeds from the sale to an allegheny account.vyas flew to helena,montana and attended the closing for to minutes and signed the necessary paperwork.mittal stated that he did not know about the sale until after it occurred.peter hospital paid for ihhc and ihs.the for ihhc was deposited into an account held by allegheny.the remaining was deposited to the account of the owner of ihs,chandra shekhar,gupta father.numerous witnesses testified that allegheny was controlled by gupta.witnesses described quinlan,the owner of allegheny stock,as an occasional visitor to allegheny.
from to,medicare reimbursed corporate defendants and ihhc more than million in allegheny fees.allegheny client agencies were all associated with gupta or his brother vijay gupta.witnesses established that gupta ran marshal medical,cardinal care,atlantic health,west coast health,and treasure coast health.the owner of marshal medical and atlantic health was a man named dev raj.the owner of west coast health and cardinal care was a woman named shanno devi.immigration files showed that raj and devi are actually and goyal,the of mahendra gupta brother,vijay gupta.there is evidence that raj and devi were straw owners who supported gupta in exchange for immigration assistance.the owner of treasure coast was a pakistani doctor named punwani,who was also a medical records file clerk for cardinal care,where she was hired upon gupta request.
between and,corporate defendants claimed reimbursement for gupta and allegheny consulting fees at the end of each fiscal year,each corporate defendant submitted hcfa form indicating that there were no transactions with its consultants to report.in addition,each cost report included a worksheet that asked the question mentioned supra.if the health care agency answered yes,it was required to explain in detail the contractual relationship.during audits by the financial intermediary,blue cross and blue shield of iowa,an auditor asked,is the owner of independent in any way related to allegheny ihhc responded that there was no relationship between the owners of ihhc and allegheny.one estimate calculated by kpmg approximated that the fees were million in excess of what medicare would have paid had it known the true relationship of the parties.
conviction 
the corporate defendants and gupta present three arguments challenging their convictions does not legally support a conspiracy conviction under because the regulation is essentially unclear the evidence was insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction under and gupta mail fraud convictions are not supported by sufficient evidence.
a.the related party regulation,and ownership and control 
defendants argue that as a matter of law they can not be held liable for conspiracy to submit false claims to the government on the basis that gupta controlled allegheny and corporate defendants under the related party regulation.defendants rely upon united states whiteside,cir,for the proposition that where the truth or falsity of a statement centers on an interpretive question of law the government must prove the statements were knowingly and willfully false as well as proving that the statement was untrue beyond a reasonable doubt under any reasonable interpretation of the law.id.defendants also assert that the only allegedly false statement stems from question.of hcfa form.on that form,the home health agencies each certified that they did not receive services from a related party by checking no instead of yes and submitting such forms between and.in addition,they contend that the question from hcfa form does not define control and that gupta behavior is properly characterized as a controlling personality or client.
we review questions of law de novo.united states mcdaniel,cir.conspiring to submit false claims to a government agency is prohibited.under medicare regulations related party transactions are not prohibited however,a provider can only be reimbursed for the actual cost incurred by the related entity.thus,actual cost must not exceed the price for which comparable services,products,or facilities could be purchased elsewhere.united states ex rel.reagan.med.ctr.reg l healthcare,cir.under the related party provision,related to the provider is defined as the provider to a significant extent is associated or affiliated with or has control of or is controlled by the organization furnishing the services,facilities or supplies.b.
the indictment alleged both ownership and control theories.there is little evidence of gupta overt ownership of the corporate defendants or allegheny.he was not a stockholder,owner,officer,director,employee,or member of allegheny management structure because quinlan was listed as the owner,president,and sole stockholder of allegheny.the government concedes that on paper the defendants and allegheny were owned by persons other than gupta.
nonetheless,control exists if an individual or an organization has the power,directly or indirectly,significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of an organization or institution.control is generally viewed as a broad encompassing term.the term control includes any kind of control,whether or not it is legally enforceable and however it is exercisable or exercised.it is the reality of the control which is decisive,not its form or the mode of its exercise.kidney ctr.shalala,citing dep t of health human services,medicare provider reimbursement manual,part i,reprinted in medicare medicaid guide cch p.section provides that both direct and indirect abilities to influence significantly the provider at the time of the transaction establishes control.sid peterson mem.hosp.thompson,cir.
while we have little case law on ownership or control under the related party regulation,the case of sid peterson provides some guidance.id.in sid peterson,the fifth circuit upheld the secretary of health and human services interpretation of control under the related party regulation in the context of a dispute for reimbursement under medicare.formal control was not required.sufficient evidence of ability to influence significantly the other in the bargaining process so that it could dictate the terms of the ultimate agreement satisfied the control requirement.id.the court held 
the regulations,therefore,contemplate a inquiry into the relationship of the parties,logically concluding that direct control over a provider during the bargaining process could result in the continued manifestation of that control in the final agreement.in order to make the determination that the transaction is a product of a bargaining process tainted by one party ability to control the other,the secretary should consider the entire body of facts and circumstances involved.dep t of health and human services,medicare prm,part i.
id.the secretary has concluded that and permit consideration of the relationship between the parties during the entire process of negotiation leading up to a transaction in determining whether the parties were related through control at the time of the transaction.id.at.
in fact,courts have had little trouble discerning when organizations are related,illustrating that interpreting that term is well within the competence of the judiciary.see,thomas jefferson shalala,d sid peterson,at monongahela valley,sullivan,cir.juries have convicted individuals in analogous factual settings,illustrating the term is also not beyond their interpretive abilities.see,united states alemany rivera,cir.
moreover,medicare regulations eliminate the potential for ambiguity by providing definitions for a related organization.see b.related to the provider,common ownership,and control are likewise defined.see id.b see also alpharma pennfield oil,cir stating that the meaning of agency publications in the federal register and code of federal regulations is well within the conventional experience of judges.medicare regulations even provide examples of organizations that would be related.see c.
with the understanding that the concepts of related party and control are clearly defined by medicare,we examine the defendants claims under whiteside,at.in a case where the truth or falsity of a statement centers on an interpretive question of law,the government bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant statement is not true under a reasonable interpretation of the law.accord united states parker,cir.
in whiteside,we held that the government could not meet its burden of proof to support a conviction for making a false statement in medicare cost reports and for conspiracy to defraud the government by making false statements under and where no medicare regulation,administrative ruling,or judicial decision exists that clearly requires interest expense to be reported in accordance with the original use of the loan.at citation omitted.the specific regulation at issue governed the amount of interest to attribute to capital improvements in cost reports submitted to medicare under b.if the interest was capital related,the reimbursements would have been greater.
in whiteside,we reversed on the basis that the government could not prove the actus reus of the offenses,concluding that the defendants interpretation that the medicare regulations authorized the treatment of debt interest as was not unreasonable,even if the funds underlying the debt were initially used for purposes.moreover,no authority answered the question posed and so reasonable people could differ as to whether the debt interest was.id.competing interpretations of the applicable law are far too reasonable to justify these convictions.
whiteside differs from this case in several significant ways.first,the related party rule is well defined and there is case law discussing its application.although control is broadly defined,it is not ambiguous the management company and the health care provider may not be on the same side of the transaction.see alemany rivera,at.second,the holding in whiteside dealt with a far more debatable application of a regulation for categorization of debt under b.here,we are dealing with the concept of control over organizations.the purpose of the related party rule is not susceptible to any other interpretation.moreover,gupta interpretation that the related party regulation should not apply to an arguably overbearing client does not accord with any reasonable interpretation as set forth in whiteside.there is no reasonable interpretation of that would allow him to be on both sides of a transaction.furthermore,his claim that he was an arguably overbearing client is not an interpretation of a regulation it is a factual claim that goes to the sufficiency of the evidence.
the regulatory context demonstrates that there are no reasonable interpretations of the related party rule that render the cost reports factually accurate.the cost reports require that the provider answer the question previously discussed that refers to chapter.chapter effectively reiterates the related party regulation.the cost reports did not identify that services had been provided by related parties when corporate defendant home health agencies submitted them for payment.
moreover,gupta could not have misunderstood form and its reporting requirements under medicare regulations and the related party rule.gupta accountant,frank blohm,testified that gupta was aware of the conduct prohibited by the related party regulation.a knowing and intentional violation of the related party regulations can support a finding of criminal intent for conspiracy to submit false claims to medicare.form cost report questionnaires should not be considered outside of the regulatory context to prevent inflated reimbursement requests.gupta can not argue otherwise by his own acknowledgment that he understood the related party transaction rules.
we hold that failing to accurately report to medicare that a related party is providing management consulting services is actionable as a false statement under because the related party has the ability to influence significantly the other in the bargaining process so that it could dictate the terms of the ultimate agreement.see alemany rivera,at.
sufficiency of the evidence.
we review for sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether gupta controlled the corporate defendants under the related party rule and conspired to submit false cost reports to medicare.sufficiency of the evidence is a question of law that we review de novo.united states massey,cir,cert.denied,d.the relevant question for a reviewing court,in judging the sufficiency of the evidence,is whether,after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution,any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.jackson virginia,d.we resolve all reasonable inferences and credibility evaluations in favor of the jury verdict we will uphold the jury verdict if a reasonable fact finder could conclude that the evidence establishes the defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.united states starke,cir.
defendants argue that the conspiracy conviction should be reversed because an agreement to submit false claims was not proven beyond a reasonable doubt.they posit that there was no agreement between quinlan and gupta or anyone else to defraud medicare.in support,the defendants highlight that no money can be traced from allegheny to gupta or any of the other defendants.
this court will sustain a conviction for conspiracy to submit false claims to the united states if the government proved the existence of an agreement to achieve an unlawful objective,the defendant knowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy,and the commission of an overt act in furtherance of it.united states suba,cir citing united states kammer,cir.conspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence and the extent of participation in the conspiracy or extent of knowledge of details in the conspiracy does not matter if the proof shows the defendant knew the essential objective of the conspiracy.suba,at a common purpose or plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.any differences between allegations and proof is reversible only when the defendant is actually prejudiced.id.at.
under these legal principles,the evidence proved an overarching conspiracy to submit false claims to medicare concealing gupta controlling relationship between allegheny and corporate defendants.a reasonable juror could justifiably find,beyond a reasonable doubt,that the conspiracy to submit false documents by corporate defendants,gupta,and allegheny,alleged in the indictment,was the conspiracy proven.
first,the evidence is sufficient to permit a reasonable juror to determine that gupta controlled allegheny under the related party regulation.the evidence established that gupta created allegheny managed the affairs from his office in allegheny directed the work of its employees had an employee of allegheny as his secretary hired an independent contractor and other employees to work for allegheny discussed hiring and firing an allegheny employee and obligated allegheny to pay ihhc through two employment contracts.moreover,there was evidence that no one would move at allegheny without gupta permission.
second,the proof showed a connection with and control over the corporate defendants.gupta hired the administrator for ihhc and hired allegheny and himself as consultants.gupta spoke of owning treasure coast and ihhc,he created west coast health care,and he was in charge of cardinal care.he used of his brother as a front for several of corporate defendant home health agencies in exchange for help with immigration matters.
third,as to conspiracy,defendants contend that there was no express agreement between quinlan,employees of the corporate defendants,and gupta,and no circumstantial evidence from which a conspiracy could be inferred.the evidence is sufficient to establish through gupta,the corporate defendants,and allegheny dealings with ihhc in montana,that a conspiracy existed between corporate defendants,allegheny,and gupta to conceal their relationship in order to submit inflated cost reports and receive medicare reimbursement for consultation services the costs of which were not bargained for at arm length.
gupta and the corporate defendants took extraordinary steps to conceal the relationship with the financial intermediary.they used dummy employment contracts,false and misleading corporate minutes,straw owners,forged contracts,backdated correspondence,and false invoices that were cosmetically altered to make them look older.the evidence was sufficient to prove that gupta controlled both corporate defendants and allegheny and conspired to submit false cost reports concealing their true relationship.see united states ndiaye,cir evidence of conspiracy does not have to be overwhelming.the government has proven gupta and the corporate defendants awareness of the essential nature of the conspiracy and sufficient circumstantial evidence.see united states lluesma,cir.
mail fraud,
gupta generically appeals his mail fraud convictions,categorized as counts ii and iii in the indictment,but provides no argument or legal support.we may decline to address an argument where a party fails to provide arguments on the merits of an issue in its initial or reply brief.without such argument the issue is deemed waived.see greenbriar,city of alabaster,cir deeming issue waived where party fails to include substantive argument and only makes passing reference to the order appealed from.accordingly,we hold that the evidence was sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to conclude that gupta conspired to submit false claims to the government.the scheme involved two mailed checks.the jury could reasonably infer gupta guilty knowledge and participation in the scheme to submit false claims to medicare from the whole of the evidence presented and strong circumstantial evidence that the checks were mailed.there was sufficient evidence to support gupta convictions on these counts.
ii.government sentencing 
the district court held its first sentencing hearing in but did not impose sentence.during that time,the government introduced a sentencing memorandum.it included the expert report of gary young calculating a loss to medicare of million,which is determined by summing the amounts by which the health care consulting fees charged by gupta and allegheny to each of the corporate defendants and ihhc exceeded the costs for the services the profit to allegheny from the corporate defendants and ihhc.in october,the district court granted a judgment of acquittal but we found that the motion was untimely and remanded to the district court with instructions to impose sentence.gupta,at.the government filed a second sentencing memorandum that included expert reports from jeff litvack and shirill garvey.both expert reports calculated the amount of loss to medicare for guidelines purposes.garvey report supported kpmg calculation of loss as the profits to allegheny that resulted from billing the corporate defendants and ihhc for management fees at amounts in excess of its cost.the litvak report calculated the amount of loss as allegheny net profits from the corporate defendants and ihhc.litvak reasoned that the costs of services furnished to a provider by a related party were includable in the allowable costs of the provider at the cost to the related organization.thus,neither corporate defendants nor ihhc was entitled to be reimbursed by medicare for amounts that exceeded allegheny cost to provide management services to them.litvak calculated losses of million.the government also referenced the yong report from its first sentencing memorandum and filed a supplemental sentencing memorandum to remind the court of its prior findings.
the district court sentenced gupta and the corporate defendants on november.during the sentencing hearing,gupta and corporate defendants objected to a increase under ussg b o contending that the amount of loss was calculated incorrectly.the district court sustained the objection and found that the government incurred no loss.gupta and corporate defendants also objected to the increase under b a,contending that the offense did not involve more than minimal planning.the d
