overview of application for social security disability insurance benefits 
to assist in understanding the fee structure for representing a social security claimant,we provide a brief overview of the application process for disability insurance benefits.see.a social security claimant must first petition the commissioner of social security for benefits.upon review of the claim,the agency issues an initial determination.a claimant who is dissatisfied with the initial determination may request further review by a federal reviewing official.if the claimant is still dissatisfied,she may request a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the decision of the alj is the final decision of the commissioner unless the claim is referred to the decision review board or appeals counsel.see also.a final decision may be reviewed in federal district court.should the district court remand the case to the agency for further review,the appeals council will either issue a decision or remand the case to an alj with instructions.see.during this process,the claimant may be represented by counsel who often charge a fee for representation.
ii.fees for representation 
congress prescribed specific limitations on the amount of fees which may be awarded for representation of social security claims.see.section deals with the administrative and judicial review stages discretely a governs fees for representation in administrative proceedings b controls fees for representation in court.gisbrecht barnhart,d.
administrative proceedings a 
a claimant may be represented during administrative proceedings by an approved representative or attorney.see a.in many instances,when a claimant is successfully represented by an attorney before the agency,the attorney submits a fee petition to the commissioner of social security.the commissioner fixes a reasonable fee in accordance with its regulations to compensate the attorney for services performed in connection with the claim.id.fee petitions may be authorized even if the claimant was unsuccessful.see b.
as an alternative to fee petitions,congress amended a in to include agreements for representation before the commissioner when asserting an entitlement to benefits.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat.codified as amended at a.the nature of these agreements makes the award of a fee contingent on the claimant being successful and are the most common fee arrangement between attorneys and social security claimants.gisbrecht,at.the agreement must be submitted to the commissioner for approval in advance of a ruling.see a a.as long as the fee does not exceed the lesser of of past due benefits or and the claimant is successful,the commissioner will approve the agreement at the time of the favorable determination.id.the amount approved is the maximum fee the representative or attorney may collect for such representation.see a a and a.
court representation b 
fees for court representation often arise when the claimant appeals from an adverse decision by the agency.under b,whenever a court finds in favor of a claimant who was represented by an attorney,it may determine a reasonable fee for court representation,not in excess of of the benefits awarded by reason of the judgment.b a.section b also allows a district court to award attorneys fees in conjunction with a remand for further proceedings it is not required,as a predicate to a b fee award,that the district court remand for an award of benefits.mcgraw barnhart,cir.the only requirement is the claimant eventually be awarded benefits,whether at the agency level or during further judicial proceedings.id.no other fee may be withheld or paid for court representation except as determined by the court.b a and b.
in order to protect an attorney from at the agency court level,the commissioner may withhold up to of the benefits awarded to pay directly to the attorney.see a and b a.if the amount withheld by the commissioner is insufficient to satisfy the amount of fees determined reasonable by the court,the attorney must look to the claimant,not the benefits,to recover the difference.at that point the attorney stands on the same level as other judgment creditors in attempting to collect.see generally tom first am.credit union,cir congress chose to protect social security beneficiaries from creditors who utilized the judicial system and creditors who devised their own methods of collecting debts a disability insurance benefits are not transferable or assignable nor are they subject to execution,levy,attachment,garnishment or other legal process.
apart from fees which may be awarded to an attorney for court representation,a claimant may seek to defray the cost of appealing from an agency decision to a court under the equal access to justice act eaja fee shifting statute.see.eaja fees are assessed against the united states when its actions were not substantially justified.see d a.in the social security context,eaja fees are awarded to the prevailing party in addition to and separate from fees awarded for representation before the court under b a.see frazier apfel,cir mcgraw,at a n eaja award is to the claimant,while counsel receives the b award.if both are awarded,attorneys are required to refund the lesser of the eaja or b fees to the client,they can not keep both.see mcgraw,at.in many cases eaja fees effectively increase the portion of benefits the successful social security claimant may pocket.gisbrecht,at.thus,an eaja award offsets an award under section b,so that the amount of the total benefits the claimant actually receives will be increased by the eaja award up to the point the claimant receives percent of the benefits.id.
