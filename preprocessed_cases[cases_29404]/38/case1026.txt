dennis cowan appeals the decision of the district court affirming the denial by an administrative law judge alj of his application for social security disability insurance benefits.we determine the decision of the alj was supported by substantial evidence and the law was properly applied.therefore,exercising our jurisdiction under and g,we affirm.
cowan was born in,has a high school education,and has relevant past work experience as an electrician helper.he alleges disability beginning september,due to status attack cva,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,and a severe mental impairment of depression or anxiety resulting from his cva.cowan initial application for disability insurance benefits and the accompanying disability report did not claim a mental impairment and was denied on february.the denial stated that cowan was claiming disability due to stroke,heart attacks,emphysema and asthma,tab at.cowan requested reconsideration,and his application was reconsidered and again denied on may.the denial following reconsideration reflected that cowan was at that point claiming disability due to stroke,heart attacks,emphysema,asthma,and depression.id.at emphasis added.cowan requested a hearing before an alj.
following the february,hearing,the alj found that cowan cva and copd qualified as severe impairments at step two of the sequential evaluation process.see lax astrue,cir describing process.the alj found that cowan did not have a severe mental impairment.at step three,the alj found that cowan impairments did not meet or medically equal one of the listed impairments in pt,subpt.p,app.the alj found that cowan had the residual functional capacity rfc to perform light work.as to limitations,the alj found that cowan could only occasionally climb,balance,stoop,kneel,crouch,and crawl.the alj also found that cowan should avoid concentrated exposure to dusts,fumes,odors,gases,tab at bolding omitted.based upon this rfc,the alj found at step four that cowan could not perform his past relevant work as an electrician helper.nevertheless,the alj found that cowan was not disabled because jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy that he could do,given his rfc,age,education,and work experience.
the appeals council denied cowan subsequent request for review,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.jensen barnhart,cir.the district court affirmed the commissioner denial of benefits,and cowan filed his notice of appeal to this court.on appeal,cowan raises three main points that the alj erred by failing to find that cowan suffered from a severe mental impairment,that the alj erred by formulating an rfc determination that failed to include all of cowan limitations,and that the alj failed to conduct a proper credibility determination.we shall address these points in order.
first we examine the applicable legal framework.
we review the commissioner decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.it requires more than a scintilla,but less than a preponderance.we consider whether the alj followed the specific rules of law that must be followed in weighing particular types of evidence in disability cases,but we will not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the commissioner.
the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency findings from being supported by substantial evidence.we may not displace the agency choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.

in this context,disability requires both an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity and a physical or mental impairment,which provides reason for the inability.the impairment must be a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.

cowan argues in his first point of error that the alj erred in failing to find that he had a severe mental impairment at step two.the alj found 
the evidence does not support the claimant has a severe mental impairment.he alleges residuals due to a cva.there is no evidence of decreased memory or concentration.the claimant has a slight slurring of words as noted during a consultative exam.although he reported special education classes in school,he actually described remedial classes in reading,arithmetic,and spelling and worked as an electrician until his cva.he complained of feeling sad,tearful and not sleeping well.he was prescribed lexapro for anxiety and depression by his treating physician,michael gietzen.a mental status form completed by gietzen reported no limitations due to a mental impairment.
tab at.the alj,consistent with a psychiatric review technique prt form in the record,went on to find that cowan had mild restriction of activities of daily living,mild difficulties in maintaining social functioning,mild difficulties in maintaining concentration or pace,and no episodes of decompensation,and that his activities of daily living are restricted due to his physical problems rather than a mental condition.id.at.
cowan argument as to his first point essentially has two subpoints that the alj erred in not presenting sufficient analysis for review in finding that he had not met his burden of showing that he had a severe mental impairment,see bowen yuckert,d holding that the claimant has the burden of showing at step two that he has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments and that even if he had not presented sufficient evidence to show a medically severe mental impairment,the alj violated her duty to properly develop the administrative record to obtain such evidence.
in his first subpoint,cowan argues that the alj failed to provide reasoning sufficient to enable meaningful review of her determination regarding cowan mental impairment.we disagree.
as we have often said,while the showing a claimant must make at step two is de minimis,a showing of the mere presence of a condition is not sufficient.williamson barnhart,cir.here,the alj concluded that cowan did not meet his burden,setting forth the evidence from the record relevant to cowan depression.
the decision referenced the october,mental status examination performed by mike gietzen.the examination form records no abnormalities,and gietzen treatment notes reflect that it was a normal mental status exam,stating that the doctor filled the form out for him for ssi disability purposes,tab at.
as pointed out by cowan,approximately six months later,gietzen treatment note for april,reads 
the patient is here to evaluate with his wife.he states he is not sleeping well.he is depressed.he is in the process of filing for disability.he does not feel well.he feels sad.he is tearful.he is not suicidal or homicidal.he has not been on any antidepressive medications in the past.we discussed the benefits and alternatives of medication for depression.at this point,he would like to start something.
id.at.gietzen prescribed an for cowan with instructions to gietzen in three to four weeks for reevaluation of his condition.the alj specifically referenced this record as well.
the alj decision also specifically referenced that she had reviewed exhibits,and of the administrative record which contained the assessments of the state agency medical consultants and that she generally concurred with those assessments.
her step two determination regarding cowan mental limitation bears this out in that it tracks some of the findings of exhibit,a prt form completed by a consultant on may,four days prior to the denial of cowan application upon reconsideration.this prt form considered the medically determinable mental impairments of depress
