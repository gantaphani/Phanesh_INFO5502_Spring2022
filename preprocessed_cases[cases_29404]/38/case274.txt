the secretary of health and human services denied district memorial hospital of southwestern north carolina,a special reimbursement that is available under the medicare program to hospitals providing inpatient acute care to a significantly disproportionate number of patients.this special reimbursement is known as the disproportionate share adjustment.because district memorial hospital used its beds to provide both acute care and nursing care,when determining whether the hospital qualified for the adjustment,the secretary applied regulation to exclude from the eligibility calculation these as swing beds whenever they were used to provide nursing care.
the district court,reviewing the secretary determination on for summary judgment,found that the secretary misconstrued and misapplied regulation.the court concluded that the regulation is clear and admits of only one meaning the meaning advanced by district memorial hospital to justify its claim for reimbursement of the disproportionate share adjustment.accordingly,the court remanded the matter to the secretary for the prompt payment to the hospital of plus interest.
because we conclude that regulation is ambiguous and that the secretary interpretation is a reasonable construction of the regulatory language,see thomas jefferson shalala,d,we defer to the secretary and reverse.
the medicare program finances health care for the elderly and the disabled.see.until,the program reimbursed hospitals for the reasonable cost of inpatient services rendered to medicare patients.in,congress overhauled the program and began reimbursing the cost of inpatient acute care under a prospective payment system.the prospective payment system reimburses hospitals at fixed rates that are based on the patient diagnosis upon discharge.see social security amendments of,stat.the fixed rates are established by determining what an efficient hospital would spend to treat a patient with that diagnosis.under the overhaul,expenses incurred for skilled nursing care continue to be reimbursable under the old reasonable cost basis,which is generally more desirable for hospitals because reimbursement is not limited by a schedule.
when adopting the prospective payment system in,congress recognized that the fixed rates established under that system could undercompensate hospitals that treated a high proportion of medicare patients,because those patients were thought generally to be in poorer health and would require more services than would patients.see.i,at,reprinted in.accordingly,congress instructed the secretary to formulate an adjustment to the fixed rates to increase the reimbursement to those hospitals that served a significantly disproportionate number of disproportionate share adjustment.when the secretary delayed publishing a formulation,congress itself set forth the criteria in for this disproportionate share adjustment.see d f.the secretary thereafter published the regulation at issue in this case,construing and implementing the congressional enactment.see.
the regulation provided that,in determining a hospital disproportionate share adjustment,the relevant factors were the hospital number of available beds,its number of patient days,and its location.a.the hospital number of patient days was defined to include only those days attributable to areas of the hospital that were subject to the prospective payment system and exclude d all others.id.a ii.because eligibility for the disproportionate share adjustment was based on the number of patient days attributable to areas of the hospital that were subject to the prospective payment system,areas providing inpatient acute for the adjustment for hospitals providing both acute care and nursing care depended on how the secretary interpreted the regulation to define the areas where acute care was being performed.the secretary interpretation was especially critical with respect to hospitals providing both acute care and skilled nursing care at the same beds.
distinguishing between areas of the hospital subject to the prospective payment system and those subject to reimbursement presented no problem so long as the hospital was divided into distinct wings,each of which provided only one form of acute care or skilled nursing care.and before,the provision of those two types of care was in fact generally divided.skilled nursing services were generally rendered in facilities that were separate and distinct from hospitals providing acute care.moreover,in areas where acute care and skilled nursing care were provided in the same facility,medicare required that hospitals provide skilled nursing care in a distinct part of the hospital,such as a building,floor,wing,or corridor that was physically separate from the inpatient acute care unit.see rural hospitals provision of care services provision,july,a distinct part must be an entire physically identifiable unit consisting of all the beds within that unit such as a separate building,floor,wing,or corridor.
in the,the secretary recognized that this model of separate facilities for different types of care was difficult for small rural hospitals to achieve,given their limited physical resources.the secretary found that rural areas generally had an excess of hospital beds for acute care and a shortage of beds for skilled nursing care because of a shortage of nursing homes.to respond to this,congress authorized the secretary to enter into agreements with rural hospitals with fewer than beds that allowed them to use their inpatient acute care facilities also for services of the type that would be provided at skilled nursing facilities.a,b.with the secretary approval,a rural hospital could accordingly use any inpatient bed for either inpatient acute care or skilled nursing care.these beds,known as swing beds,were thus licensed for acute care but were able to swing to use for nursing care when not needed for acute care.although acute care and nursing care could now be performed in the same facility,their reimbursement systems were still separate skilled nursing care was reimbursed on the reasonable cost basis,and acute care remained under the prospective payment system.id.a.
because the distinction in methods of reimbursement depended on the nature of services rendered and because only the prospective payment method was linked with the disproportionate share adjustment,the secretary construed regulation,which was promulgated to calculate the disproportionate share adjustment,to exclude from the calculation any patient day that was attributable to a swing bed providing skilled nursing care.this became the interpretation applied by the secretary.
district memorial hospital is a small under beds rural hospital in andrews,north carolina,that had a agreement with the secretary.consequently,its beds were licensed for acute care but could be used for either acute care or skilled nursing care,as needed.
in its cost reports,district memorial hospital claimed the disproportionate share adjustment authorized by d f i i,in the amount of,asserting that it served a significantly disproportionate number of patients.in performing the calculations required by regulation,the hospital included as patient days the days on which its patients received skilled nursing services in its swing beds because the beds were physically located in an area licensed for acute care.under the secretary standing construction of,however,the secretary intermediary excluded these days from the calculation,and as a result,district memorial hospital failed to qualify for the disproportionate share adjustment.accordingly,on october,the intermediary denied the hospital claim for the disproportionate share adjustment.
the hospital appealed the intermediary decision to the provider reimbursement board,and the board reversed the intermediary decision,awarding the hospital the disproportionate share adjustment.the board decision was thereafter reviewed on behalf of the secretary by the deputy administrator of the centers for medicare medicaid services formerly the health care financing administration.on august,through the deputy administrator,the secretary reversed the board and concluded that ther
