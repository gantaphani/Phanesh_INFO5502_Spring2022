louanne boothe,a former finance and accounting employee of sun healthcare group,a medicare and medicaid provider,filed a qui tam complaint,alleging that sun overbilled the united states in ten distinct ways.finding that three of these allegations were based upon information already in the public domain and that she was not an original source of that information,the district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction under e of the false claims act,to hear the case.
we agree jurisdiction is lacking with respect to the three claims the district court analyzed.while we have not yet had occasion to address whether,as the district court holding suggests,a deficiency in one claim precludes jurisdiction over all claims joined in the same lawsuit,today we clarify that it does not.just as finding three bad apples does not necessarily warrant discarding the barrel,we hold that an independent jurisdictional analysis of each of boothe remaining seven claims of fraud is necessary,and accordingly remand for further proceedings.
during the period covered by this lawsuit,sun,through its network of approximately direct and indirect subsidiaries,operated medical facilities across the country that,among other things,provided services to medicare and patients.construing the facts in the light most favorable to boothe as the party opposing summary judgment in this case,sun defrauded medicare in ten different ways.
first,and foremost in monetary terms,boothe alleges that sun the government by abusing the section exception in the years.section of the medicare provider reimbursement manual prohibits providers like sun from seeking reimbursement of any profit margins as opposed to costs actually incurred charged by related parties assisting it in providing services to the federal government.meanwhile,section provides a narrow exception to this rule if the related party meets certain requirements that,among other things,seek to ensure its profit margin is based on market forces rather than a purely arbitrary internal decision thus,section requires that a substantial portion of the related party business must be done with third parties before its profit margin will qualify for reimbursement by the government.sun bills apparently included related party profits of million that did not come close to meeting section strictures.
abusing section was,however,but the tip of the iceberg,according to boothe.though perhaps individually less significant in monetary terms,boothe contends that sun also defrauded medicare by disregarding medicare guidelines and overcharging for therapy management services to the tune of million overstated its temporary nursing staff labor hours in and at denver mediplex specialty hospital denver mediplex by overcharged medicare by in for pharmacy charges at the northview psychiatric hospital in boise,idaho improperly billed medicare in for worth of stolen medical supplies at denver mediplex overcharged medicare by in by funneling costs between denver mediplex and an affiliated outpatient clinic filed medicare reimbursements for million worth of mortgage interests payments in and associated with denver mediplex even though the mortgage was discharged in sun october bankruptcy released patients earlier than its prior practice from ballard rehabilitation hospital in san bernardino,california in order to inflate its medicare revenue by million manipulated patient discharges at continental rehabilitation hospital in san diego,california to impose improper costs on medicare of and signed without the knowledge or consent of its patients admission forms for three years ending january in order to receive from medicare million in reimbursements for accident and injury treatments when liability potentially rested with third parties.
boothe filed a sealed complaint in november.she was,however,hardly the first qui tam relator to finger sun for fraud between october and june many as seven years before boothe brought her relators filed no fewer than eleven other qui tam complaints against sun.the allegations contained in these complaints bear striking resemblances to at least the first three aspects of boothe pleading,as they,too,charge sun with fraudulently invoking the section exception to recoup improper profits violating the guidelines and overstating labor hours.in response to these earlier indications of fraud at sun,the government conducted a nationwide investigation,culminating in a settlement agreement between sun,the government,and various qui tam relators in,the year before boothe even filed suit.
after boothe filed her qui tam complaint and the government indicated that it would not intervene,the district court unsealed the action.shortly thereafter,sun filed a motion to dismiss asserting,among other things,that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider the case.after construing sun motion to dismiss as a motion for summary decision not challenged before district court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over boothe suit because three of her claims were based upon publicly disclosed qui tam complaints and boothe was not the original source for the public disclosures in the prior qui tam suits.boothe timely filed her notice of appeal.we assess de novo the issues raised in this summary judgment disposition.see united states ex rel.precision koch,cir.
originally passed by congress in to combat rampant fraud in civil war defense contracts,the false claims act,as amended,see,covers all fraudulent attempts to cause the government to pay out sums of money.united states ex rel.bahrani conagra,cir.section a authorizes the attorney general of the united states to bring civil actions to remedy this fraud,while section b authorizes private individuals,or relators,to bring qui tam civil suits on behalf of the government against those suspected of only under certain heavily specified and circumstances.as a bounty for identifying and prosecuting fraud on behalf of the government,not to mention complying with a gamut of procedural prerequisites,relators may receive up to percent of any recovery they obtain.see d.thus,the act proceeds on a theory as old as modern civilization,that one of the least expensive and most effective means of preventing frauds on the treasury is to make the perpetrators of them liable to actions by private persons acting,if you please,under the strong stimulus of personal ill will or the hope of gain.prosecutions conducted by such means compare with the ordinary methods as the enterprising privateer does to the public vessel.united states griswold,
compliance with section e a of title,known as the public disclosure bar,is one of the prerequisites to suit faced by relators and the focus of our attention in this dispute.it provides that 
n o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a criminal,civil,or administrative hearing,in a congressional,administrative,or government accounting office report,hearing,audit,or investigation,or from the news media,unless the action is brought by the attorney general or the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.
e a emphases added.essentially,then,congress has directed us to follow a inquiry when a relator files a qui tam action.we must first ask whether the relator action is based upon a preexisting public disclosure of the defendant wrongdoing.if it is,we must then ask whether the relator was the original source of the information.if the relator did not serve as the original source,we must dismiss the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.in other words,if the fraud upon the government has already come to light,congress has conferred upon us the power to hear only qui tam actions from the relator who originally exposed the deception,not those from subsequent relators who may try to copycat and capitalize on the original source efforts.
we begin our analysis under section e a by focusing on three claims the district court discussed the section fraud,the violation of the guidelines,and the overstatement of labor hours,discussing the p
