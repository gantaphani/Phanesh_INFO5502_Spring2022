the medical evidence 
treating physician,kratche 
family practitioner robert kratche first treated buxton from late to late.in response to a question regarding buxton limitations to do activities,kratche wrote in my opinion,fran buxton is fully capable of performing any and all activities delineated above.she is bright and articulate and has no demonstrable physical disability.kratche directed the reader attention to his patient notes for july,and august.kratche note on july,reads as follows 
s patient is a year old white female who presents quite upset with a complaint of year history of chronic fatigue.she states that various chemicals including the chlorine in her water at home tend to make her quite weak.she also gets some sore muscles and some symptoms of urethritis with burning.she has apparently been doctor shopping over the last years seeing a multitude of doctors giving each a month window to cure her.she has had all kinds of allergy testing which has been positive via skin testing for practically everything.she currently is being treated for allergies to dust,mites,molds,corn,wheat,yeast,beet sugar,chocolate,milk,soybean,tomato and tea as well as fermelohide sic,ethyl and chlorine,phenol and glycerine and candida.some of her old records that were forwarded include a positive ebv virus titer.she is convinced that she has chronic fatigue syndrome secondary to ebv now.she also has positive antibodies both antimicrobial and antithryroglobulin.she states that she has had rast testing as well although these results have not been forwarded to this office.she apparently was treated with synthroid for several months but finished her medication a couple weeks ago and never got it refilled.when asked about depression she began to cry and state sic that many of the doctors that she has seen have told her to have something done about her head,however she does not seem to want to accept this type of approach.she states that once she feels good she is fine but when she feels sick that is when she gets depressed.she apparently has considered suicide by taking all of the pills in her house.however she has never attempted this and does not appear to be suicidal at this time.
kratche note on august,reads as follows,in relevant part 
s patient is a yr.old white female who presents for a physical without a pap her only complaints are that of the chronic fatigue along with the sensation of weakness and chronic cystitis symptoms.

kratche interpretation of this was that buxton was basically normal.
after a period of approximately two years since her last visit,buxton again began seeing kratche in october of.kratche treated her,noting some urine dips that were positive for blood,refilling her vicodin prescription,and referring her to frank for evaluation of her questionable chronic fatigue syndrome.
family practitioner scott frank began seeing buxton in mid on a referral from kratche.frank wrote a letter in july of to buxton employer disability insurer,in response to their letter requesting more information regarding buxton conditions.in that letter,frank confirmed a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome for buxton.frank also ruled out a variety of mental disorders.specifically,frank noted a positive test result indicating a recent acute infection,which frank attributed to the then recent exacerbation of her symptoms.frank noted,however,that not all of her symptoms are attributable to this acute infection because her overall symptoms preceded the period of time during which the test result would remain positive.frank patient notes also indicated that buxton exercised by walking minutes per day,with no post exercise collapse.
allergy specialist donald nelson treated buxton for allergies from september through at least early.nelson tested buxton,and found her to be sensitive allergic to many different things,including chemicals such as phenol,glycerin,chlorine,ethanol,and formaldehyde.nelson treated buxton with various medications and antibiotics.
nelson did not answer the question regarding limitations on the form sent to him requesting information regarding buxton disability.
infectious disease specialist robert salata saw buxton twice on a referral from kratche in early.kratche referred buxton to salata for evaluation of her possible cfs.salata wrote kratche a letter in march of regarding his evaluation of buxton.salata conducted tests,and concluded that the results were consistent with prior infection.salata opined that there was no evidence currently of an ongoing infectious disease that was related to her symptom complex.
in response to a request for more information about buxton disability status,salata opined that buxton was not limited in her physical activities,but somewhat limited in mental activities.
psychologist marie bielefeld saw buxton for a period of years it is not clear from the record from at least through the end of.in response to an inquiry regarding the nature of buxton mental,bielefeld noted that buxton m ood is somewhat depressed there is somatic preoccupation which is not surprising given the nature of her physical disorders.bielefeld further noted that buxton intellectual functioning was normal,except during severe allergic reactions.bielefeld noted buxton social isolation due to her allergic reactions to chemicals bielefeld opined that at the present time,however,it is my impression that she could not be placed in a job and maintain it for health reasons stated above.
in a letter written to buxton employer disability insurer in,apparently in response to a request for information,bielefeld set forth some symptoms that buxton had apparently relayed to her,and then opined 
buxton has become depressed over the last few months.she is very discouraged about her medical condition buxton is not well enough to work at this point.she does not have sufficient stamina and mental alertness to accomplish even a half day of work cfs and css are the obstacles to buxton being able to perform gainful employment.except for these medical problems,buxton never demonstrated any problems on the job at stouffers that would inhibit her from future employment.
general practitioner kevin deorio treated buxton from march until september of.deorio noted that due to her chemical sensitivity,buxton had work limitations which included an inability to function in all activities secondary to acute chlorine exposure.deorio further noted that due to her chronic fatigue,buxton was unable to perform at a functional level of output.in treating buxton for her ailments cfs and chronic urethritis,deorio indicated buxton response was fair when she followed his treatment suggestions of changing her diet,resting,and taking nutritional supplements.
in a letter dated april,urology specialist julian gordon indicated buxton had been seen twice in for urethral burning,but that a ll testing done through gordon office was negative including urethral and urine cultures,as well as an showing no evidence of urethral abnormalities.gordon opined that buxton urethral burning in no way creates a disability from a physical perspective.
ssa medical expert witness,cox 
internist frank cox testified before the alj at the second hearing in september of.the alj asked cox to identify and evaluate buxton mental disorders,based on cox review of buxton medical records.cox then explained the diagnosis of cfs and discussed the history of the medical field development of a definition for the disease.cox then explained that buxton had a positive result for a human herpes virus titer,that may or may not have related to the cfs.cox then explained that buxton diagnosis of multiple chemical sensitivities was not a diagnosis recognized by conventional medical centers.cox explained that the alleged symptoms of css were almost identical to those associated with cfs.cox then explained that buxton had a diagnosis for her irritable urethra,but that the urologist had indicated it would not cause a disability.
the alj then inquired about buxton alleged allergies.cox acknowledged buxton had been evaluated,and tested positive for,some allergies,but stated there just nothing in her evaluation that would be accountable for her disability.the alj discussed with cox that the alj had previously made a finding about buxton need to avoid exposure to a work environment with multiple chemicals,and asked cox opinion with regard to that finding.cox opined if you asking me,is there a medical reasonable certainty that working next to or in that plant would harm her,i would have to s ay no.
cox was then questioned by buxton attorney.cox indicated that he had treated patients with cfs,and that cfs was a recognizable diagnosis.cox further indicated that to some extent,a patient symptoms are the primary factor used to diagnose cfs.cox also stated that he did not quarrel with buxton diagnosis of cfs.cox opined that multiple chemical sensitivities as a diagnosis was quackery,and that those associated with its treatment had not shown that these programs do a bit of good other than costing a lot of money.
following questioning by daniel schweid infra,the alj readdressed cox for a brief moment.the alj asked cox if he had reconsidered any of his testimony,and cox said no but further explained i mean,they use bleach somewhere in the house,and her urethra immediately began to burn and she,she had to sleep on a cot by the door for three days.i mean,that not a physical illness.and it not an allergy.there no way,but she been allowed to think that.
ssa medical expert witness,schweid 
psychiatrist daniel schweid testified before the alj at the second hearing in september of.based on schweid review of buxton medical records,the alj asked schweid to identify and evaluate buxton psychological or psychiatric disorders that might affect buxton occupational abilities.schweid first opined that his review of the records showed that none of buxton physicians had adequately evaluated the psychiatric component to buxton diagnoses of cfs and css,not even bielefeld,the psychologist.
schweid then discussed,at length,the medical community debate regarding whether chronic fatigue immune and multiple chemical are legitimate diagnoses,and if so,what research criteria a physician should use to make the diagnosis.schweid indicated that there was a subset of physicians who were true believer s who would try to treat these patients with treatments that either did not work,or would have the effect of reinforcing the patient beliefs that she could not tolerate exposure to certain chemicals it becomes iatrogenic,an iatrogenic illness,after a while.
schweid then discussed buxton doctors.he noted that a couple of her physicians had advocated the diagnoses,but that salata,the infectious disease specialist,had noted that she did not quite meet the criteria for the diagnosis,although he did not affirmatively discount the diagnosis.schweid also noted frank herpes virus theory as possibly being a causal element to her symptoms.
however,schweid opined that what buxton truly suffered from was depression,somatoform disorder,or both.he noted that patients such as buxton do not want to believe that they have a psychiatric disorder,so sometimes no physicians will even entertain the idea of a psychiatric disorder.schweid then translate d the parts of the record that do not seem to support cfs,but do support somatoform disorder,which he noted is found at in the listings.schweid further opined that buxton is depressed,and evaluated her depression under the listing.
schweid noted that the elements of a somatoform disorder are present in buxton case hypochondriasis,some unrealistic interpretation of physician signs or sensations associated with the preoccupation or belief that she has a serious disease or injury,chronic fatigue,and maybe some chronic pain.schweid then noted the elements of a depressive disorder that are present in buxton case loss of interest,that is anhedonia,sleep disturbance,decreased energy,difficulty concentrating.as to her level of impairment,schweid opined she is moderately impaired in her activities of daily living and social functioning often impaired in c oncentration,persistence,and pace.schweid opined that buxton does not meet the listing of the impairment.however,he did suggest some limitations buxton might have by reason of her somatoform or depressive syndromes her situation would have to be routine,low stress,no high production quotas,and because of irritability,no situations that are intrinsically confrontational or very intense interpersonal transactions she should not be in a situation where she would be responsible for the safety or welfare of others,and i think that would define it.
upon questioning by buxton attorney,schweid opined that buxton was not primarily a malingerer she both hypochondriacal and responsive to her doctors who say that she should not touch certain things or be in a room where certain chemicals exist,s he likes to listen to the ones that verify it.schweid clarified that when he was assessing the impairments see paragraph above,he was assessing for both listings and.schweid opined that buxton is at least moderately impaired in all of this,but i do think extremely impaired,and i do think markedly impaired.schweid concluded i do think this issue we dealing with stands or falls on the diagnosis.it more on,on the operational issues,the functional issues.
vocational expert testimony 
at the second hearing in september of,vocational expert carol mosley ve was asked some questions regarding jobs available in the economy based on buxton profile.the alj described the hypothetical profile 
no exertional impairments,high school graduate not yet years of age,some significant nonexertional impairments,and that is that this worker must work in an environment limited to routine,simple,repetitive tasks that do not carry any high production requirements that is,the worker can do work at an ordinary pace and in an ordinary work routine.this worker can not work at any jobs or occupations that would require confrontation,negotiation,persuading,not to be responsible for the safety of others,and would only require nonintense or neutral interactions with the public,with her supervisors or fellow workers.
first,the alj asked the ve whether buxton could return to her past relevant work,and the ve opined that buxton could not.the alj then asked the ve whether a hypothetical person with buxton profile could perform other jobs or occupations in the economy.the ve opined that such a person could perform as a file clerk,meat clerk,garment sorter,and food service worker,and that each of these jobs exists in both the ohio and the national economies in significant numbers.
buxton attorney then inquired of the ve,whether any of the jobs she listed did not require concentration or attention.the ve stated that all of them would require full attention.the alj then asked the ve whether there were jobs with varying degrees of concentration,to which the ve answered yes,and stated that jobs requiring intense concentration usually have high quotas or high stress.the hearing ended at that point.
alj findings 
an initial hearing was held in february,before an alj,who found buxton not disabled.following a remand to correct an inconsistency in the opinion,the alj held a second hearing in september.buxton testified at the first hearing,but waived her right to appear at the second hearing.based on the extensive medical record,buxton testimony,testimony by the two consultative physicians,and vocational expert ve testimony,the alj concluded that although buxton has severe impairments consisting of chronic fatigue syndrome,chemical sensitivity syndrome,depression,and somatoform disorder,she is not disabled as defined by the social security act.the alj accepted the ve testimony that there were jobs in significant numbers in national economy which buxton had the capacity to perform.
ii.analysis 
buxton arguments are these that the combination of her actual physical conditions,and her mental perception of her conditions,renders her totally unable to engage in work that the alj commissioner and the district court failed to consider the effect her mental perception of her limitations has on buxton ability to work and that even if her mental perceptions regarding her physical are mistaken,the court should have considered the sincerity of her mistaken beliefs in determining whether she is able to engage in work.buxton notes that in arriving at the decision,the alj relied upon a statement made some five years prior to the second hearing,in which buxton had stated that she was physically capable of taking care of her personal needs,her living area,and was performing many activities of daily life.buxton argues that the alj reliance upon that statement was erroneous because she is not asserting a physical or exertional limitation,only impairments buxton argues that the alj should have been focusing on the delusional aspects of her condition s,rather than the medical conditions themselves.
the commissioner argues simply that there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the alj determination that buxton suffered from four serio
