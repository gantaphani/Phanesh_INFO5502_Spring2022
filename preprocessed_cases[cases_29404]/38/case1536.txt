at issue in the present appeal is the effective date of williams dic benefits.williams appealed from the board determination that she was not entitled to an effective date earlier than october.in its en banc split decision,the veterans court addressed the legal questions of 
whether nehmer i and nehmer ii had the legal effect of voiding the and denials of williams august and june dic claims whether,if those denials were voided,there is a legal basis for an earlier effective date under stipulation or the statutory and regulatory effective date provisions and whether,if the denials were not voided,there is a legal basis for an earlier effective date,under stipulation or the statutory and regulatory provisions,based on the,or claim.
