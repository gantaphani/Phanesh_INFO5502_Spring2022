this case requires us to decide whether litigation seeking judicial review of an action or decision by a public entity is subject to a special motion to strike under the statute,code of civil procedure section merely because the challenged action or decision was taken by vote after discussion at a public meeting.our answer is no.even if the conduct of individual public officials in discussing and voting on a public entity action or decision could constitute an exercise of rights protected under the issue we need not and do not does not mean that litigation challenging a public entity action or decision always arises from protected activity.in the present case,the litigation does not arise from the speech or votes of public officials,but rather from an action taken by the public entity administered by those officials.moreover,that action was not itself an exercise of the public entity right of free speech or petition.we therefore affirm the trial court order denying the entity special motion to strike.
facts and procedural background 
all of the parties to this appeal are public entities appellant contra costa county employees retirement association cccera is a county retirement system established under article xvi,section of the california constitution and the county employees retirement law of cerl.appellant board of retirement of contra costa county employees retirement association the board is the governing body of the board respondent san ramon valley fire protection district district is a special district within contra costa county.
the board administers retirement benefits for employees of contra costa county and of various government entities within that county,including the district.in december,the district entered into a memorandum of understanding with the union representing the district employees,under which the employees retirement benefits were increased.as both the board and the district recognized,cerl required that the increased benefits be funded through increased contributions to the board from the district its employees.the board therefore retained an actuary to determine the amount of those contributions in december,the board notified the district that in order to fund the increased benefits,the district would have to pay nearly million in accrued contributions as of january,plus interest from that date 
in february,the district retained its own actuary,who disagreed with the methodology used by the board actuary.meanwhile,the board retained a different actuary,who ultimately confirmed that the methodology of the board first actuary was appropriate,though also recognizing that an alternative methodology could appropriately be used that would decrease the amount of the additional contribution to just under million.
at a publicly noticed board meeting on april,the board actuary made a presentation regarding the alternative methods of calculating what the district owed for the increased benefits.he characterized the original actuary calculations as accurate and consistent with the board rating policies and past practices.after discussion,the board voted to adopt the original actuary methodology,with the correction it had already agreed to make,thus determining that the district would have to pay nearly million to fund the increased benefits.
the district promptly requested reconsideration.at the board meeting on may,a motion for reconsideration was moved and seconded,but the vote on the motion was split evenly at four votes in favor and four votes against.under the board regulations,the motion was deemed to have failed because it did not receive five affirmative votes.
on july,the district initiated the litigation out of which this appeal arose by filing a combined petition for mandamus code civ,petition for administrative mandamus,and complaint for declaratory relief against the board the board stipulated to the district filing of an amended petition and complaint in october.
the basis for the district suit,as alleged in the petition,is the board failing to comply with the mandatory duties set forth in provisions of cerl,and abusing its discretion by acting without the guidance of any policy or precedent in the board april,action regarding imposing a higher alternative contribution on the district for implementation of retirement benefits,and the board may,action regarding denying the district motion for reconsideration based upon a vote.the petition also alleges that the board violated clear ministerial duties by refusing to exercise their fiduciary duty to the district in minimizing its employer contribution consistent with the principles of cerl complains of the board failure to keep a verbatim record and swear in witnesses at board meetings and asserts that the tie vote on the district motion for reconsideration should have been treated as a failure to act on the motion rather than as a denial.
the district petition seeks the issuance of writs of mandate,declaratory judgments,and associated equitable remedies requiring the board to implement the increased retirement benefits based on a contribution by the district in the amount of to void the adoption of the higher contribution rate for the district to promulgate a consistent policy to guide the board decisionmaking process in setting employer contribution rates to provide adequate findings and evidence when choosing between actuarial valuations to comply with its own regulations to ensure a fair hearing when reviewing employer contribution valuations and to rehear the district motion for rehearing rather than deeming it denied by the evenly split vote.
on november,the board filed a special motion to strike the petition under the statute.the district opposed the motion,and after a hearing on december,the trial court issued a minute order denying the motion in its entirety.the board appealed,as permitted by section,subdivision j.
motion to dismiss 
before addressing the merits of the board appeal,we must first consider the district motion to dismiss the appeal,which was taken under submission and deferred for consideration together with the merits.the motion argues that the appeal should be dismissed for three reasons first,because the appeal is frivolous and taken solely for the purpose of delay second,because the underlying motion was procedurally defective in ways that the district contends deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to consider it and third,because the appeal was not properly authorized due to an alleged violation of the brown act,et with regard to the board meeting at which the decision to appeal was made.
the district first argument may be disposed of without extended discussion.california courts have the inherent power to dismiss frivolous appeals.citations.of course,it is a power that should not be used except in the absolutely clearest cases.citations.people ex rel.lockyer brar th,d,italics in original omitted,new italics added.an appeal is frivolous and warrants the imposition of sanctions when it is prosecuted for an improper harass the respondent or delay the effect of an adverse when it indisputably has no any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally and completely without merit.citation.citations.keitel heubel th,d.
this is not such a case.the board position is not clearly foreclosed by statute,as was the appellant in people ex rel.lockyer brar,supra,th at pages,d.there is no published case authority precisely on point,and as will appear in our discussion of the merits,some of the premises for the board arguments are well taken.moreover,the board appeal can not have been taken to delay the effect of an adverse judgment,because no judgment has yet issued,and the board may ultimately prevail on the merits.accordingly,while we will ultimately conclude that the board arguments on appeal are not meritorious see discussion,post,they are nonetheless not frivolous,and we decline to dismiss the appeal on that ground.
the second ground for the district motion to dismiss the appeal is that the board special motion to strike should have been denied due to the board failure to comply with two of the statute procedural requirements.the first is the provision requiring that the caption page of the motion be served on the judicial council,subd.k.it appears that this defect has been cured,and in any event,the district does not point to anything in the record indicating that this issue was raised at the trial court.nor does the district cite any authority,or even seriously argue,that this defect affects either the trial court jurisdiction,or ours,to consider the merits,or that the district was prejudiced in any way by the board failure to comply.the district also points to no authority indicating that failure to serve a special motion to strike on the judicial council,standing alone,warrants the denial of the motion,much less the dismissal of an appeal after the motion is denied on the merits.
the district second procedural argument for dismissal of this appeal is based on the board asserted failure to comply with the statutory requirement that the motion be set for hearing within days of service unless the trial court docket conditions require a later date,subd.f.in support of this argument,the district cites decker registry,th,d decker and fair political practices com.american civ.rights coalition,th,d fppc.unlike the plaintiffs in decker and fppc,however,the district did not raise the timeliness issue in the trial court.this omission deprived the board of an opportunity to establish,in a forum suitable for the trial of factual issues,that the delay was due to the court docket.
the district argues nonetheless that the issue was not waived,because decker held that the time limit was jurisdictional.decker did not address the issue whether the time limit had been waived,however,because it had been squarely raised and litigated in the trial court in that case.see decker,supra,th at,d.the decker court held that the defect was jurisdictional only in the sense that once the timeliness issue had been raised,if the moving party failed to make the requisite showing regarding docket conditions,the trial court had no authority to overlook the problem and decide the motion on its merits.see id.at,d.
in other words,the period of section,subdivision f is not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense of subject matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction.instead,it is jurisdictional in the sense that it deprives the court of power to act except in a particular manner,or to give certain kinds of relief,or to act without the occurrence of certain procedural prerequisites.abelleira district court of appeal cal d.when a court fails to conduct itself in the manner prescribed,it is said to have acted in excess of jurisdiction.citations.people williams th,d williams.a n act in excess of jurisdiction is valid until set aside,and parties may be precluded from setting it aside by such things as waiver,estoppel,or the passage of time.citations.people ruiz d.
where the trial court acts in excess of its jurisdiction by reaching the merits of a matter despite the expiration of a statutory time limit,a party failure to object in the trial court generally constitutes a waiver of the issue for appeal.see williams,supra,th at,d.although this waiver rule is not applied when the alleged error involves a pure question of law ibid,the applicability of the time period at issue here turns on a factual the docket conditions of the court require a later hearing,subd.f.moreover,as is exemplified by the discussion in fppc of the trial court comments about its own calendaring practices fppc,supra,th at,d,this factual question is clearly one that is best suited for resolution by the very court whose docket conditions are at issue.because the statute is not jurisdictional in the fundamental sense,and its application depends upon a factual question,the statute time limit is an example of a procedural issue that should be held to be waived if not raised at the trial level.accordingly,we hold that the district can not raise this issue for the first time in its motion to dismiss the board appeal.
finally,the district argument regarding the brown act violations alleged to have occurred in connection with the board authority to pursue the appeal appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the relevant facts the applicable law.in any event,once again,the district does not cite any authority indicating that the board failure to touch all the required procedural bases before initially authorizing the filing of this appeal would justify us in dismissing it,over the board objection,at this stage in the proceedings.we therefore decline to do so.
discussion 
the statute provides that a cause of action against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person right of petition or free speech under the united states or california constitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to strike,unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a probability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim,subd.b.the statute posits a process for determining whether an action is a slapp.first,the court decides whether the defendant has made a threshold showing that the challenged cause of action is one arising from protected activity.citation if the court finds that such a showing has been made,it must then determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the claim.citations.navellier,supra,cal th at,d.
in the present case,the trial court did not reach the second step of the test,because it ruled that the petition did not arise out of acts by the board in furtherance of its right to petition or free speech as defined in section we review the trial court order independently,as the issues raised are purely ones of law that we consider de novo.kajima engineering construction,city of los angeles th,d kajima.
the board contends that its decision to assess million in additional pension contributions to fund the district enhanced benefits,which occurred only after a public hearing and a majority vote of the board members,constituted conduct in furtherance of the exercise of the constitutional right of petition or the constitutional right of free speech in connection with a public issue or issue of public interest,subd.e.on appeal,the board argues that the statute therefore applies because the district petition arose from the board members discussions and votes in a public proceeding,which were acts in furtherance of their constitutionally protected right to free speech.
we have no doubt that a public official or government body,just like any private litigant,may make an motion where appropriate.see mission oaks ranch,county of santa barbara th,d mission oaks,disapproved on other grounds in briggs eden council for hope opportunity cal th,fn,d,bradbury superior court th,d see also schroeder irvine city council th,d,fn.schroeder.we also recognize that,in an appropriate case,a petition for mandamus may be subject to a special motion to strike just like any other form of action.see,fire protection dist.weir th,d mandamus petition seeking to strike or modify ballot argument constituted a slapp suit.moreover,although we need not and do not reach the issue here because no individual board member was sued by the district,we note that there is support for the argument that the protection accorded by the statute extends to statements made by public officials at an official public meeting,and perhaps also to their votes.see schroeder,supra,th at,fn,d see also stella kelley cir,brewer financial responsibility and manag.
however,there is nothing about the board collective action in requiring the district to make additional contributions to the cccera in the amount specified by the board actuary that implicates the rights of free speech or petition.as our supreme court has put it,the mere fact an action was filed after protected activity took place does not mean it arose from that activity.the statute can not be read to mean that any claim asserted in an action which arguably was filed in retaliation for the exercise of speech or petition rights falls under section,whether or not the claim is based on conduct in exercise of those rights.citations.c
