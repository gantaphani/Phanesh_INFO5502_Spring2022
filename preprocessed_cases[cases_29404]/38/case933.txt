in,congress amended the social security act to preclude an award of disability benefits if drug or alcohol abuse is a contributing factor material to the commissioner determination that the individual is disabled.d c.in this appeal,we confront an issue explicitly left open by our prior opinions,namely which party bears the burden of proof on this substance abuse issue.consistent with other circuits that have considered this question,we hold that when evidence exists of a claimant drug or alcohol abuse,the claimant bears the burden of proving that his substance abuse is not a material contributing factor to his disability.because this claimant failed to carry that burden,we affirm the commissioner denial of benefits.
background 
on april,joseph parra parra applied for disability and supplemental security income benefits under titles ii and xvi of the social security act.parra alleged disability since november,due to alcoholism and bursitis.following a hearing,an administrative law judge alj denied parra application.the alj found that parra testimony regarding his physical ailments was neither credible nor medically supported.he also found that d c barred parra from receiving benefits because parra alcoholism was a material contributing factor to his disability.parra appealed this decision to the district court,which remanded the case to the alj under g with instructions to consider a medical examination performed upon parra following the alj decision.
parra died on september,from cardiovascular collapse,hepatorenal syndrome,hepatocellular carcinoma,and liver cirrhosis.parra daughter,cathleen,was substituted as plaintiff and testified at a hearing the following month.subsequently,the alj issued a decision finding that parra alcoholism was a material contributing factor to any disability incurred before july.because parra disability insurance coverage lapsed on december,he was entitled to no relief cathleen again sought review by the district court,and the parties stipulated to a second g remand to reconsider her testimony and the weight it should be given.
a third hearing was held before a different alj on january.at the hearing,cathleen testified that,during his insured period,her father experienced pain in his hands and knees and also suffered from hearing difficulties,confusion,and paranoia.she also testified that he drank to the point of intoxication occasionally and that his alcohol use was not excessive,although when pressed for details she explained that he often consumed beers in a period and became intoxicated at least weekly.the alj also heard testimony from jerome marmorstein,a medical expert who reviewed parra medical history.marmorstein testified that parra medical records showed severe complications due to cirrhosis from july forward,although the disease had undoubtedly come on over many years and could have been moderately well advanced or moderately severe before parra insurance lapsed in.following marmorstein testimony,the alj stated orally that the evidence clearly indicated that parra was disabled due to cirrhosis by,and that the operative question was whether the disease would have resolved itself had he quit drinking before his insurance lapsed.
the alj issued his final decision on april.he rejected parra bursitis claim because the medical evidence failed to show a severe physical impairment prior to december.turning to the substance abuse claim,the alj found that by the summer of the claimant was disabled primarily due to heavy alcohol consumption and intoxication and also had moderately severe but curable cirrhosis of the liver.but he further found that prior to july,it was likely that parra would have recovered had he quit drinking.therefore parra cirrhosis was irreversible only after that date.the alj also explicitly ruled that the claimant bore the burden of proving that his alcoholism was not a contributing factor material to his disability.because his disability likely would have resolved had parra ceased using alcohol during his insured period,the alj found him ineligible for disability benefits under d c.the district court affirmed this ruling.
ii.standards of review 
we review de novo a district court affirmance of an alj decision.tackett apfel,cir.we may set aside the alj denial of benefits only when the alj findings are based on legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.id.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.flaten sec y of health human,cir.where the evidence can reasonably support either affirming or reversing the decision,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the commissioner.id.
iii.discussion 
cathleen parra appeals the alj decision on three grounds.she alleges that the alj erred by failing to perform the full analysis to determine parra disability,the alj erred in finding that alcoholism was material to parra disability,and the alj improperly discredited joseph and cathleen parra testimony.we address each claim in turn.
a.the analysis 
a claimant is disabled under title ii of the social security act if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.to determine whether a claimant meets this definition,the alj conducts a sequential evaluation that asks whether the claimant is presently engaging in substantially gainful activity whether the claimant has a severe impairment whether the impairment is listed,or equivalent to an impairment listed,in appendix i of the regulations whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past relevant work and whether the impairment prevents the claimant from performing any other substantially gainful activity.a.the claimant bears the burden of proving steps one through four,consistent with the general rule that a t all times,the burden is on the claimant to establish his entitlement to disability insurance benefits.tidwell apfel,cir.once this prima facie case is established,the burden shifts to the commissioner at the fifth step to show that the claimant may perform other gainful activity.see tackett,at.
a finding of disabled under the inquiry does not automatically qualify a claimant for disability benefits.bustamante massanari,cir.under d c,a claimant can not receive disability benefits if alcoholism or drug addiction would be a contributing factor material to the commissioner determination that the individual is disabled.congress adopted this amendment in as part of the contract with america advancement act caaa,public law.as we have previously explained,the purpose of the caaa was to discourage alcohol and drug abuse,or at least not to encourage it with a permanent government subsidy.ball massanari,cir.under the implementing regulations,the alj must conduct a drug abuse and alcoholism analysis daa analysis by determining which of the claimant disabling limitations would remain if the claimant stopped using drugs or alcohol.b.if the remaining limitations would still be disabling,then the claimant drug addiction or alcoholism is not a contributing factor material to his disability.if the remaining limitations would not be disabling,then the claimant substance abuse is material and benefits must be denied.id.
appellant asserts that the alj erred by failing to conduct the full analysis to determine that parra cirrhosis was disabling before conducting the daa analysis to determine if parra alcoholism was material.see bustamante,at holding alj must identify disability under procedure before conducting daa analysis to determine whether substance abuse was material to disability.we agree with appellant that the alj findings regarding parra cirrhosis are ambiguous.in his decision,the alj initially states that the claimant did not have a severe physical impairment prior to the date last insured of december.later,however,the alj finds that by the summer of the claimant was disabled primarily due to heavy alcohol consumption and intoxication
