linda vaccaro petitions for review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board board that affirmed the denial by the office of personnel management opm of her application for a survivor annuity as the former spouse of angelo vaccaro,a deceased federal retiree.vaccaro office of pers,vaccaro ii.we affirm.
background 
pursuant to the provisions of the civil service retirement spouse equity act of,stat,csrsea,a former spouse of a deceased federal employee or civil service annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity if certain conditions are met.the provisions of the csrsea that are relevant to this case are found at h which provides in pertinent part as follows 
subject to paragraphs through of this subsection,a former spouse of a deceased employee or annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection,if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or property settlement agreement incident to such decree.
for purposes of this subchapter,a modification in a decree,order,or agreement referred to in paragraph of this subsection shall not be effective 
a if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee and 
b to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.
the pertinent facts can be briefly stated the vaccaros married in.in,vaccaro retired from his employment with the united states postal service.in his application for retirement,he elected to receive a reduced monthly annuity payment so that his spouse would be entitled to a survivor annuity.vaccaro received reduced annuity payments from the date of his retirement until his divorce fifteen years later.
vaccaro filed for divorce in.on august,the superior court of the state of california,county of del norte,entered a judgment of dissolution of the vaccaros marriage.the judgment stated that the parties were ordered to comply with the terms and provisions of attachment.attachment.was a marital property agreement.the agreement listed the community property of and vaccaro on the date of their separation.among the items of property listed was community interest in husband postal retirement.the agreement then proceeded to divide the community property.vaccaro civil service retirement was addressed as follows 
division of community interest in the federal employee civil service pension is deferred so long as respondent pays to petitioner as and for spousal support the sum of not less than three hundred dollars per month.the court retains jurisdiction over this asset to insure vaccaro receives her share of the community interest in the retirement.
vaccaro died on march.on march,upon vaccaro motion,the california court awarded vaccaro a former spouse survivor annuity.the order stated in pertinent part having reserved jurisdiction over respondent federal employee civil service pension,the court hereby awards to petitioner all benefits as surviving spouse of angelo vaccaro.
on march,vaccaro filed with opm an application for a survivor annuity based upon the march,order of the california court.in a reconsideration decision dated august,opm denied the application.after citing h and h,as well as its regulations implementing those statutory provisions opm stated to vaccaro 
your divorce decree did not award you a former spouse survivor annuity nor did it direct vaccaro to elect to provide you a former spouse survivor annuity.the court order dated march,is not qualifying for awarding you a former spouse survivor annuity since it was issued after the first court order that divided marital property between you and vaccaro.it was also issued after his death.thus,you are not eligible for a former spouse survivor annuity as the former spouse of vaccaro.
vaccaro appealed to the board.in an initial decision dated december,the administrative judge to whom the appeal was assigned ruled that opm reconsideration decision was in accordance with.vaccaro office of pers,no,slip op.at merit.prot.bd,vaccaro i in addition,the administrative judge rejected vaccaro claim that she was entitled to a survivor annuity because,after his divorce and prior to his death,vaccaro would have made a timely election to provide her with such an annuity had opm not failed to provide him with notice of his election rights.the administrative judge therefore sustained opm denial of vaccaro application.the administrative judge initial decision became the final decision of the board when,on february,a divided board denied vaccaro petition for review.vaccaro ii,at.vaccaro filed a timely petition for review with this court in accordance with.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the board is limited.specifically,we must affirm the board decision unless we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.
vaccaro raises two arguments on appeal.first,she contends that the march,order of the california court that awarded her a survivor annuity should be given effect under h.according to vaccaro,the march order does not run afoul of the provisions of h because it did not constitute a modification of the divorce decree.vaccaro notes that the decree that dissolved the vaccaros marriage divided all marital property except for the community interest in vaccaro civil service pension.vaccaro points out that division of that property was deferred and that the court reserved jurisdiction over the property.from that fact,vaccaro reasons that,since the decree did nothing as far as vaccaro pension was concerned,the order that awarded her a survivor annuity did not modify the decree.the government counters that,since the decree did divide marital property,the order awarding a survivor annuity was ineffective under h,because it came after vaccaro death and involved a survivor annuity.vaccaro second argument on appeal is that substantial evidence does not support the administrative judge finding that she failed to establish that,following his divorce,vaccaro intended to elect a survivor annuity for her and would have done so had opm not failed to provide him with notice of his election rights.the government responds that substantial evidence does support the administrative judge decision.we address vaccaro contentions in turn.
as noted above,under the csrsea,a former spouse of a deceased annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or property settlement agreement incident to such decree.h.in addition,
a modification in a decree,order,or agreement referred to in h shall not be effective if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee and to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.
it is clear that the divorce decree did not award vaccaro a survivor annuity.it also is clear that the order of the california court was entered after vaccaro death and involved an annuity under h.the question before us then is whether a divorce decree that divides marital property,but defers d ivision of community interest in the federal employee civil service pension so long as spousal support payments are made and does not award a survivor annuity,is modified by a subsequent order that does award such an annuity.this question involves an issue of statutory interpretation,a matter of law that we review de novo.see rosete office of pers.
in addressing the question before us,we do not write upon an entirely clean slate.in newman love,we addressed the provisions of the csrsea that are at issue in this case.love involved two separate petitioners,each with two court orders,one order that dissolved the marriage and the other that divided the marital property.the two initial divorce decrees in love expressly provided that all matters relating to property division were excluded from the decrees and were reserved by the state courts for future consideration and judicial disposition in bifurcated proceedings.id.in subsequent divorce proceedings,the former husbands in love sought to provide financial protection for their former spouses in the form of survivor annuities.id.when the surviving spouses sought to implement the survivor annuities memorialized in the state court orders,opm denied the applications.id.the case came to us as an appeal by opm from the decision of the board reversing opm reconsideration decisions and directing opm to award the two surviving spouses the survivor annuities for which they had applied.
we framed the issue before us in love as whether a decree of divorce which dissolves a marriage,but does nothing with respect to property,is modified for purposes of h by a subsequent court order which for the first time addresses the issue of property division and settlement.love,at.looking to the dictionary,we stated that the plain meaning of the word modification is a change or alteration or limitation.id.armed with that definition,we concluded that the bifurcated orders in love,which were the initial orders dividing the marital property,did not alter or limit the terms or effect of the previously entered decrees of divorce,which dissolved the marriage s.id.the reason was that the bifurcated orders did not change,alter or limit anything.accordingly,we held that opm reconsideration decisions denying implementation of the bifurcated orders that awarded survivor annuities were contrary to h.id.we therefore affirmed the decision of the board.
we had occasion to consider the same provisions of the csrsea again in hokanson office of personnel management.in hokanson,the final judgment and decree of divorce,which was issued in the state of idaho and which divided the marital property,issued on september.at.the decree included the following awards 
as her portion of said civil service retirement benefits,hokanson shall be paid the sum of per month the balance of the civil service retirement benefits shall be paid to hokanson.
id.at.the divorce decree was supplemented by an amended judgment on april.
hokanson died on september,before retiring from federal service.consequently,hokanson never received any payments from the expected retirement annuity.id.after opm denied her request for a former spouse survivor annuity on the ground that the divorce decree did not expressly provide for such an annuity,as required by h,hokanson requested that the idaho court clarify the amended decree that had issued four years earlier.id.on june,the idaho court issued an order that purported to clarify the divorce decree.the order indicated that it was the intent of the court to award hokanson of all retirement benefits that accrued as of the date of divorce whether those benefits be characterized as retirement benefits,survivor benefits,or death benefits.id.opm denied hokanson renewed application for a survivor annuity and the board affirmed the denial.
on appeal,we affirmed the board decision.we pointed out that h states that a former spouse is not eligible for a survivor annuity unless the annuity is expressly provided for.hokanson,at.in addition,we looked to what we characterized as opm relevant regulations a,c,and.id.at.we also considered opm guidelines for interpreting state court orders awarding survivor annuity benefits to former spouses.id we concluded that,under the statute,the regulations,and the guidelines,an award directing the payment of a share of a federal employee retirement benefits is distinct from,and will not be interpreted as,an award of a survivor annuity.id.at.
turning to hokanson divorce decree,we noted that the decree did not provide hokanson with a former spouse annuity or death benefits,or designate her as the beneficiary of any such benefits.id.at.we reasoned that,as hokanson was to receive the balance of the annuity,it was clear that the decree did nothing more than divide his retirement annuity.id.we continued that annuity,including hokanson share,would cease upon his death.such an award is insufficient to provide hokanson with a survivor annuity.id.in our decision,we rejected hokanson argument that any deficiencies in the decree were rectified in the idaho court clarification order.in so doing,we concluded that the order could have no effect as far as awarding hokanson a survivor annuity was concerned.we stated because the amended divorce decree divided the marital assets,including the retirement benefits,the order is properly considered a modification of that decree and is therefore ineffective for purposes of awarding hokanson a former spouse survivor annuity under h.id.at.
when,as was the case in love,a divorce decree provides that matters relating to property division are reserved for future consideration and judicial disposition,the divorce proceedings are bifurcated.in such a case,when the subsequent proceedings divide marital property,including civil service retirement annuity benefits,and provide for a survivor annuity in the manner required by h and the pertinent opm regulations,there is no conflict with h.the reason is that there is no modification of a h decree.that is because there is one,and only one,decree that divides marital property.see love,at an initial court order dividing marital property,such as the orders in this case,does not change,alter or limit the terms or effect of the previously entered decree of divorce,which dissolved the marriage.the initial property order does not change,alter or limit anything.on the other hand,a decree that divides marital property,including retirement benefits,without expressly providing for,or reserving disposition of,a survivor annuity can not be altered after the employee death by a court order that purports to award such an annuity.such a court order runs afoul of the provisions of h because it constitutes a prohibited modification of the original decree.it is a prohibited modification of the original decree because it alters the terms of the original decree by adding survivor those terms,and because it comes after the death of the employee and involves a survivor annuity under h.see hokanson at.
in this case,the decree did not meet the requirements of h and opm regulations for the express provision of a survivor annuity.the decree divided certain items of marital property.at the same time,the court deferred a division of vaccaro civil service pension and retained jurisdiction over the pension to ensure that vaccaro paid vaccaro her monthly spousal support of.the court characterized vaccaro monthly payment as her share of the community interest in the retirement.thus,it is clear that,in the words of the statute,a survivor annuity was not expressly provided for in the terms of the decree.h.
the order changed the decree.it did so because it added a survivor annuity to a decree that i divided various specified items of marital property ii provided for a monthly payment of a portion of vaccaro retirement annuity iii deferred division of the retirement annuity and retained jurisdiction over it in order to ensure that vaccaro kept up his monthly payments to vaccaro and iv made no mention of a survivor annuity.the order was ineffective as a matter of law under h because it modified the decree after vaccaro death by providing a survivor annuity when the decree made no mention of such an annuity.accordingly,opm did not err in rejecting vaccaro argument that she was entitled to a survivor annuity based upon the order.
we turn now to vaccaro second argument on appeal.within two years after the date of their divorce,vaccaro could have elected to have vaccaro receive a survivor annuity as his former spouse.see j.in addition,opm was required to provide vaccaro with notice of that election right.see vallee office of pers.
the vaccaros were divorced in august of.in october of that year,opm sent vaccaro a notice stating that,because of his divorce,he would now be receiving the full amount of his retirement annuity every month in december of,opm sent vaccaro a form identified as standard form sf,entitled designation of beneficiary.there is no evidence in the record,however,that between the date of his divorce and the date of his death,opm sent vaccaro notice of his election rights under j.consequently,the administrative judge found that opm had failed to show by preponderant evidence that vaccaro received notice of his election rights.vaccaro i,slip op.at.the administrative judge noted,however,that vaccaro never argued that vaccaro was unaware of his election rights.id.rather,vaccaro testified that vaccaro received,and that he intended to elect a survivor annuity for her,but was too ill to do so in a timely fashion.the administrative judge stated that,under the circumstances,vaccaro was required to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that vaccaro intended to provide a survivor annuity for her and would have done so but for the lack of notice.see vallee,at.following a hearing,the administrative judge ruled that vaccaro had failed to carry that burden.although the administrative judge determined that could not be used to designate a survivor benefit,she concluded that vaccaro belief that the form could be used for such a purpose,coupled with his failure to make an application,negated any evidence of intent to provide a survivor annuity for vaccaro.the administrative judge stated the appellant testified that she and vaccaro believed that the was the proper form for election of survivor annuity benefits.nevertheless,between the date of his receipt of such form in december,until his march,death,vaccaro never completed,which he believed would award the appellant a survivor annuity.vaccaro i,slip op.at.the administrative judge also relied on the testimony of carl potter,vaccaro neighbor,that in the months before his death,vaccaro was more lucid and rational than he had ever been before 
on appeal,vaccaro contends that the administrative judge finding that there was insufficient evidence that vaccaro intended to provide a survivor annuity for her is not supported by substantial evidence.she argues that,while her hearing testimony may indicate that she believed that could be used to elect the survivor benefit,it does not indicate that vaccaro understood that the form could be used for the election.however,the administrative judge interpretation of vaccaro testimony is reasonable in that her testimony indicated that she and vaccaro understood that vaccaro had to affirmatively act in order to preserve her right to survivor benefits in fact,the vaccaros daughter stated that in his last days,vaccaro indicated that he wanted to put vaccaro back on his survival benefit sic to make sure my mother was taken care of.lintner aff.at.in addition,the vaccaros son stated that his father intended to place my mom back on his survival benefits however time would allow it.vaccaro aff.at.while both statements indicate that vaccaro may have intended for his wife to receive a survivor annuity,the statements also indicate that he understood that affirmative action on his part was required in order to accomplish that result.however,vaccaro never acted upon that knowledge,even though he did take steps to place vaccaro name on his checking and savings accounts.additionally,no medical evidence in the record substantiates vaccaro claim that vaccaro was too ill to make the intended election.in fact,as noted,carl potter,the vaccaro neighbor,testified that vaccaro was lucid and rational at the time of his death.substantial evidence thus supports the decision of the administrative judge.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the final decision of the board sustaining opm denial of vaccaro application for a survivor annuity is affirmed.
i respectfully dissent.the majority opinion holds that state court divorce decrees,if they dispose of any marital property,can not effectively reserve for future decision the disposition of federal survivor annuities.this approach is inconsistent with this court decision in newman love,with the language and purpose of the survivor annuity statute h,and with federal preemption law.
in love,the office of personnel and management appealed two board decisions concerning love and penn,and this court consolidated the cases for appeal.love,at.in the case involving love,an earlier state court order had dissolved her marriage to a federal retiree without making any disposition of survivor annuities.id.at.the divorce decree specifically ordered that all matters relating to property division and alimony are hereby reserved by the court for future consideration and decision.two subsequent state court orders,entered on the same date,approved a property settlement between the parties and provided for a survivor annuity upon the death of love,respectively.id.at.in the case involving penn,the initial court order dissolving the divorce retired this matter,the divorce,except for the entry of such future orders as may be necessary concerning equitable distribution.the state court later entered an order dividing the parties marital property and awarding a survivor annuity to.we held that the subsequent state court orders in both cases awarding a survivor annuity to the former spouses were effective pursuant to h because the later orders were not a modification of the earlier court orders.id.at.the later court orders were not a modification of the earlier court orders because they did not change,alter,or limit the first order in each case.id.
here,as in love,the initial court order made no disposition of the survivor annuity,but instead reserved resolution of the issue for the future.thus this case is controlled by love.the order at issue on this appeal does not constitute a modification of the order,because it did not change,alter,or limit the first order with respect to the survivor annuity.love,at.nothing in love suggests that the result turned on whether the original decrees made no disposition of any marital property as in love or as here made a disposition of marital property other than the federal survivor annuity.nor has the majority shown why such a rule would make sense.
nothing in hokanson office of personnel management,relied on extensively in the majority opinion,purported to change the decision in love,nor could it do so.in hokanson,the initial state court order precluded any award of a survivor annuity.id.at.the initial court order awarded hokanson,as her portion of said civil service retirement benefits,the sum of per month.id.at emphasis added.it also stated that t he balance of the civil service retirement benefits shall be paid to hokanson.id.at first brackets added second and third brackets in original.the initial order made no reservation of the survivor annuity issue.we held that a subsequent order awarding hokanson a survivor annuity was a modification because the provision of a survivor annuity was inconsistent with the express terms of the initial order.id.at.this case is governed by love,not hokanson.
the decision today is also directly contrary to the language of the survivor annuity statute.section provides that opm must honor a state court order awarding a survivor annuity to a former spouse,except in one limited the order is a modification of a disposition of the survivor annuity in an earlier order.the statute provides in pertinent part that 
h subject to paragraphs through of this subsection,a former spouse of a deceased employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or property settlement incident to such decree.
for the purposes of this subchapter,a modification in a decree,order,agreement,or election referred to in paragraph of this subsection shall not be effective 
a if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or member concerned,and 
b to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.
h emphases added.it is clear from the language of the statute that a prohibited modification only exists to the extent that such modification involves an annuity.if the original decree did not resolve the annuity question,a subsequent order providing for an annuity is not a modification that involves an annuity.in this case,the initial order of august,made no disposition of the survi
