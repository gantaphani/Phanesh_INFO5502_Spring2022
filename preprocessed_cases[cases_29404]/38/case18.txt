after providing medicaid coverage for over years for and year old children whose families met requirements,in,maine sought to drop that coverage by proposing an amendment to its medicaid state plan.the federal department of health and human services dhhs secretary disapproved the amendment,stating that it plainly violates a federal statute,gg,part of the patient protection and affordable care act aca,stat.section gg requires states accepting medicaid funds to maintain their medicaid eligibility standards for children until october.
maine dhhs now petitions for review,arguing that the federal disapproval is unconstitutional.it says that under portions of national federation of independent businesses sebelius nfib,d,gg as applied here is unconstitutionally coercive in violation of the spending clause and,independently,that it violates maine right to equal sovereignty as recognized in shelby county holder,d,and like cases.
the united states says the statute as applied here is constitutional,fitting easily within congressional spending power to condition federal medicaid grants.the attorney general of maine,janet mills,as interested,argues that the rejection of maine dhhs proposed amendment is constitutional.and amici health professionals explain the history and importance of the medicaid health care provisions for this age group 
for the reasons that follow,we hold that the statute is constitutional as applied here.
background 
the medicaid act,et,first enacted in,provides federal funds to states to assist them in paying for the medical care of needy individuals.nfib.at.the secretary of the dhhs administers the medicaid program through the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms.dep t of health human servs.ahlborn,d.
states are not required to participate in medicaid,but all of them do.id.maine began participating in medicaid in,shortly after the program inception.see advisory comm on intergovernmental relations,intergovernmental problems in medicaid,available at http.in order to receive medicaid funding,states must comply with federal criteria governing matters such as who receives care and what services are provided at what cost.nfib.at.to this end,states must submit to cms a state medicaid plan that details the nature and scope of the state medicaid program.states must also submit any amendments to the plan that they may make from time to time.and they must receive the agency approval of the plan and any amendments.douglas indep.living ctr.of,d.cms reviews the states plans and their proposed amendments to determine whether they comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements governing the medicaid program.id.citing a,b,a,b et.
when congress passed the medicaid act,it expressly reserved t he right to alter,amend,or repeal any provision of the medicaid statute.nfib.at quoting.it has exercised that power.congress has,in fact,provided greater medicaid eligibility on numerous occasions.from the start,the act has mandated coverage for certain children,and over time it has increased the eligibility by changing age and income requirements.see social security amendments of,a,b,stat,codified at b.for example,approximately years ago,congress required participating states to include among their beneficiaries pregnant women with family incomes up to of the federal poverty level,children up to age at the same income levels,and children ages to with family incomes up to of the poverty level.nfib.at ginsburg,dissenting.
before the expansion of medicaid effected by the aca in,medicaid did not require states to cover,children ages to as a condition of participation in the program,but it permitted states to do so at the state option.see a i.states which chose to do so were required to provide the same mandatory benefits to children aged to as they provided for other children.
from to the present,maine medicaid program,mainecare,has provided medicaid coverage to individuals aged to.although considered children for medicaid purposes,such individuals are otherwise considered adults under maine law.see.tit.mainecare makes up a major portion of maine annual outlays,accounting for just over of the state total budget in 
in,as part of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra,stat,congress offered stimulus funds to states which agreed to maintain their medicaid eligibility criteria at july,levels until december.id.f a,h,stat.at.two of the purposes of the arra were to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery and to stabilize state and local government budgets,in order to minimize and avoid reductions in essential services and counterproductive state and local tax increases.id.a,stat.at.maine accepted those funds and the concordant conditions,which included continuing to provide coverage to to year olds until december.
the aca,enacted on march,contains a moe provision,now codified at gg,which provides,in relevant part,that states,in order to continue receiving medicaid funds,
shall not have in effect eligibility standards,methodologies,or procedures that are more restrictive than the eligibility standards,methodologies,or procedures,respectively that as of march,are applicable to determining the eligibility for medical assistance of any child who is under years of age or such higher age as the state may have elected.
maine had elected to cover to year olds.the requirement of the moe provision is in effect until october.gg.in other words,beginning march,in order to continue receiving those medicaid funds they had received for this population,states were required to freeze their eligibility standards for children for a period of approximately nine years.those standards included maine provision of coverage for to year olds.
in short,in,maine agreed to continue providing coverage,as it had since,for individuals aged to through as a condition of receiving federal stimulus funds under the arra.the aca in then required maine to continue doing so for another nine years as a condition of receiving medicaid funds.maine dhhs complains that it did not have an opportunity to restrict its eligibility standards for children after it accepted funds under the arra but before the aca went into effect.
maine is required by its state constitution to have a balanced budget.see me.const,pt d,id.faced with a budget deficit in,maine governor proposed eliminating mainecare eligibility for and year olds not otherwise covered by medicaid.the legislature voted in favor of that elimination of coverage,among other budget cuts.maine dhhs projected that removing and year olds from the program would save maine million but cause the state to lose million in federal funds.
in august,maine dhhs submitted a state plan amendment to the dhhs that eliminated coverage of and year olds,among other changes.on january,cms issued an initial decision allowing most other cuts but declining to approve maine dhhs amendment as to eliminating coverage for and year olds because it did not comply with gg.cms rejected maine dhhs arguments that the moe provision was an unconstitutional exercise of congress spending power under the supreme court decision in nfib.cms,on reconsideration,affirmed the disapproval of the state plan amendment,this time simply stating that the proposed amendment was inconsistent with the moe provision and that the agency did not have the authority to adjudicate the constitutional questions raised by maine dhhs.this petition for judicial review followed.
maine dhhs brings a twofold constitutional challenge to the moe provision before us.first,it renews its argument that the moe provision is unconstitutional under the spending clause.second,it contends for the first time that the moe provision violates the doctrine of equal sovereignty as articulated in shelby county holder,d.
we review these constitutional challenges de novo.see court reviewing agency action must decide all relevant questions of law and interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,and shall set aside agency action found to be contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity see also united states rene,cir review of constitutional challenge to a federal statute is de novo 
ii.spending clause challenge 
the spending clause grants congress the power to pay the debts and provide for the general welfare of the united states.nfib.at quoting const.art.i,cl.maine dhhs argues that application of gg in these circumstances exceeds congress power under the spending clause for two reasons it is unconstitutionally coercive under nfib and it violates the principle of pennhurst state school hospital halderman,d.nfib itself shows that both of these contentions are without merit.the moe provision is analogous to past modifications of medicaid that nfib deemed constitutionally permissible.
nfib sebelius and the spending clause 
in nfib,the supreme court considered constitutional challenges to two provisions of the aca to the individual mandate,which required most americans to maintain a minimum level of health insurance coverage,and to the significant expansion of the medicaid program,which required states to provide specified health care to all individuals with incomes below percent of the poverty level but at a higher federal financial participation rate as a condition of the state continued participation in medicaid.at.in a fractured decision,the court upheld the individual mandate as a permissible exercise of congress taxing power,but found severable and struck down as beyond congress spending clause authority the provision penalizing states that did not participate in the new expansion of the medicaid funding with the loss of all medicaid funding.id.at.the court struck down only the penalty for noncompliance,not the expansion itself.id.at.that is,the court held that the dhhs could not condition the granting of all federal medicaid funds on a state participation in the new expanded program,but was permitted to condition funds for the new expanded program on participation in the new program.the court made this explicit 
nothing in our opinion precludes congress from offering funds under the affordable care act to expand the availability of health care,and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use.what congress is not free to do is to penalize states that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing medicaid funding.
seven justices concluded that the penalty of taking away existing medicaid funding from states which declined to sign up for the new expanded medicaid program was unconstitutional,but they were unable to agree on a single or consistent rationale.chief justice roberts,in a plurality opinion joined by justice breyer and justice kagan,offered one rationale for that holding.a joint dissent authored by justice scalia,justice kennedy,justice thomas,and justice alito offered another.
the plurality approach 
the plurality began its analysis by noting that the medicaid expansion of the aca dramatically increase d state obligations under medicaid.id.at.under the system,states were required to cover only certain discrete categories of needy individuals pregnant women,children,needy families,the blind,the elderly,and the disabled.id.citing a.the medicaid program expansion,in contrast,require d states to expand their medicaid programs to cover all individuals under the age of with incomes below percent of the federal poverty line.id.citing a a i viii 
the plurality reiterated the longstanding rule that congress may use its power under the spending clause to condition federal grants to states upon the states taking certain actions that congress could not require them to take.id.quoting coll.sav.bank.prepaid postsecondary educ.expense,d.but,in order for an exercise of the spending power to be deemed legitimate,the state must voluntarily and knowingly accept the terms of the deal.id.at quoting pennhurst,at.put differently,congress may use its spending power to create incentives for states to act in accordance with federal policies,but it oversteps its authority when pressure turns into compulsion.id.quoting charles steward mach.davis.this limit on congress spending power is necessary to ensur e that spending clause legislation does not undermine the status of the states as independent sovereigns in our federal system.id.
the plurality opinion reasoned that,while congress is entitled to condition the receipt of funds on the states complying with restrictions on the use of those funds in order to ensure that the funds are spent according to congress view of the general welfare,when congress places conditions on funds that do not govern the use of those funds,the conditions are properly viewed as a means of pressuring the states to accept policy changes.id.at.the plurality determined that the latter situation obtained with respect to the medicaid program expansion.that expansion,chief justice roberts explained,
accomplishe d a shift in kind,not merely degree.the original program was designed to cover medical services for four particular categories of the needy the disabled,the blind,the elderly,and needy families with dependent children previous amendments to medicaid eligibility merely altered and expanded the boundaries of these categories.under the aca,medicaid is no longer a program to care for the neediest among us,but rather an element of a comprehensive national plan to provide universal health insurance coverage.
id.at.the plurality viewed the medicaid expansion as creating an entirely new health care program,participation in which was a condition of states receiving even continued funding for an old program medicaid.see id.at.this meant that the medicaid expansion was a condition upon the receipt of funds that did not govern the use of those funds.
the plurality next considered whether the financial inducement offered by congress as to the new program expansion was so coercive as to pass the point at which pressure turns into compulsion.id.at quoting south dakota dole,d internal quotation marks omitted.the precedent for this portion of the analysis was the court decision in dole.dole had considered whether congress threat to withhold five percent of a state federal highway funds if the state did not raise its minimum drinking age to was permissible under the spending clause.dole,at.dole held that it was permissible.id.at.the nfib plurality distinguished dole,saying while the condition was not a restriction on how the highway funds were to be used,it was not impermissibly coercive,because congress was offering only relatively mild encouragement to the states.nfib.at quoting dole,at.
by contrast,the plurality found that the financial inducement and penalty in the new medicaid program expansion was much more than relatively mild encouragement it was a gun to the head.id.importantly,the plurality expressly acknowledged that congress is permitted to modify the medicaid program,and to condition states continuing participation in medicaid upon compliance with those modifications,as it has done on numerous occasions in the past.id.at 
the plurality found that the new medicaid program expansion was much more than a simple modification it was a dramatic transform ation of the program.nfib.at.states could not have anticipated that their entitlement to medicaid funds would become conditioned on providing new medical care to all individuals with incomes below percent of the poverty line.id.thus,the new medicaid program expansion violated the rule of pennhurst,which provides that congress may not surpris e states participating in a cooperative program with or retroactive conditions.id.quoting pennhurst,at.
the joint dissent approach 
the joint dissent analysis of the constitutionality of the medicaid expansion differed significantly from that of the plurality.the focus of the joint dissent was on the concept of coercion,which it defined simply i f states really have no choice other than to accept the package,the offer is coercive,and the conditions can not be sustained under the spending power.id.at scalia,kennedy,thomas alito,dissenting.the justices cautioned,however,that courts should not conclude that legislation is unconstitutional on this ground unless the coercive nature of an offer is unmistakably clear.id.at.emphasizing that medicaid constitutes the largest line item in states budgets,as well as the apparent view of congress that no state would refuse to participate in the new medicaid program expansion,the joint dissent concluded that the expansion exceeded congress power under the spending clause.id.at.
application of nfib to the disapproval here based on gg 
when a majority of the supreme court agrees on a result but no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices,the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds marks united states,d quoting gregg georgia,d plurality opinion.in nfib,the plurality invalidated the medicaid expansion on narrower grounds than did the joint dissent.the plurality found a spending clause violation because it determined that the medicaid program expansion was an entirely new program,participation in which was a condition on continued receipt of medicaid funds,and because the loss of medicaid funds would have been so consequential to the states that states had no real option to refuse.in other words,the plurality found that the expansion placed a condition on the receipt of funds that did not govern the use of those funds and that the condition was unduly coercive.the joint dissent,in contrast,would have invalidated the expansion based on a finding of coercion alone.hence,the plurality rationale was narrower.see pasachoff,conditional spending after nfib sebelius the example of federal education law,am,bagenstos,the anti leveraging principle and the spending clause after nfib,geo,rejecting the proposition that the plurality analysis relied only upon the size of the grant at issue.thus,we apply the plurality approach to gg.
under that analysis,maine dhhs spending clause challenge fails.indeed,the plurality opinion precludes us from finding that there is a spending clause problem with gg.the moe provision applied to the provision of care to and year olds,unlike the new medicaid program expansion first appearing in the aca,is not a new program.it is simply an unexceptional alter ation of the boundaries of the categories of individuals covered under the old medicaid program,completely analogous to the many past alterations of the program that nfib expressly found to be constitutional.see nfib.at.
section gg differs from the new program expansion considered in nfib in several critical ways.as an initial matter,gg does not expand medicaid eligibility at all.it simply requires a state,as a condition of continued participation in medicaid,to maintain its medicaid eligibility standards for children for nine years.see gg moe provision applies to the eligibility standards,methodologies,and procedures that are applicable to determining the eligibility for medical assistance of any child who is under years of age or such higher age as the state may have elected.as nfib noted,the medicaid expansion require d states to expand their medicaid programs by to cover all individuals under the age of with incomes below percent of the federal poverty line and establishe d a new e ssential health benefits package.at citing a a i viii,k,b,b.
what is more,gg requires states to maintain eligibility standards for a population children of certain ages that has historically been covered by medicaid.maine dhhs admits in its argument that the classic form of medicaid provided coverage for the blind,the disabled,the elderly,and needy families with dependent children.in fact,the medicaid program has an extensive history of covering to year olds.at the time of medicaid enactment in,the program included some and year olds within the population of children that states had to cover.it did so first by requiring states to match the coverage of social assistance programs like aid for families with dependent children afdc,which defined eligible children to include and year olds in particular educational programs.see a providing that afdc was available to any dependent child,defined as a needy child who has been deprived of parental support or care and who is living with one of several enumerated relatives,and who is a under the age of eighteen,or b under the age of and a student regularly attending certain educational programs social security amendments of,a,a,stat,codified at a a state plan for medical assistance must provide for making medical assistance available to all individuals receiving aid or assistance under state plans approved under afdc.
the medicaid program also mandated that states provide medical assistance to all under individuals who would have qualified as children for afdc but for their age,thus removing the educational condition that limited the class of and year olds covered under afdc.see id.b,stat.at codified at b see also id,stat.at codified at a i.thus,from its early days,medicaid contemplated mandatory coverage of some and year olds,due to their status in federal law as children in need.such a mandatory coverage requirement was in place when maine joined medicaid in.the mandate to cover children under who would qualify for afdc but for their age did not become optional until more than a decade later.see omnibus budget reconciliation act of,b,stat,codified at a i id.a,stat.at codified at b.
there is an additional relevant point.the category of children for which a state must provide coverage has remained subject to expansion throughout the history of medicaid.alterations to the category of needy children occurred repeatedly in the,with states being required to cover an expanding group of children based on changing age and income requirements.importantly,in,congress required states to cover all year olds who met certain income eligibility requirements,irrespective of their dependent status.omnibus budget reconciliation act of,a,stat,codified at n id.a a,stat.at codified at a a i vii.in this way,children aged historically treated by afdc and medicaid in the same manner as children under thus became included in the mandatorily covered category without any condition other than their income level.that is so even though year olds are for many other purposes,including voting,treated as adults rather than children.
the history of medicaid treatment of,and year olds further demonstrates that application of gg here as to the treatment of and year olds accomplishes a shift in degree,rather than in kind.nfib.at see also id.at noting that a medicaid amendment requiring states to cover pregnant women and increasing the number of eligible children can hardly be described as a major change in a program that from its inception provided healthcare for families with dependent children emphasis added 
two further differences between the moe provision and the new medicaid program expansion considered in nfib support the conclusion that the moe provision did not accomplish a shift in kind.first,the moe provision uses the same funding mechanism as medicaid,whereas the expansion uses a new,more generous federal funding mechanism.second,under gg,maine is required only to maintain its current benefits for and year olds,whereas the medicaid expansion required states to provide a new e ssential health benefits package to all new medicaid recipients.nfib.at first alteration in original.the nfib court explicitly mentioned both of these features of the expansion in its analysis.it noted that the manner in which the expansion was structured indicate d that congress recognized it was enlisting the states in a new health care program because congress created a separate funding provision to cover the costs of providing services to any person made newly eligible by the expansion and because congress mandated that newly eligible persons receive a level of coverage that is less comprehensive than the traditional medicaid benefit package.id.at.
in short,the moe provision as applied here does not create a new program and falls comfortably within congress express reservation of power to alter or amend the terms of the medicaid statute in its coverage of previously covered groups.see cong.research,selected issues related to the effect of nfib sebelius on the medicaid expansion requirements in section of the affordable care act july,available at http concluding that the moe provision of the aca remains valid after nfib because it is not part of the new medicaid expansion program for which the states must have a genuine choice.further,the states had notice at the inception of the medicaid program that continued participation by a state in medicaid might be conditioned on a requirement such as the moe provision here.
as a result,there is no spending clause violation under nfib.see also california united states,cir rejecting california argument that congress can not introduce new conditions on participation in medicaid because california now has no choice but to remain in the program in order to prevent a collapse of its medical system stowell ives,cir finding that statute providing that dhhs would not approve a state plan for medical assistance if the state reduced payment levels for the afdc program provided incentives not commands to the states,since states could choose to maintain afdc benefits or to reduce them and risk losing federal funding.rather,this is one of the typical case s in which we look to the states to defend their prerogatives by adopting the simple expedient of not yielding to federal blandishments when they do not want to embrace the federal policies as their own.nfib.at quoting massachusetts mellon.
maine dhhs arguments to the contrary are unconvincing.first,maine dhhs argues that the moe provisions are an integral part of the medicaid expansion that was considered in nfib,and so they must be struck down as a direct implementation of the ruling in nfib.not so.the plurality focused exclusively on the amendments to medicaid that required states to meet the health care needs of the entire nonelderly population with income below percent of the poverty level.nfib.at.the court did not hold,or even intimate,that other changes to medicaid wrought by the aca,such as the moe provision at issue here,were constitutionally infirm.to the contrary,the plurality expressly stated that it was holding unconstitutional only the sanction of withholding all medicaid funding from states that refused to accept this basic change in the nature of medicaid.id.at.that remedy d id not require striking down other portions of the affordable care act.id.
second,maine dhhs contends that,regardless of its earlier choice to provide coverage for and year olds,congress had not previously mandated this coverage,so the moe coverage is new.it argues that congress can not threaten to withdraw all medicaid funds from a state for failing or refusing to cover categories of adults for whom medicaid has never previously mandated coverage,regardless of the fact the state had chosen to provide such coverage.in fact,congress can do so and it has done so,on numerous occasions.moreover,the nfib plurality expressly said congress is allowed to do so,so long as the change effected by the expansion is a shift in degree rather than a shift in kind.see id.at.nfib approved of a past amendment that newly required states to cover pregnant women that was a shift in degree and not in kind,as is this.id.at.further,application here of gg concerns children,a classic medicaid program objective,not adults.
third,maine dhhs argues that gg is coercive because when a federal program is as large as medicaid is,the state has no option but to participate.that is not the test nfib has adopted.even were the question of tests open,maine dhhs spending clause claim based upon coercion alone does not work.as the supreme court noted long ago,an attempt to determine when inducement to comply with a condition on the use of federal funds crosses the line into compulsion would plunge the law into endless difficulties.davis,at cardozo,see also oklahoma schweiker,the courts are not suited to evaluating whether the states are faced with an offer they can not refuse or merely a hard choice.
maine dhhs argument that the moe provision is indistinguishable from the medicaid expansion considered in nfib is,as explained,unpersuasive.as it affects maine,the moe provision requires maine to do no more than continue to cover individuals aged to for a period of nine years,and in exchange maine will receive the classic funding.by contrast,the new medicaid program expansion would have required maine to cover all individuals indefinitely.nfib.at.those changes are not the same nor even analogous 
claimed pennhurst anti retroactivity violation 
maine dhhs also argues that the application to it of the moe provision violates the pennhurst principle because congress changed the deal it offered to maine in.maine dhhs points out that,in,maine was required to maintain eligibility standards only through in order to get the stimulus funds it had chosen to seek.then,in,with the passage of the aca,maine was required to maintain those standards through in order to avoid losing all medicaid funds.
this retroactivity argument fails.in pennhurst,the supreme court explained that legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of a contract in return for federal funds,the states agree to comply with federally imposed conditions.at.but a state can not voluntarily and knowingly accept the terms of the contract if it is unaware of the conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected of it.id.thus,if congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys,it must do so unambiguously it may not surpris e participating states with post acceptance or retroactive conditions.id.at.
the aca did not surprise maine with a retroactive condition.because congress has reserved in the medicaid act the power to alter or amend the medicaid program,states have had fair notice that congress may make incremental changes such as increasing the number of eligible children.nfib.at here,congress did not even go that far instead,it merely required that states continue providing coverage to children on the same terms as were in effect on the date of the aca passage.maine dhhs appears to argue that it could not have foreseen that in exchange for stimulus funds it would be locked into those coverage levels at a later time.but this modest change falls within the medicaid act broad reservation clause.maine was on notice,both before and after accepting stimulus funds,that an incremental alteration of medicaid might change the conditions on participation in the medicaid program in the way that gg has.put differently,maine was not unaware of the conditions on its participation in medicaid or unable to ascertain what was expected of it,pennhurst,at,when it chose to constitutional infirmity here.
iii.equal sovereignty claim 
maine dhhs also argues that the moe provision deprives maine of its right to equal sovereignty under shelby county holder,d,because it prohibit s maine from exercising the prerogative to design its medicaid laws in ways that many of its sister states remain free to do.this argument fails at every step of the analysis.first,maine dhhs premise that gg singles out certain states for disparate treatment is wrong.shelby county is also not relevant here because gg does not similarly effect a federal intrusion into a sensitive area of state or local policymaking.finally,there is no constitutional problem because any disparate treatment caused by gg is sufficiently related to the problem that the statute was designed to address.
shelby county 
shelby county considered the continuing constitutionality of and of the voting rights act vra of.section set forth a coverage formula that identified jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination,and required those jurisdictions to obtain preclearance for any change in voting procedures by proving that the change had neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.id.at alteration in original.in the years after the vra passage,congress repeatedly the act most recently in,but it made no changes to coverage formula after.id.at.
the shelby county court held that coverage formula unconstitutionally infringed the equal sovereignty of the states.id.at.the majority explained that,when a statute authorizes federal intrusio
