james batson,appeals the district court affirmance of the social security commissioner commissioner denial of his application for disability insurance benefits under sections i and of the social security act.batson contends that the decision of the social security administration administrative law judge alj that batson was not disabled as defined by the social security act,and therefore not eligible for social security disability insurance benefits,is not supported by substantial evidence and is based on an improper application of legal precedent.we have jurisdiction under to consider batson appeal.because substantial evidence supports the alj decision and the alj committed no legal error,we affirm.
batson suffers from cervical degenerative disease.on september,batson underwent cervical surgery in an attempt to relieve his symptoms.batson believed the surgery to be successful,but eventually his pain and symptoms returned.on october,batson was terminated from his employment,and he applied for disability insurance benefits on november,alleging an inability to work because of upper and lower back injuries.batson claim was denied both initially and upon reconsideration.on batson further request,a hearing was then held before an alj on october.on october,the alj issued a written decision finding batson ineligible for disability insurance benefits.the social security administration appeals council denied batson request for review,and batson appealed to the united states district court for the district of oregon,which by an opinion and order dated april,affirmed the alj determination that batson was not eligible to receive disability insurance benefits.
on batson appeal,we review de novo the district court order upholding a decision of the commissioner denying benefits to an applicant.benton barnhart,cir.the commissioner decision must be affirmed by us if supported by substantial evidence,and if the commissioner applied the correct legal standards.id.under this standard,the commissioner findings are upheld if supported by inferences reasonably drawn from the record,see gallant heckler,cir,and if evidence exists to support more than one rational interpretation,we must defer to the commissioner decision,see morgan commissioner,cir 
to establish whether he qualifies for benefits,batson has the burden of proving an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.the social security regulations set forth a sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant has met this standard.see.first,the alj must determine whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity.see b.if not,the alj then must determine whether the claimant impairments are severe within the meaning of the regulations.see c.if the impairments are severe,then the alj must compare the claimant impairments to the impairments listed in the listing of impairments set forth in appendix to.see d.if any severe impairment equals a listed impairment,the claimant must be found to be disabled.however,if a decision as to whether a severe impairment corresponds to a listed impairment can not be made on medical factors alone,the alj must proceed to the final two steps in the sequential evaluation process.
at step four,the alj must consider the functional limitations imposed by the claimant impairments and determine the claimant residual functional capacity.if the claimant retains the capacity to perform his or her past relevant work,defined as work the claimant has performed in the past fifteen years,see b,the claimant is not disabled.see f.if the alj determines that the claimant can no longer perform past relevant work,the alj at step five must consider whether the claimant can perform other work in the national economy.see g.if the claimant can perform other work in the national economy,then the claimant may not be found to be disabled.id.
batson contends that the alj findings that batson does not have a back impairment under the listing of impairments and that batson is capable of performing light work are not supported by substantial evidence.batson challenges the alj decision to give only minimal evidentiary weight to the opinions of batson treating physicians.batson also asserts that the alj erred in concluding that batson subjective pain testimony was not fully credible.finally,batson maintains that the alj erred in determining that batson is capable of performing light work based on his residual functional capacity.we review each of these contentions in turn.
batson first alleges that the alj improperly discounted the views of claimant treating physicians timothy keenen and lynn kadwell,who both opined that plaintiff met or equaled the criteria for a listing found at pt,subpt.p,app,c disorders of the spine if correct,that finding would mean that a conclusive presumption of disability applies.see marcia sullivan,d.however,an alj need not give controlling weight to the opinion of a treating physician.although a treating physician opinion is generally afforded the greatest weight in disability cases,it is not binding on an alj with respect to the existence of an impairment or the ultimate determination of disability.tonapetyan halter,cir.the alj may disregard the treating physician opinion whether or not that opinion is contradicted.magallanes bowen,cir.
in this case,the alj determined that the treating physicians views carried only minimal evidentiary weight.the alj discounted keenen view because it was in the form of a checklist,did not have supportive objective evidence,was contradicted by other statements and assessments of batson medical condition,and was based on batson subjective descriptions of pain the alj gave minimal weight to kadwell opinion,because it,too,was based on batson subjective complaints without objective evidence,was conclusionary in the form of a,and lack ed substantive medical findings to support her conclusion.the alj also noted that kadwell opinion was based in part on keenen records and findings,the value of which the alj had discounted.
the alj also discounted the views of keenan and kadwell because of their conflict with the results of a consultative medical evaluation performed by bradley bergquist.bergquist examined batson and determined that batson disc herniation had been eliminated with surgery and did not remain a cause of disability.bergquist concluded that batson symptoms could not be explained on a physical basis,that batson inability to work was based solely on his subjective complaints,and that batson was objectively able to work.
when presented with conflicting medical opinions,the alj must determine credibility and resolve the conflict.matney sullivan,cir.greater weight must be given to the opinion of treating physicians,and in the case of a conflict the alj must give specific,legitimate reasons for disregarding the opinion of the treating physician.id.these rules were honored,for in this case the alj gave specific and legitimate reasons to discount the opinions of keenen and kadwell on the degree of batson impairment.further,an alj may discredit treating physicians opinions that are conclusory,brief,and unsupported by the record as a whole,or by objective medical findings,tonapetyan,at.here,the alj found this to be true for the opinions of both keenen and kadwell.we hold that the alj did not err in giving minimal evidentiary weight to the opinions of batson treating physicians.see tonapetyan,at lester chater,cir.
batson also argues that the alj improperly discredited batson pain testimony.in deciding whether to admit a claimant subjective symptom testimony,the alj must engage in a analysis.smolen chater,cir.under the first step prescribed by smolen,which is sometimes known as the cotton test the claimant must produce objective medical evidence of underlying impairment,and must show that the impairment,or a combination of impairments,could reasonably be expected to produce pain or other symptoms.id.at.if this cotton test is satisfied,and if the alj credibi
