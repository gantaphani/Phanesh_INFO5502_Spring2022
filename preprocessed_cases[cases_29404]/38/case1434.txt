donald buchanan appeals from the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court affirming a decision of the board of veterans appeals the board which denied buchanan claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder.buchanan nicholson.because the veterans court accepted the board legally erroneous interpretation of the statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining to a veteran ability to prove service connection through competent lay evidence,we vacate the veterans court decision and remand for reconsideration of all of the evidence of record,including the lay evidence,under the correct statutory and regulatory construction.
background 
buchanan served on active duty in the united states army from january to december and also from may to june.he was honorably discharged following his first period of service,but received an other than honorable discharge after his second.in,he filed a claim for service connection for a psychiatric disorder.the board denied his claim in,finding that his service medical records were negative for any manifestations of psychiatric problems and that a psychiatric disability was not demonstrated until,nearly three years after his first period of service had ended.again,in june,a department of veterans affairs dva regional office ro denied service connection for a nervous condition.since that time,buchanan attempts to establish service connection have resulted in his claim being sent back and forth between the ro and the board.essentially,each remand or reopening of his claim by the board was accompanied by a dva medical examination.thus,by the time the board rendered its september,decision,which is the subject of this appeal,buchanan had undergone three dva medical examinations over a period of five years.
the first of such examinations occurred in july and resulted in a diagnosis of s chizophrenia,chronic paranoid type,severe.at.the opinion of the examiner was that i t appears that this disorder first began while he was in the service,although there is no record in his which would substantiate his claim of receiving counsel to seek psychiatric treatment while in the service.id.
the second dva examination occurred in november and also reflects a diagnosis of s chizophrenia,paranoid type,chronic,severe.appellant app.the examiner summarized his findings and concluded by stating while it is at least as likely as not that the veteran symptoms predate his first documented treatment in for psychosis,it is not possible without prior records to determine when these symptoms first occurred.appellant app.
the third dva examination in march resulted in a similar diagnosis,s chizophrenia,paranoid type,chronic.appellant app.this examiner likewise summarized her findings,in pertinent part,as follows 
review of the veteran revealed numerous layperson affidavits attesting to a change in the veteran interpersonal style and presentation while the veteran was in the military between and,and after his discharge from the military.however,there is no medical documentation within the veteran to substantiate the presence of any psychotic symptoms or treatment for psychiatric conditions while the veteran was on active duty thus,given the absence of any medical documentation from the veteran period of active duty service from january to december,and given the absence of any medical documentation of psychiatric symptoms or treatment within the presumptive period,it is this clinician clinical opinion that the veteran onset of symptoms of schizophrenia did not occur during his first period of active service or during the one year presumptive period.
appellant app.
in support of his claim,buchanan submitted several affidavits from lay witnesses,including his relatives,acquaintances,and a sergeant who led the unit to which buchanan was assigned in,describing their perceptions of the onset of his symptoms while in service or soon thereafter.additionally,he submitted an august medical opinion from kenneth manges,who opined that buchanan signs and symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia first appeared in service and that his paranoid schizophrenia manifested itself to a compensable degree during the first year after his discharge from his first period of service.at.
in considering whether buchanan established service connection,the board focused on whether the evidence linked the veteran psychiatric disability to a disease or injury that was incurred in,or was aggravated by,service from january to december or whether the evidence demonstrated the presence of that disability to a degree of ten percent within the first year such that service connection would be presumed pursuant to.the board recognized that buchanan statements and testimony along with the lay statements indicate that his psychiatric disability began during his first period of service because that is when his behavior changed.the board also noted that what it called the objective medical evidence did not corroborate the presence of psychiatric problems in service or within the first year after service except by medical history reported by buchanan.the board then stated recollections of medical problems some years after the veteran separation from service have slight probative value and lack credibility absent confirmatory clinical records to substantiate such recollections.appellant app.
after discussing the four medical opinions,three from the dva examiners and one from manges,the board found the opinion of the examiner who conducted the third dva examination to be the most persuasive because it relie d on the objective medical documents in the record rather that sic the slight probative recollections of the veteran,his relatives,acquaintances,and a service comrade.appellant app.the board indicated that it did not find manges opinion persuasive because it relied on the recollections expressed in the lay statements,and that the other two dva examiner opinions did not unequivocally state that the veteran psychiatric disability began in service or within one year of his separation from service in december.id.thus,the board found that the preponderance of the evidence was against buchanan claim for service connection for a psychiatric disability and denied his claim.
on appeal,the veterans court found that the board decision was not clearly erroneous and that it was supported by an adequate statement of reasons or bases.specifically,the court noted that the board considered the lay and medical evidence of record and concluded that service connection was not warranted because the credible evidence of record did not show the presence of a psychiatric disorder during service or that such disability had manifested to a compensable degree during the applicable presumptive period.the court noted that it was not error for the board to favor the opinion of one competent medical expert over another when the board provides an adequate statement of its reasons and bases.further,the court did not find error in the board determination that the lay evidence lacked credibility.finally,the court rejected buchanan request for another medical examination because it found that the third dva examiner opinion was sufficiently detailed and that it thoroughly reviewed the available medical records.thus,the court affirmed the decision of the board denying buchanan claim for service connection.
buchanan timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
