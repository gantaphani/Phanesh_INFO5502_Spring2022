discussion 
background 
the following explanation of the ssa pension offset is drawn primarily from the supreme court opinion in heckler mathews,d.
the social security act provides spousal benefits for husbands and wives of retired and disabled wage earners.before,such benefits were payable only to those husbands who could show that they depended on their wives for more than of their support,while wives were entitled to benefits whether or not they depended on their husbands at all.in,the supreme court held that the dependency requirement violated equal protection,first with respect to widowers benefits,califano goldfarb,d,and then with respect to husbands benefits,califano silbowitz,d mem,aff g.califano jablon,d mem,aff g.
following those opinions,congress repealed the dependency requirement for husbands.social security amendments of,b,stat.it also concluded,however,that eliminating the test could create an unexpected drain on the treasury by increasing the number of husbands who were entitled to benefits.see.congress was especially concerned about retired federal and state employees who would become eligible for husbands benefits.unlike most retirees,who must offset any dual social security benefits against each other,k a,retired government employees were eligible to receive both their full government pensions and full spousal benefits,with no offset.
to address that concern,congress included a pension offset in the amendments to the social security act.with respect to husbands benefits,that offset,codified at c a,provides the amount of a husband insurance benefit for each month shall be reduced but not below zero by an amount equal to of the amount of any monthly periodic benefit payable to the husband for such month which is based upon his earnings while in the service of the federal government.
however,congress also was concerned about upsetting the expectations of federal employees who had planned their retirements in reliance on the version of the social security act.in order to protect those employees,congress enacted a grace period,exempting from the offset those retirees who would become eligible for government retirement benefits between january and december and would have qualified for spousal benefits under the social security act as it was in effect and being administered in january.social security amendments of,g,stat.
plaintiff became eligible to receive his retirement annuity from the postal service between january and december.accordingly,he would be entitled to the exemption from the pension offset if he would have qualified for husbands benefits under the social security act as it was being applied in january.accordingly,plaintiff must show that he received more than of his support from his wife during the period before she began receiving social security benefits 
the ssa has promulgated administrative rules covering the offset and the exception for husbands.the offset is addressed in a a,which provides y our monthly social security benefits as a husband will be reduced each month you are receiving a monthly pension from a federal,state,or local government agency for which you were employed in work not covered by social security.
the exception is covered by b,which provides,as relevant 
the insured person provides of your support if he or she makes regular contributions for your ordinary living costs the amount of these contributions equals or exceeds of your ordinary living costs and any income from sources other than the insured person you have available for support purposes is or less of your ordinary living costs.we will consider any income which is available to you for your support whether or not that income is actually used for your ordinary living costs.ordinary living costs are the costs for your food,shelter,routine medical care,and similar necessities.a contribution may be in cash,goods,or services.
in determining whether a party meets the requirement under,the ssa uses the pooling or method,which creates a rebuttable presumption that members of a household pool their income and are supported equally by the combined amount.batista sullivan,cir see also social security ruling.under the pooling method,the ssa combines the income of the husband and wife divides the pooled income by two,to determine the cost of the husband support and looks at the husband individual income to see whether it is less than or equal to of the cost
