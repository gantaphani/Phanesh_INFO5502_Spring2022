william kelly appeals the judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims denying his application for reimbursement of legal fees and expenses under the equal access to justice act eaja,d.kelly principi,wl.we reverse and remand.
background 
in may,kelly filed a claim that he had balance problems and had been exposed to agent orange during his service in vietnam.the department of veterans affairs va regional office ro subsequently informed him that his submission was insufficient and that he was required to specify a disability.kelly responded that he suffered from a developmental nerve problem that required him to stop working.he said he was being treated but had not received a diagnosis from his doctors.va made a progress note in july of hypertension and ataxia,post agent orange,and kelly underwent a va examination in november,which diagnosed him with dysthimia,secondary type and cerebellar ataxia.he also underwent a va neurology examination in july,which noted an impression of ataxia and a possibility of olivopontocerebellar atrophy opca.he was again examined in august and was diagnosed with opca.he also submitted a july medical record from a private hospital indicating that he suffered from chronic cerebral ataxia of undetermined etiology.see kelly principi,wl,providing a summary of medical evidence before the va.
the ro issued a rating decision in april denying kelly service connection claim.it stated that kelly claimed service connection for an unnamed condition manifested by weakness in the legs,and the condition was subsequently diagnosed as opca.kelly appealed the ro decision to the board of veterans appeals,expressing disagreement with the denial of his claim for service connection exposure to agent orange.the board remanded the claim for additional development and directed the ro to have kelly examined by a neurologist i f and only if kelly claim is found to be well grounded.
on remand,the ro obtained additional medical documentation.kelly also underwent a brain and spinal cord va examination in december.the ro again concluded that olivopontocerebellar degeneration was an appropriate diagnosis and that it was a familial disorder with no known relationship to agent orange exposure.the case was returned to the board,which concluded kelly claim was not well grounded and thereby denied entitlement to service connection for olivopontocerebellar atrophy.in re kelly.the board reasoned that there was no competent evidence that his opca was present in service,compensably disabling within one year after separation from service or otherwise related to service,including herbicide exposure.id.at.it also noted that his condition was not one that is presumed to result from agent orange exposure.id.at.
kelly appealed to the veterans court.while the appeal was pending,the veterans claims assistance act of vcaa,stat,was enacted.in light of this,on january,the court vacated and remanded the board decision with respect to the claim for service connection for opca.kelly also argued that the ro and board had failed to consider his diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia.the court,however,said that his notice of disagreement nod was insufficient to confer it with jurisdiction over that claim.kelly gober,wl.
kelly then filed a motion for reconsideration and for panel review.the government opposed both requests.the motion for reconsideration was denied in a order,which again concluded that the nod was inadequate to confer jurisdiction over kelly ataxia claim.kelly principi,wl.on february,the motion for panel review was granted.in light of congress repeal of the nod jurisdiction requirement on december,veterans education and benefits expansion act of,a,stat,the panel reinstated kelly appeal with respect to his ataxia claim.the panel said that although it reinstated the appeal on the ataxia ground,it made no determination as to whether he ever made any formal or informal claim for service connection for ataxia if he did make such a claim,whether that claim was reasonably raised to the board and if he did not reasonably raise that claim to the board,whether there is a final board decision as to any such claim that is reviewable by this court.kelly principi.
the case was returned to the original judge who noted that the original remand with respect to what he termed the opca claim remained operative.with respect to the ataxia diagnosis,which the panel had reinstated,the court stated that kelly essentially argues that his problems and a developmental nerve problem,for which he received treatment at a va hospital in october,and for which he applied for service connection in may attributable to ataxia,as to which the record on appeal contains a va diagnosis rendered on july,and again on november.kelly principi,at,wl,ataxia remand order citations omitted.in light of this discussion,it held that kelly pending claim for service connection for neurological problems related to agent orange exposure has never been limited to a particular diagnosis in such a way as to preclude him from having va develop his claim for a possible ataxia diagnosis and consider whether such a condition should be awarded service connection.id.at.the court,however,declined to address this issue in the first instance and remanded it,stating if he raises to the board an argument that his ataxia resulted in his symptoms,the board and ro,after any appropriate remand thereto must consider that argument.in addition,the board and the ro must fully develop the ataxia matter as well as his opca claim in accordance with a and and before readjudicating the case,and then must reach a conclusion on that matter.id.
kelly filed an application for reimbursement of attorneys fees and expenses under eaja for his ataxia claim.the veterans court denied the application,determining that he was not a prevailing party.kelly principi,at,wl.vet.cl.memorandum decision,judgment,eaja order.kelly appeals,and we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to a.

we review the veterans court interpretation of eaja de novo.vaughn principi.our review is limited by statute,under which we shall decide all relevant questions of law,including interpreting constitutional and statutory provisions.d.however,unless addressing a constitutional issue,we may not review factual determinations or the application of law to the facts.id.at d.we have recognized,however,that where adoption of a particular legal standard dictates the outcome of a case based on undisputed facts,we may address that issue as a question of law.halpern principi,citing brandenburg principi,bailey principi.
under eaja,a prevailing party in a civil action is entitled to attorneys fees and expenses unless the government position was substantially justified.d a.the essential objective of the eaja is to ensure that persons will not be deterred from seeking review of,or defending against,unjustified governmental action because of the expense involved in the vindication of their rights johnson gonzales,cir quoting clarke immigration naturalization,cir see also sullivan hudson,d.removing such deterrents is imperative in the veterans benefits context,which is intended to be uniquely,hodge west,citations omitted collaro west,and in which veterans generally are not represented by counsel before the ro and the board,see c prohibiting attorneys fees prior to a final board decision.eaja is a vital complement to this system designed to aid veterans,because it helps to ensure that they will seek an appeal when the va has failed in its duty to aid them or has otherwise erroneously denied them the benefits that they have earned.
