these consolidated cases involve claims for survivors benefits under the black lung benefits act blba,et,filed by respondents virginia richards and mary ellen morgan.in both cases,department of labor dol administrative law judges aljs awarded the survivors claims,and the dol benefits review board the board affirmed.union carbide corporation and peabody coal company,the coal mine operators responsible for payment of respondents benefits,petitioned for this court review.petitioners submit that principles of res judicata foreclose of whom previously and unsuccessfully sought blba survivors relying on a recent amendment to the blba to pursue benefits again through a subsequent claim.we disagree.because the amendment created a new cause of action that was unavailable to respondents when they brought their initial claims,res judicata does not bar their subsequent claims.accordingly,we affirm the board awards.
in addition to lifetime disability benefits for coal miners,the blba provides survivors benefits to certain of their dependents.the statute has been substantially amended over the years.initially,a deceased miner qualifying dependents could obtain survivors benefits either by showing that the deceased miner death was caused by pneumoconiosis or by showing that the miner was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis at the time of his death.survivors who proved their entitlement under the latter method were automatically entitled to benefits even if pneumoconiosis played no role in the deceased miners deaths.see a.this automatic derivative benefits scheme was reinforced in the amendments to the blba,which enacted l,providing in no case shall the eligible survivors of a miner who was determined to be eligible to receive benefits under this title at the time of his or her death be required to file a new claim for benefits,or refile or otherwise revalidate the claim of such miner,h,stat.
in,congress scaled back benefits under the blba,eliminating section l provision of automatic derivative survivors benefits.consequently,a survivor filing a claim on or after january,could establish entitlement only by proving that the miner death was due at least in part to pneumoconiosis.see shuff cedar coal,cir.
in,the patient protection and affordable care act aca reinstated section l automatic survivors benefits for claims filed after january,that were pending on or after the aca march,enactment date,section,stat.cwp fund stacy,cir.accordingly,survivors whose claims meet those temporal thresholds need no longer show that the miner death was caused by pneumoconiosis the claimant need only show that the miner was determined to be eligible to receive blba benefits at the time of his death.section is silent as to whether survivors whose previous claims were denied may now receive benefits by filing subsequent claims under amended section l.
dol implementing regulations set forth the protocol for treatment of these subsequent as claims filed more than one year after the effective date of a final order denying a claim previously filed by the claimant under this part.d.the regulations provide 
a subsequent claim shall be processed and adjudicated in accordance with the provisions that govern original claims,except that the claim shall be denied unless the claimant demonstrates that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement has changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.
if the applicable condition s of entitlement relate to the miner physical condition,the subsequent claim may be approved only if new evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent claim establishes at least one applicable condition of entitlement.a subsequent claim filed by a surviving spouse,child,parent,brother,or sister shall be denied unless the applicable conditions of entitlement in such claim include at least one condition unrelated to the miner physical condition at the time of his death.
addressing the effect of res judicata on blba claims,a dol comment to the proposed section d observed that the principles of claim preclusion are applicable to claims under the act.proposed,citing pittston coal grp.sebben.in the context of subsequent claims,however,dol clarified that claim preclusion bars only an attempt to relitigate a cause of action that was previously resolved it has no effect on the litigation of a cause of action which did not exist at the time of the initial adjudication.id.citing lawlor screen serv.corp.
arlie richards worked as a coal miner for over thirty years and was awarded blba benefits in.union carbide paid his blba benefits until his death in january.virginia richards,arlie widow,filed her first claim for survivors benefits in february.after protracted proceedings,an alj ultimately denied her claim on may,because she failed to prove that her husband death was due in part to pneumoconiosis.richards did not appeal that denial,but filed a second,subsequent claim for survivors benefits in may.in october,months before the aca enactment,a dol district director denied that claim because it failed to demonstrate a change in any condition of entitlement,as is required of subsequent claims under section d.richards requested a hearing before an alj.
while that request was pending,congress enacted the aca,restoring automatic derivative survivors benefits under section l.upon a motion from the director of the office of workers compensation programs director,the federal respondent in these cases,the alj acknowledged the change in law and issued a summary decision awarding benefits to richards,since her husband had been receiving benefits at the time of his death.
union carbide appealed to the board,arguing as it does in its instant petition that richards subsequent claim was barred by d and principles of res judicata.in january,the board issued a split en banc decision affirming the alj award of benefits.richards union carbide,black lung juris en banc.the board made four principal determinations.first,it held that the plain text of section l,as amended by section,authorizes its application to subsequent claims.second,it held that richards had demonstrated a change in a condition of entitlement unrelated to her husband physical condition,thus satisfying section d.third,the board concluded that res judicata did not bar richards subsequent claim because a determination of entitlement under section l did not require relitigation of the prior finding that richards death was unrelated to pneumoconiosis.finally,the board modified the benefit accrual date,clarifying that benefits for successful subsequent claims are payable from the month following the prior denial.union carbide timely petitioned for this court review.
don morgan worked as a coal miner for nineteen years and filed a claim for lifetime disability benefits in.an alj approved his claim in,and after more than a decade of proceedings,we affirmed morgan award of benefits in june.peabody coal morgan,app x cir.morgan died months before that decision,in january.
in may,mary ellen morgan,don widow,filed a claim for survivors benefits.the district director initially approved her claim,but an alj denied benefits after determining that morgan had failed to prove that her husband death was due to pneumoconiosis.morgan appealed,but the board affirmed the denial in october.morgan took no further action on her claim,and the board decision became final.
after congress amended the blba via aca section,morgan filed a second,subsequent claim.as he did in richards,the director moved for a summary decision awarding benefits.acknowledging the change in law,the alj granted the motion.peabody,morgan former employer,appealed to the board,arguing that morgan subsequent claim was barred by d and principles of res judicata 
the board affirmed the award,relying on its decision in richards.morgan peabody coal,brb,wl ben.bd.june,unpublished.peabody timely petitioned for this court review.
the central issue before us is whether,in light of the aca amendments to section l of the blba,a final decision denying benefits on a prior claim bars a survivor from receiving benefits through a subsequent claim.we consider this question of law de novo.stacy,at.
petitioners argue that morgan and richards are ineligible for automatic derivative survivors benefits under amended section l.because,unlike past amendments to the blba,section does not expressly authorize departure from the traditional principles of res judicata,petitioners believe that respondents previously denied claims should preclude them from bringing subsequent claims under amended section l.according to petitioners,section did not create a new cause of action,but rather merely created a new theory or method by which survivors may demonstrate entitlement.this change in law,petitioners insist,does not negate the preclusive effect of respondents previously denied claims,particularly because the record evidence remains unchanged since the denial of the respondents initial claims.
relatedly,petitioners say that the board erred in determining that respondents subsequent claims were not barred by d,which requires that a subsequent claim be denied unless the survivor can show a change in the conditions of entitlement unrelated to the decedent physical condition.
petitioners also contend that the board decision in these cases renders meaningless congress requirement that the claims be filed after january,and pending on or after the aca march,enactment date.see section c.by allowing previously denied claimants to file subsequent claims under amended section l,petitioners say the board has created an around section c filing limitations,which congress imposed to mitigate the financial burden of section on coal mine operators.
defending the board holding,respondents say that the plain language of section and amended section l permits awards on survivors subsequent claims,since section states,without qualification,that the amendment appl ies with respect to claims filed within section c time limitations.fed.resp t br.at quoting section c emphasis added by federal respondent.respondents rely on our recent decision in stacy,where we affirmed the applicability of amended section l to a survivor original claim.at.in holding that amended section l applies not only to miners claims but also to those of survivors,we observed that the plain language of that section requires that amended l apply to all claims that satisfy section c s time limitations.id.at.accordingly,since survivors may file subsequent claims under the blba,respondents insist that their instant claims are encompassed by section.
countering petitioners res judicata arguments,respondents contend that section did not merely change the process by which survivors could prove their entitlement,but instead created a new,previously unavailable cause of action.although respondents acknowledge that they presented no new evidence since the denial of their initial claims,they maintain that their subsequent claims rely on facts different from the initial claims,thus rendering res judicata inappropriate.to wit,whereas respondents initial claims turned on whether pneumoconiosis caused the miners deaths,respondents point out that that fact is irrelevant to their subsequent claims under amended section l,which concern only whether the miners were eligible to receive benefits at the time of their deaths.
finally,respondents argue that their reading does not defeat the time limitations in section c,which they believe are still effectuated by the judicially implied requirement that claimants take some affirmative action to initiate the administrative application of section l after january.fed.resp t br.at citing stacy,at.thus,rather than being required to pay all previously denied survivors claims where the miner died while receiving benefits,coal operators must pay only those where a surviving spouse has taken pains to submit a subsequent claim.
looking first to the text of section,we reject petitioners contention that the amendment does not apply to survivors subsequent claims.as we explained in stacy,the plain language of section requires that amended l apply to all claims that satisfy section c s time limitations.at.because congress used the term claims without any qualifying language,and because survivors whose claims were previously denied may file subsequent claims under the blba,see d,the statutory text supports respondents position that amended section l applies to all claims that comply with section c time limitations,including subsequent claims.
petitioners are correct that,in contrast to previous blba amendments,section does not explicitly indicate an intent to override the res judicata effect of previously denied claims.compare section,with,stat,directing the secretary of health,education,and welfare,upon a claimant request,to review and apply amendments to previously denied claims,and pub,stat,may,same,only without the need for a claimant request.but application of section to subsequent claims does not require us to run roughshod over res judicata.rather,res judicata is not implicated by respondents subsequent claims since entitlement under section l,as revived by section,does not require relitigation of the prior findings that the miners deaths were not due to pneumoconiosis.
in this case,respondents easily satisfy.d requirement of showing a change in the conditions of entitlement unrelated to the decedent physical condition.by restoring the derivative entitlement provisions of section l,congress has effectively created a change establishing a new condition of entitlement unrelated to whether the miner died due to pneumoconiosis.
and just as congress created a new condition of entitlement for purposes of section d,so too it created a new cause of action for purposes of res judicata.
by precluding parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate,the doctrine of res judicata minimizes the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits,conserve s judicial resources,and foster s reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.taylor sturgell,internal quotations omitted.however,res judicata does not bar claims that did not exist at the time of the prior litigation.meekins united transp.union,cir.a party invoking res judicata must establish three elements a previous final judgment on the merits,an identity of the cause of action in both the earlier and the later suit,and an identity of parties or their privies in the two suits.id.
identity of the cause of only prong presently in dispute exists if two claims arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions or the same core of operative facts.pueschel united states,cir.while typically it is a new factual development that gives rise to a fresh cause of action,see,lawlor,at,changes in law can also have that effect.for instance,on rare occasions,when a new statute provides an independent basis for relief which did not exist at the time of the prior action,a second action on the new statute may be justified.james moore et,moore federal practice,ed see also clodfelter republic of sudan,wl,at cir.june,maldonado,cir.
like respondents,we recognize that the record evidence has not changed since the denial of the original claims and that the only relevant change is one of law.nevertheless,we conclude that the instant subsequent claims arise from operative facts that are separate and distinct from those underlying respondents initial claims,and therefore constitute new causes of action.whereas respondents initial claims turned on whether the deceased miners died due to pneumoconiosis,these subsequent claims concern only whether the miners were determined to be eligible to receive black lung benefits at the time of their deaths an entirely unrelated factual issue.
meanwhile,the statutory change in law provides a previously unavailable basis for relief that justifies the instant claims,since res judicata does not bar claims that the parties have not had a full and fair opportunity to litigate.sturgell,at.on this point,petitioners cite the supreme court decision in sebben.sebben involved the amendments to the blba,which imposed higher evidentiary standards on miners attempting to receive benefits,but which also required dol to reopen and
