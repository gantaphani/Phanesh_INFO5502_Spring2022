alberta schroeder appeals a grant of summary judgment for the united states in her suit seeking to quiet title in an apartment complex she owns and operates.under the national housing act loan program into which she entered in,schroeder was required to use her property exclusively as housing until she fully repaid her loans.schroeder argues that,although the loans have not yet come due,the government must now accept payment in full on her loans,thereby allowing her to terminate her participation in the national housing act program.the district court ruled that the emergency low income housing preservation act of elihpa forecloses schroeder arguments and declined to grant equitable relief.we affirm the decision of the district court.
factual and procedural background 
i.the housing act of and the emergency low income housing preservation act of 
congress passed the housing act of,to encourage private investment in housing for elderly and rural residents.section of title v of the housing act authorized the department of agriculture farmers home administration fmha which was later incorporated into the rural housing service rhs to make direct loans to borrowers seeking to finance affordable housing rhs loans or loans.see.involved property owners,in exchange for reduced interest rates and other subsidies,agreed to rent their covered properties only to qualified elderly and tenants at affordable rates until the owners had fully repaid their rhs loans.initially,loans made under this program provided borrowers with an unrestricted right to repay their loans at any time.franconia assocs.united states,d.
in,responding to fears that the supply of affordable rural housing was dwindling because borrowers were prepaying their rhs loans,congress enacted elihpa,c under elihpa,rhs may accept prepayments on covered loans only if the property owner first complies with elihpa elaborate requirements designed to preserve housing.iv.united states,cir describing prepayment procedures under c see also kimberly assocs.united states,cir.
under these procedures,the owner must first give notice of intent to prepay.c.then,the government must offer the owner a financial incentive to remain in the program.id.c a.if the owner still wishes to prepay,the owner must offer to sell the property to any qualified nonprofit organization or public agency at fair market value.id.c a i.if the property is not sold within days,rhs may then accept the prepayment from the owner.id.c a ii,at.
in,in response to property owners legal challenges to elihpa,the supreme court held that the act effected a repudiation of the existing loan contracts.franconia,at.on remand,the court of federal claims clarified the property owners rights and recourse the promissory notes at issue could not be much clearer in allowing plaintiffs to prepay at any time,indicating unambiguously that p repayments of scheduled installments,or any portion thereof,may be made at any time at the option of the borrower.franconia assocs.united states,alteration in original.the government,therefore,has a concomitant obligation to accept the prepayment,and elihpa repudiated the property owners rights.id.at.as a result,a property owner whose contracts have been adversely affected by elihpa may bring a claim for damages against the government.franconia,at.
because the united states was not acting in its capacity as sovereign in enacting elihpa,the government may not assert a sovereign immunity defense in such an action.id.at.when the united states enters into contract relations,its rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law applicable to contracts between private individuals.quoting mobil oil exploration producing,united states,d see also kimberly,at.but the united states is not free to disobey elihpa it may accept a borrower prepayment only after following the procedures described in elihpa,at.therefore,borrowers who wish to prepay must either comply with elihpa procedures or seek damages under the tucker act in the court of federal claims.see franconia,at,at.
ii.schroeder property and loans 
schroeder currently owns and operates a lowincome housing project located in heppner,oregon,known as the willow view apartments.schroeder predecessor,the midas company,purchased the property in using a,loan from the fmha the loan,the terms of which were evidenced by a promissory note and mortgage on the property.
schroeder purchased the willow view apartments in august,approximately three years before elihpa became law.with the government consent,schroeder assumed the loan and executed another promissory note,a deed of trust,and a loan agreement as part of a,housing act loan the loan.accordingly,schroeder became liable for two loans on the property collectively,the loans,which respectively became due in and.both promissory notes gave schroeder the unconditional right to prepay in full the principal sums due thereon at any time.however,the deed of trust associated with the loan included a provision requiring schroeder to use the property only for housing for a period,beginning in august the loan covenant.in addition,the loan agreement which referenced both of the loans included a provision further restricting the use of the property by stating that,s o long as the loan obligations remain unsatisfied,the borrower shall not use the house for any purpose other than as rental housing and related facilities for eligible,elderly and occupants.schroeder operated the property for the next twenty years,making regular payments on the loans.
the loan covenant expired on september.that same day,schroeder attempted to tender the full amount outstanding on both loans.in her payment request,schroeder stated that she had difficulty managing the property due to her advanced age and that the property rental income was insufficient to permit her to hire a manager.in march,the government sent schroeder an incentive offer to continue operating the property as housing.in april,schroeder tendered full payment on both loans,but her tender was rejected by rhs.schroeder,in turn,rejected rhs incentive offer and attempted to sell the property to a local housing authority at a substantially higher price than rhs appraisal value.rhs continued to refuse to allow schroeder to prepay the remaining debt owed on the loans,maintaining that elihpa prohibits prepayment unless a property owner specifically complies with the act procedural requirements.
iii.procedural history 
in may,schroeder filed this suit in morrow county,oregon,circuit court,seeking to compel the government to accept her full payment of the loans,and to quiet title to her property.the government removed the case to federal court.
the parties filed for summary judgment.schroeder argued that elihpa does not apply to her property because the loan covenant had expired in and because she did not tender a prepayment within the meaning of elihpa.she also offered equitable arguments in support of her quiet title action.
a magistrate judge recommended granting schroeder motion for summary judgment and denying the government motion for summary judgment.the magistrate judge concluded that,because the loan covenant had expired,equity favored granting schroeder quiet title action.the government filed objections.the district court rejected the magistrate judge proposed findings and conclusions,and held that schroeder was not entitled to quiet title to her property.schroeder appeals.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to.we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment.see buono norton,cir.we review for abuse of discretion the district court decision to grant or deny equitable relief.see rabkin or.health scis,cir.federal common law applies to the contracts at issue.side lumber block,cir.
discussion 
i.the application of elihpa to the loans 
schroeder first argues that elihpa does not apply to her loans because a the final attempted payment on the loans was not a prepayment,which triggers elihpa procedures but,rather,a regularly scheduled payment and b elihpa does not create a new,enforceable period.we address these arguments in turn.
