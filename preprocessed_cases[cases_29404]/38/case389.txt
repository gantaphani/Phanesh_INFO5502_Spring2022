standard of review and statute of limitations 
we review de novo a district court dismissal under rule b.marks newcourt credit group,cir.in deciding whether to grant a rule b motion,we must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff,accept all factual allegations of the plaintiff as true,and determine whether the plaintiff undoubtedly can prove no set of facts in support of his claims that would entitle him to relief.id.at quoting allard weitzman in re delorean motor,cir.moreover,a rule b motion should not be granted unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.id.at quoting cameron seitz,cir quotation omitted.the postmaster points out that he timely raised in his answer as an affirmative defense the expiration of the fmla statute of limitations,but that the district court did not rule upon this issue in its opinion.the fmla provides 
in general 
except as provided in paragraph,an action may be brought under this section not later than years after the date of the last event constituting the alleged violation for which the action is brought.

statutory interpretation 
on appeal,ricco contends that the district court erred by adopting the reasoning in plumley,arguing that the first circuit erroneously concluded that the requirement contained in the fmla definition of eligible employee means only hours that an employee performed actual work,not hours for which an employee was compensated pursuant to an arbitration award.in plumley,the first circuit looked,as directed by the fmla,to the fair labor standards act of flsa for guidance regarding the proper interpretation of the requirement.plumley,at.
