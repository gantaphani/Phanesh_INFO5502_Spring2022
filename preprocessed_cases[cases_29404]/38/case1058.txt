appellee motion to publish the order and judgment of august,is granted.a copy of the published opinion is attached.
christel branum appeals from an order of the district court affirming the social security administration decision denying her application for supplemental security income ssi payments.we exercise jurisdiction under g and.we affirm.
plaintiff claims she has been unable to work since january as a result of back pain,obesity,and depression.after her application for ssi payments was denied initially and on reconsideration,a de novo hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj,and plaintiff was represented by counsel at the hearing.in a decision dated september,the alj denied plaintiff application for ssi payments,concluding that plaintiff is not disabled because she does not suffer from a severe mental impairment while her back pain and obesity are severe physical impairments,she is capable of performing sedentary work that requires only occasional walking up ramps and stairs and only occasional stooping,kneeling,and crouching,and which does not require climbing ladders,ropes,or scaffolds or balancing or crawling and based on the testimony of the vocational expert,she has the residual functional capacity rfc to perform jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy.
in january,the appeals council denied plaintiff request for review of the alj decision.plaintiff then filed a complaint in the district court.after the parties consented to having a magistrate judge decide the case,a magistrate judge entered an order affirming the alj decision denying plaintiff application for ssi payments.this appeal followed.
because the appeals council denied review,the alj decision is the commissioner final decision for purposes of this appeal.doyal barnhart,cir.in reviewing the alj decision,we neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency.casias sec y of health human,cir.instead,we review the alj decision only to determine whether the correct legal standards were applied and whether the alj factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.doyal,at.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quotation omitted.a decision is not based on substantial evidence if it is overwhelmed by other evidence in the record or if there is a mere scintilla of evidence supporting it.bernal bowen,cir.
in this appeal,plaintiff claims the alj decision denying her application for ssi payments is not supported by substantial evidence in the record because the alj failed to develop a record containing all of her medical records the alj erroneously determined that her mental impairment is not severe and failed to develop an adequate record concerning her mental impairment the alj improperly discredited her subjective complaints regarding her back pain the alj failed to give appropriate weight to the opinion of her treating physician and the alj incorrectly assessed her rfc and incorrectly found that she can perform jobs that exist in significant numbers in the national economy.we disagree with plaintiff on each of these points,and we therefore affirm the alj denial of plaintiff application for ssi payments.
duty to develop the record.
the administrative record contains medical records from the cherokee nation indian clinic in stillwell,oklahoma,and the records document medical care that plaintiff received at the clinic in.see at.the administrative record also contains medical records from the redbird smith behavioral health center in sallisaw,oklahoma,and the records document medical care that plaintiff received at the center from february through october id.at.plaintiff claims the alj erred by failing to obtain medical records dating back to january when she was in a car accident.plaintiff also claims the alj erred by failing to obtain medical records pertaining to medical care she received at the redbird smith medical clinic,a facility that,according to plaintiff,is separate from the redbird smith behavioral health center.
the burden to prove disability in a social security case is on the claimant,and to meet this burden,the claimant must furnish medical and other evidence of the existence of the disability.bowen yuckert,d.a social security disability hearing is nonadversarial,however,and the alj bears responsibility for ensuring that an adequate record is developed during the disability hearing consistent with the issues raised.henrie united states dep t of health human,cir.as a result,a n alj has the duty to develop the record by obtaining pertinent,available medical records which come to his attention during the course of the hearing.carter chater,cir.nonetheless,in cases such as this one where the claimant was represented by counsel at the hearing before the alj,the alj should ordinarily be entitled to rely on the claimant counsel to structure and present claimant case in a way that the claimant claims are adequately explored,and the alj may ordinarily require counsel to identify the issue or issues requiring further development.hawkins chater,cir.
during the hearing before the alj,plaintiff counsel did not indicate or suggest to the alj that any medical records were missing from the administrative record,nor did counsel ask for the alj assistance in obtaining any additional medical records.moreover,under the governing regulations,the alj was required to develop plaintiff medical history only for the twelve months preceding the month in which she filed her application unless there is a reason to believe that development of an earlier period is necessary.d here,plaintiff filed her application in april,and she has made no showing that the alj did not properly develop her medical history for the preceding twelve months.in addition,while plaintiff has referred in conclusory fashion to a car accident that allegedly occurred in january,we are not convinced that the alj needed to obtain any earlier medical records in order to properly evaluate plaintiff back impairment.in fact,we note that plaintiff prior medical history is documented in the medical records contained in the administrative record and plaintiff has made no showing that anything of significance is missing from the current record.we thus conclude that there was an adequate record by which the alj could decide this case.
mental impairment.
the medical records in the administrative record indicate that plaintiff has suffered from depression for several years,and that she has been prescribed zoloft to treat her depression.see at.as noted by the alj,however,the exhibits of record fail to demonstrate much in the way of a longitudinal treatment history for mental health impairment s.id.at.we also note that victoria dillard,the primary individual that plaintiff was seeing at the redbird smith behavioral health center to treat her depression,is not a medical doctor.as a result,the records generated by dillard,id.at,did not come from an acceptable medical source under the governing regulations.see a.further,it does not appear that the redbird smith behavioral health center employed any medical doctors.see at.
because of the lack of information in plaintiff medical records pertaining to her mental impairment,it was necessary to have plaintiff evaluated by a consulting psychologist.in july,douglas brown,a clinical neuropsychologist,performed a consultative psychological examination of plaintiff,and he diagnosed her as suffering from a dysthymic disorder,a chronic pain disorder,and a personality disorder.id.at.however,brown did not report any significant limitations with respect to plaintiff ability to function on a basis.id.at.to the contrary,he reported that plaintiff communicates effectively with no specific limitations in speech or language,and he also observed no abnormalities with respect to persistence,concentration,or pace.id.at.
based on brown evaluation and the administrative record as a whole,the alj concluded that plaintiff does not suffer from a severe mental impairment.id.at see also a an impairment is not severe if it does not significantly limit a p
