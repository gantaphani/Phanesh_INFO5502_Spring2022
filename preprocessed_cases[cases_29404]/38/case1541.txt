james cook appeals the decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court in cook west,wl table.june.in its decision,the veterans court upheld the ruling of the board of veterans appeals board that the alleged failure of the veterans administration regional office ro to give cook a proper medical examination before denying his claim for benefits did not constitute clear and unmistakable error cue under.see id.at.the veterans court also rejected cook argument that,under hayre west,the ro alleged failure to give him a proper medical examination rendered the ro denial of service connection.cook,wl,at.subsequently,a split panel of this court affirmed the decision of the veterans court.cook principi,vacated.the panel mayer,friedman,rader,held that the veterans court did not err in ruling that the ro alleged violation of the duty to assist could not serve as the basis for a claim of cue.at the same time,the panel held that the hayre exception to the rule of finality did not apply in cook case.chief judge mayer dissented on the latter point,stating that a breach of the duty to assist the veteran by failing to provide a proper medical examination vitiates the prior decision of the regional office for the purpose of direct appeal.cook,at mayer,dissenting.
cook petitioned for rehearing en banc.in so doing,he argued that,under a proper application of hayre,a showing that the va violated any statutory or regulatory duty towards a veteran vitiates the finality of a decision regarding the veteran entitlement to benefits.on january,we granted cook petition for rehearing en banc and vacated the panel opinion.cook,at.for purposes of the en banc proceedings,we asked the parties to brief the following two questions 
whether this court decision in hayre west,should be overruled insofar as that case holds that the existence of grave procedural error renders a decision of the veterans administration 
whether,if hayre is overruled in this respect,a failure of the secretary to assist the veteran under the law and regulations applicable at the time affirmatively demonstrated by the record before the adjudicator in the particular case can constitute clear and unmistakable error cue under see roberson principi.
we answer the en banc questions as follows first,to the extent that it created an additional exception to the rule of finality applicable to ro decisions,hayre is overruled.second,a failure of the secretary to assist a veteran under applicable law and regulations can not constitute cue.in parts i and ii of this opinion,respectively,we address the first and second en banc questions.in part iii,we consider cook appeal in light of our answers to the en banc questions.doing so,we affirm the decision of the veterans court.
discussion 
first en banc question 
whether this court decision in hayre west,should be overruled insofar as that case holds that the existence of grave procedural error renders a decision of the veterans administration 
b.the rule of finality 
if a veteran fails to appeal from an ro decision concerning a claim,the decision becomes final,and the claim will not thereafter be reopened or allowed,except as may otherwise be provided by regulations not inconsistent with this title.c.principles of finality and res judicata apply to agency decisions that have not been appealed and have become final.see astoria fed.savs.loan ass solimino,d allowing the application of res judicata to administrative agency determinations that have attained finality routen west,applying finality and res judicata to va decisions.as we observed in routen,u nless otherwise provided by law,the cases are closed and the matter is thus ended.routen,at.
there are,however,two statutory exceptions to the rule of finality.first,pursuant to,the secretary must reopen a claim i f new and material evidence regarding the claim is presented or secured.second,a decision is subject to revision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error.decision by the secretary decision by the board.these are the only statutory exceptions to the finality of va decisions 
hayre west 
in hayre,the veteran filed a claim in for service connection for a nerve problem.at.hayre stated on his claim form that he had been treated while in service for nerves and that he had talked to a psychiatrist,and he requested that the ro obtain his service medical records smrs.id.the ro sent a request for the smrs to the national personnel records center but did not receive them.id.the ro made no further attempts to obtain the records and rejected hayre claim without notifying him that his smrs had not been obtained.the ro told hayre in its denial notice that we do find in your medical records or elsewhere any evidence of a nervous condition.id.
in,hayre again applied for disability.following a va examination,he was awarded service connection and a disability rating for stress disorder.in,seeking an earlier effective date for the award of service connection,hayre brought a claim challenging the ro decision as clearly erroneous.hayre argued that the ro had not obtained the psychiatric smrs that he had requested and had failed to afford him a va examination.id.the ro denied the claim,and the board and the veterans court affirmed,treating the claim as a cue claim hayre appealed to us.
on appeal,we reversed and remanded.we first held that an ro single unsuccessful request for pertinent smrs that are specifically sought by a claimant does not fulfill the ro duty to assist the veteran in developing facts pertinent to his claim id.at.however,relying on bustos west,we held that such a breach of the duty to assist can not amount to cue.hayre,at.
we next held that the ro decision was not final for purposes of appeal.in so doing,we created a third exception to the rule of finality in addition to the two statutory exceptions created by congress.specifically,we held that where there is a breach of the duty to assist in which the va failed to obtain pertinent smrs specifically requested by the claimant and failed to provide the claimant notice explaining the deficiency,the claim does not become final for purposes of appeal.id.at.in reaching this holding,we stated that i n cases of grave procedural error,the veterans court has consistently held that ro or board decisions are not final for purposes of direct appeal.id.at citing tablazon brown,hauck brown,kuo derwinski,ashley derwinski.we explained that a breach of the duty to assist in which the va failed to obtain pertinent smrs specifically requested by the claimant and failed to provide the claimant with notice explaining the deficiency is a procedural error of,at least,comparable gravity to the errors in the four cited veterans court cases that vitiates the finality of an ro decision for purposes of direct appeal.id.we elaborated on the importance of providing adequate notice to the veteran 
notice to the claimant explaining the failure to obtain pertinent and specifically requested smrs is essential to insuring that the agency of original jurisdiction aoj will adequately develop a veteran claim before deciding it on the merits.furthermore,if the claimant is to effectively appeal his or her case,the claimant must be cognizant of all the evidence considered by the aoj.where so much of the evidence in va adjudications is circumstantial at best,notice explaining the failure to obtain pertinent and specifically requested smrs is critical to ensuring a proper award for benefits and an effective right to judicial review.
id.at.we thus concluded that if the veterans court finds that the ro breached the duty to assist hayre in,then the ro decision is not final for purposes of direct appeal.id.at.we remanded the case to the veterans court for further proceedings consistent with our opinion.
whether hayre should be overruled 
the government contends that we should overrule the holding of hayre that the finality of a va decision is vitiated if the va commits a grave procedural error when adjudicating a claim.the government argues that the hayre decision is not supported by statute or legislative history.for his part,cook argues that the hayre decision is consistent with congress intent to create a system where the veteran is fully and sympathetically assisted in the development of his claims before the va makes a decision on the merits.he further contends that the holding in hayre recognizes the need for a mechanism to allow a veteran to collaterally challenge a va decision where the veteran later discovers that the va breached its duty to assist him in developing his claim.
we agree with the government that hayre should be overruled.the statutory scheme provides only two exceptions to the rule of finality.at the same time,we see nothing in the legislative history of the pertinent cue challenge to an ro decision.cue challenge to a board decision,reopening of a claim based on new and material evidence,and former a recognizing the va duty to assist the claimant in the development of his claims that indicates that congress intended to allow additional exceptions to the finality of va decisions based upon grave procedural error.
the purpose of the rule of finality is to preclude repetitive and belated readjudication of veterans benefit claims.congress knew how to create exceptions to the finality of va decisions,and it explicitly did so in two circumstances.it enacted the statutes codifying cue challenges sections and and the statute allowing claims based on new and material evidence section.applying the familiar canon of expressio unius est exclusio alterius,we conclude that congress did not intend to allow exceptions to the rule of finality in addition to the two that it expressly created see,leatherman tarrant county narcotics intelligence coordination unit,d applying the expressio unius est exclusio alterius canon in concluding that because federal rule of civil procedure b imposes a particularity requirement for pleading two specific types of actions,such particularity is not required for pleading other types of actions bmw united states,it thus appears that congress expressly provided for the exemption of certain merchandise from the harbor maintenance tax.where it did not so provide,it is reasonable to conclude that it did not so intend.
in support of its holding that grave procedural error vitiates the finality of a va decision,the hayre panel relied on the legislative history of the veterans benefits amendments of,a,stat,which added sections a and to title of the united states code currently codified as amended at a and b.hayre,at.the relevant provision,section b,provides that when the va denies a benefit,the claimant must be provided with a statement of the reasons for the decision and a summary of the evidence considered by the va it was effective with regard to va decisions issued after january,b,stat.at.section b was intended to remedy a lack of information in va notices denying claims,at,reprinted in.there is nothing in the legislative history relating to section b,however,to indicate that congress intended that the lack of information in a pre va decision could support a claim to reopen a final decision.
as noted above,the hayre panel also relied on four veterans court decisions involving grave procedural error in support of its conclusion that the va single request for hayre smrs and its failure to notify him of its inability to obtain the records vitiated the finality of the ro decision.hayre,at.we do not think,however,that these cases provide support for the creation of a third exception to the finality of an unappealed va decision.
an understanding of the process for obtaining disability benefits will help put the four veterans court decisions upon which the hayre panel relied in proper perspective.we outlined the process in maggitt west.a veteran may appeal an adverse ro decision to the board.appellate review is initiated by the veteran filing a notice of disagreement nod with the.see a the nod is a written communication from the veteran expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative decision of the.see collaro west,explaining that disagreement between the va and the veteran over legal entitlement to a particular benefit may form the basis of an nod.once the va receives the veteran nod,it must prepare a statement of the case.see d.the statement of the case frames the va view of the case,and is meant to assist the veteran in gaining every benefit that can be supported in law.maggitt,at.the veteran is required to file a formal appeal with the board within sixty days from the date the statement of the case is mailed.see d the appeal should set out specific allegations of error of fact or law,such allegations related to specific items in the statement of the case.after the board renders a decision on the merits of the veteran request for benefits,the veteran may appeal the board decision to the veterans court.see a.a veteran has days from the date of receipt of a board decision to appeal to the veterans court.see.
in each of the cases cited by the hayre panel,the veterans court held that the time for appealing either an ro or a board decision did not run where the va failed to provide the veteran with information or material critical to the appellate process just described.see tablazon brown.because the va did not furnish the veteran with a statement of the case,he was unable to file a formal appeal with the board and the ro rating decision did not become final hauck brown.because the veteran never received notification of claim denial in accordance with b,the period in which to file an nod did not begin to run kuo derwinski.the veteran was not furnished with a statement of the case therefore,the period in which to lodge a formal appeal with the board did not begin to run ashley derwinski.since the board did not mail its decision in accordance with e and,the period within which to appeal to the veterans court did not begin to run.
tablazon,hauck,kuo,and ashley involved straightforward application of b,d,and.section b provides that the period which the veteran has to file an nod does not begin to run until the date of the mailing of notice of the claim denial to the veteran.section d makes the furnishing of a statement of the case the event that triggers the veteran obligation to file a formal appeal with the board,while pursuant to section,the day period for appealing to the veterans court from a decision of the board does not begin to run until the board decision is mailed to the veteran.in contrast,there is no statutory basis for the hayre panel holding that a breach of the duty to assist the veteran in developing facts pertinent to his claim would vitiate the finality of an ro decision.
furthermore,in tablazon,hauck,kuo,and ashley,the va failure to comply with statutory procedural requirements regarding notification of benefit determinations had the effect of extinguishing the claimant right to appeal an adverse decision.in hayre case,however,regardless of any failure of the duty to assist in the development of evidence,hayre was afforded notice of the ro decision denying his claim for service connection.if he had filed an nod with respect to the administrative decision,the va would have been required to provide him with a statement of the case,which would have notified him of the basis for the denial of his claim.see,stat.adding requirement at,currently codified as amended at.thus,the va failure to notify hayre that it had been unsuccessful in obtaining his smrs did not preclude him from challenging the administrative decision denying his claim and raising the issue of the duty to assist after he was notified of the basis for the decision 
in summary,a breach of the duty to assist the veteran does not vitiate the finality of an ro decision.we therefore overrule hayre to the extent that it created an additional exception to the rule of finality applicable to va decisions by reason of grave procedural error.if additional exceptions to the rule of finality in c are to be created,if is for congress,not this court,to provide them.as we discuss next,however,to the extent it stands for the proposition that a breach of the duty to assist can not constitute cue,hayre remains good law 
second en banc question 
whether,if hayre is overruled in this respect,a failure of the secretary to assist the veteran under the law and regulations applicable at the time affirmatively demonstrated by the record before the adjudicator in the particular case can constitute clear and unmistakable error cue under see roberson principi.
b.the concept of cue 
cue provides a means for collateral attack on a final decision of an ro.this concept,once solely grounded in regulation,see,is now also governed by statute.in congress enacted,stat,which is codified at and.section covers claims of clear and unmistakable error at the ro level,while section covers claims of clear and unmistakable error at the board level 
although the two provisions are quite similar,only section,pertaining to review of an ro decision,is relevant to our inquiry.section states in relevant part that 
a a decision by the secretary under this chapter is subject to revision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error.if evidence establishes the error,the prior decision shall be reversed or revised.
b for the purposes of authorizing benefits,a rating or other adjudicative decision that constitutes a reversal or revision of a prior decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error has the same effect as if the decision had been made on the date of the prior decision.
the regulation from which section was derived,and which remains in place today,provides that final determinations of the ro will be accepted as correct unless cue is shown.see a.further,like the statute,the regulation provides for the reversal of decisions found to contain cue and the retroactive award of benefits to the date of the original decision.id.the pertinent language in the regulation is as follows 
a error.previous determinations which are final and binding,including decisions of service connection,degree of disability,age,marriage,relationship,service,dependency,line of duty,and other issues,will be accepted as correct in the absence of clear and unmistakable error.where evidence establishes such error,the prior decision will be reversed or amended.for the purpose of authorizing benefits,the rating or other adjudicative decision which constitutes a reversal of a prior decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error has the same effect as if the corrected decision had been made on the date of the reversed decision.
the veterans court has rendered decisions addressing the meaning of clear and unmistakable error,as used in the statute and regulation.in russell principi,the court addressed for the first time the validity of.en banc.in upholding the validity of the regulation,id.at,the court set forth the parameters of a successful claim of cue 
by its express terms,a refers to determinations on which an action was predicated.therefore,it necessarily follows that a clear and unmistakable error under a must be the sort of error which,had it not been made,would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made.
see also fugo brown,e ven where the premise of error is accepted,if it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued,the error complained of can not be,ipso facto,clear and unmistakable error.the requirement that a clear and unmistakable error be one which would have manifestly changed the outcome of the ro determination was adopted by this court in bustos.see at t o prove the existence of cue as set forth in a,the claimant must show that an error occurred.
in russell,the veterans court also explained that in order for an error to rise to the level of cue,the error must have been made on the record as it existed at the time the decision was made.see russell.at.according to the court,a determination that there was a clear and unmistakable error must be based on the record and the law that existed at the time of the prior aoj decision.id.emphasis added.as explained by the veterans court in caffrey brown,a cue claim is an attack on a prior judgment that asserts an incorrect application of law or fact.necessarily,the asserted error must have occurred on the record as it existed at the time of the disputed adjudication.id.we extended this interpretation of the regulation to section in pierce principi,we affirm the court interpretation of the term evidence in and a as being limited to evidence that was of record at the time the challenged ro decision was made.
whether a breach of the duty to assist can constitute cue 
cook urges us to overrule precedent holding that a breach of the duty to assist can not serve as a basis for cue.see hayre,at stating that a breach of the duty to assist is not an error of the sort that should be contemplated in the cue analysis caffrey.at stating that the va breach of the duty to assist can not form a basis for a claim of cue because such a breach creates only an incomplete rather than an incorrect record.cook advances three arguments in support of his position.first,he contends that requiring the cue analysis to be conducted on the record as it existed at the time of the original decision is flawed.he argues that the proper interpretation of section allows for all evidence of error to be considered in reviewing a cue claim,not just evidence that was a part of the original record.second,cook urges that the requirement that an error must be outcome determinative in order to constitute cue,stated in bustos,see at,and relied on in part by hayre in its rejection of hayre cue claim,see at,is also flawed.cook urges that a lesser standard should be applied consistent with the goal of fundamental fairness.he suggests that a lesser standard for cue was advanced by this court in roberson principi.for its part,the government argues that the interpretations of and discussed above are supported by the statute and legislative history and,therefore,should be upheld.
we agree with the government that a breach of the duty to assist can not constitute cue.both our precedent and that of the veterans court establish two requirements for a cue claim.first,in order to constitute cue,the alleged error must have been outcome determinative,see bustos,at second,the error must have been based upon the evidence of record at the time of the original decision,see pierce,at.as explained below,in order to hold that a breach of the duty to assist can form the basis for a cue claim,we would have to jettison these requirements.we do not think that such a change in the law is warranted.
turning first to the requirement that the alleged error be outcome determinative,we note that both the regulation and the statute provide that once a prior decision is found to contain clear and unmistakable error it is to be reversed.see a.the call for reversal on account of clear and unmistakable error clearly suggests that the contemplated error is outcome determinative.see id.
the legislative history of section also supports the conclusion that an alleged error must be outcome determinative in order to constitute cue.we have held that congress intent in drafting section was to codify and adopt the cue doctrine as it had developed under.see pierce,at noting that the legislative history of section reveals congress awareness and approval of the decision of the veterans court in russell,and pointing out that the house and senate reports,see,at,and,at,discuss russell as setting forth the current state of the law which was to be codified by donovan west.made no change in the substantive standards in the regulation governing modifications of a regional office decision because of clear and unmistakable error.bustos,at made no change to the substantive standards governing modifications of ro decisions because of cue this statutory provision merely codified and the court of appeals for veterans claims long standing interpretation of cue.as stated in the legislative history,the purpose of the bill was to effectively codify,and extend the principle underlying it to bva decisions,at.in addition,congress explicitly endorsed the russell interpretation of cue.the house report to.cites liberally to the russell and fugo opinions in its discussion of cue,including the following language from fugo 
it must always be remembered that clear and unmistakable error is a very specific and rare kind of error.it is the kind of error,of fact or of law,that when called to the attention of later reviewers compels the conclusion,to which reasonable minds could not differ,that the result would have been manifestly different but for the error.thus even where the premise of error is accepted,if it is not absolutely clear that a different result would have ensued,the error complained of can not be,ipso facto,clear and unmistakable.russell principi,en banc.
at quoting fugo.at.the senate report cites to russell in its explanation of the doctrine of cue cva has ruled that clear and unmistakable error is error that is obvious and was outcome determinative with respect to the decision under review,at.
we turn now to the second requirement of cue.as noted above,in russell,the veterans court held that a determination that there was cue must be based upon the record that existed at the time of the original ro decision.we have held that the legislative history of section supports the requirement that the cue analysis be limited to the record before the prior adjudicator.in pierce,we stated that a lthough the language of does not expressly limit the evidence that can be considered in a cue challenge to evidence that was of record at the time the challenged decision was made,the legislative history of the statute,the purpose of the statute,and the overall statutory scheme for reviewing veterans benefits decisions all indicate that congress intended the evidence to be so limited.at.in addition,we pointed out that a lthough the house and senate reports do not expressly discuss russell holding with respect to the evidence that can be considered when evaluating a cue claim,they do discuss russell as setting forth the current state of the law that was to be codified by.id.significantly,the house report explains,t his bill addresses errors similar to the kinds which are grounds for reopening social security claims.under the social security system,a claim may be reopened at any time to correct an error which appears on the face of the evidence used when making the prior decision,at emphasis added.
we conclude that decisions of this court and the veterans court concluding that a clear and unmistakable error at the ro level must be outcome determinative and must be apparent from the evidence of record at the time of the original decision are supported by the language of and its legislative history.we therefore reject cook request that we overturn existing law to that effect 
the requirements that a clear and unmistakable error be outcome determinative and be based on the record that existed at the time of the original decision make it impossible for a breach of the duty to assist to form the basis for a cue claim.first,a breach of the duty to assist can not constitute an outcome determinative error.without the benefit of additional evidence that might have been in the record but for the breach,we may only conclude that,as a result of the breach,the record was incomplete.this can not be an error.in caffrey,the veterans court explained that 
w hile it is true that an incomplete record may ultimately lead to an incorrect determination,it can not be said that an incomplete record is also an incorrect record.if the facts contained in the record are correct,it is not erroneous,although not embodying all of the relevant facts.rather,an incomplete record is just thus,an incomplete record,factually correct in all other respects,is not clearly and unmistakably erroneous.
caffrey.at.second,a breach of the duty to assist necessarily implicates evidence that was not before the ro at the time of the original decision.in accordance with the duty to assist,the va is required to help a veteran in obtaining evidence in support of his or her claim.see.if the va breaches this duty,the result is that the ro considers the veteran claim on a record that is incomplete because it does not include all the pertinent evidence.incomplete or not,however,as explained above,the only record that may be reviewed in the cue analysis is the record that was before the ro at the time of the original decision.evidence that should have been part of the record,but was not because of a breach of the duty to assist,may not be considered.in sum,a breach of the duty to assist can not constitute cue.
finally,we do not agree with cook that roberson principi supports the proposition that a breach of the duty to assist can form the basis for a cue claim.in roberson,a panel of this court reviewed the veterans court rejection of a cue claim that was based on an alleged breach of the duty to assist relating to a rating percentage of disability decision.we explained that,a s we held in hayre west,breach of the duty to assist can not form the basis for a cue claim.roberson,at.
having rejected the argument that a breach of the duty to assist could serve as the basis for a cue claim,we went on to determine the standard that applies when the va is considering a cue claim.id.we concluded that,in adjudicating a cue claim,the va is required to follow the approach outlined in hodge west,for the situation in which a veteran seeks to reopen a disallowed claim based upon new and material evidence under.roberson,at.in hodge,we stated that the va is to fully and sympathetically develop the veteran claim to its optimum before deciding it on the merits.at.in roberson,a critical issue was whether,in addressing roberson claim that there was cue in the rating decision,the va and the veterans court had erred by failing to recognize that in his original claim,roberson had sought total disability based upon individual unemployability tdiu.we concluded that,in line with the hodge rubric,once a veteran submits evidence of a medical disability and makes a claim for the highest rating possible and also submits evidence of unemployability,the va must consider tdiu.we stated that,in order to develop a claim to its optimum,as required by hodge,the va must determine all potential claims raised by the evidence,applying all relevant laws and regulations,regardless of whether the claim is specifically labeled as a claim for tdiu.roberson,at.we therefore reversed the holding of the veterans court that roberson had failed to make a claim for tdiu before the ro in.id.we remanded the case to the court for consideration of roberson appeal of the denial of his cue claim in light of our decision.roberson does not support cook contention that a breach of the duty to assist may constitute cue.
having held that there can be no judicially crafted exception to the rule of finality and that a breach of the duty to assist can not constitute cue,we turn now to the facts of this case.
cook served in the united states army from august of to december of.his service medical records contain a march diagnosis of psychoneurosis,anxiety type.when he was recalled for service in,an examination found that he was not qualified for active duty due to his ulcer.in,cook submitted a benefits claim to the ro for service connection for stomach trouble nervous stomach.a physical examination revealed a duodenal ulcer.in a neuropsychiatric examination the attending physician noted 
the present day idea is,generally,that a peptic ulcer may be a visceral expression of long continued anxiety.in this case,a diagnosis of duodenal ulcer has been established.a dual diagnosis should not be made,but it should be clear that the diagnosis of duodenal ulcer includes a psychic or emotional component.
in june of,the ro denied service connection for stomach trouble and nervousness.it stated that cook ulcer was not incurred or aggravated in service and that the most recent examination had not revealed nervousness.the ro also stated that the neuropsychiatric examination revealed no evidence of a psychiatric disability.
cook did not appeal the ro decision to the board it therefore became final.see in july of,cook sought to reopen his claim.the board did so and denied service connection.the veterans court,however,reversed and directed the board to determine cook rating for both his nervous disorder and his ulcer.cook brown.thereafter,the ro awarded cook a thirty percent rating for his anxiety disorder and a zero percent rating for his duodenal ulcer.the ro made the awards effective as of july when cook had sought reopening of his claims.
cook appealed the ro decision,contending that the effective date of the award should have been the april date of the original filing of his claim and that the ro decision contained cue and therefore was the board rejected cook contention that the regional office decision constituted cue,and cook appealed to the veterans court.while the appeal was pending at the veterans court,hayre was decided.the veterans court ordered briefing by the parties as to the application of hayre to cook case.
subsequently,in a unpublished decision,the veterans court affirmed the decision of the board.the court first held that the alleged deficiencies in the ro decision did not constitute cue.the court then rejected cook argument that the ro failure to give him an adequate medical examination in violated its duty to assist him,so as to render the decision not final and make the date of that decision the effective date of his benefits.as to whether cook claim fit within the exception to the rule of finality created by hayre,the court concluded that even if cook had established a breach of the duty to assist,the failure to provide him with an appropriate medical examination did not rise to the level of the grave procedural error found in hayre.
we affirm the decision of the veterans court.in part i of this opinion,we have overruled hayre insofar as it holds that the existence of grave procedural error renders a decision of the va.in part ii,we have held that a failure of the va to assist the veteran to the extent required by applicable law and regulations can not constitute cue under.in the face of these rulings,cook claim for an earlier effective date for his disability benefits must fail,because the rulings leave cook without any ground upon which to claim an earlier effective date.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the decision of the veterans court is affirmed.
i fully join the majority opinion,but wish to make clear that we are not deciding today that a past breach of the duty to assist is without consequence.in particular we are not deciding the effect of a past breach of the duty to assist on a new and material evidence claim.
unlike a successful clear and unmistakable error cue claim,which is given the effective date of an earlier reversed or revised decision under,a successful new and material evidence claim typically is not given retroactive effect.by statute and regulation,a reopened claim generally results in the veteran receiving payments only from the date that the application was received.a unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter,the effective date of an award based on a claim reopened after final adjudication shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.the effective date will be the date of receipt of the claim or the date entitlement arose,whichever is the later.
where there has been a material breach of the statutory duty to assist at some time in the past,and that breach by the government prevented the veteran from discovering the new and material evidence at an earlier date,a question arises as to whether retroactive relief is available in a new and material evidence proceeding.an argument for retroactivity might have particular force where the violation of the duty to assist was unknown to the veteran at the time of the original application,for example,where the veterans administration had pertinent undisclosed information in its files and the veteran was unaware that a proper search had not been conducted.indeed,the government in this case appears to concede that in such circumstances retroactive relief would be available in a new and material evidence proceeding by virtue of q.
i express no opinion on these questions,and write merely to emphasize that we are not deciding them today.
i respectfully dissent.in my view,a breach of the duty to assist a veteran by failing to provide a proper medical examination vitiates the prior decision of the regional office ro for purposes of direct appeal.the duty to assist is an integral part of the,claims adjudication process of the department of veterans affairs va.congress expressly stated that the va must fully and sympathetically develop the veteran claim to its optimum before deciding it on the merits.at,reprinted in,see also a the secretary shall assist such a claimant in developing the facts pertinent to the claim,amended by duty to assist claimants notice to claimants of required information and evidence.breaches of this critical duty compel us to toll the finality of va decisions,as we held in hayre west,which the majority today overrules,or to declare such a breach a clear and unmistakable error.this would ensure that the va duty to assist claimants does not become a hollow slogan.
in the veterans uniquely system of awarding benefits,systemic justice and fundamental considerations of procedural fairness are critical,hayre,at citing.at,reprinted in,which i develop below.this is because,as congress recognized,in most cases before the ro the veteran is not represented by counsel or a veterans service organization and representation at the board of veterans appeals board is discouraged.as a result,a veteran ability to ensure that a fair and procedurally correct decision has been reached on his or her claim is limited so too is his or her ability to make a choice whether to accept or appeal a decision.see.at,reprinted in.thus,va decisions on records that are less than thoroughly and adequately prepared may go unchallenged and the veteran will lose years of earned benefits that,but for the va breach of its duty to assist,he or she would have collected.in an adversarial system,it may be appropriate to dismiss a claimant who does not immediately challenge a decision.but in a paternalistic system,where a claimant is led to believe that his or her claim is being fairly and accurately decided to afford him or her the fullest compensation he or she is due,it is readily apparent why a decision may not be promptly challenged.the va is charged with the development of the merits of a claim and acts as final adjudicator as well there must be a remedy when it fails in its responsibility.to allow the organization to default in its development of a claim and then to adjudicate it without the possibility of challenge is an injustice.
the question raised here is whether a claimant should be denied an opportunity to collaterally challenge a va decision where the veteran later discovers that the va breached its duty to assist.ante,at.the majority says no such opportunity exists,for two reasons first,p rinciples of finality and res judicata apply to agency decisions that have not been appealed and u nless otherwise provided by law,the cases are closed and the matter is thus ended,ante,at citing astoria fed.savs.loan ass solimino,at.routen west,and second,t he statutory scheme provides only two exceptions to the rule of finality which do not apply to cook and hayre,ante,at.
i recognize the importance of the rule of finality however,enforcement of that policy must be circumscribed by constitutional due process and tempered by fairness and equity although administrative estoppel is favored as a matter of general policy,its suitability may vary according to the specific context of the rights at stake,the power of the agency,and the relative adequacy of agency procedures.astoria,at.thus,where breaches of the statutory duty to assist result in denials of benefits,draconian application of the rule of finality is tantamount to a denial of due process.because such breaches impose an unconstitutional restraint on an individual property right,the rule of finality is inappropriate here.
i shall first explain why claimants for,as well as recipients of,veterans benefits have property rights,then identify my disagreements with the majority analysis,and finally explain why i believe a breach of the statutory duty to assist veterans imposes an unconstitutional restraint on individual property.
according to board of regents roth,d,to have a property interest in a government benefit,a person clearly must have more than an abstract need or desire for the benefit.he or she must have more than a unilateral expectation of it.he or she must,instead,have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.id.at.entitlements derive from an independent source such as state law,that is,statutes or regulations that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlements to those benefits.id.it is well established that recipients of statutory entitlements such as social security disability benefits have a property interest protected by the due process clause of the fifth amendment.see mathews eldridge,d t he interest of an individual in continued receipt of social security disability benefits is a statutorily created property interest protected by the fifth amendment.citing richardson belcher,d richardson perales,d flemming nestor,d arnett kennedy,d powell,concurring in part roth,at.bell burson,d goldberg kelly,d.for the same reasons property interests were found in these cases,a veteran interest in the continued receipt of death and disability benefits is also a property interest.the statutory entitlement to such benefits is set forth in,and,and these sections provide an absolute right to benefits to qualified individuals.providing for wartime disability compensation providing for wartime death compensation for designated heirs and dependents providing for peacetime disability compensation providing for peacetime death compensation for designated heirs and dependents.
applicants for death and disability benefits,as distinct from recipients threatened with total or partial termination,also have a property interest in the receipt of those benefits.in walters of radiation survivors,the supreme court considered whether a statutory fee limitation,as it bears on the veterans benefits system in operation,deprives a rejected claimant or recipient of life,liberty,or property,without due process of law by depriving him of representation,d quoting const.amend.v.although the supreme court did not rule on the extent to which applicants for government benefits have property rights in their statutory entitlements,the court analyzed the rights to veterans benefits of the applicants together with the recipients as a statutorily created property interest protected by the due process clause.id.the first,third,seventh,and ninth circuits have held that the due process clauses apply to applicants seeking property interests.see,ressler pierce,cir applicant for federal rent subsidies kelly retirement,cir applicant for disabled child annuity griffeth detrich,cir applicants for general relief program wright califano,cir applicant for social security benefits raper lucey,cir applicant for driver license.but see eidson pierce,cir ruling that holders of federal housing subsidies had no property interest because the owners of those units had complete discretion to turn away individual for any reason or for no reason at all.these courts have reasoned that claimants,just like recipients threatened with termination for alleged ineligibility,have a property interest because of their statutory entitlement to benefits if they meet the substantive requirements.
for veterans basic entitlement to disability compensation derives from two statutes,both found in title,sections and former relating to wartime disability compensation and the latter relating to peacetime disability compensation.both statutes provide for compensation with the following words for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in the line of duty,or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted the united states will pay to any veteran thus disabled compensation.here,cook and hayre,who meet the threshold eligibility requirements of,are entitled to procedural due process by virtue of the statutory mandate of the program and the va policy and practice in the administration of the veterans benefits program.it is common ground that a statute declaring that veterans meeting certain eligibility criteria will receive a benefit secures the benefit for those veterans,just as a blanket of common law rules secures more traditional forms of private property for individuals.see roth,at.as discussed below,no form of new property is more clearly earned by the applicant,who received this claim of entitlement to benefits in exchange for service given to his or her country.
correlatively,the fact that only those who meet specified criteria are entitled to the benefit does not mean that due process is inapplicable until eligibility has been conclusively proven,because this approach would deny the very procedures needed to demonstrate that a property interest exists in the first place.see id.r ecipients in goldberg kelly had not yet shown that they were,in fact,within the statutory terms of eligibility.but we held that they had a right to a hearing at which they might attempt to do so.thus,while at the application stage of the proceedings neither cook nor hayre had been administratively adjudged entitled to receive benefits under the regulatory scheme,an applicant for veterans benefits nonetheless possesses a property interest of sufficient magnitude to invoke the protection of the fifth amendment due process clause.the property interest is not that benefits have been previously received,but the existence of statutory provisions creating the right to a remedy and defining the terms under which it can be obtained.by establishing substantive standards for qualification,the regulations governing the veterans benefits system create a legitimate claim the applications of cook and hayre will not be denied unless the va factually determines that they do not suffer from a disability originating from service.accordingly,their statutory entitlement to benefits constitutes a protected property right.
by focusing primarily on the red herring finality issue,the majority avoids application of the test normally applied in due process cases.i understand the majority to imply two basic arguments in dismissing the arguments of cook and hayre.the first is to suggest that no remedy is required when breaches of the statutory duty to as the omission of a complete and thorough medical examination for involved.the second is that the affirmatively misleading notice sent to hayre sufficed to adequately protect veterans interests in any case,because veterans can be presumed to know the law regarding the veterans benefits system and their right to appeal.
in my view,the majority fixation on finality creates a conceptual confusion in identifying the constitutional deprivation present in these cases.in traditional cases arising under the due process clause of the fifth amendment,governmental confiscation of property is not difficult to recognize an individual possesses property and the government action deprives the individual of it.where new property is,statutory involved,however,claimants have an interest only in their benefit level as correctly determined under the law,rather than in any particular preordained amount.see charles reich,the new property,yale.thus,while any deprivation of property by the government implicates the due process clause,only a breach resulting in denial or inadequate allocation of benefits effects a deprivation subject to constitutional constraint.it is the breach,and not the reduction per se,that causes the deprivation.
keeping this point in mind,it is readily apparent that the supreme court application of the due process clause to governmental administrative action has not only encompassed,but indeed has been premised upon,the need for protection of individual property interests against even inadvertent breaches by the government.see,memphis light,gas water div.craft,d mathews,d goldberg,d.properly applied,regulations that govern administrative decisions in such cases do not deprive recipients of property,because a beneficiary whose entitlement should be reduced or terminated under relevant statutes can claim no valid interest in continuation.administrative decisions that affect statutory entitlements may often be correct.but when the is,the deprivation of because the administrative agent,for reasons beyond the claimant control,failed to comply with a statutorily mandated duty,constitutional procedures are interposed to prevent such breaches of regulation insofar as feasible.see logan zimmerman brush,d holding that the remedy the possibility of a negligence suit against the commission was insufficient to comply with due process because petitioner was challenging not the commission error,but the established state procedure that destroys his entitlement without according him proper procedural safeguards.
in the veterans uniquely claimant friendly system of awarding compensation,breaches of the duty to assist are at the heart of due process analysis.if the constitution provides no protection against the occurrence of such breaches,then the paternalistic interest in protecting the veteran is an illusory and meaningless assurance.the fact that breaches inevitably occur in the administration of any bureaucracy requires the conclusion that when the secretary administers a property entitlement program,he or she has a constitutional obligation to provide due process before implementing adverse changes in the entitlement level.otherwise,erroneous reductions or denials of is,deprivations of individual effected without due process of law.
because the breaches in these cases can not merely be overlooked,i turn to the central constitutional inquiry what process was due in light of the practicalities and peculiarities of the case mullane central hanover bank trust.in determining what process is due,the court must employ a flexible balancing test that takes into account the particular facts and circumstances,as the need for procedural safeguards varies with the situation due process unlike some legal rules,is not a technical conception with a fixed content unrelated to time,place and circumstances.cafeteria workers mcelroy,d.due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.morrissey brewer,d.
when reviewing alleged procedural due process violations,the supreme court has distinguished between claims based on established state procedures and claims based on random,unauthorized acts by state employees.see daniels williams,d logan,at.in the latter case,the due process clause is not violated when a state employee intentionally deprives an individual of property or liberty,so long as the state provides a meaningful remedy.hudson palmer,d.however,when the deprivation occurs in the more structured environment of established example,because an administrative official,for reasons beyond the claimant control,failed to comply with a statutorily mandated must follow the now familiar analysis set forth in mathews,at.identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors first,the private interest that will be affected by the official action second,the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used,and the probable value,if any,of additional or substitute procedural safeguards and finally,the government interest,including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute requirement would entail.id.these interests are relevant to determining the content of the notice as well as its timing and other procedural claims.goss lopez,d.
importance of the private interest 
the importance of the correct level of veterans benefits to eligible veterans can not be overstated.no form of new property is more clearly earned by an applicant or recipient,who received this claim of entitlement to benefits in exchange for service given to his or her country award through the va claims procedure is the sole process available to the veteran.he or she can not sue for disabilities stemming from military service under the federal tort claims act.see feres united states.veterans injured in military service generally lose all or much of their ability to earn a livelihood.yet under the majority opinion,a man or a woman,after time in service,has no rights that may not be frustrated to serve the shibboleth of finality.the majority makes no effort to balance the interests at stake.in this clash between individual rights and the public policy of finality,the latter,they say,is automatically held to be superior and trumps the former.
risk of error and value of additional procedures 
a primary function of legal process is to minimize the risk of erroneous decisions.mackey montrym,d see also fuentes shevin,d.consequently,a breach that may cause deprivation of property must be preceded by notice.mullane,at.an elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated,under all the circumstances,to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.the notice must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required information id.at.citations omitted see also memphis light,at.ruling that skeletal notice was constitutionally insufficient because utility customers are of various levels of education,experience and resources and the uninterrupted continuity of utility service is essential to health and safety.
the likelihood of error due to ineffective decision notices by the va is substantial.the general accounting office gao found that 
in over percent of the compensation notices reviewed,insufficient information was found to have been provided on the reason or reasons for va decision.gao found that denial notices for compensation claims were especially poor.they often stated only that the claims were denied because service connection was not found.
at,reprinted in.the gao also noted that the evidence was incomplete in approximately percent of claims and that information about how a veteran could appeal a decision was not included in the notices in to percent of claims.id.
the importance of this information can be seen in the circumstances of cook and hayre where the vital failure of effective notice was misleading enough to jeopardize their rights to appeal.although hayre was afforded notice of the ro decision,ante,at,the notice misleadingly assured hayre that we do not find in your medical records or elsewhere any evidence of the existence of a nervous condition without obtaining the service medical records hayre had specifically requested,ante,at.notice that affirmatively misleads in this fashion clearly violates the constitutional guarantee of due process.for cook,the notice denying service connection for stomach trouble and nervousness stated that the neuropsychiatric examination revealed no evidence of a psychiatric disability,even though the va compensation examination in noted 
the present day idea is,generally,that a peptic ulcer may be a visceral expression of long continued anxiety.in this case,a diagnosis of duodenal ulcer has been established.a dual diagnosis should not be made,but it should be clear that the diagnosis of duodenal ulcer inculdes sic a psychic or emotional component.
ante,at.the denial notice given to cook did not clearly indicate that the neuropsychiatric report had evidence of a psychic or emotional component.although the record does not state whether cook was aware of the contents of the report before the appeals period had run,it was important for cook,who was relying on the benefits system,to be notified of what evidence was considered by the va and how the evidence was used in reaching a decision.without such knowledge,cook was not in a position to evaluate its accuracy or propriety and to determine whether or not to contest it.the obvious value of notice of those simple factual determinations is that they were the only data that would have enabled cook to choose for himself whether to acquiesce or contest by filing a timely appeal.mullane,at.as the supreme court made clear in goldberg,at,in statutory entitlement cases the due process clause normally requires timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for proposed administrative action.such process is constitutionally required whenever the action may be challenged as resting on incorrect or misleading factual premises or on misapplication of rules or policies to the facts of particular cases.id.at.the forms of notice delivered to cook and hayre are sufficiently misleading that they introduce a high risk of error into the decisionmaking process,because veterans with valid entitlements might wrongly abandon their claims after an initial denial and not reassert them until their right to appeal is barred by the rule of finality.
this is especially true in the circumstances of cook and hayre,who relied on the and character of the veterans benefits system and pursued their statutory entitlements without the assistance of legal counsel.see c prohibiting fee agreements with an attorney until the board issues a final decision jaquay principi,en banc t he law prohibiting lawyers from charging a fee has the practical effect of limiting the ability of veterans to retain a lawyer at the early stages of the claim process.hayre,at noting that representation by attorneys is discouraged and infrequent quoting,reprinted in.while all citizens are presumed to know the law,that legal fiction is not identical to requiring that veteran claimants must be personally conversant and proficient with the arcane intricacies of an entitlement program that requires voluminous statutes,regulations,manuals,and circulars to administer.
in light of the complexity of the substance and procedures involved in these proceedings,as well as the importance of the interest at stake,i believe that due process includes minimal protections for the property interests of unrepresented veterans.when a veteran is not represented by counsel,the secretary has a heightened duty to assist veterans by conscientiously developing and obtaining all the relevant evidence.the secretary must be especially diligent in ensuring that favorable as well as unfavorable facts and circumstances are elicited.in addition,when a veteran service medical records are not obtained,as in hayre,the va duty to assist is essential,because the veteran possession of service medical records is a decidedly abnormal situation.the veteran can not reasonably be expected to have such records.department of veterans benefits,veterans administration,dvb circular,procedures for claims involving delayed receipt of service medical records,see also va veterans benefits administration letter at,service medical records and va medical center records are to be requested in all cases.these are records considered to be in va custody.
moreover,where so much of the evidence in va adjudications is circumstantial at best,the results of a medical examination for a veteran such as cook,are often the determinative factor in the claim adjudication process.an insufficient examination also breaches the va duty to assist the veteran in fully developing his or her claim because such evidence is needed to determine whether the veteran is eligible for benefits and the amount of any such benefits.therefore,administering an inadequate medical exam has as important an effect on the proper resolution of a veteran claim as a failure to inform the veteran that the va was unable to obtain medical records.a veteran must rely upon the va for a thorough medical examination just as he or she must rely upon the department to locate service medical records.just as a veteran must be able to assume,absent notice to the contrary,that the va located and based its claim determination on the requested,complete,and adequate medical records,he or she should be able to assume that the va performed a complete and thorough medical examination.because the breach of the duty to assist in this uniquely system jeopardized in a fundamentally unfair manner the right to appeal,the claims of cook and hayre should not become final for purposes of appeal.
governmental interest 
in contrast,requiring notices accurately to state what evidence was considered by the va and how the evidence was used in reaching a decision does not impose a significant financial or administrative burden on the secretary.in determining the costs to support the veterans benefits system,congress has already appropriated its resources with the presumption that statutory requirements will be upheld.thus,requiring the secretary to meet the duty to providing notices that are not affirmatively misleading and by administering complete and thorough medical not increase the expected administrative burden of providing eligible veterans with statutory entitlements.moreover,congress has evaluated the financial and administrative costs of upholding the statutory duty to assist in accordance with the interest at stake.the benefits administered by the secretary are an entitlement by which the nation keeps its commitment to our veterans who have sacrificed to protect and defend our freedom.the government has considered this interest and ensured that it will continue to pay our debts to these men and women.thus,congress,through fiscal appropriations presuming that statutory requirements will be upheld,recognizes the value of demonstrating to all those currently serving in our military and to those who may serve in the america honors its commitments to those who have served.
in my view,regardless of the nature of the dispute between the sovereign and the it be a claim for social security benefits or veterans benefits asserted by a soldier who was disabled during service to his or her citizen right to procedural due process is constitutionally protected.i am dismayed by the majority implication that breaches in the administration of veterans benefits programs may be ignored in determining what protection the constitution provides.such breaches all too often plague benefits programs designed to aid veterans.if breaches that might be prevented inexpensively lie entirely outside the ambit of the due process clause,then the and manifestly character of the veterans benefits system would be the cruelest of shams perpetrated upon our veterans.
i would reverse the judgment of the court of appeals for veterans claims.
the veterans administration was renamed the department of veterans affairs in.department of veterans affairs act,stat.throughout this opinion,va will be used as an abbreviation for both the veterans administration and the department of veterans affairs.
we have held that a veteran may bring a claim having the same factual basis as a previously disallowed claim when an intervening and substantive change in law or regulation creates a new basis for entitlement to a benefit.see spencer brown,routen,at.such a claim is treated as a new claim,however,and not a request for reconsideration of a previously disallowed claim.see spencer,at.
a veteran who successfully brings a cue claim is entitled to benefits retroactive to the date of the original claim.see b for the purpose of authorizing benefits,a rating or other adjudicative decision that constitutes a reversal or revision of a prior decision on the grounds of clear and unmistakable error has the same effect as if the decision had been made on the date of the prior decision.
when hayre was decided,the statutory duty to assist was set forth at a the secretary shall assist such a claimant in developing the facts pertinent to his or her claim.in enacting a as part of the veterans judicial review act,a,stat,congress codified the va obligation to assist claimants,which had existed in a since.see a i t is the obligation of the va to assist a claimant in developing the facts pertinent to his or her claim hayre,at.the duty to assist is now codified at a the secretary shall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant claim for a benefit under a law administered by the secretary.section a was added to the statutory scheme when congress enacted the veterans claims assistance act of,stat.see,a,stat.at.the regulation setting forth the duty to assist remains unchanged.see a.
pursuant to the veterans claims assistance act,the va,as part of the duty to assist,is required to notify a claimant when it is unable to obtain relevant r
