this case involves a jurisdictional limit on the authority of the merit systems protection board to review an agency removal of a worker from her job.in late,the department of justice hired amy mitchell as an assistant united states attorney.she began working while the required background investigation took place.when the investigation concluded about seven months later,the department issued mitchell a form stating that her appointment was subject to a trial period beginning august.the department fired her effective july,a few days before the period ended.she appealed her removal to the board.
the board may hear mitchell appeal only if she was an employee as an assistant united states attorney.the statute defines employee as someone who has completed years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to years or less.a c ii.mitchell was an employee under that definition if the time during which her background check was pending counted toward the required years of current continuous service.the board concluded that it did not,on the ground that mitchell service as an assistant united states attorney before august,was under a temporary appointment,not under other than a temporary appointment.the board dismissed the appeal.we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
mitchell began working as a government attorney in,when she became a lawyer for the social security administration.in,the department of justice appointed her as a special assistant united states attorney for the northern district of appointment during which she remained an employee of,and continued to be paid by,the social security administration.the department twice extended that appointment,and she served for just over two years in the special assistant position.
effective december,the department hired mitchell as an assistant united states attorney in the same office.it issued a standard form b notification of personnel action documenting the appointment.as authority for the appointment,the form invoked,which authorizes assistant united states attorney appointments generally.the form also stated that the appointment was not to exceed months,was temporary because of the pending background investigation,and was subject to the successful completion of that investigation.the background check concluded in late july.in early august,the department provided mitchell another standard form b,again citing as legal authority for the personnel action.this time,the remarks section stated that mitchell was subject to a trial period beginning august,during which she could be removed without cause or appeal rights.the department fired mitchell effective july,days before the period was to end,without notice or an opportunity to respond.
mitchell promptly filed an appeal at the mspb.in february,the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction,concluding that mitchell was not an employee within the meaning of a and therefore did not have the right to appeal.mitchell filed a petition for review to the full board,which denied her relief.she now appeals to this court.we have jurisdiction under a and b.
discussion 
there is no dispute that very nearly two years worth of mitchell service as an assistant united states attorney from august,to july,was under other than a temporary appointment limited to years or less.a c ii.we must decide whether she held a temporary appointment limited to years or less during the pendency of her background check in the months before august.if she did,then those months do not count toward the required years of current continuous service,leaving her just a few days shy of the threshold.if she did not,then she worked for more than two years in the same or similar positions and she comes within the statutory definition of an employee who may appeal to the board.making that legal determination de novo,roy merit systems protection board,we conclude that the second view is the better one 
title limits the board jurisdiction over federal workers appeals based on both the nature of the personnel action being contested and the employment status of the individual complainant.this case is about the latter.an employee has the right to appeal certain adverse actions to the board.a,d.section defines what employee means for such purposes.id.a.that definition modifies,for adverse actions,the general definition of a federal civilservice employee set out in.it is undisputed that,for mitchell,as a person in the excepted service not eligible for a preference,qualification as an employee depends on whether,upon her july firing,she had completed years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to years or less.id.a c ii van wersch dep t of health human,discussing addition of provision.to calculate the length of mitchell current continuous service,we must ask whether she was in a temporary appointment limited to years or less during her first months as an assistant united states attorney,starting in december.
our answer starts with the text,where our task is to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of the statute,avoiding,if it may be,any construction which implies that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed.inhabitants of montclair twp.ramsdell.that principle counsels against reading temporary to have no meaning beyond limited in time or for a limited period.such a reading would effectively erase the term from the provision the result would be the same as if the statute referred simply to other than a n appointment limited to years or less.the word temporary should be given independent meaning,if possible.
several sources might provide such meaning,but the first and most natural place to look is in regulations of the agency charged with implementing the statute,opm.see.it makes sense for congress to include the word temporary and allow its definition to depend,at least in part,on opm determinations.in fact,the predominant and longstanding use of the word temporary in the context of federal appointments is to refer to appointments of one year or less.
an opm regulation states 
w hen agencies elect to make temporary,intermittent,or seasonal appointments in schedule a,b,c,or d,those terms have the following meaning temporary appointments,unless otherwise specified in a particular schedule a,b,c,or d exception,are made for a specified period not to exceed year and are subject to the time limits in paragraph b of this section.appointments made for more than year are not considered to be temporary appointments,and are not subject to these time limits.
a.when opm promulgated the regulation,it made clear that it was newly making uniform a standard for temporary appointments that already appeared in opm regulations.the first sentence of the summary announced that opm was revising its regulations governing use of temporary appointments,appointments limited to year or less to set a uniform service limit for such appointments in both the competitive and the excepted service at year with no more than one year extension months total service,emphasis added see stern dep t of the army,it was a temporary appointment,one year or less,emphasis added.this understanding has persisted.see,excepted appointments year are defined in cfr a as temporary and are subject to the maximum time limits of cfr b.
opm has long distinguished temporary appointments from others given labels like term and timelimited made for different but still limited periods.for example,when adding the last sentence of a,which refers to t appointments,the agency explained both that t he existing regulations provide that if the appointments are for year or less,by definition,they are temporary appointments and,in addition,that agencies continue to have the ability to make appointments with time limits of more than year and that t hese appointments are not subject to the restrictions for temporary appointments.these distinctions existed long before the relevant provision of a was added t
