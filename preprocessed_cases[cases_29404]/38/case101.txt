in this dispute about how to count to are medicare beneficiaries who appeal from a grant of summary judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut hall.each of them spent at least three days in the hospital but was discharged less than three days after having been formally admitted,and each sought coverage under part a of the medicare program for a nursing home stay.after their claims for coverage were initially denied,they brought this lawsuit challenging the denial.the district court granted summary judgment for the government,holding that the plaintiffs were not entitled to medicare reimbursement because they had not spent the requisite amount of time as hospital inpatients.we agree and therefore affirm.

medicare is the federal government program for the elderly.dep t of soc.servs.leavitt,cir.it contains four distinct programs,the first of which,known as part a,is a hospital insurance program.see to.part a provides basic protection against the costs of hospital,related,home health services,and hospice care for,among others,eligible people over years of age.id.see also id.establishing the entitlement to part a benefits.under part a,service providers such as hospitals are paid the lesser of the reasonable cost of covered services provided to program beneficiaries or the customary charges with respect to such services,and agree not to charge beneficiaries for these services.haven hosp.leavitt,cir citations omitted quoting b see also kraemer heckler,cir describing the basic categories of services covered by part a.
the entitlements under part a include an extended care benefit,which provides coverage for extended care services for up to days during any spell of illness.a.part a does not cover all extended care services that follow hospital stays,however.rather,part a requires that the hospital stay be a qualifying hospital stay before it covers the subsequent extended care.specifically,the statute defines extended care services to mean extended care services furnished an individual after transfer from a hospital in which he was an inpatient for not less than consecutive days before his discharge from the hospital in connection with such transfer.id.i.in turn,it defines extended care services to mean services furnished to an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility.id.h.these services include nursing care,bed and board,physical and occupational therapy,and drugs.id.if extended care services are not covered by part a,they still may be covered by part part b is a voluntary program,however,and unlike part a beneficiaries,part b enrollees must pay a monthly premium.matthews leavitt,cir.dep t of soc,at furlong shalala,cir.
marion landers,marion dixon,and muriel grigley,the first of whom is now deceased and is represented here by her estate,were medicare beneficiaries who each received inpatient hospital care followed by care at a skilled nursing facility,or snf essentially,a nursing home.see a defining snf.each of them spent three consecutive days in the hospital before moving to the snf.yet the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms the federal agency situated within the department of health and human services hhs that administers the medicare program on behalf of the secretary of hhs denied their claims for coverage with respect to their snf stays.cms did so in accordance with its own rules for determining whether a patient is eligible for snf coverage.according to one such rule,known as the rule,a patient is eligible for snf coverage only if he or she has been hospitalized for medically necessary inpatient hospital or inpatient critical access hospital care,for at least consecutive calendar days,not counting the date of discharge.a.and according to another rule,a patient is considered an inpatient if he or she is formally admitted as an inpatient.ctrs.for medicare medicaid,publ,medicare benefit policy manual,ch,hereinafter medicare benefit policy manual,available at.gov manuals iom list.asp.landers,dixon,and grigley all spent only midnights in hospitals and then moved to nursing homes,where they received extended care services.but while in the hospital,each of them spent at least one midnight either in the emergency room or on observation status before being formally admitted.accordingly,cms determined that,because they had not spent three consecutive midnights hospitalized after having been formally admitted,part a did not cover their snf stays.
landers,dixon,and grigley challenged cms interpretation of the qualifying hospital stay requirement in a putative class action.they sought a permanent injunction and a writ of mandamus prohibiting the secretary from excluding medicare beneficiaries time in the emergency room and on observation status from counting toward the qualifying stay requirement.the district court granted class certification,landers leavitt landers i,and on for summary judgment,ruled in favor of the secretary,landers leavitt landers ii,jch,wl.the plaintiffs now appeal.
discussion 
the plaintiffs challenge the district court ruling on three grounds.first,they argue that the medicare statute entitles them to coverage for their snf stays.second,they contend that cms interpretation of the statute violates the equal protection guarantee of the constitution.third,they argue that the district court erred by basing its decision exclusively on the administrative record.
the medicare statute provides coverage for a snf stay for a beneficiary who receives extended care services in an snf after having been an inpatient for not less than consecutive days in a hospital.i.neither the statute nor any applicable regulation defines inpatient.cms policy manual defines an inpatient as a person who has been formally admitted to a hospital.the government urges us to credit the interpretation of the statute that it has set forth in the policy manual.we only consider whether we should defer to the agency interpretation of the statute,however,upon finding the statute ambiguous.dynamics land cline,d d eference to an agency statutory interpretation is called for only when the devices of judicial construction have been tried and found to yield no clear sense of congressional intent.citing ins,d kruse wells fargo home,cir if the provisions of the statute are unclear or ambiguous we must decide whether to defer to the agency reading of them if we decide that we are to defer,we must then decide the appropriate level of deference.we have little difficulty finding ambiguity here.the statute provides no definition of inpatient,and both the plaintiffs and the agency can cite to dictionary definitions supporting their competing definitions.see webster third new international dictionary defining inpatient as a patient in a hospital or infirmary who receives lodging and food as well as treatment american heritage dictionary of the english language ed defining inpatient as a patient who is admitted to a hospital or clinic for treatment that requires at least one overnight stay see also oxford english dictionary ed defining inpatient as a patient who remains in a hospital while under medical treatment.therefore,we agree with the agency that the statute is ambiguous as to whether time spent in observation and in the emergency room should be considered inpatient time upon the patient later admission.
the next question for us is whether the agency interpretation of inpatient is of the type that is eligible for deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.if it is,then we proceed with a chevron analysis.mcnamee dep t of the treasury,cir levine apker,cir.if not,then we construe the statute in the first instance,giving effect to cms nonlegislative interpretation to the extent we find it persuasive in accordance with skidmore swift.we review de novo these questions of law that the district court addressed on for summary judgment.krauss oxford health plans,cir prot.advocacy for persons with disabilities mental health addiction,cir butts barnhart,cir,amended on reh g in part,cir.
a n administrative implementation of a statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.rotimi gonzales,cir per curiam quoting united states mead,d.the first half of this test is clearly satisfied congress has delegated general rulemaking authority with respect to medicare to the secretary of hhs,who in turn has delegated that authority to cms.see,a the secretary shall promulgate regulations and make initial determinations with respect to benefits under part a or part b of this subchapter in accordance with those regulations id.a the secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the administration of the insurance programs under this subchapter.see also shalala guernsey mem l,d recognizing the medicare statute broad delegation of authority new york ex rel.stein sec y of health human,cir resolution of medicare reimbursement issues requires an understanding of complicated and technical facts,and congress has delegated these difficult decisions to the agency that has specialized knowledge in the area.thus,we move to the second half of the test and consider whether cms has promulgated its interpretation in the exercise of its authority.
most agency interpretations that have qualified for chevron deference are rules that have been promulgated in regulations issued through notice and comment or adjudication,or in another format authorized by congress for use in issuing legislative rules.cmty.health ctr,cir citations omitted see also mead,at.t he overwhelming number of our cases applying chevron deference have reviewed the fruits of rulemaking or formal adjudication.the policy manual provision at issue here,of course,is not the product of rulemaking or formal adjudication.nevertheless,less formal,nonlegislative interpretations are not for that reason alone disqualified from receiving chevron deference.see barnhart walton,d mead,at.cmty.health,at see also gonzales oregon,d considering at great length whether an interpretive rule was eligible for chevron deference but ultimately answering in the negative.
although nonlegislative rules are not per se ineligible for chevron deference as a general matter,we are aware of few,if any,instances in which an agency manual,in particular,has been accorded chevron deference indeed,we have remarked that christensen harris county,d,made clear that interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals and enforcement guidelines do not warrant chevron style deference.de la mota dep t of,cir quoting christensen,at.although both barnhart and mead recognized that some subset of informal interpretations can receive chevron deference,the sole example that both cases cite,nationsbank variable annuity life insurance,d,concerned an agency opinion letter,id.at,which is qualitatively different from an agency manual.neither barnhart nor mead casts doubt on prior pronouncements that agency manuals,as a class,are generally ineligible for chevron deference.see mead,at.describing policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines as beyond the chevron pale guernsey mem l,at.definition in hhs medicare provider reimbursement manual is a prototypical example of an interpretive rule and therefore do es not have the force and effect of law and is not accorded that weight in the adjudicatory process pub.citizen,dep t of health human,mead and christensen cited agency manuals as an archetype of the kind of document that is not entitled to chevron deference.we therefore decline to accord chevron deference to the interpretation of inpatient in cms policy manual.
an agency interpretation that does not qualify for chevron deference is still entitled to respect according to its persuasiveness,mead,at,as evidenced by the thoroughness evident in the agency consideration,the validity of its reasoning,its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements,and all those factors which give it power to persuade,id.at.quoting skidmore,at.as we conduct this inquiry,we are mindful of the supreme court repeated suggestion that hhs interpretations,in particular,should receive more respect than the of agency interpretations.see,thomas jefferson shalala,d schweiker gray panthers,d.indeed,we have observed that,in cases such as those involving medicare or medicaid,in which cms,a highly expert agency,administers a large complex regulatory scheme in cooperation with many other institutional actors,the various possible standards for deference namely,chevron and skidmore begin to converge.cmty.health,at.
our analysis of the skidmore factors in this case leads us to conclude that cms interpretation is entitled to a great deal of persuasive weight.first,cms interpretation is longstanding.see haven bd.of educ.bell,d in construing a statute,this court normally accords great deference to the interpretation,particularly when it is longstanding,of the agency charged with the statute administration.medicare came into existence in.see health insurance for the aged act,tit.i,stat.a nearly contemporaneous hhs regulation established a rule that,like cms current rule,began counting inpatient days for purposes of the qualifying stay requirement on the day the patient was formally admitted 
the consecutive days as a hospital inpatient defined.the hospital inpatient requirement is a period of consecutive calendar days beginning with the calendar day of admission even if less than a day,and ending with the day before the calendar day of discharge.thus,in determining whether the requirement is met,the day of admission is counted as one day the day of discharge is not counted as a day and each intervening day is counted as a single day.
c cms interpretation thus reflects a position that hhs first adopted more than years ago.
second,cms is consistent in its interpretation,employing the same definition elsewhere in its guidance manual and expressly declining to count time on observation status or in the emergency room toward the qualifying stay requirement.see medicare benefit policy manual,supra,ch.this section of the policy manual also references the federal register publication in which hhs promulgated c,which further bolsters the conclusion that cms desires to maintain its consistent and position.
the plaintiffs urge us to find the government position inconsistent based on the way in which cms reimburses beneficiaries for their hospital stays.the plaintiffs in this case sought medicare reimbursement not only for their snf stays,but also for the time they spent in hospitals before their snf stays.the same section of the medicare statute that provides coverage for snf stays also provides coverage for hospital stays,in the latter case for inpatient hospital services for up to days during any spell of illness.a.yet the plaintiffs were reimbursed both for the services they received after they were formally the government view,the only time during which they were for the services they received while in the emergency room and on observation status before being formally admitted.this reimbursement policy,the plaintiffs contend,makes the government position with respect to snf reimbursement unreasonable and inconsistent if emergency room and observation status services are inpatient hospital services,why should time spent in the emergency room or on observation status not count as inpatient hospital time for the purpose of meeting the qualifying stay requirement 
the difficulty with this argument is that the statute at least strongly counsels in favor of the distinction that the government has drawn.part a reimbursements for inpatient hospital services are determined by reference to the statutory term operating costs of inpatient hospital services.as the statute defines that term,it means operating costs with respect to inpatient hospital services,and includes the costs of all services for which payment may be made under this subchapter that are provided by the hospital to the patient during the days immediately preceding the date of the patient admission if such services are related to the admission.a emphases added.thus,a directs cms to provide coverage for an inpatient hospital stay and up to three days of related services rendered before the patient was admitted to the hospital.the statute does not,however,require or even suggest that the days themselves be treated as inpatient days.indeed,cms has relied on this aspect of the statute to explain its present position.see medicare program prospective payment system and consolidated billing for skilled nursing facilities for fy,may,hereinafter proposed rules.accordingly,regardless of whether we think it sensible as a policy matter for cms to reimburse hospital services as if they were inpatient services but not consider that time to be part of a inpatient stay,the statutory requirement that services be reimbursed leads us to find no regulatory inconsistency in cms decision not to count hospital time in determining whether a patient has had an snf qualifying stay.
third,cms has recently reconsidered its position on the public record.in,cms invite d comments on whether it should consider the possibility of counting the time spent in observation status toward meeting the snf benefit qualifying hospital stay requirement.id.at.in inviting these comments,cms observed that the stay requirement was designed to target the snf benefit more effectively at the limited segment of the nursing home population that the benefit was actually designed to cover that is,those beneficiaries requiring a,fairly intensive stay in a snf as a continuation of an acute hospital stay of several days.id.it observed,further,that the medical practice of placing patients on observation status before formally admitting them has grown in prevalence since congress enacted the medicare statute in,that some commentators have suggested that patients on observation status receive qualitatively the same type of care as admitted patients,and that some view it as unfair for medicare reimbursement decisions to turn on a distinction that they believe to be a mere recordkeeping convention on the part of the hospital rather than a substantive change in the actual care that the beneficiary receives there.id.
following this invitation,cms received comments on this precise issue.many of these comments expressed support for the idea that hospital time spent in observation status immediately preceding a formal inpatient admission should count toward satisfying the snf benefit statutory qualifying hospital stay requirement.medicare program prospective payment system and consolidated billing for skilled nursing facilities for fy.s ome others supported counting the observation time,but not time spent in the emergency room.id.
ultimately,however,cms declined to change its interpretation.with regard to the suggestion that emergency room time count toward the qualifying stay requirement,cms d id not share the belief that time spent in the emergency room is essentially comparable to observation time in this context because the mere presence of time spent in the emergency room prior to formal admission would not,in itself,serve to identify the degree of severity of a particular patient condition during that time.id.with regard to the suggestion that time on observation status count toward the requirement,cms stated that it was continuing to review this issue,but was not yet ready to make a final determination.id.cms was wary of changing its interpretation,it said,because it did not want to adopt a reimbursement guideline that conflicted with what it viewed as congress intent in establishing the qualifying hospital stay requirement namely,that the snf benefit serv e as a less expensive alternative to what would otherwise be the final,convalescent portion of an acute care stay of several days as an inpatient at a hospital.id.at.
the preceding exchange shows that cms opened its policies to public comment,received comments challenging the interpretation at issue in this case,and declined to change its position in light of what it perceives as congress intent in imposing the qualifying stay requirement.cms statement with respect to observation status may be less than wholly satisfying,but it is not so deficient that it lacks persuasive force.to be sure,we may reject an agency interpretation that merely mirrors the common understanding at the time the agency adopted its interpretation but has not been revised to reflect changing circumstances,particularly in areas characterized by rapid technological development.detsel sullivan,cir.here,however,cms does not attempt to justify its position by arguing that it was reasonable when first adopted.rather,cms appears to be acutely aware of the changes in medical practice since the and has declined to include time on observation status toward the count because,in its view,doing so would risk undermining congressional intent.we are thus unable to conclude that cms entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem or offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before it.motor vehicle mfrs.ass state farm mut.auto.ins,d.
the plaintiffs urge us to view this public comment opportunity and cms reconsideration of its interpretation as a farce or as otherwise tainted because it was conducted during the pendency of this litigation.we decline to do so.although we do not defer to agency constructions of statutes asserted as litigating positions,see keisler,cir citing bowen georgetown,d,cms presented its construction to the public at large and considered its position as a generally applicable matter rather than for a single litigation.the law generally seeks to encourage public participation in agency decisionmaking,see am.postal workers union postal,guardian fed.sav.loan ass fed.sav.loan ins,and we would frustrate rather than further that goal if we were to strip an agency of deference it would otherwise be due merely because that public participation was spurred by litigation rather than arising from the agency desire or beneficence.by way of analogy,a duly promulgated agency regulation enjoys the full extent of chevron deference even when the regulation was prompted by pending litigation that lurked in the background.smiley citibank,d.the plaintiffs proffer no persuasive reason why we should question the integrity of cms deliberative process here given that we would decline to do so in the chevron context.
fourth,cms rule is the product of an interpretation that is relatively formal within the universe of informal interpretations.t he deference due to an agency interpretation is at the high end of the spectrum of deference when the interpretation in question is not merely ad hoc but is applicable to all cases.chauffer training,spellings,cir.cms interpretation,set forth in a policy manual rather than,for example,a nonprecedential letter ruling,is generally applicable and is not an ad hoc position.in the medicaid context,we have regarded a cms manual as meriting an intermediate level of deference that lies between a published recommendation and an interpretation advanced only in litigation,rabin,cir,and we do the same here.
in sum,the skidmore factors lead us to regard the statutory interpretation set forth in cms policy manual as persuasive.
in view of our skidmore analysis,we conclude that a medicare beneficiary is not an inpatient within the meaning of i unless he or she has been formally admitted to a hospital.we reach this conclusion not only because our decision is informed by cms highly persuasive interpretation,but also because it accords with the statutory text and our governing precedents.
the statutory definition of inpatient hospital services enumerates such services as bed and board,b,nursing services,id.b,and other diagnostic or therapeutic items or services,id.b.the plaintiffs urge us to credit their argument that anyone who receives these services in the hospital is receiving inpatient hospital services and is therefore an inpatient.in light of the statutory text,however,this argument is ultimately.the statute defines inpatient hospital services to include the aforementioned items and services when they are furnished to an inpatient of a hospital and by the hospital.id.b emphasis added.thus,services can not be
