this case is before the court on appeal from a decision of the fifth district court of appeal,state rubio,so d dca,which held a state statute to be invalid.this court has jurisdiction under article v,section b of the florida constitution.
facts and procedural history 
the defendants were charged in a information.the counts were racketeering,in violation of section,florida statutes conspiracy to commit racketeering,in violation of section,florida statutes medicaid provider fraud,in violation of section a,florida statutes patient brokering,in violation of section b,florida statutes and white collar crime,in violation of section,florida statutes.
the following facts were set out in the fifth district decision.defendants sonia guzman and anamaria mendez are miami dentists who were recruited to provide dental services in orlando to children.guzman and mendez billed medicaid and then split the fees with defendants john rubio and gustavo fernandez.rubio and fernandez solicited children primarily from public housing areas and transported them to and from the clinic.five medicaid recipients were examined by a pediatric dentist,who found no evidence to support the claims submitted on their behalf.the defendants were charged with violation of the above statutes on october.
according to the defendants,the fee arrangement was between their corporations.rubio company provided management services for the dentists,including marketing for the dental practice and handling the business aspects of the dental practice.guzman and mendez performed the clinical work.in return for getting a turnkey dental office and marketing,rubio company was paid between and of the compensation received by the dentists for their services.
the defendants moved to dismiss all charges.on february,following a hearing,the trial court granted the motion,dismissing all counts because it determined that the statutes under which the defendants were charged were unconstitutional,that the counts against the defendants were multiplicitous,and that a proper predicate for the racketeering and white collar crime charges was not established.
the state appealed this dismissal to the fifth district court of appeal,which affirmed in part and reversed in part the trial court decision.the fifth district affirmed the trial court decision that the medicaid provider fraud statute,a,is unconstitutional.rubio,so d at.the fifth district found that the trial court erred in concluding that the patient brokering statute,is unconstitutional.id.at.however,the fifth district affirmed the trial court dismissal of the patient brokering charges on the ground that they were multiplicitous.the court found that under the statute,the defendants could only be charged for the arrangement between the defendants to split fees and not for each instance of.finally,the fifth district affirmed the trial court dismissal of the racketeering and white collar crime charges.id.at.
this case comes to this court on the basis of its mandatory jurisdiction to review the fifth district determination that section a is unconstitutional.however,both the state and the defendants have also raised issues in respect to each of the decisions in the fifth district opinion.in our review,we will consider whether the medicaid provider fraud statute is constitutional the patient brokering statute is constitutional the charges under the patient brokering statute were multiplicitous and there is a sufficient predicate for the charges of racketeering and white collar crime.because each of these issues concern questions of statutory constitutionality or construction,we review each issue de novo.tillman state,so d,state,so d.
constitutionality of medicaid provider fraud statute 
in the information alleging violation of section a,the defendants were charged with on various dates knowingly making,causing to be made,or aiding and abetting the making of a claim for payment for dental services which were not rendered.the trial court order granting the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that section a is unconstitutional states that the trial court ruling is as to the issue of law and not on the basis of findings of fact.state rubio,cir.order dated,order.the fifth district affirmed the motion to dismiss.the case is now presented for our review of whether the granting of the motion to dismiss on the constitutional ground was correct.
section a provides that it is unlawful to 
knowingly make,cause to be made,or aid and abet in the making of any false statement or false representation of a material fact,by commission or omission,in any claim submitted to the agency or its fiscal agent for payment.
at the time that the defendants were charged with violating this provision,knowingly was defined in section d to mean that the act is done by a person who is aware or should be aware of the nature of his or her conduct and that his or her conduct is substantially certain to cause the intended result.
this issue is similar to the issue of constitutionality of section e that this court considered in state harden,so d,cert.denied,d.in harden,the defendants were charged with nine counts of conspiracy,racketeering,and medicaid fraud under section e,florida statutes.that section states that it is unlawful to 
knowingly solicit,offer,pay,or receive any remuneration,including any kickback,bribe,or rebate,directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind,in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made,in whole or in part,under the medicaid program,or in return for obtaining,purchasing,leasing,ordering,or arranging for or recommending,obtaining,purchasing,leasing,or ordering any goods,facility,item,or service,for which payment may be made,in whole or in part,under the medicaid program.
this is known as the provision of the statute.the same definition of knowingly in section d applies to both sections a and e.
in harden,the defendants argued that the florida statute was preempted by the federal medicaid statute,in part because the florida statute definition of the term knowingly conflicted with the federal mens rea requirement that the kickback occur knowingly and willfully.however,the defendants in harden also based their preemption argument on the federal statute exceptions or safe harbors from the provisions that were not similarly excluded by the state statute.these safe harbor provisions include an exception for patient referrals occurring within a bona fide employment relationship.the defendants in harden maintained that the alleged kickbacks were part of a bona fide employment relationship and thus could not be prosecuted under the federal statute.
in considering harden,we reviewed the federal statute,noting that within the legislative history of the federal statute,it was clear that the purpose of the federal provision was to outlaw health care referrals that were unethical or inappropriate.harden,so d at.the federal statutory language for the provision originally had no mens rea requirement,though it was primarily concerned with outlawing health care referrals that were considered unethical or inappropriate.id.at.subsequent amendments added both a knowing and willful mens rea requirement,as well as the safe harbor provisions.these amendments were made because of health care providers concerns that the statute was overbroad and punished conduct that while improper,was inadvertent.id.at.we noted that although the federal statute did not provide for explicit preemption of the florida statute,implied conflict preemption could still exist.we stated that we must look to the statutory differences between the federal and state laws and determine whether these differences warrant conflict preemption.id.at.we concluded that florida statute was preempted by the federal statute because it criminalize d conduct that federal law specifically intended to be lawful and shielded from prosecution.id.at.we continued 
there is clear congressional intent to exempt compensation paid by employers to bona fide employees for providing covered items or services from those remunerations that constitute prohibited kickbacks under the federal statute.the heightened mens rea of the federal statute also indicates a clear intent that negligent or inadvertent behavior does not subject an individual to prosecution under the federal statute.
both the heightened mens rea requirement and the safe harbor provision are key elements in fulfilling the purpose of the federal statute,which is to outlaw health care referrals that are unethical.accordingly,we agree with the third district that the florida statute is preempted because it presents an obstacle to the accomplishments of the purposes of the federal law.
the defendants in the present case repeat the argument that the charges based on the prohibition against filing a false statement in a claim for payment based upon section a should be dismissed because this statute unconstitutionally conflicts with the federal false statements statute that contains the language knowingly and willfully.the federal statute,a,imposes penalties on whoever 
knowingly and willfully makes or causes to be made any false statement or representation of a material fact in any application for any benefit or payment under a federal health care program as defined in subsection f of this section,
at any time knowingly and willfully makes or causes to be made any false statement or representation of a material fact for use in determining rights to such benefit or payment.
the defendants maintain that our holding the provision unconstitutional because of the reduced mens rea necessarily should apply to the false statement provision in this case.
the defendants argument fails to take into account that we held in harden that both the mens rea and the safe harbor provisions were key elements in fulfilling the purpose of the federal statute.so d at.no similar safe harbor provisions are key elements in fulfilling the purpose of the false statement provisions.the intent of the false statement provisions is to protect medicaid funds from depletion by paying false claims.there are no bona fide relationships built upon false statements in claims for payment.
as we expressly stated in harden,for preemption to apply defendants must be able to show that any impediment to the purpose and objectives of the federal statute purposes caused by the state statute must be severe and not merely modest.pharm.research mfrs.of am.walsh,d.this impediment must seriously compromise important federal interests.arkansas coop.arkansas pub.serv.comm n,d.we stated in harden 
federal preemption of a state law is strong medicine,and is not casually to be dispensed.pharm.research mfrs.of am.concannon,cir quoting grant dairy comm r,cir.this is especially true when the federal statute creates a program,such as medicaid,that utilizes cooperative federalism.where coordinated state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework,and in the pursuit of common purposes,the case for federal preemption becomes a less persuasive one.id.quoting.dep t of soc.health servs.bowen,cir see also pharm.research mfrs.of america walsh,d the presumption against federal preemption of a state statute designed to foster public health has special force when it appears that the two governments are pursuing common purposes.
harden,so d at.
prior to our decision in harden,the third district decided state wolland,so d dca,which involved the issue of the constitutionality of the false statements prohibition of section a.in wolland,the third district distinguished its earlier decision in state harden,so d dca,aff,so d,and found that the false statements prohibition in section a was constitutional.the third district upheld the false statements provision,reasoning that the mens real concern in harden was not the same in respect to false statements because one can not negligently knowingly make a false statement in a claim submitted to the agency for payment.wolland,so d at quoting a.
the fifth district,in its opinion in the present case,issued prior to the release of our decision in harden,acknowledged the decisions of the third district in wolland and harden.the fifth district disagreed with the wolland decision and held that under the definition of knowingly in the statute,the defendants could be convicted for conduct that may be improper but was inadvertent and found that this definition was not consistent with what congress intended.rubio,so d at.
while we do not agree with the reasoning of the third district in wolland that a prosecution of a violation of the false statements provision can proceed upon only proof of a negligent filing of a false statement in a claim for payment,we reject the fifth district conclusion that this means that the false statement provision is unconstitutional in the present case.
as noted earlier,our concern about the reduced mens rea is not combined here with a concern about safe harbor provisions.while the strong medicine of preemption was necessary in harden because the state statute criminalized activities expressly protected in the federal law,no similar safe harbor provision exists in the statute regarding false statements to induce payments from federal health care programs.
the present case is only at the information stage of the proceedings.the charges are that the defendants filed claims for payment for dental services which were not performed and that,therefore,the claims for payment contained false statements.if the proof is that the defendants were aware that the statements in the claims for payment were false,we do not believe that the prohibition in section a is unconstitutional as to such conduct by the defendants.
the constitutionality of the false statement prohibition of section a can and should be saved by severing the should be aware language from section d as it pertains to section a.we have long recognized that if an unconstitutional provision of a statute can be severed so that the remaining provisions of the statute can be found to be constitutional,there should be a constitutionally saving severance.in state calhoun county,so,citations omitted,we said 
it is a principle of statutory construction that the language of a statute should be so construed as to preserve its constitutionality rather than to defeat it,and that if two apparently contradictory provisions exist in a statute,one being consistent with the limitations of the constitution and another in violation of them,the latter should not control to strike down the statute in other words,if a clause in the statute which is violative of the constitution may be eliminated and the remaining portion of the act stand as a valid expression of the legislative will the clause violative of constitutional limitations will be eliminated and the act permitted to stand although there is no separability clause in the act.
the authority of the court to eliminate from an act of the legislature an invalid clause does not flow from legislative authority authorizing the court to do so,but from the inherent power of the court to preserve the constitutionality of the act if it is possible to do so even by the elimination of invalid clauses,where it appears that the elimination of such clauses would not destroy the main and essential features of the act and the portion left is a completed and workable statute and where it can not be said that the legislature would not have enacted the remaining portions of the act without the invalid clause which is stricken.
see also schmitt state,so d,portion of statute may be severed provided it meets test that unconstitutional provisions can be separated from valid provisions legislative purpose can be accomplished independently of provisions that are void,good and bad features are not so inseparable that it can be said that the legislature would have passed the one without the other and an act complete in itself remains after the invalid provisions are stricken.we apply this principle in this case in order to fulfill our obligation to preserve the constitutionality of the statute.
in the present case,the trial court granted a motion to dismiss the charges based upon the allegations that the defendants knowingly filed false statements for payment.we reverse the affirmance of the trial court dismissal,with directions that the charges be reinstated.in order to prove the charges,the state is required to prove as an element of the offense that the defendant was aware of the nature of his or her conduct and that his or her conduct is substantially certain to cause the intended result.by this decision we also adhere to the principle of preemption that state law is displaced only to the extent that it actually conflicts with federal law.dalton little rock family planning,d quoting pacific gas state energy res.conservation dev.comm n,d.
we disapprove the decision of the third district in wolland to the extent that it is in conflict with this decision.
ii.constitutionality of patient brokering statute 
in this issue,the defendants argue that section,florida statutes,which prohibits patient brokering,is unconstitutional because it is vague lacks a mens rea requirement and fails to impose a mens rea requirement of willfulness.counts charged the defendants with patient brokering,in violation of section b c.
the trial court held that the statute was unconstitutional,though it did not identify on what basis it reached this conclusion.the fifth district reversed the trial court holding,finding each of the defendants arguments meritless,and concluded that the statute is constitutional.rubio,so d at.we affirm the fifth district decision holding the statute to be constitutional and adopt the fifth district reasoning on this issue.
iii.multiplicity 
in this issue,the state contends that the fifth district erred in dismissing counts,the patient brokering charges,and finding that the charges were multiplicitous.the prosecutor stated at the motion to dismiss hearing that the information was designed so that the defendants were charged with violating the statute every single time they did any act in furtherance of the arrangement to refer patients the defendants,in their motion to strike these charges,argued that the counts were multiplicitous because the legislature use of the words any and arrangement in section meant that charges could only be brought per arrangement and not per act committed in that arrangement.again,no evidence has yet been presented or considered because this case is an appeal of an order granting the defendants motion to dismiss prior to trial.
the trial court dismissed the charges as multiplicitous because the court found that section b makes it a crime to engage in any arrangement regardless of the number of instances which occur thus,charging each instance as a separate and distinct crime results in a multiplicitous information.order at.the fifth district affirmed the trial court dismissal,finding that the statute was meant to prohibit the agreement to refer patients to the dentists in return for a split of the fees.the fifth district held that it could discern no intent by the legislature to criminalize each and every act done pursuant to the agreement.rubio,so d at.where the defendants are charged with multiple violations of the same statute,as is the case here,the courts apply the allowable unit of prosecution standard to determine whether a double jeopardy violation has occurred.id.at.the allowable unit of prosecution is defined as the aspect of criminal activity that the legislature intended to punish.mcknight state,so d,dca.
as the fifth district opinion reflects,we have dealt with issues of multiplicity several times,most recently in bautista state,so d.in bautista,we considered whether the state could charge the defendant with multiple counts of dui manslaughter when multiple deaths occur in a single dui incident.the defendant argued that he could not be charged with multiple counts of dui manslaughter because the statute stated that one who causes the death of any human being commits dui manslaughter.c.stat.emphasis added.bautista relied upon a test from our case law in arguing that while the use of the article a in a statute would indicate the legislature intent to impose punishment for each death,the use of the word any rendered the statute ambiguous and thus required the imposition of the rule of lenity,such that the statute should be interpreted to favor the defendant.id.at.
we rejected bautista claim.our opinion traced the history of the test,noting that several of our previous decisions had indeed relied solely on this test to determine the legislature intended unit of prosecution.however,we noted that in our initial decision on this matter in grappin state,so d,we had not simply applied the test,but had instead adopted a approach to discerning the intended unit of prosecution.bautista,so d at.
following this precedent,we concluded 
applying a approach to the dui manslaughter statute leads to one inexorable conclusion.any reasonable consideration of the language of the statute,the history of its enactment,the uniform statutory treatment of manslaughter offenses,and the case law in existence makes it clear that the legislative intent is that each death caused in a dui crash is to be charged and punished as a separate offense.
regarding the test,we stated 
the test does not compel a contrary determination of the legislature intended unit of prosecution for the offense of dui manslaughter.bautista argument based on the test succeeds only if we were to apply the test as a simple syntactical rule in isolation from the context in which the test arose.however,it would be improper to so isolate this distinction.as discussed earlier,the distinction was used in grappin as one part of a common sense application of rules of statutory interpretation,including reference to the overall statutory scheme and purpose as well as to related cases.within this context,the test is a valid linguistic tool that is helpful in establishing the legislature intended unit of prosecution.however,the test is not an infallible or exclusive indicator of legislative intent.rather,absent clear legislative intent to the contrary,the test serves as a valuable but nonexclusive means to assist courts in determining the intended unit of prosecution.
in attempting to discern the intent behind a statutory term,courts should not mechanistically rely on a single tool but must use all available tools of interpretation.see united states dickerson.stating that the meaning to be ascribed to a legislative act can only be derived from a considered weighing of every relevant aid to construction.
in fact,only if the criminal statute in question uses the article a is the legislative intent as to the intended unit of prosecution actually determined by the test.this is because the use of the article a is unambiguous.if the adjective any is used,an ambiguity of legislative intent arises.instead of using the traditional tools for determining legislative intent,the test simply applies the rule of lenity to this ambiguity and precludes more than one unit of prosecution.this latter result avoids determining legislative intent rather than ascertaining that intent.
we acknowledge that our decision in state watts,so d,while reaching the correct result,might appear to apply the test mechanistically.we applied the test in that case because there was no clear evidence of legislative intent to permit multiple units of prosecution.however,grappin and its progeny should not be interpreted to suggest that the intended unit of prosecution is automatically rendered ambiguous whenever a statute uses the word any.in the dui manslaughter statute,the intent of the legislature is clear.and since our purpose in construing a statutory provision is to give effect to legislative intent,the unit of prosecution in dui manslaughter cases must be the number of victims the number of dui traffic violations.the test should not be applied to create an ambiguity where none exists and then to reach a result contrary to clear legislative intent.
thus,in order to determine the intended unit of prosecution for section,we must look at the overall statutory scheme and language of the statute.while much is made by the parties and the lower court of the test,it seems that the real difference in the state and defense
