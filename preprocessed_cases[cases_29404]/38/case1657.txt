factual and procedural background 
on february,the department sent a letter to pharmacy,located in los angeles,stating the department was terminating pharmacy provisional provider status,effective on february,in accordance with section,footnote,ante,because during a field audit,an auditor and consultant directly observed the pharmacy technician dispensing medication intended for delivery to clients without direct supervision and control of a pharmacist.this violates california business and professions code section sic a and f,which states in part a pharmacy technician may perform packaging,manipulative,repetitive,or other nondiscretionary tasks,only while assisting,and while under the direct supervision and control of a pharmacist t he pharmacy technician shall be within the pharmacist view 
on february,the department sent pharmacy an amended letter correcting the provider number.
on february,pharmacy attorney responded that there must be some mistake and requested an informal meeting to obviate the expenditure of resources on an administrative appeal.
as alleged in pharmacy writ petition,pharmacy attorney and its pic luther jenkins met in sacramento on march,with jan inglish,chief of the department medical review branch,audits and investigations section,and members of her staff.jenkins allegedly provided documents and live testimony contradicting the department facts,and inglish allegedly asked inappropriate questions about the ethnic of the community where pharmacy was located the national origin of pharmacy owners and the relative salaries of the owners and pharmacist.
on may,the department sent an amendment to letter dated february,to luther jenkins,president,chief executive officer and pic of golden drugs.the letter stated the department is terminating your provisional provider status,suspending you from enrollment and participation in the program,and deactivating your provider number effective june,in accordance with section fn,ante.
in addition to the facts asserted in the prior termination letter,the may letter said that it conducted an onsite review on november,which revealed pharmacy changed ownership in may after the change in ownership,pharmacy monthly payments increased from a monthly average of,to a monthly average of jenkins,the majority owner and pic,earned less than the two minority owners pharmacy daily dispensing report showed it dispensed prescriptions or prescriptions per hour on november,prescriptions or per hour on november,and prescriptions or per hour on december,while having only one pharmacist on hand.
the may letter provided further detail regarding the substance of the prior termination letter,stating on december,the department reviewers consisting of a health program auditor and pharmacy consultant directly observed a pharmacy technician dispensing medication intended for delivery to clients without direct supervision and control of a pharmacist,the person selected the prescription label placed them sic on the counter went to the shelves to get the medications counted out the medications put them in vials put caps on the vials put the medications in bags returned the medication containers back to the shelves or discarded in the trash empty containers placed the bags in an office adjacent to the pharmacy and no pharmacist checked or viewed this person work.the observed actions of the pharmacy technician coupled with the lack of direct supervision by a licensed pharmacist represent an immediate threat to harm and danger to both beneficiaries and the general public.this is because a pharmacy technician does not possess the necessary knowledge and professional judgment to act independently while dispensing medications.potential errors in dispensing of medication could result in serious or even fatal medication complications to clients of the pharmacy.
the letter said pharmacy thus violated business and professions code section as well as regulations by submitting claims for services not performed by a pharmacist,provider shall not submit claims for benefits not provided,misrepresenting the actual provider,provider shall not submit false or misleading statement of material fact,and subjecting customers to the risk of error from inadequate supervision,provider shall not engage in conduct inimical to the public health,morals,welfare and safety of any beneficiary.
the may letter advised that the department was terminating pharmacy provisional provider status under section fn,ante,which authorizes termination if a the provider has provided material information that was false or misleading at the time it was provided,and b the provider commits any violation of a federal or state statute or regulation governing the provider profession or occupation and the violation represents threat of immediate jeopardy of significant harm to any beneficiary or to the public welfare.
the may letter also stated 
appeal rights 
if you disagree with this action,you have the right to appeal termination of provisional provider status pursuant to wel.this appeal procedure does include a formal administrative hearing under the administrative procedure act.an appeal will not result in reactivation of any deactivated provider number during the appeal.if you decide to appeal,you must submit pertinent documents and all other relevant written evidence for consideration by the program within days of the date of this notification to 
office of administrative hearings and appeals 
street,suite 
sacramento,ca 
upon receipt of all pertinent documents and all other relevant evidence supporting an appeal,the director or the director designee shall review all submitted relevant documents and issue a decision within days of the receipt of the evidence.
on may,pharmacy sent a notice of appeal to the office of administrative hearings and appeals oaha.as indicated fn,ante,a section appeal is not a formal administrative hearing but a paper hearing in which the provider pharmacy must submit relevant evidence to support its appeal.pharmacy notice of appeal stated,please note that pertinent documentation and other written evidence for consideration by your office will follow.however,the referenced evidence did not follow.
on june,the california state board of pharmacy board,which is not a party to this case,sent a letter to pharmacy stating the board had investigated the department allegations of unlicensed activity,and o ur analysis of the information and documentation received did not reveal sufficient evidence to determine that a violation of the pharmacy law occurred.as a result,the board is closing the matter and no action will be taken.pharmacy submitted the board letter to the hearing officer.
the department presented to the hearing officer declarations of the department auditor and consultant,dated december,describing their december,inspection of pharmacy.auditor thomas nguyen declared they arrived around,and met and spoke with luther jenkins the pic on one side of the dispensing drug.the pharmacy technician worked on the other side of the dispensing drug counter.i requested jenkins to provide prescriptions and the pharmacy daily prescription log report for november,and december.while i was working with jenkins,tang came and requested me observe sic the pharmacy technician.the pharmacy technician selected the prescription label,placed them sic on the counter,went to the shelves to get the medications,counted out the medications,put them in the vials,put caps on the vials,put the medications in the bags,returned the medications containers back to the shelves or discarded empty containers in the trash,and placed the bags in an office adjacent to the pharmacy.no pharmacist was observed to have checked or viewed the pharmacy technician work.tang asked the pharmacy technician where she went to pharmacy school.the pharmacy technician said that she did not go to pharmacy school,she used to work for a small pharmacy and received her license due to her work experience.the pharmacy technician name sic is i observed no client during our visit.i told jenkins that i did not see any client.according to jenkins,the patients lived in the area and they come during the day.the driver delivers the medication daily at and using his own car.if necessary,jenkins and the other owner reznik will also deliver medications using their own cars.there were four pharmacy staffs sic in the pharmacy.they are jenkins,the receptionist,and two pharmacy technicians.the other pharmacy technician performed online billing duties.
consultant scholastica tang declared while nguyen was working with the pic to request additional documents for the review,i toured the pharmacy and observed a person was dispensing medications on the other side of the counter.this person picked up the prescription labels,lined them on the counter,obtains sic the medication bottles from the shelves,counts the medications,put them into the vials,put on the labels,and then packs the vials in the bag.she then cleaned up the counter by returning the medication bottles back to the shelves where she originally had them or throwing away the empty medication bottles.she repeated the same process for other clients prescriptions.when she had about five or six bags of prescriptions ready,she took them into the office adjacent to the pharmacy dispensing area.after observing her doing that for about minutes,i went to get nguyen.with nguyen present i asked this person where she went to pharmacy school.she responded that she never went to pharmacy school she was filling prescriptions independently for about minutes.during this time,she was never under the immediate,personal supervision and control of the pic.the prescriptions filled were never checked against the original bottles or initialed by the pharmacist before the medications left the dispensing area.
in october,the oaha hearing officer issued an appeal finding,recommending rejection of pharmacy appeal on the ground of failure of supervision and control by a pharmacist.the hearing officer said pharmacy had not denied that events occurred as reported by the department,and the only evidence submitted by pharmacy was the board letter.counsel for pharmacy requests that the determination from the california state board of pharmacy be considered.this office concludes that the standards the board requires for an action are meant for civil or criminal prosecution when professional licensure is at stake.this office reviews the merits of the case as to whether the provider is in compliance with the regulations regarding the service of clientele.counsel has not denied any of the contentions presented by the department in the may,letter terminating provisional provider status.the conduct of the provider in provision of services is noncompliant as demonstrated by the department.the appeal to vacate the termination of provisional provider status is denied.
the department adopted as its decision the hearing officer appeal finding.
on february,pharmacy filed a petition for traditional mandamus code civ.pharmacy concedes the caption reference to administrative mandamus was a mistake.pharmacy alleged the department ignored evidence that no technician dispensed or could have dispensed medication without the pharmacist supervision,and the department based its decision on unreliable evidence.pharmacy tried to submit declarations which it had not submitted to the oaha.pharmacy also filed a motion to allow oral testimony at the hearing on the writ petition and a motion for judgment.
the department opposed the writ petition and motions,arguing the court should not entertain evidence pharmacy failed to present at the administrative level.the department argued pharmacy could not rely on items presented at the earlier informal meeting with jan inglish,which was not part of the appeal procedure.the department also disputed pharmacy claim that its evidence was overwhelming.
on november,the trial court entered a judgment denying the writ petition and stating,at the administrative level,pharmacy had the burden of presenting to the administrative hearing officer any supporting evidence in furtherance of its administrative appeal.the only evidence that pharmacy submitted was a letter from the board of pharmacy stating it was not going to pursue action against the pharmacy license.pharmacy offered the hearing officer no other evidence to challenge the department basis for denying the provisional provider license.before this court,pharmacy has the burden of demonstrating that the department decision of october,was arbitrary or capricious or wholly lacking in evidentiary support.pharmacy failed to carry this burden.the court finds no basis to conclude that pharmacy was in any way mislead sic concerning the nature of the appeal process 
the trial court accordingly entered judgment in favor of the department and against pharmacy.
discussion 
standard of review 
we said in marvin lieblein,shewry,supra,th,d in enacting section et,the legislature chose to make the department decisions appealable under code of civil procedure section ordinary mandamus rather than code of civil procedure section administrative mandamus,subd.a.under code of civil procedure section,a writ can be granted only where the administrative agency has a clear,present,and usually ministerial duty to perform,and the petitioner has a clear,present,and beneficial right to the performance of that duty.citations.
where a statute leaves room for discretion,a challenger must show the official acted arbitrarily,beyond the bounds of reason or in derogation of the applicable legal standards.citation.where only one choice can be a reasonable exercise of discretion,a court may compel an official to make that choice.citation.
the trial court review of the respondent action is limited to determining whether the actions were arbitrary,capricious,entirely lacking in evidentiary support or contrary to required legal procedures.citations.id.at,d.
where,as here,the trial court made no new factual findings,our review is the same as that of the trial court.shapell industries,governing board th,d shapell lewin joseph hospital of orange d.
although plaintiff invokes the substantial evidence test,the question whether agency action is entirely lacking in evidentiary support is not the same as a substantial evidence test.american board of cosmetic surgery medical board of california th,d american board of cosmetic surgery shapell,supra,th at,d.
in american board of cosmetic surgery,supra,th,d,we said ordinary mandamus may be used to compel the performance of a duty that is purely ministerial in nature citation or to correct an abuse of discretion citation.when reviewing the exercise of discretion,the scope of review is limited,out of deference to the agency authority and presumed expertise the court may not reweigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the agency.citation.in general the inquiry is limited to whether the decision was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support citations.when making that inquiry,the court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choice made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.id.at,d.
shapell,supra,th,d,said the appropriate degree of judicial scrutiny in any particular case is perhaps not susceptible of precise formulation,but lies somewhere along a continuum with nonreviewability at one end and independent judgment at the other.citation.since the ultimate question is whether the agency has abused its discretion,the answer is one of degree.in each case the court must satisfy itself that the order was supported by the evidence,although what constitutes reasonable evidentiary support may vary depending on the nature of the action.citation.a proceeding which has determined individual rights in a factual context will warrant more exacting judicial review of the evidence.otherwise courts will tend to defer to the presumed expertise of the agency acting within its scope of authority for our purposes we find useful the test articulated by our supreme court in california hotel motel industrial welfare com.cal d,a court will uphold the agency action unless the action is arbitrary,capricious,or lacking in evidentiary support.a court must ensure that an agency has adequately considered all relevant factors,and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,the choices made,and the purposes of the enabling statute.citation.shapell,supra,th at,d.
shapell remark about the continuum was cited with approval by the california supreme court,which added that,as opposed to administrative decisions which are treated with deference,informal actions do not merit such deference,and therefore lie toward the opposite end of the continuum.western states petroleum superior court cal th,d,evidence is generally not admissible in traditional mandamus action challenging administrative action under environmental law.
shapell reasoning is sound and has been followed in other cases,mcgill regents of university of california,supra,th at,d.we recognize that not everyone acknowledges a distinction between devoid of evidentiary support and substantial evidence,associated builders contractors,san francisco airports com.cal th,d,section review of action was substantial evidence test,whether decision was arbitrary,capricious or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,under traditional substantial evidence test plastic pipe fittings california building standards com.th,d review of action was limited to determining whether agency action was arbitrary,capricious,or entirely lacking in evidentiary support,which generally means that a court can not disturb the agency decision if substantial evidence in the administrative record supports the decision warmington old town associates tustin unified school dist.th,d inquiry into arbitrariness or capriciousness is like substantial evidence review in that both require a reasonable basis for the decision.other cases simply say the standard of review is substantial evidence,saathoff city of san diego th,d.
it seems appropriate to apply shapell here,because even if the administrative action is characterized as informal,the legislature has given the department discretion to terminate provider status if a pharmacy violates regulations in a way that threatens public welfare,fn,ante.the fact question is not merely whether the pharmacist had his eyes fixed on the technician while she filled prescriptions,but whether the pharmacist exercised adequate supervision and control to protect public welfare.this is a question within the department expertise.
ii.evidence 
pharmacy argues we should consider evidence apparently the declarations of jenkins and the pharmacy technician that are in the record on appeal,because evidence may be considered in traditional mandamus cases.although pharmacy also refers to documents it assertedly presented to the department at the march meeting,no such documents are before us.we shall conclude pharmacy fails to show grounds to consider evidence.
we preliminarily address pharmacy suggestion that the evidence includes the board letter declining to take action on the charge of unlicensed activity.we observe,as did the trial court,that the hearing officer did consider the board letter indicating insufficient evidence of unlicensed activity.the hearing officer said,this office concludes that the standards the board requires for an action are meant for civil or criminal prosecution when professional licensure is at stake.this office reviews the merits of the case as to whether the provider is in compliance with the regulations regarding the service of clientele.pharmacy makes no argument and presents no legal analysis demonstrating reversible error on this point,and therefore the matter is forfeited.badie bank of america th,d.moreover,contrary to pharmacy view,the board letter did not clear pharmacy of any alleged violation of california pharmacy law.the board merely said it had insufficient evidence.we do not know what evidence was presented to the board.accordingly,the board letter is without consequence in this appeal.
as to the other evidence,pharmacy cites without discussion two cases for the proposition that evidence is admissible in traditional mandamus cases.friends of the old trees of forestry fire protection th,d friends held judicial review of the forestry department approval of a timber harvest plan should not have proceeded by traditional mandamus,which allows the admission of evidence,but by administrative mandamus which generally does not allow the admission of evidence.garrick development hayward unified school district th,d garrick,said that,because traditional mandamus proceedings allowed the court to consider evidence,substantial evidence review obliged the appellate court to consider all data considered by the education board in imposing school facilities fees on building permits which was also introduced in the trial court,whether or not the evidence was presented at public hearings to receive community input before the board adopted the resolution approving the fees.
