we have on appeal a decision of the third district court of appeal declaring invalid section e,florida statutes,the provision of the florida medicaid fraud statute.we have jurisdiction.see art.v,b.const.for the reasons explained below,we conclude that this provision of florida medicaid fraud statute is in conflict with federal law and therefore preempted by it.
facts and procedural history 
in december,the office of the statewide prosecutor filed a information against ten individuals gabriel harden,edward polsky,maria rodriguez,bruce eric smith,herbert lee goss,flora johnson,elsa cortorreal,victor rivera,billy madison,and von shella carter associated with or employed by dental express dentists,dental express,and express dental,three corporate entities providing dental services to children hereinafter dental express.the information charged these individuals with conspiracy,racketeering,and medicaid fraud under section e,florida statutes.the state alleged that the defendants engaged in a pay for patients scheme in which individuals received per head payments in exchange for soliciting and driving children for dental treatment at dental express.
the defendants filed motions to dismiss the information,arguing that the payment of wages by a medicaid provider to its employees for the solicitation and transportation of children to dental facilities for treatment was expressly protected by the federal medicaid statute and the federal administrative regulation safe harbor provisions thus,the defendants argued,the state attempt to prosecute this federally protected activity was unconstitutional under the supremacy clause in article vi,clause of the united states constitution.alternatively,the defendants argued that the undefined term remuneration in section e was unconstitutionally vague as applied to wages.they also argued that the solicitation of patients by employees of a legitimate medicaid provider,when the solicitation involves no intent to defraud,is protected activity under the first amendment of the united states constitution and article i,section of the florida constitution.in its response,the state conceded that the patients treated by dental express were patients.however,the state asserted that the method of paying the drivers was unlawful under both federal and state law.
after hearing argument from the parties,the circuit court entered an order granting the defendants motion to dismiss.the circuit court concluded that the state attempt to prosecute the defendants under the unlawful remuneration provision of section e was preempted by federal law and thus unconstitutional under the supremacy clause.the circuit court also held that the mens rea requirement in section d was preempted by federal law and unconstitutional under the supremacy clause.additionally,the circuit court agreed with the defendants alternative argument that the state construction of section e as a criminal ban on the solicitation of commercial business would,absent an intent to defraud requirement not contained in the statute,violate the first amendment and render the statute unconstitutionally vague as applied.
the state appealed the circuit court ruling to the third district.the third district agreed with the circuit court that there is an implied conflict preemption which renders section e unconstitutional.see state harden,so d dca.in reaching this conclusion,the third district noted two significant differences between the federal statute and the florida statute.first,the federal statute contains safe harbor provisions that exclude certain types of payments from being considered illegal remuneration,including payments for the provision of covered items or services such as the transportation of patients for eligible dental services.based on this distinction,the third district concluded that florida statute criminalizes activity that is protected under the federal statute and stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress,thereby resulting in implied conflict preemption.id.at.second,the federal statute contains a knowing and willful mens rea requirement that is not part of the florida statute.under federal law,the government must prove that the defendant acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.in contrast,the florida statute only requires that the defendant act knowingly the florida statutory definition of knowingly in section d includes mere negligence and consequently criminalizes activity that the federal statute intended to protect.id.the third district found these two differences to be dispositive in this case and did not address the other constitutional defects found by the circuit court.id.at.accordingly,the third district declared the statute unconstitutional.
the state sought review by this court on the basis of our mandatory jurisdiction to hear appeals of district court decisions declaring a state statute invalid.the court heard oral argument from the parties and also received several amicus briefs filed in support of the appellees,who were the defendants in the circuit court.the state raises three arguments in its appeal to this court.the state contends that neither the federal medicaid statute nor the federal safe harbor regulations preempts section e the safe harbor regulations do not protect a per head payment scheme for the solicitation and referral of eligible medicaid patients and section e does not violate the first amendment and is not constitutionally vague.
law and analysis 
we review de novo a district court decision declaring a statute unconstitutional.dep t of children families,so d.this case involves the confluence of federal and state medicaid law,specifically those provisions referred to as the statutes.both the federal and state statutes prohibit the payment,offer,solicitation,or receipt of a kickback,bribe,or rebate for referring an individual for services paid for under the medicaid program or for arranging such services.we are asked to determine whether florida statute,which encompasses a wide range of remunerations within its ambit of prohibited kickbacks,is preempted by the federal statute and thus unconstitutional under the supremacy clause of the united states constitution.see const.art.vi,cl.stating that federal law shall be the supreme law of the land any thing in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.in resolving this issue,we begin by reviewing the basic principles of preemption and then we examine the history and language of both the federal and state statutes.
under the supremacy clause,a federal law may expressly or impliedly preempt state law.a state can not assert jurisdiction where congress clearly intended to preempt a field of law.see chicago transp.kalo brick tile,d.the united states supreme court has recognized three categories of preemption express preemption where a federal statute contains explicit language implied field preemption,where the scheme of federal regulation is so pervasive as to make reasonable the inference that congress left no room for the states to supplement it and implied conflict preemption,in which compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility or where state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.gade solid wastes mgmt.ass n,d plurality opinion explaining categories of preemption recognized in supreme court case law.the federal statute does not contain explicit preemptive language,nor does it contain such a pervasive scheme of federal regulation so as to indicate field preemption.thus,this case involves the third category of preemption,implied conflict preemption.
in any preemption case,the court ultimate task is to determine whether state regulation is consistent with the structure and purpose of the statute as a whole.id.plurality opinion.this involves looking to the provisions of the whole law,and to its object and policy.id.plurality opinion quoting pilot life ins.dedeaux,d.the nature of the power exerted by congress,the object sought to be attained,and the character of the obligations imposed by the law,are all important in considering the question of whether supreme federal enactments preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.hines davidowitz.
in analyzing a claim of preemption,a reviewing court assumes that the historic police powers of the states are not to be superceded by federal act unless that is the clear and manifest purpose of congress.pharm.research mfrs.of america concannon,cir quoting grant,llc comm r of me.dep t of,food rural,cir,aff,d.federal preemption of a state law is strong medicine,and is not casually to be dispensed.id.quoting grant dairy,at.this is especially true when the federal statute creates a program,such as medicaid,that utilizes cooperative federalism.where coordinated state and federal efforts exist within a complementary administrative framework,and in the pursuit of common purposes,the case for federal preemption becomes a less persuasive one.id.quoting.dep t of soc.health servs.bowen,cir see also pharm.research mfrs.of america walsh,d the presumption against federal of a state statute designed to foster public health has special force when it appears that the two governments are pursuing common purposes.citation omitted.
federal statute 
the current federal statute,entitled criminal penalties for acts involving federal health care programs,prohibits illegal remunerations.b.the statute provides that 
whoever knowingly and willfully solicits or receives any remuneration including any kickback,bribe,or rebate directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind 
a in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program,or 
b in return for purchasing,leasing,ordering,or arranging for or recommending purchasing,leasing,or ordering any good,facility,service,or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program,
shall be guilty of a felony and upon conviction thereof,shall be fined not more than or imprisoned for not more than five years,or both.
id.b.the statute also prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully offer ing or pay ing any remuneration for the same purposes.id.b.thus,in order to convict under the federal statute,the government must prove three elements the defendant knowingly and willfully solicited or received remuneration in return for,or to induce,referral of business.paragraph b of the federal statute lists eight exceptions to which the prohibitions in paragraphs and do not apply.one exception is any payment practice that is specified in the regulations promulgated by the secretary of the department of health and human services hhs.these are the safe harbors which are exempt from the prohibitions.
the federal statute was first enacted as part of the social security amendments of,and was primarily concerned with outlawing health care referrals that were considered unethical or inappropriate.see social security amendments of,b,stat.the original statute made it a misdemeanor for any individual to furnish,solicit,offer,or receive any kickback,bribe,or rebate in connection with any item or service for which payment could be made under the medicare or medicaid programs.id.the penalties for violating the statute were fines of up to and imprisonment for up to one year.id.however,several problems arose as to the interpretation of the statute,including the following there was no mens rea requirement for a violation of the statute it was unclear what types of business arrangements were precluded by the statute and the terms kickback,bribe,and rebate were not defined in the statute.these uncertainties led to conflicting court interpretations of the statute and the test to be applied in determining whether an violation had occurred.compare united states porter,cir applying a narrow interpretation of the statute with united states hancock,cir rejecting reasoning in porter and holding that broad interpretation of statute was appropriate.
congress amended the statute in by substituting any remuneration for the terms rebate,bribe,and kickback by increasing the violation from a misdemeanor to a felony by increasing the possible fine to and the possible length of imprisonment to five years and by excluding two business practices from the scope of the statute,the practice of discounts and price reductions and payments made to employees under a bona fide employment relationship.see and abuse amendments,b,stat.as explained in the legislative history,the statutory amendments were based on a general agreement that the existing language of these penalty statutes is unclear and needs clarification.ii,at,reprinted in.the office of the inspector general oig of hhs has explained that the exceptions for certain business practices were prompted by the concerns of health care providers that many relatively innocuous,or even beneficial,commercial arrangements are technically covered by the statute and are,therefore,subject to criminal prosecution because the statute on its face is so broad.medicare and medicaid programs fraud and abuse oig provisions,explaining the statutory background for proposed safe harbor regulations the legislative history also specifically states that an amount paid by an employer to an employee for employment in the provision of covered items or services is exempt from the definition of a kickback.conf,at,reprinted in.it is this employee payment exception that is at issue here.see b b.
congress amended the statute again in by adding a knowingly and willfully mens rea element.see omnibus reconciliation act of,stat.as explained by the house budget committee,this amendment was prompted by a concern that criminal penalties may be imposed under current law to an individual whose conduct,while improper,was inadvertent,at,reprinted in.accordingly,congress amended the statute to assure that only persons who knowingly and willfully engage in the proscribed conduct could be subject to criminal sanctions.id.
the statute was amended again in to establish more statutory exceptions.see medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of,stat.these statutory exceptions were designed to assist health care providers in understanding the legal limits of the statute.the act also required the secretary of hhs to issue regulations establishing specific financial arrangements that would not violate the statute,referred to as safe harbors.the proposed regulations took a number of years to be finalized.these safe harbors,which currently number provide immunity from prosecution for behavior that might have violated the statute.the employee safe harbor provides that a remuneration does not include any amount paid by an employer to an employee,who has a bona fide employment relationship with the employer.i.this provision also states that the term employee has the same meaning as it does for purposes of d,the internal revenue code definition of an employee the employee safe harbor presumes a reduced potential for program abuse because of the greater degree of control that employers are presumed to exercise over their employees.see medicare and state health care programs fraud and abuse oig provisions,july,we are confident that the relationship is unlikely to be abusive,in part because the employer is generally fully liable for the actions of its employees and is therefore more motivated to supervise and control them.
the amendment also gave the secretary of hhs authority to exclude a violator from participating in federal health care programs and to direct appropriate state agencies to exclude that person or entity from participation in state health care programs as well.see a.in addition to the criminal penalties,as of august,a violator may also be subject to a civil penalty of up to for each act and to an assessment of damages.id.
as part of the health insurance portability and accountability act,in congress charged hhs with issuing advisory opinions in response to requests for guidance as to whether a specific business arrangement violates the law.see health insurance portability and accountability act of,stat,codified as b.these advisory opinions require the requestor to fully identify himself or herself and to involve an actual set of facts or a seriously proposed transaction that will be implemented if the requestor receives a favorable advisory opinion.the request may also seek advice on the application of the statute or civil money penalties to a set of facts.id.a.notably,the requestor may not seek an opinion as to whether something is fair market value or whether a person is a bona fide employee.id.b see also b.
beginning in,the oig has issued fraud alerts to medicaid providers from time to time these alerts are intended to inform the health care industry about possibly fraudulent and abusive practices within the industry that constitute statutory violations.see publication of oig special fraud alerts.the fraud alerts also create a stronger case of intent if the questionable conduct continues after the alert,encourage whistleblowers to report questionable conduct,and create a cautionary effect on the industry.patricia meador,health care fraud and abuse,practicing inst.
in response to two requests that oig clarify the relationship between the federal statute and various state laws,oig responded that i ssues of state law are completely independent of the federal statute and these regulations.medicare and state health care programs fraud and abuse oig provisions,july.the oig also noted that there is no federal preemption provision under the statute,so conduct that is lawful under the federal statute or regulations may still be unlawful under state law,and.the state cites this commentary as evidence that there is no federal preemption of the florida statute at issue in this case.however,we do not read this commentary as entirely foreclosing the question of preemption.as explained above,the absence of an express preemption provision only means that there is no explicit preemption of the florida statute.the statute may still be subject to implicit conflict preemption.as the supreme court explained in gade,conflict preemption can result when it is impossible to comply with both the state and federal regulations or where the state law is an obstacle to accomplishing the full purposes and objectives of congress.at.
gade involved illinois statutes governing the licensing requirements for hazardous waste equipment operators and workers.the supreme court concluded that these state regulations were impliedly preempted because they were in conflict with the federal occupational safety and health act osha regulations.the supreme court concluded that the osh act as a whole evidences congress intent to avoid subjecting workers and employers to duplicative regulation.at.plurality opinion.the supreme court noted that osha permits a state to assume responsibility for occupational safety and health standards,but only if it submits a plan that is approved by the secretary of labor.id.at.plurality opinion.in considering the provisions in this section of osha as a whole,the supreme court concluded that the implications of the text of the statute evince a congressional intent to preempt nonapproved state regulations when a federal standard is in effect.id.at.plurality opinion.
unfortunately,the federal statute is silent on state laws and state regulatory schemes.instead,we look to the statutory differences between the federal and state laws to determine whether these differences warrant conflict preemption in light of the preemption principles explained above.
florida statute and preemption 
section e,florida statutes,which is included in the statute entitled medicaid provider fraud,makes it unlawful to 
knowingly solicit,offer,pay,or receive any remuneration,including any kickback,bribe,or rebate,directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind,in return for referring an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made,in whole or in part,under the medicaid program,or in return for obtaining,purchasing,leasing,ordering,or arranging for or recommending,obtaining,purchasing,leasing,or ordering any goods,facility,item,or service,for which payment may be made,in whole or in part,under the medicaid program.

the florida statute differs from the federal statute in two important respects.first,the florida statute has a lower mens rea element which permits an violation based on negligent behavior.the florida statute defines knowingly as done by a person who is aware or should be aware of the nature of his or her conduct and that his or her conduct is substantially certain to cause the intended result.d.stat.emphasis added in contrast,the federal statute applies only to those acts that are performed knowingly and willfully,which requires proof that the defendant acted with an mind,that is to say,that he acted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.united states starks,cir quoting bryan united states,d,in which a federal firearms trafficking law prohibited anyone from willfully violating the statutory provision that forbids dealing in firearms without a federal license these mens rea elements,which were added to the federal medicaid statute in,reflect congressional concern that criminal penalties may be imposed under current law to an individual whose conduct,while improper,was inadvertent,at,reprinted in,see also united states jain,cir noting that the literal language of this statute might otherwise encompass some types of innocent conduct.
second,the florida statute contains no exceptions or safe harbors.congress was concerned that the federal statute was so broad that some relatively innocuous commercial arrangements were technically covered by the statute and therefore were subject to criminal prosecution.medicare and state health care programs fraud and abuse clarification of the initial oig safe harbor provisions establishment of additional safe harbor provisions under the statute.
our research has only revealed one other case which addresses the question of preemption of a state statute in massachusetts mylan,d,the defendants argued that the provision in massachusetts law was preempted by federal law.the defendants argued that the lack of a scienter requirement means that certain behavior legal under the federal statute would be illegal under the massachusetts statute,leading to inevitable conflict.id.at.the mylan laboratories defendants cited the third district decision in harden in support of their preemption argument.however,because the argument was raised late in the briefing and because the court found that the interpretation of the law on the scienter requirement is evolving,it deferred ruling on the preemption issue.see also boman med.services group,wl,at,the primary difference between the federal statute and the state provisions is that the massachusetts statutes do not require the action or practice to be knowing and willful.
based on the differences between the federal and state statute at issue here,we conclude that florida statute criminalizes conduct that federal law specifically intended to be lawful and shielded from prosecution.see legislative history of federal statute discussed supra and differences in florida statute discussed supra.there is clear congressional intent to exempt compensation paid by
