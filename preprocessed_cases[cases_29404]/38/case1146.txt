appellants are inpatient hospitals located in alabama,louisiana,and mississippi.they contend that the department of health and human services hhs interpreted the medicare reimbursement statute in a way that improperly deprived them of millions of dollars.the district court disagreed and granted summary judgment for the department.we affirm the district court judgment in all but one respect.
in,congress revised the medicare reimbursement statute to move from a reasonable cost method of retrospective compensation to the prospective payment system pps.social security amendments of,stat,see transitional hosps.of shalala,county of los angeles shalala.under this system,hhs reimburses hospitals that provide inpatient care to eligible beneficiaries according to a preestablished formula,regardless of the actual costs incurred.d.the payment rates are tied to the national average cost of treating a patient in a particular group drg.id.the statute mandates that hhs adjust the standardized payment rates for area differences in hospital costs,id.d e,which hhs accomplishes through annual rulemaking.this case concerns the methodology that hhs used to make these geographic adjustments in fiscal years fy and.
during those years,the relevant statutory section,d e,provided in relevant part 
the secretary shall adjust the proportion,as estimated by the secretary from time to time of hospitals costs which are attributable to wages and costs,of the drg prospective payment rates computed under subparagraph d for area differences in hospital wage levels by a factor established by the secretary reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.not later than october,and october,and at least every months thereafter,the secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of a survey conducted by the secretary and updated as appropriate of the wages and costs of subsection d hospitals in the united states.not less often than once every years the secretary through such survey or otherwise shall measure the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category and shall exclude data with respect to the wages and costs incurred in furnishing skilled nursing facility services.
d e emphases added hhs has traditionally referred to the proportion described in d e first sentence as the share,and has referred to the factor described in the first two sentences as the wage index.following the district court,we will instead refer to these constructs by their statutory names and will capitalize proportion and factor for purposes of clarity.the measurement of the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category described in the third sentence of d e has traditionally been known as the occupational mix,a term we will retain.
although d e is hardly a paragon of clarity,the bottom line is as follows the statute first requires hhs to determine the proportion of the drg reimbursement that is attributable to wages and costs.hhs must then adjust that proportion by a factor reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the hospital geographic area as compared to the national average hospital wage level the rest of the reimbursement share not attributable to wages or not adjusted.in addition,hhs must adjust the factor itself for occupational mix.but see infra part explaining that this last requirement is not applicable to the fiscal years at issue on this appeal.
for fy and,hhs determined the proportion to be percent the factor varied significantly across geographic areas,ranging in fy from a high of in the oakland,california area to a low of in northwest puerto rico as the mathematics worked out,hospitals in geographic areas with factors less than,hospitals in the proportion to be as low as possible,whereas hospitals in areas with factors greater than wanted the proportion to be as high as possible.in addition,every hospital wanted its own area factor to be as high as possible.the hospitals bringing this case are all from areas that were assigned factors less than 
the appellant hospitals challenged hhs final rules for fy and before the department provider reimbursement review board,see b,which granted their request for expedited judicial review in the united states district court for the district of columbia,see f.the hospitals raised four main arguments before the district court.first,they contended that during the fiscal years in question,hhs violated d e by including in the proportion hospital expenses that were not attributable to wages and costs and that did not vary on a local basis.second,they argued that the department decision to include certain cost items in the proportion but not in the factor violated the plain language of the statute and was arbitrary and capricious.third,they argued that hhs also violated the statute and acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to adjust the factor for occupational mix.finally,they maintained that hhs violated the statute by failing to account for interstate employment when calculating the factor.
the district court rejected all of these arguments and granted summary judgment for the government.se.med.ctr.leavitt,d.the court found that hhs interpretation of wages and costs in the proportion was consistent with the words ordinary meaning,id.at that the statute permitted hhs to use different cost items in the proportion as compared to the factor,id.at that there was no basis on the record on which to conclude that the secretary choice to not collect data on occupational mix in time to be applied in fy and was unambiguously forbidden by the statute or otherwise unreasonable,and that the hospitals failure to raise their interstate employment argument before the provider reimbursement review board barred them from raising it in court,id.at.
the hospitals now appeal,making the same four arguments.we address each of them below.we note,however,that although resolution of these arguments has financial significance for the appellants fy and claims,the significance of the arguments for any claims is extremely limited.see oral arg.recording at acknowledgment by counsel for appellants that their primary arguments in this case do not affect them for the future.the import of the first two arguments was greatly diminished if not negated by a statutory amendment,effective in fy,which directs hhs to substitute percent for the p roportion unless doing so would result in lower payments to a hospital than would otherwise be made.medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,a,stat,codified at d e ii.and as explained in part below,appellants third argument was mooted by statutory amendments to the provision regarding occupational mix.
in reviewing hhs actions on appeal from the district court,this court addresses the issue de novo,without deference to the decision of the district court.methodist hosp.of sacramento shalala.we review the department interpretation of provisions of the medicare statute under the framework of chevron natural resources defense council,d.under that framework,i f the intent of congress is clear,a court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.but if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the court must uphold the agency interpretation as long as it is reasonable.id.at.we review other aspects of hhs actions under the administrative procedure act apa,pursuant to which we will uphold them unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.a see f.
the hospitals primary target on appeal is the is,the proportion of hospitals costs which are attributable to wages and costs.d e.for the fiscal years in question,hhs interpreted the phrase costs which are attributable to wages and costs to include wages,salaries,and fringe benefits,as well as professional fees,contract labor,postage,business services,and services.fy final rule.at see fy final rule.at.each of these categories,hhs has said,is classified as because it consists of direct payments to labor inputs by the hospital or hospital payments for services that are very labor intensive.medicare program changes to the inpatient hospital prospective payment system and fiscal year rates,hereinafter fy final rule.the hospitals object to three cost items that hhs included in its calculation of the proportion.
first and foremost,the hospitals maintain that hhs should not have included payments made for hospital employees health insurance,worker compensation insurance,pension plans,and other fringe benefits because they are not wages or.but the medicare statute defines neither wages nor,and there is nothing unreasonable about hhs determination that these cost items fit within common definitions.as the district court noted,some dictionaries define the term wage,itself,to include fringe benefits.see,webster third new international dictionary of the english language unabridged defining a wage as a pledge or payment of usually monetary remuneration by an employer especially for labor or services usually according to contract and on an hourly,daily,or piecework basis and often including bonuses,commissions,and amounts paid by the employer for insurance,pension,hospitalization,and other benefits emphases added abbreviations in original replaced with whole words.in any event,fringe are part of the compensation an employee receives for his or her comfortably within the broad meaning of the term.see id.at defining related as having relationship connected by reason of an established or discoverable relation see also morales trans world airlines,d the ordinary meaning of relating to is a broad one,and the words thus express a broad statutory purpose.moshea ntsb,without getting into a metaphysical discussion of the meaning of the phrase related to,it suffices here to say that the words related to are broad.
the hospitals also maintain that hhs wrongly included the cost of payments for insurance premiums,pensions,and other fringe benefits because such costs do not vary based on local labor markets.it is true that the secretary has found it relevant,in determining whether a cost item is,to examine whether the item varies with the local labor market.for example,the final rule stated that w e define the proportion to include all costs that are likely related to,influenced by,or vary with local labor markets,even if they could be purchased in a national market.fy final rule.at emphasis added.but although hhs statements on this issue are not crystal clear,we do not read them as declaring that only costs that vary with local labor markets may be included in the proportion.
nor does the statute itself impose such a requirement.the statute provides only that the secretary must,first,estimate the proportion of hospitals costs which are attributable to wages and costs,d e,and,second,adjust that proportion for area differences in hospital wage levels by the f actor,id.the geographic element enters at step the calculation of the not at step one calculation of the proportion.as counsel for hhs correctly noted at oral argument,the proportion and the factor are two different moving parts that work together to accomplish the purpose of adjusting pps payments for area wage differences,and the role of the proportion is to define the universe of costs that the factor adjusts on this basis.oral arg.recording at.
accordingly,while it might have been reasonable for hhs to restrict the proportion to cost items that vary on a local basis,it was not unreasonable for the agency to decline to do so.see entergy riverkeeper,d holding that an agency view governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the necessarily the only possible interpretation,nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.even if the hospitals are correct that the costs of items used to calculate the proportion do not vary with local labor proposition that is not obvious and certainly not would not establish a violation of the medicare statute or the apa.
the hospitals also contend that the agency erred by including in the proportion payments to independent contractors for certain nonmedical services.these include the services of landscapers,accountants,and lawyers.in the district court,the hospitals asserted that only amounts paid directly by the hospital to the individual providing the service to the hospital,whether that individual is an independent contractor or a hospital employee,were appropriately included.se.med,d at.although this,too,might have been a reasonable line to draw,it is not the only reasonable line.as the district court found,t he statute does not expressly limit the wages and costs to those paid by the hospital directly to an individual,as opposed to some employer of individuals providing hospital services.id.rather,the statute simply directs hhs to include costs that are attributable to wages and costs,d e emphasis added,and payments to third parties to provide workers reasonably fall within that category.indeed,when a hospital hires an outside entity to provide individuals to perform services for which it might otherwise have used or hired its own employees,the hospital incurs costs that it would otherwise have spent directly on wages.see medicare program changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,hereinafter fy proposed rule by capturing more than just the direct labor costs,our definition captures the decisions hospitals make in the purchase of their inputs.
on appeal,the hospitals take a somewhat different tack,suggesting that the line should be drawn against including fees paid for or nonmedical services,while permitting the inclusion of payments to independent contractors such as physicians.appellants br.see id.at.again,this might have been a reasonable line to draw.but the statute merely requires the inclusion of costs which are attributable to wages and costs,d e,and hhs did not act unreasonably in interpreting that phrase to include nonmedical costs 
finally,the hospitals challenge hhs decision to include postage costs in calculating the proportion,and with this they strike a heavier blow.hhs initially proposed to exclude postage from the proportion in fy,see fy proposed rule.at,but ultimately declined to do so in that year and in both of the next two.in its fy rulemaking,however,hhs changed its mind,concluding 
we do not believe that we should continue to include postage costs in the proportion as postage fees are set at nationally uniform rates and are not affected by local purchasing power of hospitals.the cost of postage is primarily influenced by weight of the package and the distance the package is traveling.
medicare program changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,citation omitted.the question is whether there was any reasonable ground for including postage costs in the fiscal years under challenge here.
in its fy and final rules,hhs gave no reason at all for deciding against its initial proposal to revise the proportion by excluding postage hhs briefs offer one somewhat opaque rationale,citing the department statement that it includes very services in the proportion.fy final rule.at quoted in hhs br.at.yet even assuming that postage or mail delivery is very,hhs does not argue that postage is materially more than other excluded services or explain why postage was included while other very services were not.oral arg.recording at acknowledgment by hhs that we have no position on what kind of detailed analysis might support the determination that postage is or is not.
it can not be the case that every service purchased by a hospital that is very is therefore attributable to the hospital wages and costs.d e.although much labor surely goes into the manufacture of ambulances,hhs does not contend that the entire purchase price of an ambulance can be counted toward the proportion.hhs must explain why the cost of the stamps on a hospital letters is while the cost of the ambulance in its garage or the grapes in its cafeteria is not.until the secretary provides such an explanation,this court can not evaluate whether the secretary interpretation of the statute is reasonable within the meaning of chevron step t
