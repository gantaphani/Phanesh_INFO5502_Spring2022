janet manning appeals the district court denial of a.motion requesting that the court either set aside an administrative offset to an award of attorney fees the court made to her under the equal access to justice act eaja,d,or,alternatively,amend the fee order to award the eaja fees to her counsel.the very narrow issues before us on appeal are whether the eaja attorney fees award should have been paid to manning or to her attorney in the first instance and if the fees were properly paid to manning,are those fees subject to administrative offset under the debt collection improvement act of,for student loan debts owed by manning to the united states department of education.because we conclude the district court properly made the attorney fees award to manning and that award was subject to administrative offset for her unpaid student loan debts,we affirm.
background 
the district court reversed the commissioner denial of supplemental security income ssi benefits to manning and remanded for further proceedings.manning then moved in that court for an award of attorney fees to her counsel of under the eaja.the commissioner did not object,and the district court awarded the fees,ordering payment to manning as the prevailing party.in addition,the court ordered that if manning attorney were awarded any fees pursuant to b,which permits payment of fees to an attorney out of past due benefits,the attorney must refund the smaller amount to her pursuant to weakley bowen,cir.
thereafter,the social security office of the general counsel notified mannings attorney that the district court had ordered the social security administration to pay attorney fees in the amount of under the eaja and that he would soon receive a check payable to janet manning and timothy white and associates richmond brownson,in accordance with the district court order.at.counsel,however,received a united states treasury check made payable to janet manning timothy white associates in the amount of.id.at.under the authority of the debt collection improvement act of,the united states had administratively offset the eaja award by,an amount manning owed to the united states department of education on an outstanding school loan debt 
manning counsel then moved the district court,on his own behalf,either to set aside the alleged wrongful administrative offset or to correct,under.a,the alleged clerical error of awarding attorney fees directly to manning rather than to her attorney.at.counsel argued that the offset should be set aside because eaja fees are income to counsel the debt collection improvement act permits administrative offset from disability benefits,but does not specifically mention administrative offset from eaja fees counsel has a de facto lien against the fees that should receive priority over any claim by the government and under weakley,at,if a claimant later receives disability benefits resulting in the claimant attorney being awarded fees under b,then the attorney must refund the smaller of the eaja or the b fees to the claimant,thereby suggesting that the intent of the eaja is to compensate counsel.
in addition to filing the motion,counsel contacted the department of education to resolve this matter administratively.the department initially indicated that it was in the process of refunding the offset monies.at.later,however,the department changed course and determined it would not refund the offset.after efforts to resolve the matter administratively failed,the commissioner stipulated that the district court order should be corrected to award attorney fees to manning attorney.the court declined to honor the stipulation,however.the court first decided that the motion should have been made pursuant to rule b,rather than rule a,because there was no clerical error as the court had intended to award attorney fees to manning,the prevailing party,and not to her attorney.construing the motion as filed under rule b,the court denied relief,finding that under the clear language of d a,the eaja payment was properly made to manning,the prevailing party,and not to her attorney.the court reasoned that to ignore the clear statutory language and to award fees directly to manning attorney to circumvent the offset would 
summarily decide unresolved disputes not properly before the court i whether the united states may legally assert an offset against fees awarded to the plaintiff under the eaja ii whether the plaintiff attorney has an enforceable lien on the eaja fee award arising out of his contract with the plaintiff and,iii whether any attorney lien has priority over the government right of offset.

i.what is the scope of this appeal 
in this section,we set forth the issues that are the basis for this appeal and discuss why we are not addressing other issues raised on appeal by manning.as indicated above,we confine our disposition to the following two issues whether attorney fees under the eaja are payable to manning or to her attorney and if the attorney fees are payable to manning,whether the fees may be offset under the debt collection improvement act for an outstanding student loan debt owed by manning to the department of education.the first issue was raised in the district court by manning and later by her counsel on his own behalf and by his own motion.the district court,as indicated above,addressed this issue,ruling on it adversely to counsel.the second issue was not ruled on by the district court.manning raises the issue on appeal,however,and the commissioner responds,arguing that any eaja award to manning is subject to offset.while technically we could avoid deciding this issue because it was not ruled on by the district court,we choose to consider it for two reasons because the district court held that the fee award was to manning as the prevailing party,the court effectively held that the debt could be offset and the first and second issues are intertwined,making it advisable to address the second issue.
manning also argues on appeal that counsel probably has an enforceable lien on the eaja fee award with priority over the government.aplt.br.at.this argument was not adequately raised or briefed in the district court and was not ruled on by that court.due to the insufficient development in the district court,the lack of an adequate record on appeal,and the lack of a district court ruling,we do not address any issue concerning an attorney lien.specifically,we decline to address whether an attorney lien attached to the award of attorney fees if a lien attached,how that lien attached how to enforce an attached attorney lien how to collect on the attorney lien or whether a lien would have priority 
ii.are the eaja attorney fees payable to manning or to her attorney 
manning does not dispute the district court finding that her motion was properly filed under rule b.we review the denial of rule b relief for an abuse of discretion.see zurich am.matrix,cir.under rule b,a court may relieve a party from an order based on mistake,inadvertence,surprise,or excusable neglect.b.a mistake may occur if the district court made a substantive mistake of law in its order.yapp excel,cir.
applying these standards,we conclude that there was no mistake warranting rule b relief,and,therefore,the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying manning motion.in reaching this conclusion,we first look to the eaja statute.
when interpreting the language of a statute,the starting point is always the language of the statute itself.if the language is clear and unambiguous,the plain meaning of the statute controls.a statute is ambiguous when it is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different senses.

the eaja statute provides that a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action,including proceedings for judicial review of agency action,brought by or against the united states,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.d a emphasis added.as the district court found,this statutory language clearly provides that the prevailing party,who incurred the attorney fees,and not that party attorney,is eligible for an award of attorney fees.see gisbrecht barnhart,d under eaja,a party prevailing against the united states in court,including a successful social security benefits claimant,may be awarded fees payable by the united states if the government position in the litigation was not substantially justified.mcgraw,at,stating eaja award is to the claimant,while counsel receives the b award and eaja award is to the claimant,who may or may not tender that award to counsel,regardless of their agreement phillips servs,per curiam as the statute requires,any eaja fee award is made to the prevailing party,not the attorney.see also city of burlington dague,d blackmun,dissenting the provisions at issue in this case,the clean water act and the solid waste disposal act,like provisions generally,authorize fee awards to prevailing parties,not their attorneys.venegas mitchell,d section makes the prevailing party eligible for a discretionary award of attorney fees i t is the party,rather than the lawyer,who is eligible id.at.w e have already rejected the argument that the entitlement to a award belongs to the attorney rather than the plaintiff.evans jeff,d holding in b case that congress gave prevailing party statutory eligibility for discretionary award of attorney fees and statute did not bestow fee award on attorney weeks indep.sch.dist.no,cir relying on case law addressing attorney fees under and deciding that prevailing party language in.d refers to party and not to attorney turner sec y of air force,cir relying on case law dealing with and holding in k case that i t is clear that the award of attorneys fees belongs to the prevailing party,not to the attorney representing the party united states adkinson,d,t he eaja fee award belongs to the client,and an attorney has no independent right to a fee award under the eaja,aff,cir per curiam.
in addition to the prevailing party language,other parts of the eaja statute affirmatively rule out the attorney as a recognized applicant for fees and expenses.panola land buying ass clark,cir.in defining fees and other expenses,the eaja treats attorneys in the same manner as it treats expert witnesses,engineers,scientists,analysts,or other persons found by the court to be needed to prepare the case.see also d a.in addition,the eaja requires that to apply for fees and other expenses,the prevailing party must submit an itemized statement from the attorney or expert stating the time expended and the fee rate.d b.lastly,the eaja statute conditions eligibility for attorney fees upon the prevailing party,not the attorney,not having a net worth exceeding.id.the eaja therefore permits attorney fees reimbursement to financially eligible prevailing parties,who make a proper application,and not to their attorneys.
although the statutory language alone makes it clear that the prevailing party and not the attorney may recover an award of attorney fees,the legislative history for the eaja also makes it clear that certain prevailing parties,and not their attorneys,may recover attorney fees when the government action was not substantially justified.see,at,reprinted in.the eaja 
rests on the premise that certain individuals may be deterred from seeking review of unreasonable governmental action because of the expense involved in securing the vindication of their rights.the economic deterrents to contesting governmental action are magnified in these cases by the disparity between the resources and expertise of these individuals and their government.the purpose of the bill is to reduce the deterrents and disparity by entitling certain prevailing parties to recover an award of attorney fees,expert witness fees and other expenses against the united states,unless the government action was substantially justified.
id.this statement of purpose directly addresses the question whether the eaja fees are for the claimant or for the claimant attorney and clearly states that the fees are for the claimant.see panola land buying ass n,at noting that federal fee statutes were not enacted for the benefit of the bar but for the benefit of the persons the statutes are designed to reach.t he specific purpose of the eaja is to eliminate for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.comm r jean,d the eaja therefore was not enacted for the benefit of counsel to ensure that counsel gets paid.panola land buying ass n,at.
manning,however,maintains that uncodified portions of the eaja anticipate that her attorney will receive the eaja fee award.in particular,she points to,stat.this section,however,refers to the fact that the attorney must return to the claimant the smaller of the two fee awards under the eaja or under b.it does not state that the attorney is entitled to receive the full amount of the eaja fees awarded.rather,the purpose is to ensure that the attorney does not receive double compensation.
the language of b further supports the conclusion that the eaja award is for the prevailing party and not her attorney.under b,the commissioner must withhold and pay a reasonable attorney fee directly to the attorney out of the claimant benefits,thus guaranteeing payment to the attorney and avoiding collection problems,but the amount of the attorney fee that must be withheld and directly paid to the attorney is limited to the maximum of of benefits.burnett heckler,cir.thus,unlike the eaja,b expressly provides for payment to the attorney.congress has not substantially amended b since enacting the eaja.from this,we draw the conclusion that congress knows what language to use to award attorney fees to an attorney and what language to use when it chooses to award the fees to the prevailing party.congress could have worded the eaja statute to award attorney fees to the attorney,but it did not do so.
further support for the conclusion that the eaja award is for the prevailing party and not for the attorney is the settled law that the attorney does not have standing to apply for the eaja fees that right belongs to the prevailing party.see oguachuba ins,cir.just as a prevailing party can not assign her underlying substantive action,she can not assign her right to seek attorney fees,which is derivative of the underlying substantive action,to her attorney.pony county of los angeles,cir.addressing attorney fees under and rejecting as invalid under california law plaintiff putative assignment of right to apply for attorney fees,cert.denied,d.only after the prevailing party exercises her right to seek an award of attorney fees under the eaja and obtains an award may her attorney pursue collection of the attorney fees.see id.at.
citing willis government accountability office,cert.denied,d,and united states ex rel.virani jerry lewis truck parts equipment,cir,manning argues that even though the eaja statute gives her the right to claim the fees,her attorney has the right to receive the awarded fees.because these cases are distinguishable,we reject this argument.
the ninth circuit has held that virani,a qui tam action under the false claims act,does not apply to fee awards under.gilbrook city of westminster,cir.the court noted that there are significant differences between a fee award in a qui tam action and in a action.gilbrook,at.those differences are that the supreme court has held that fee awards under are bestowed upon the prevailing party and not the attorney that the concerns present in a qui tam action are not present in a civil rights action and that denying direct payment to attorneys is consistent with purpose of attracting counsel to represent civil rights plaintiffs.id.citing jeff,at.gilbrook therefore specifically held that i n the absence of a contractual assignment of the fee award to counsel,requires that attorney fee awards be made directly to the prevailing party.at.based on our previous discussion that legal principles from cases apply to eaja cases,we conclude that gilbrook analysis and holding are equally appli
