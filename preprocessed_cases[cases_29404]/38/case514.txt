james young applied for social security disability benefits,claiming that he suffered from progressively declining cognitive abilities and increasing personality problems which interfered completely with his ability to work.the social security administration ssa denied young application and upon review,the administrative law judge alj determined that young was not disabled.the social security appeals council denied young request for review.young now appeals from the district court judgment upholding the denial of benefits.because we find that alj residual functional capacity assessment and hypothetical question to the vocational expert were flawed,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
young,a year old veteran,applied to the ssa for disability insurance benefits on july,claiming that as of december,he was no longer able to work due to an adjustment disorder with mixed features,anger control,and personality problems.these problems,he asserts,stem from a motorcycle accident and the resultant extended coma which left him with residual brain injuries.at the time of the accident he was employed as a load master with the air force,but was discharged in after the military determined that he was disabled.since that time,young has worked in many different jobs with very little success at maintaining employment.he was fired from his most recent job as a mail carrier for the postal service because of,among other things,his inability to understand the schedule,report to work on time,relate theory to task performance,and complete his deliveries in a timely fashion.he also has had little success in maintaining employment as a bartender,lawn laborer,or airport baggage handler.in the department of veterans affairs va found that although young injuries were seventy percent disabling,he was percent unemployable.since,young has worked approximately thirty hours a week performing custodial duties at a bar that his wife,tamara young,owns.
the ssa denied young july,disability benefits application and his subsequent request for reconsideration.he fared no better before the alj who determined,after a may,hearing,that young was not disabled.the social security appeals council declined his request for rehearing and the decision of the alj,therefore,is the final decision of the commissioner.on appeal to the united states district court,magistrate judge crocker affirmed the decision of the commissioner.young filed this appeal claiming that the alj incorrectly dismissed the consultative examining doctor psychological exam and medical opinion,the alj erred by using a residual functional capacity assessment that did not incorporate all of the evidence,the alj erred in creating the list of jobs that young could perform,and the alj made an improper credibility assessment.
the alj had a dizzying array of medical and psychological information to consider,including the opinions of no fewer than eight psychological and medical professionals who either examined or evaluated young.since we review the record as a whole,jens barnhart,cir,we briefly summarize some of the relevant evidence from the record here 
in august,william hathaway,a staff neurologist for the air force,examined young and determined that he had poor visual memory abilities,relied on inefficient mnemonic strategies,was easily distracted during learning tasks,but performed within the normal range on a host of other memory tasks.he also found that young had some impaired motor functioning in his left hand,problems in visuospatial functioning,and had deficits in concept formation and conceptual flexibility.hathaway also noted displays of low frustration tolerance,irritability,impulsivity and a potential for poor social judgment,which he concluded substantially interfered with young daily performance.he recommended that the military consider young for final medical retirement.
in,the department of veterans affairs determined that young was seventy percent disabled up from thirty percent prior and unemployable.the change in disability was based on a veterans administration psychological exam performed in march.that exam confirmed mild cognitive deficits,impulsivity,poor social judgment and apathy,and a drop in iq from the above average to normal range,irritability,and short temper.the examiner noted at the time that although neuropsychological testing showed only a mild impairment,in practice it translated into a significant impairment for young in his social and occupational life.the veterans administration report indicated that young had trouble climbing,balancing,and working in high places or places with poor ventilation.he could not perform work or work around cluttered or slippery floors,hazardous machinery or poor lighting.he also had partial restrictions on working alone,working with others,exacting performance,repetitive work,and following instructions.
in october,the state disability agency referred young to michael ostrowski,for an evaluation.ostrowski diagnosed young with an adjustment disorder,finding that he had some symptoms of decreased mood and functioning.ostrowski did not find pronounced memory deficiencies,but noted that he did not conduct formal memory testing.he concluded that young would not have difficulty carrying out activities such as following instructions,sustaining persistence,and adopting to change,but did note that young temper problems might make it difficult for young to relate well to coworkers.
robert hodes,a consultative psychologist completed an ssa mental residual capacity assessment on november,in which he concluded that young was moderately limited in his ability to carry out detailed instructions,to interact appropriately with the general public,to set realistic goals,and to make plans independently of others.hodes filled out the ssa psychiatric review technique form in which he noted the presence of pathological dependence,passivity or aggressivity and moderate difficulties maintaining social functioning.hodes concluded that young seemed capable of performing simple routine work.
ward jankus,a consulting,examining physician with the wisconsin department of health and human services examined young in early and determined that he had higher level memory and concentration problems and mild higher level balance deficits.his exam focused mostly on young physical condition,which,with the exception of the balance problems,was largely unremarkable.
in april,jack spear,a,consultative psychologist completed a mental residual functional capacity assessment of young.he found some mild to moderate limitations in young ability to understand and remember detailed directions,and in his ability to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods.he also determined that young was slightly to moderately limited in his ability to maintain social functioning,and noted that young had difficulties with concentration,persistence,and pace which he described as occurring seldom to often.his ultimate conclusion was that young had an adjustment disorder and the mental residual functional capacity to perform unskilled work with objects,rather than people or data.
timothy howell examined young in july,and determined that he had a memory impairment,and a personality change manifested by an increased tendency to become irritable.howell noted that young memory problems had interfered with his past job performance.howell gave young a score of fifty on the global assessment of functioning scale,indicating serious symptoms or functional limitations.
douglas,a psychologist who,in february,examined young at the request of the alj,found significant deficits in young ability to maintain attention and concentration and to understand,remember,and carry out complex job instructions.he also found some deficits in young ability to use judgment,function independently,cope with work stress,and in his ability to understand,remember,and carry out even simple job instructions.administered memory testing which revealed some memory deficiencies,including memory deficiencies affecting attention and concentration.he concluded that young might have difficulty sustaining his efforts and persistence in a work environment.he also concluded that young could be expected to have some difficulty with distractibility,with remembering and carrying out instructions,and with physically tolerating stress in the.he found no evidence that he would have difficulty working effectively with others.
the medical expert,kenneth sherry,testified at young may,disability hearing.although he could not explain the degradation in young memory functioning between the,and evaluations on the one hand and testing in march,he did report that young had problems with memory,higher cognitive functioning,and some visual memory problems.in addition,he was able to conclude that young would have problems with concentration,persistence,and that might occur frequently or often.although sherry noted that young had lost two jobs due to his temper and that those behavior problems might be part of his organic mental syndrome,he had trouble evaluating whether young would suffer from deterioration and decompensation in work or settings.
the alj also heard the testimony of young and his wife.young testified that he often had trouble remembering things,and that these memory deficits have caused him great trouble in work settings.he testified that he lost his job with the post office because he could not remember the routes and procedures,and that at his wife bar he forgets to put away cleaning supplies and sometimes triggers the security alarm.young testified that he was fired from two jobs due to physical altercations with coworkers,and that he can no longer work as a bartender because of his temper.he also testified that he generally sticks close to housework,playing computer games,and watching television.when he does go out socially,he relies on his wife to keep him from offending others.tamara young corroborated her husband testimony,noting in particular her husband memory and temperament problems.
the commissioner has set forth a evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled.following this process,the alj considered 
whether young was currently engaged in substantial gainful activity 
whether young had a severe impairment 
whether young impairment met or equaled one of the impairments listed in the ssa regulations 
whether young could perform his past relevant work 
whether young could make the adjustment to other work 
a i iv.scheck barnhart,cir.the process is sequential,and if the alj can make a conclusive finding at any step that the claimant either is or is not disabled,then she need not progress to the next step.a.if the claimant makes it past step four,the burden shifts to the commissioner to demonstrate that the claimant can successfully perform a significant number of jobs that exist in the national economy.zurawski halter,cir.
in this case,the alj proceeded through all five steps of the analysis.he concluded that young had not engaged in substantial gainful activity during the relevant time period,ssa decision at young impairments were severe,id.at,they did not meet or equal one of the impairments listed in the ssa regulations,id.at young could not perform his past relevant work,id.at and young could,in fact,make the adjustment to work at a number of jobs which exist in the national economy in significant numbers.id.at.
at the fourth and fifth steps,the alj must consider an assessment of the claimant residual functional capacity rfc.the rfc is an assessment of what activities the claimant can perform despite her limitations.dixon massanari,cir a your residual functional capacity is the most you can still do despite your limitations.the rfc must be assessed based on all the relevant evidence in the record.a.
the alj made a determination that young had the rfc to perform the nonexertional requirements of simple,routine,repetitive,low stress work with limited contact with coworkers and the public.ssa decision at.
young argues,in his initial point,that the alj improperly rejected the medical evidence submitted by one of the medical experts.had he accepted the report of,young argues,the alj would have found that young memory and concentration difficulties were far more significant than he found.young also argues that,had the alj parsed the medical evidence from the other experts,he would have found that it was not,in fact,conflicting but that it supported young disability claim.
in reviewing the decision of the alj,we can not engage in our own analysis of whether young is severely impaired as defined by the ssa regulations.jens,at.nor may we reweigh evidence,resolve conflicts in the record,decide questions of credibility,or,in general,substitute our own judgment for that of the commissioner.lopez barnhart,cir.our task is limited to determining whether the alj factual findings are supported by substantial evidence.g jens,at stevenson chater,cir.evidence is substantial if a reasonable person would accept it as adequate to support the conclusion.stevenson,at.
young complains that the alj appears to give greater weight to the earlier mental status exam conducted by the va,than to the recent mental status exam conducted in february.appellant brief at.weighing conflicting evidence from medical experts,however,is exactly what the alj is required to do.see books chater,cir pointing out that when assessing conflicting medical evidence,an alj must decide,based on several considerations,which doctor to believe.and we may not the evidence.jens,at.the alj did not ignore evidence as young maintains,but rather considered it in light of all of the other evidence before him.in considering the weight to give to the and memory examinations,the judge considered the testimony of sherry who stated that he could not find a medical explanation for the significant drop in young memory function,and considered the fact that young had an incentive not do well on the later evaluation since it was administered for the purpose of determining young eligibility for benefits.this conclusion is not an improper medical determination,but rather is the type of context consideration that judges regularly make when assessing the weight to attribute to conflicting evidence.
we can not conclude that the alj decision to disfavor the evidence submitted by regarding young mental status examination scores was not supported by substantial evidence.the alj evaluated the evidence submitted by the many medical experts in this case and where that evidence was conflicting,he resolved those conflicts by giving more weight to some evidence and less to others.specifically,he concluded that conclusions that young had poor or no capacity to maintain attention and concentration was inconsistent with other medical opinions and worthy of less weight.this is not a case where a treating physicians opinion was disregarded in favor of the opinion of a consulting physician.see books,at d.in this case,none of the medical experts was a treating physician.nor was it a case where the alj improperly rejected an examining physician opinion in favor of a physician decision.gudgel barnhart,cir an administrative law judge can reject an examining physician opinion only for reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record a contradictory opinion of a physician does not,by itself,suffice.but in this case one examining physician opinion was contradicted by several other examining and physicians opinions.after weighing the evidence,the alj opted to believe the latter group of experts.the alj decision that the evidence presented by hathaway,spear,hodes,ostrowski,jankus,and howell more accurately reflected young cognitive and memory problems was supported by substantial evidence.
this conclusion,however,resolves only half of the story.in addition to the cognitive and memory problems at issue in the conflict between conclusions and those of the other experts,young claims to suffer from problems involving his temper and poor social judgment.the alj found that young was severely impaired by an adjustment disorder marked by blunted insight and judgment,decreased mood and functioning,and an increased tendency to become irritable.ssa decision at.he also appears to have credited the findings of medical experts who found that young is impulsi
