this case involves a dispute between telecare telecare and the government as to telecare liability under the medicare secondary payer statute,social security act,codified at.the united states district court for the northern district of california held that telecare was liable as a secondary payer.we affirm.
background 
the defendants in this case administer the medicare program.medicare provides health insurance to the elderly,the disabled,and other eligible beneficiaries.medicare was enacted in as title of the social security act,commonly known as the medicare act.see health insurance for the aged act,stat.
beginning in,congress provided that where beneficiaries are covered for medical expenses by both a group health plan and medicare,medicare would be a secondary payer of those medical expenses.this provision is known as the medicare secondary payer msp statute and is found at section of the social security act,codified as.when the msp statute applies,a private group health plan must pay for an expense first.thus,it is the primary payer.medicare pays for any remaining amount of the expense not satisfied by the group health plan.consequently,it is the secondary payer.life ins.united states.
although a private group health plan is obligated to make payment when primarily liable,and medicare is to avoid payment in such circumstances,medicare nonetheless sometimes makes payments in error.see united states baxter int l,cir.the government has the right to reimbursement in such circumstances,and that reimbursement right is not limited to the beneficiary,the health care provider,or the group health plan.under the statute,as amended in,the government may recoup the payment from 
any or all entities that are or were required or responsible directly,as an insurer or,as a administrator,as an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan,or large group health plan,or otherwise to make payment with respect to the same item or service or any portion thereof under a primary plan

the issue in this appeal is whether the statute authorizes recovery against an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan.
telecare is a company that provides services to those suffering from mental illness.the issue concerns telecare liability for medicare payments made to telecare employees and their dependents.telecare makes available to its employees a prepaid health care plan from kaiser foundation health plan and pays a premium to kaiser,thereby sponsoring and contributing to the group health plan.under the arrangement between kaiser and telecare,kaiser is obligated to provide a defined list of health care items and services for telecare employees and their dependents.telecare is not itself contractually obligated to pay health care providers for these medical services.
some of telecare employees and their dependents are also covered by medicare.one such individual incurred medical expenses,for which medicare initially paid.invoking the msp statute,medicare then demanded that telecare reimburse it,allegedly without seeking payment from the group health plan kaiser.telecare eventually paid medicare the sum of under protest.telecare then filed this action in the united states district court for the northern district of california,seeking recovery of the amount paid to medicare under the little tucker act,a,and declaratory and injunctive relief against further reimbursement demands under the administrative procedure act apa,et.telecare also sought class certification with respect to the apa claim.
the district court dismissed the complaint.the district court held that there was jurisdiction over telecare claim for under the little tucker act but dismissed the suit for failure to state a claim,because the msp statute,as amended in,gave medicare the right to seek reimbursement from telecare.telecare thompson,slip op.at.the district court concluded that a n employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan falls squarely into the language of the statute.id.at.the district court dismissed the apa claim for lack of jurisdiction because there was no apa waiver of sovereign immunity where an adequate remedy existed under the tucker act or little tucker act to recover the amounts illegally extracted by the government id.at.the district court did not rule on telecare motion for class certification.telecare appeals 
discussion 
we must first consider whether the district court had jurisdiction over the claim for under the little tucker act.although the government concedes jurisdiction under the little tucker act,every appellate federal court must satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction,but also of that of the lower courts in a cause under review.mitchell maurer.
the tucker act provides jurisdiction to recover an illegal exaction by government officials when the exaction is based on an asserted statutory power.aerolineas argentinas united states.because the amount claimed is less than,the little tucker act on its face grants the district court jurisdiction to determine whether telecare was entitled to the return of.see a.
however,as we recently held in wilson united states,tucker act jurisdiction is limited in medicare cases by sections and of the social security act.specifically,h,as modified by,provides 
the findings and decisions of the secretary of health and human services after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing.no findings of fact or decision of the secretary shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.no action against the united states,the secretary,or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section or of title,united states code the little tucker act to recover on any claim arising under the medicare act.
social security act h,codified at h.
section h thus bars little tucker act jurisdiction and federal question jurisdiction for a claim arising under the medicare act.we have read section h to bar tucker act jurisdiction as well for arising under claims brought under the tucker act itself.wilson,at.the question is the meaning of the arising under language of h.in wilson,we held that a claim arises under the medicare act if the claim is subject to the specialized review process of sections g and of the social security act codified at g and.wilson,at.section a provides,inter alia,for an initial determination by the secretary of whether an individual is entitled to benefits.section b a provides 
a ny individual dissatisfied with any initial determination under subsection a shall be entitled to reconsideration of the determination,and a hearing thereon by the secretary and to judicial review of the secretary final decision after such hearing as is provided in section g.
social security act b a,codified at b a supp.
in wilson we held that the plaintiff was asserting a claim of entitlement to benefits and thus the claim arose under the medicare act.in that case,medicare determined that it overpaid benefits to wilson,and medicare sought to recover that overpayment from him.wilson paid medicare but then sued to get the money back.we held that such a suit was essentially a claim contesting the agency initial determination that it overpaid benefits to wilson,and was thus a claim for benefits.wilson,at.because the specialized administrative and judicial review process of sections and g applied to claims for benefits,tucker act jurisdiction was barred by section h.the same would,of course,apply to a suit under the little tucker act,which is expressly barred when a suit arises under the medicare act.
however,we also noted in wilson that w e do not suggest that the application of section h precludes judicial review through other avenues in cases where the specialized administrative and judicial review processes provided in the statute are not available,at.in this case,medicare did not assert that it overpaid benefits to telecare,but rather to telecare employee.telecare is not asserting,and can not assert,any claim of entitlement to medicare benefits,or any other claim under section a.the specialized review process is thus not available because telecare can not invoke the specialized administrative and judicial review process of sections and g,section h does not apply.indeed,the government here concedes that telecare money claim is properly presented under the little tucker act.br.of appellee at.therefore,the district court properly had jurisdiction under the little tucker act to adjudicate telecare claim for.
in addition to the little tucker act,telecare also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to bar further demands for payment under the apa.the apa contains a waiver of sovereign immunity for suits to set aside agency action found to be in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations.but the apa waives sovereign immunity only if there is no other adequate remedy.
the availability of an action for money damages under the tucker act or little tucker act is presumptively an adequate remedy for purposes.christopher village,united states,consol.edison of united states,see martinez united states,en banc.because telecare can bring an action under the tucker act or little tucker act to redress the allegedly improper exaction,there is no waiver of sovereign immunity under the apa.telecare contends that the remedy is not adequate because it could recover the amounts illegally demanded by medicare only by repeatedly bringing suit,but a final decision in a little tucker act case either by this court or the supreme court will finally resolve the issue and as a practical matter make repeated suits unnecessary.see consol.edison,at.the district court correctly dismissed telecare apa claim for declaratory and injunctive relief for lack of jurisdiction 
we proceed to the merits of telecare little tucker act claim.on the merits of telecare little tucker act claim for,this case requires us to interpret the msp statute.originally,medicare paid for services without regard to whether they were also covered by an employer group health plan.life,at.as noted earlier,the msp statute was first enacted in to make medicare secondarily liable to liability insurance plans and workmen compensation plans.medicare and medicaid amendments of,stat.its provisions were extended to make medicare secondarily liable to group health plans in.medicare and medicaid amendments of,a,stat.medicare was not obligated to pay for certain medical services if payments had been made or would be made promptly by a group health plan 
section b b of the statute then provided,in pertinent part 
any payment under this title with respect to any item or service shall be conditioned on reimbursement to the appropriate trust fund when notice or other information is received that payment has been made under a plan.
thus medicare was entitled to reimbursement by the beneficiary or the health care provider who had received payment from medicare,but there appeared to be no provision for the secretary to seek payment from the group health plan.see,at.
in,the statute was amended to authorize actions by the united states to recover payments from entities responsible for payment.medicare and medicaid budget reconciliation amendments of,c,b,stat.the statute provided,in pertinent part 
in order to recover payment made under this title for an item or service,the united states may bring an action against any entity which would be responsible for payment with respect to such item or service or any portion thereof under such a plan.
social security act,b a,codified at b a supp.ii.the language of the statute clearly allowed the united states to recover payments from the group health plan.
in the late,medicare asserted that it could also seek recovery from administrators tpas of group health plans as well as the entity that bore the ultimate financial burden of the plan.the litigation culminated in the district of columbia circuit decision in health insurance association of america,shalala,hiaa,holding that the statute did not provide for recovery against tpas.
congress amended the statute in to allow medicare to recover against tpas and others required or responsible to make payment.balanced budget act of,a,stat.the statute,in pertinent part,was amended to read 
in order to recover payment made under this title for such an item or service,the united states may bring an action against any entity which is required or responsible directly,as a administrator,or otherwise to make payment with respect to such item or service or any portion thereof under a primary plan.
social security act b b ii,codified at b b ii prior to amendment amendment emphasized.the legislative history makes clear that this amendment was in response to the hiaa decision.the house report stated a appeals court decision held that medicare could not recover from third party administrators of plans the provision would permit recovery from third party administrators of primary plans,at.
beginning in,medicare asserted that it could seek recovery from employers who sponsored or contributed to health insurance for their employees,relying on the or otherwise language of the amendment.telecare and other employers disputed this interpretation,leading to the filing of the present suit in august.while the suit was pending,in december,congress again amended the msp statute.medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,pub,b,b b,stat.the amendments were made effective retroactively to id.d.the amended statute provides 
iii action by united states.in order to recover payment made under this title for an item or service,the united states may bring an action against any or all entities that are or were required or responsible directly,as an insurer or,as a administrator,as an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan,or large group health plan,or otherwise to make payment with respect to the same item or service or any portion thereof under a primary plan.the united states may,in accordance with paragraph a collect double damages against any such entity.in addition,the united states may recover under this clause from any entity that has received payment from a primary plan or from the proceeds of a primary plan payment to any entity.
social security act b b iii,codified at b b iii supp.the changes in language from the amendments are emphasized.
the parties discuss at some length the various regulations under the statute,the appropriate construction of those regulations,and the question of deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.we need not address those questions because we conclude that the statute plain language compels a finding that all employers who sponsor or contribute to a group health plan are liable.
telecare first argues that the term employer should be limited to employers.we see no basis for limiting the term employer in this way,and congress specifically and separately provided for recovery from in the same statutory provision telecare concedes that it makes available to its employees a prepaid health care plan from kaiser and pays a premium to kaiser.br.of appellant at.telecare is thus clearly an employer that sponsors or contributes to a group health plan.it argues,however,that this does not create liability because it is not required or responsible to make payment under a primary plan.in essence,telecare argues that there is a conflict between the employer language inside the parenthetical and the required or responsible language outside the parenthetical,and it urges us to disregard the employer language within the parenthetical,following the supreme court decision in chickasaw nation united states,d.however,chickasaw does not support telecare proposed interpretation of the statute.
chickasaw involved the interpretation of,which provided the provisions of the internal revenue code of including sections,q,and,and chapter of such code concerning the reporting and withholding of taxes shall apply to indian gaming operations in the same manner as such provisions apply to state gaming and wagering operations.the problem was that chapter was not a reporting or withholding provision,but rather imposed taxes.the petitioners in chickasaw,i
