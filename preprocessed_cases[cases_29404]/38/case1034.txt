this case arises from the tragic death of an eight month old infant,renee dawn robbins,the child of dustin robbins and melissa gillum.in,renee parents sought financial assistance and other social services from the oklahoma department of human services dhs.employees of dhs informed robbins and gillum that carla beth mckinney operated a licensed and daycare center in tahlequah,oklahoma,where they might obtain state subsidized care for renee.plaintiffs further allege that employees of dhs informed them that the mckinney daycare was the only daycare to which renee could attend due to financial considerations.comp.emphasis added.following this consultation,renee parents placed her in mckinney daycare where she suffered blunt force trauma to the head resulting in her death.the chief medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide the state filed criminal charges of first degree murder against mckinney.
renee parents originally filed suit against the state of oklahoma department of human services,five named employees of dhs in their individual capacities,ten unnamed employees of dhs in their individual capacities,carla beth mckinney,and the mckinney daycare,in the united states district court for the eastern district of oklahoma on june.that case was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs on september.this case was filed by robbins and gillum on september,against the same parties seeking damages and other relief under for alleged violations of renee constitutional rights and various torts in connection with renee death.
the oklahoma department of human services,howard hendrick,nancy vonbargen,and casey foreman filed a motion to dismiss under rule b for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.the court granted the defendants motion to dismiss against dhs on the basis of sovereign immunity,but denied the motion with respect to the individual defendants.hendrick,vonbargen,and foreman filed a motion to reconsider.the court granted the motion with regard to the prayer for declaratory relief,but once again denied the individual defendants qualified immunity claim on the prayer for damages because the court found that it ha d insufficient information,and therefore that some discovery was necessary to determine whether qualified immunity shielded the defendants from suit.robbins oklahoma dep t of human,wl,march.
defendants hendrick,vonbargen,and foreman appeal the partial denial of their motion to dismiss,and ask us to consider whether the plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim on which relief may be granted and whether they are entitled to qualified immunity.we reverse the district court denial of defendants motion to dismiss,and instruct that the suit be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
federal rule of civil procedure a provides that a complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.at the time when the district court denied the motion to dismiss,this and other courts generally embraced a liberal construction of the pleading requirement,derived from conley gibson a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief,d emphasis added see,kikumura osagie,cir.under this construction of rule a,a complaint containing only conclusory allegations could withstand a motion to dismiss unless its factual impossibility was apparent from the face of the is,a complaint was immune from dismissal if it left open the possibility that a fact not alleged in the complaint could render the complaint sufficient.under this construction of the rules,the district court in this case was probably correct when it concluded that it should deny the motion to dismiss when it ha d insufficient information to tell whether the complaint stated a claim or not.robbins,wl at.
just two months after the district court decision,however,the supreme court handed down bell atlantic twombly,rejecting the no set of facts language of conley and announcing a new or clarified standard to withstand a motion to dismiss,a complaint must contain enough allegations of fact to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,d.under this revised standard,as we explained in ridge at red hawk,schneider 
the mere metaphysical possibility that some plaintiff could prove some set of facts in support of the pleaded claims is insufficient the complaint must give the court reason to believe that this plaintiff has a reasonable likelihood of mustering factual support for these claims.
cir emphasis in original.the burden is on the plaintiff to frame a complaint with enough factual matter taken as true to suggest that he or she is entitled to relief.twombly.at.factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.id.
we are not the first to acknowledge that the new formulation is less than pellucid.see iqbal hasty,cir referring to the conflicting signals in the twombly opinion phillips county of allegheny,cir calling the opinion confusing.as best we understand it,however,the opinion seeks to find a middle ground between heightened fact pleading,which is expressly rejected,twombly.at see also id.at a complaint does not need detailed factual allegations,and allowing complaints that are no more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action,which the court stated will not do.id.at.
the most difficult question in interpreting twombly is what the court means by plausibility.the court states that the complaint must contain enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.id.at.but it reiterates the bedrock principle that a judge ruling on a motion to dismiss must accept all allegations as true and may not dismiss on the ground that it appears unlikely the allegations can be proven.a complaint may proceed even if it strikes a savvy judge that actual proof of those facts is improbable,and that a recovery is very remote and unlikely.id.at quoting scheuer rhodes,d.thus,plausible can not mean likely to be true.rather,plausibility in this context must refer to the scope of the allegations in a complaint if they are so general that they encompass a wide swath of conduct,much of it innocent,then the plaintiffs have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible.id.at.the allegations must be enough that,if assumed to be true,the plaintiff plausibly not just speculatively has a claim for relief 
this requirement of plausibility serves not only to weed out claims that do not in the absence of additional allegations have a reasonable prospect of success,but also to inform the defendants of the actual grounds of the claim against them.without some factual allegation in the complaint,it is hard to see how a claimant could satisfy the requirement of providing not only fair notice of the nature of the claim,but also grounds on which the claim rests.id.at.see airborne beepers video,v.at t mobility,cir a t some point the factual detail in a complaint may be so sketchy that the complaint does not provide the type of notice of the claim to which the defendant is entitled under rule.the twombly court was particularly critical of complaints that mentioned no specific time,place,or person involved in the alleged conspiracies.at.given such a complaint,a defendant seeking to respond to plaintiffs conclusory allegations would have little idea where to begin.id.
the third circuit has noted,and we agree,that the degree of specificity necessary to establish plausibility and fair notice,and therefore the need to include sufficient factual allegations,depends on context context matters in notice pleading.fair notice under rule a depends on the type of case phillips,at.a simple negligence action based on an automobile accident may require little more than the allegation that the defendant negligently struck the plaintiff with his car while crossing a particular highway on a specified date and time.see form,complaint for negligence,forms,fed.rules civ,discussed in twombly.at.the complaint in twombly was inadequate because the plaintiff failed to plead any facts to show contract,combination or conspiracy,in restraint of trade beyond a bare allegation of parallel conduct that could be explained as identical but independent action.sherman act.given that the complaint encompassed scenarios under which the defendants conspired to engage in parallel conduct and those in which they did not,the court found that the likelihood that the plaintiff would be entitled to relief,even if all of the allegations were true,fell short.to allow such a complaint to proceed would impose the cost of discovery on the defendants for no plausible basis.i t is only by taking care to require allegations that reach the level suggesting conspiracy that we can hope to avoid the potentially enormous expense of discovery in cases with no reasonably founded hope that the discovery process will reveal relevant evidence to support a claim.twombly.at brackets in original quoting dura,broudo,d further internal citations omitted.
the context of this case is a claim of qualified immunity by state officials or employees who were sued for damages in their personal capacity for injuries to a child inflicted by a third party.qualified immunity exists to protect public officials from the discovery that can be peculiarly disruptive of effective government.anderson creighton,d quoting harlow fitzgerald,d.defendants are permitted to appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on qualified immunity grounds precisely to spare them the ordeal of discovery if the complaint fails to allege a constitutional violation or if the alleged violation was not clearly established.behrens pelletier,d.to nudge their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible,twombly.at,in this context,plaintiffs must allege facts sufficient to show assuming they are true that the defendants plausibly violated their constitutional rights,and that those rights were clearly established at the time.this requires enough allegations to give the defendants notice of the theory under which their claim is made.
this does not mean that complaints in cases subject to qualified immunity defenses must include all the factual allegations necessary to sustain a conclusion that defendant violated clearly established law.breidenbach bolish,cir.in currier we found this heightened pleading standard superceded by the court decision in britton,d.currier doran,cir.twombly,too,rejects a heightened pleading standard.at.however,the complaint must meet the minimal standard of notice pleading as articulated by the court in twombly.although we apply the same standard in evaluating dismissals in qualified immunity cases as to dismissals generally,shero city of grove,cir,complaints in cases against individual government actors pose a greater likelihood of failures in notice and plausibility because they typically include complex claims against multiple defendants.the twombly standard may have greater bite in such contexts,appropriately reflecting the special interest in resolving the affirmative defense of qualified immunity at the earliest possible stage of a litigation.anderson,at.harlow,at.without allegations sufficient to make clear the grounds on which the plaintiff is entitled to relief,twombly.at,it would be impossible for the court to perform its function of determining,at an early stage in the litigation,whether the asserted claim is clearly established.
danger creation 
count i of robbins and gillum complaint,requesting damages for violations of renee due process rights,is inadequate both for failure to provide fair notice and because,even if we take all facts in the complaint as true,the plaintiffs have failed to present a plausible right to relief.we reiterate that c ontext matters in notice pleading.fair notice under rule a depends on the type of case.phillips,at.in cases,defendants often include the government agency and a number of government actors sued in their individual capacities.therefore it is particularly important in such circumstances that the complaint make clear exactly who is alleged to have done what to whom,to provide each individual with fair notice as to the basis of the claims against him or her,as distinguished from collective allegations against the state.see twombly.at.
count i of robbins and gillum complaint fails to isolate the allegedly unconstitutional acts of each defendant,and thereby does not provide adequate notice as to the nature of the claims against each.for example,paragraph of the complaint alleges that defendants instruct ed the plaintiffs to place renee dawn robbins in a specific daycare defendants assert ed control over such daycare and defendants failed to protect and supervise the child the three defendants named in this appeal are howard hendrick,the director of dhs for the state of oklahoma nancy vonbargen,a local dhs social worker and casey foreman,another local dhs social worker.other defendants named in the complaint include mckinney,two additional named dhs social workers,and ten other unnamed dhs social workers or supervisors.presumably,the allegedly tortious acts committed by hendrick as the director of dhs,mckinney as the private owner and operator of the daycare where renee was killed,and the individual social workers in tahlequah,are entirely different in character and therefore are mistakenly grouped in a single allegation.the complaint makes no mention of which if any of these defendants had direct contact with renee and her parents,and for those defendants who had no direct contact,how they might be individually liable for deprivations of renee constitutional rights.
we need not speculate,because the burden rests on the plaintiffs to provide fair notice of the grounds for the claims made against each of the defendants.given the complaint use of either the collective term defendants or a list of the defendants named individually but with no distinction as to what acts are attributable to whom,it is impossible for any of these individuals to ascertain what particular unconstitutional acts they are alleged to have committed.see atuahene city of hartford,may,granting a motion to dismiss for failure to provide fair notice under rule in part because t he complaint failed to differentiate among the defendants,alleging instead violations by the defendants medina bauer,wl,lane capital acquisitions and mgmt,wl,april.
in addition to the failure of count i to satisfy the standard of fair notice required by rule,the plaintiffs do not allege facts sufficient to render their claim plausible.setting aside the numerous conclusory allegations,plaintiffs allege that defendants we can not discern which ones instructed plaintiffs to place renee dawn robbins in a specific daycare informed melissa that the mckinney daycare was the only daycare to which renee could attend due to financial considerations were or should have been aware of the past nature of mckinney personal background knew that dustin robbins and melissa gillum were relying upon dhs to provide them with a safe environment for renee fail ed to take steps to ensure that renee was placed in a safe environment lulled the plaintiffs into a false sense of security about renee welfare failed to correct the misimpressions that the dhs generated report of available daycare facilities engendered and continued to place children in mckinney custody instead of revoking her license.comp.
plaintiffs claim that these factual allegations,if taken as true,show a violation of renee due process rights under a theory of danger creation.in general,state actors may only be held liable under for their own acts,not the acts of third parties.deshaney winnebago county of dep t of social services,d.the danger creation exception to this rule applies only when a state actor affirmatively acts to create,or increases a plaintiff vulnerability to,or danger from private violence.currier doran,cir.to state a prima facie case,the plaintiff must show that state actors created the danger or increased the plaintiff vulnerability to the danger in some way,the plaintiff was a member of a limited and specifically
