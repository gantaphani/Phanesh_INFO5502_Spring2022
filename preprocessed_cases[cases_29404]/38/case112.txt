the appeal in this class action asks us to determine the amount in controversy in an action for an accounting where there is no accompanying demand for damages or restitution.appellants,collectively a administrator of a new york dental panel reimbursement pool the pool funded by medicaid and medicare,argue that,because ditolla seeks an accounting of all amounts by which the pool has been funded and reduced an estimated million,he has put the entire million in controversy.as such,they contend,the amount in controversy is well over the million jurisdictional requirement imposed by the class action fairness act of,stat.cafa.for the reasons that follow,we hold that the appellants have not met their burden of demonstrating that the requirement has been met.we affirm the judgment of the district court and deny as moot the appellants motion seeking a stay.
preliminarily,we also hold that,under the provision of cafa requiring courts of appeals to complete all action on appeals not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed,c,we are not required to deny the appeal despite the fact that it was docketed more than days prior to the time that a panel of this court granted the petition to allow it.
background 
doral dental ipa of new york,llc,doral dental usa llc,and dentaquest ventures,llc collectively doral dental compensate,through this pool and others,dentists operating in various states who have agreed to treat patients eligible under medicaid or medicare.the pools consist of state and federal funds from which participating dentists are paid monthly on a pro rata basis.according to their provider agreements,doral dental may subtract associated consulting or brokerage fees from the pools prior to distributing the remaining monies to the dentists.
in february,william ditolla,a new dentist,filed on behalf of himself and all other dentists receiving funds from the new york pool a class action complaint in the nassau county supreme court.asserting that doral dental owed a fiduciary duty to ditolla and the purported class,the complaint sought an accounting of all amounts by which the pool was funded and reduced throughout the period in which defendants have been under contract as well as the amounts paid out to all dentists in the class,and the methods by which such payments to dentists were calculated.ditolla noted that the doral dental entities were the subjects of ongoing federal grand jury investigations in several states for allegedly deducting improper or sham consulting fees from the pools,and that doral dental had purportedly settled for million a class action relating to improper deductions from a pennsylvania pool.
doral dental removed the action to the united states district court for the eastern district of new york pursuant to cafa,which has amended diversity jurisdiction requirements by vesting jurisdiction in the federal courts over class actions where,inter alia,the amount in controversy exceeds million.see d gottlieb carnival,cir.
doral dental notice of removal asserted that the amount in controversy exceeded the sum of million,exclusive of interest and costs.specifically,doral dental averred that the amounts by which the pool was funded and reduced during the class period exceeded million.after the action was removed,ditolla moved to remand the action to the state court,contending that because the complaint sought only an remedy for which no value could be amount in controversy requirement had not been met.
the district court granted ditolla motion and remanded the case to the state court.the district court determined as a preliminary matter that cafa had not altered the traditional rule that the party asserting federal jurisdiction bears the burden of proving the case is properly in federal court.next,the district court rejected the argument that the res of the pool was the measure by which to determine whether the statute jurisdictional minimum was satisfied.citing macken jensen,cir,the district court held that,because ditolla sought only information,and the value of that information could not be estimated,doral dental had failed to meet their burden of establishing federal jurisdiction.
in accordance with cafa provision enabling courts of appeals to accept an appeal from an order of a district court granting or denying a motion to remand a class action to the state court from which it was removed,c,doral dental petitioned for this court permission to appeal the district court decision.after this court granted doral dental petition,and before briefing,doral dental moved for a stay of the district court remand order or,in the alternative,to enjoin the state court from proceeding with the remanded action.pursuant to fed.a d,a single judge of this court granted doral dental a temporary stay subject to this panel review.
discussion 
cafa deadline 
before addressing the jurisdictional question of the amount in controversy,we nostra sponte address another issue presented by this,as of the date that a panel of this court granted doral dental permission to appeal and before the parties stipulated to an enlargement of time in which to complete all action on this appeal,the court should have denied the appeal.the issue arises from cafa requirement that courts of appeals complete all action on such appeal from a district court grant or denial of a motion to remand,including rendering judgment,not later than days after the date on which such appeal was filed,unless an extension is granted under c.c emphasis added.if a court does not issue a final judgment within that time period,the statute provides that the appeal shall be denied.c.here,doral dental filed a petition for permission to appeal on may,but the petition itself was not granted until days later on july.doral dental brief was filed on august,and,on september,the parties stipulated pursuant to section c a to a extension of our deadline to render judgment.
the question to be answered is when was the appeal filed for purposes of commencing the original cafa period if we were to interpret the filing of the appeal to be the may filing of the petition,the present appeal would have been effectively denied by operation of section c before we even granted doral dental permission to appeal.that is,as of july,the only entry this court would have had authority to make was a denial of the appeal because by that date days had already passed since doral dental initial filing.we reject this interpretation,however,and hold that the filing of the appeal for cafa purposes occurs on the date in which this court issues an order granting permission to appeal.thus,we presume that congress intended the filing of the appeal to mean the commencement of the appeal,not merely the docketing of the appeal.
this holding is in line with our administrative handling of this case.although the may filing of the petition for permission to appeal docketed the present appeal,it was the july order granting that petition that triggered the clerk office to commence its routines for preparing the appeal for briefing and argument.our holding is also consistent with the provision of fed,governing appeals by permission,which we conclude applies to cafa appeals.see fed.d the date when the order granting permission to appeal is entered serves as the date of the notice of appeal for calculating time under these rules.
accordingly,cafa clock for rendering judgment starts running on the day that the court order granting permission to appeal is filed.in so holding,we join several of our sister circuits.see hart fedex ground package system,cir evans walter industries,cir patterson dean morris,cir bush cheaptickets,cir.we were thus not required to deny the appeal and may proceed to address its relevant issues within the additional time stipulated by the parties.
ii.burden of proof 
it is that,prior to cafa enactment,t he party asserting federal jurisdiction bore the burden of proving that the case was properly in federal court.gilman bhc,cir citing mcnutt general motors acceptance.it is an issue of first impression in this court whether cafa has changed this traditional rule.substantially for the reasons articulated by
