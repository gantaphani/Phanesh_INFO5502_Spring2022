background 
factual background 
clark has been a member of the alabama national guard since.the alabama national guard is a state militia that employs from the state of alabama.these soldiers respond to calls to service by the governor of alabama and must remain prepared to serve at all times.clark also is a member of the national guard of the united states.that is because alabama national guard members,like national guard members from every state and the district of columbia,are also required to enlist as members of the national guard of the united states.b under regulations to be prescribed by the secretary of the army,a person who enlists in the army national guard,or whose term of enlistment in the army national guard is extended,shall be concurrently enlisted,or his term of enlistment shall be concurrently extended,as the case may be,as a reserve of the army for service in the army national guard of the united states.the national guard of the united states is a reserve component of the uniformed services that may,under the first militia clause of the constitution,be called into federal service by congress in order to execute the laws of the union,suppress insurrections and repel invasions.const.art.i,cl.at all times pertinent to this case,clark was serving solely as a member of the alabama national guard.the second militia clause of the constitution authorizes congress to organize,arm,and discipline the militia.const.art.i,cl.additionally,it allows congress to govern the portion of the military that is employed in service to the united states.id.finally,it reserves to the states the ability to appoint and train the militia,but requires that the states do so in accordance with the discipline prescribed by congress.id.
clark asserts that,in his capacity as a member of the alabama national guard,he was required to take several correspondence courses in order to maintain his status in the guard or to advance in rank.he further asserts that he took required correspondence courses for which he received no compensation from the government.clark claims that these courses were not offered as resident courses,for which active duty pay is generally available,but were only offered as correspondence courses.he further claims that the required courses were equivalent training prescribed by the secretary of the army,entitling him to compensation under a.clark alleges that he could not dedicate the hours required to continue taking the courses without pay and that he was demoted in rank after he failed to take bncoc phii,a required correspondence course.
ii.procedural history 
as noted above,clark filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking compensation pursuant to a for his completed compulsory correspondence courses and seeking an injunction prohibiting the government from withholding pay for mandatory correspondence courses completed in the future by national guard members section a provides that a member of the national guard or a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service who is not entitled to basic pay is entitled to compensation for each regular period of instruction or other equivalent training a.
the government moved to dismiss clark complaint for lack of jurisdiction or,in the alternative,for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.rejecting the government jurisdictional argument,the court concluded that it had jurisdiction under the tucker act.since clark had presented a colorable claim under section a,which this court has held to be a statute,the court concluded that it had jurisdiction over the case.clark,fed.cl.at.turning to the merits,however,the court proceeded to dismiss clark claim on the government alternate ground,failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.id.at.the court concluded that because clark was a member of a reserve component,he was barred from receiving compensation for time spent taking required correspondence courses by d.id.that statute provides that section does not authorize compensation for work or study performed by a member of a reserve component in connection with correspondence courses of an armed force.d.
on appeal,clark contends that the court of federal claims erred in construing to defeat his claim.he argues that section a requires compensation for the mandatory correspondence courses he took as a member of the alabama national guard and that section d does not bar such compensation.the government responds that clark is a member of a reserve component due to his enlistment in the national guard of the united states and that section d prohibits payment of compensation to him for correspondence courses.in addition to responding to clark appeal on the merits,the government renews its assertion that the court of federal claims lacked jurisdiction.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
jurisdiction 
whether the court of federal claims properly exercised jurisdiction over a case is a question of law that we review de novo.wheeler united states.in this case,the court exercised jurisdiction under the tucker act,which states in pertinent part as follows 
the united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.
jurisdiction in the court of federal claims is proper under the tucker act if a federal statute can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained.united states testan,d quoting eastport united states.however,the tucker act is merely a jurisdictional statute that allows a plaintiff to bring a substantive claim against the united states.id.at.a plaintiff must still prove a substantive right that results in monetary recovery based upon the constitution,a federal statute,or a regulation.id.in this case,clark alleges a substantive right under a,so our inquiry must focus on whether section a is.
the jurisdictional issue in this case is controlled by dehne united states.in dehne,we held that section a mandates pay for regular periods of instruction,periods of appropriate duty,and for performance of other equivalent duties.id.at.the government answer to dehne is that,in this case,section d applies to clark claim,and section d on its face is not.since dehne dealt with section a,the government urges,it does not apply to clark case.
we are not persuaded by the government argument.the problem with the argument is that it confuses the issue of jurisdiction with the question of whether clark can prevail on the merits or whether section d bars his claim.federal jurisdiction is generally determined at the outset of a case.albert kevex,referring to the normal rule that federal jurisdiction is measured at the outset of the suit.in this case,clark has asserted a claim under a for compensation for mandatory correspondence courses that he took as a member of the alabama national guard.under dehne,the court of federal claims had jurisdiction to determine whether clark presented a claim upon which relief could be granted under section a.the court did not err in exercising jurisdiction over clark claim.ralston steel united states,in general,a claimant who says that he is entitled to money from the united states because a statute or a regulation grants him that right,in terms or by implication,can properly come to the court of claims,at least if his claim is not frivolous but arguable.we now turn to the merits.
we review without deference whether the court of federal claims properly dismissed an action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.mitchell arms,united states.a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under court of federal claims rule b is appropriate when the facts asserted by the claimant do not entitle him to a legal remedy.in reviewing the dismissal,the court accepts all factual allegations as true and draws all reasonable inferences in the claimant favor.lindsay united states.we also review without deference the court of federal claims construction of the relevant statutory provisions because it presents an issue of law.united states.
on appeal,clark contends that he is entitled to compensation under a for mandatory correspondence courses that he took as a member of the alabama national guard.he further contends that his dual enlistment in the national guard and the national guard of the united states does not preclude him from receiving compensation under section d,because when he took the courses,he was a member in service of the alabama national guard and he was not in federal service.
the government argues that clark enlistment in the national guard of the united states makes him a member of a reserve component for the purposes of d and that,therefore,he is excluded from receiving compensation for any correspondence courses.the government contends that it is immaterial that clark took the correspondence courses in his role as a member of the alabama national guard.that is so,the government maintains,because section d focuses on a national guard member status as a member of a reserve component rather than on the function the member is performing at the time of the training.additionally,the government asserts that the secretary of the army must prescribe payment and equivalent training before a national guard member becomes eligible for compensation.in this case,the government argues,the secretary of the army never prescribed compensation for correspondence courses and never prescribed correspondence courses as equivalent training.
we begin with the language of the statute.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.and where the statutory language provides a clear answer,it ends there as well.hughes aircraft jacobson,d.the statute at issue in this case,states in relevant part as follows 
reserves members of national guard training 
a under regulations prescribed by the secretary concerned,and to the extent provided for by appropriations,a member of the national guard or a member of a reserve component of a uniformed service who is not entitled to basic pay under section of this title,is entitled to compensation,at the rate of of the basic pay authorized for a member of a uniformed service of a corresponding grade entitled to basic pay 
for each regular period of instruction,or period of appropriate duty,at which the member is engaged for at least two hours,including that performed on a sunday or holiday 
for the performance of such other equivalent training,instruction,duty,or appropriate duties,as the secretary may prescribe or 
d this section does not authorize compensation for work or study performed by a member of a reserve component in connection with correspondence courses of an armed force.
a d emphases added.
clark claim rests on section a,which authorizes compensation to be paid to both a member of the national guard and a member of a reserve component for performing functions for which they are not entitled to active duty pay.a.the government argument against clark claim rests on section d,which bars compensation for a member of a reserve component.d.for the reasons which follow,we conclude that the court of federal claims erred in holding that section d operates to bar clark claim for compensation under section a.
preliminarily,as a matter of textual construction,the government reading of the statute requires the phrase member of a reserve component to encompass both national guard members and reserve component members.such a reading renders the delineation of the two groups in section a redundant.we will avoid an interpretation of a statute that renders some words altogether redundant.united states alaska,d internal quotation marks omitted.the same is true in the case of sections b and e,where congress again chose to refer to both national guard members and reserve component members.b e the language in section a suggests that congress intended to treat members of the state national guard separately from members of a reserve component and that congress did not intend section d to apply to members of the state national guard.
a closer look at the meaning of the phrase a member of a reserve component in section d helps decipher whether the phrase includes national guard members.the government argues that all national guard members are also members of a reserve component due to their dual enlistment in the national guard of the united states.section of title defines several of the terms used in section,including member,reserve component,and army national guard of the united states.section defines member as a person appointed or enlisted in,or conscripted into,a uniformed service,and defines reserve component as a the army national guard of the united states b the army reserve.additionally,section defines army national guard of the united states as the reserve component of the army all of whose members are members of the army national guard.under the definitions in section and by reason of clark dual enlistment pursuant to b,he is a member of the alabama national guard and a member of the army national guard of the united states,which is a reserve component of the army.
our inquiry does not end there,however.although the national guard of the united states is a reserve component,the alabama national guard,of which clark is also a member,is not a reserve component of a uniformed service.it becomes clear,when we consider supreme court precedent and the statutory scheme of which section is a part,that the national guard and the national guard of the united states are separate and distinct entities.to include a member of the alabama national guard in the section d exclusion would not only make congress delineation in section a of who is entitled to compensation superfluous,but would result in a state national guard member bring treated like a federal member of a reserve component.
to determine whether a member of the national guard should be covered by section d,we look to perpich department of defense,d.in perpich,the governor of minnesota challenged the constitutionality of the montgomery amendment,enacted as section of the national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat.the montgomery amendment precluded a state governor from withholding consent to active duty outside the united states by national guard members.perpich,at.the court rejected the challenge.it held that when members of the minnesota national guard were called into federal duty,they lost their state militia status,and the second militia clause in the constitution was no longer applicable.id.at.with this in mind,the supreme court discussed the dual scheme of the state and federal national guard systems and the compromise that lead to this hybrid body.the court stated 
since all persons who have enlisted in a state national guard unit have simultaneously enlisted in the national guard of th
