introduction 
the defendants,mel martinez,secretary of the united states department of housing and urban development,and the united states department of housing and urban development collectively hud,appeal from a decision of the district court for the southern district of new york william pauley iii,denying their motion for summary judgment and granting the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.the plaintiffs,auburn housing authority,new york city housing authority,and plattsburgh housing authority collectively the housing authorities,brought this lawsuit to enforce section n of the quality housing and work responsibility act of,pub,tit.v,stat,codified at n supp.qhwra,which the plaintiffs argue requires hud to provide funding to approximately of the plaintiffs public housing units.hud contends that section of the veteran affairs and hud appropriations act,pub,stat,the appropriations act,permanently bars hud from implementing section n of qhwra,which was also enacted in the appropriations act.the district court rejected hud position and ordered the secretary to comply with section n.for the reasons stated below,we affirm the district court decision.
background 
this case arises from a disagreement as to the interpretation of two provisions in the appropriations act that,on the surface,appear to conflict.in order to evaluate properly the parties arguments on appeal,it is helpful first to discuss the federal public housing program and to set out the statutory provisions at issue in this case.
the federal public housing program 
pursuant to the united states housing act of,et.the housing act,hud provides financial assistance to public housing throughout the country primarily through two types of annual grants to public housing operating fund and a capital fund.an operating fund grant provides funding for the routine expenses of operating and managing public housing developments,while a capital fund grant provides funds for capital improvements to those developments and for related expenses.congress appropriates amounts for the operating fund and the capital fund annually.hud,in turn,allocates these funds to the public housing agencies through an operating fund formula and a capital fund formula.the public housing agencies receive their annual allocations of operating and capital funds based on agreements with hud that are amended annually.prior to the passage of qhwra in,federal funds could only be used to support housing units developed through the federal public housing program,with some very limited exceptions.
the two statutory provisions at issue 
qhwra was enacted on october,as part of the appropriations act.see stat.at.qhwra amends section of the housing act by,among other things,making certain public housing units developed pursuant to state law eligible for federal assistance.id.at.specifically,section n of qhwra provides that for purposes of determining allocations under the operating fund and capital fund formulas,hud is to deem certain housing units in new york and massachusetts to be federal public housing and to provide assistance for those units.id.at.as to new york,section n states in relevant part 
t he secretary shall deem any covered locally developed public housing units as public housing units developed under this title and such units shall be eligible for such assistance 
for purposes of this paragraph,the term covered locally developed housing units means not more than public housing units developed pursuant to laws of the state of new york and that received debt service and operating subsidies pursuant to such laws 
the appropriations act also included administrative provisions,such as section,which stated 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no funds in this act or any other act may hereafter be used by the secretary of housing and urban development to determine allocations or provide assistance for operating subsidies or modernization of certain state and city funded and locally developed public housing units,as defined for purposes of a statutory paragraph,notwithstanding the deeming by statute of such units to be public housing units developed under the united states housing act of,unless such unit was so assisted before october.
the housing authorities requests for funding under n of qhwra 
in the spring of,the housing authorities filed applications with hud regional offices,requesting that hud deem certain locally developed public housing units to be covered units so they could qualify for funding under section n.the plaintiffs were informed that a determination regarding the requests would have to be obtained from hud washington,office.to date,hud has failed to provide the requested funding to the housing authorities based on its understanding that section permanently bars the agency from doing so.
on june,new york representative rick lazio,chairman of the house of representatives subcommittee on housing and community opportunity of the committee on banking and financial services and principal author of qhwra,wrote secretary andrew cuomo regarding the housing authorities requests for funding.congressman lazio explained that although the appropriations act prohibited hud from implementing section n for fiscal year,the appropriations act did not contain any such restriction.on june,several members of congress wrote secretary cuomo,requesting that the approximately units of public housing in plattsburgh,auburn,and new york city be transferred into the federal housing program pursuant to section n of qhwra.the members expressed their view that section only limited the secretary ability to expend certain funds and that sections and n should be read together to give effect to both provisions.
on august,before the instant litigation began,harold lucas,hud assistant secretary for public and indian housing,wrote to the chairmen and ranking minority members of the house and senate appropriations subcommittees on veterans affairs,hud,and independent agencies,informing them of the housing authorities requests.assistant secretary lucas noted that w e have received letters from members of congress expressing the view that the intent of section was not to permanently foreclose funding.therefore,we will act in accordance with the mandate of section and fund those units.lucas asked that the members inform him if this was not congress intent.senator christopher bond,chairman of the senate subcommittee on veterans affairs,hud,and independent agencies of the committee on appropriations,responded to lucas letter.he expressed his view that section overrides section n of the fy appropriations act and prohibits the federalization of these and other state assisted public housing units through funding under the public housing capital fund and the public housing operating fund.according to senator bond,section applied to fiscal year and to each fiscal year thereafter.senator bond based his interpretation of section on language in that provision stating no funds in this act or any other act may hereafter be used.
procedural history 
on august,the housing authorities filed the instant lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york,alleging that hud violated section n of qhwra by failing to provide the requested funding for state and locally developed public housing units in fiscal year.on september,the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the housing authorities motion for summary judgment on december,and ordered hud to comply with section n of qhwra.
in a thorough and opinion,the district court found that section lacked the requisite unambiguous language of permanence necessary to overcome the presumption that an appropriation provision applies only to the fiscal year in which it is enacted unless its language clearly and expressly indicates that it is intended to be permanent.the district court determined that the word hereafter in section did not indicate that congress intended to permanently prohibit hud from distributing funds under section n rather,the court concluded that hereafter limits the secretary ability to expend funds appropriated in the appropriations act or any other appropriation act for the same fiscal year.the court noted that congress used clear language in section n to make it permanent legislation t his subsection shall apply to fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter and thus could have been as clear in section if it had intended section to be permanent.the district court also reasoned that the defendants interpretation of section would prevent hud from ever allocating funds to the additional units section n intended to fund,thereby nullifying section n.the district court noted as well that the legislative history of section supported the plaintiffs interpretation of section.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court grant of a summary judgment.see richardson new york state dep t of corr,cir.summary judgment is properly granted only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.questions of statutory interpretation are reviewed de novo.see lander hartford life annuity ins,cir perry dowling,cir.
discussion 
in this case,we are called upon to determine whether congress intended section of the appropriations act to nullify section n of the same act,as the defendants argue,or whether section only prohibited the implementation of section n with fiscal year funds,as the plaintiffs argue and the district court found.in interpreting the terms of a statute,we look first to the language of the statute itself.see mallard united states dist.court,d in re boodrow,cir,cert.denied,d.but the text is only the starting point,especially when the language is ambiguous.id.at quoting kelly robinson,d.if the meaning of the statute is ambiguous,the court may resort to canons of statutory interpretation to help resolve the ambiguity.see united states dauray,cir.the court may also look at legislative history to determine the intent of congress.see barnhill johnson,d appeals to legislative history will be taken only to resolve statutory ambiguity dauray,at when the plain language and canons of statutory interpretation fail to resolve statutory ambiguity,we will resort to legislative history.see also united states general accounting office,principles of federal appropriations law ed.hereinafter gao principles.
statutory construction is a holistic endeavor.united sav.ass of texas timbers of inwood forest,d.see generally william eskridge,philip frickey,cases and materials on legislation statutes and the creation of public policy ed.the meaning of a particular section in a statute can be understood in context with and by reference to the whole statutory scheme,by appreciating how sections relate to one another.in other words,the preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.see robinson shell oil,d the plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.k mart cartier,d in ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute,the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue,as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.
the meaning of section is not patently clear when it is read together with section n of the same act.the relevant portion of section states 
notwithstanding any other provision of law,no funds in this act or any other act may hereafter be used by the secretary of housing and urban development to determine allocations or provide assistance for operating subsidies or modernization for certain state and city funded and locally developed public housing units 
stat.at.section n makes up to state and local public housing units in new york eligible for assistance from hud under the federal housing program.id.at.section n explicitly states that t his subsection shall apply to fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter.id.while the parties agree that section prohibits hud from using fiscal year monies to implement section n,the parties disagree as to the duration of the prohibition imposed by section.hud argues that section is a permanent bar to funding,while the housing authorities contend that congress intended section only to apply to funds appropriated in fiscal year.
applying canons of statutory construction 
to resolve the ambiguity of section,we turn to canons of statutory construction.we begin with the important principle that repeals by implication are not favored.see tennessee valley auth.hill,d morton mancari,d.this is especially true when the provision advanced as the repealing section enacted in an appropriations bill.see united states will,d tennessee valley,at.calloway district of columbia.
while congress may amend or repeal a statute by means of an appropriations bill,its intention to do so must be clear.see robertson seattle audubon soc y,d congress may amend substantive law in an appropriations statute,as long as it does so clearly.tennessee valley,at.stating that the intention of the legislature to repeal must be clear and manifest quoting posadas national city bank.mchugh rubin,cir stating that congress may repeal,amend,or suspend a statute by means of an appropriations bill,so long as its intention is clear.absent an affirmative showing of an intention to repeal,the only permissible justification for a repeal by implication is when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.tennessee valley,at.quoting morton,at.mchugh,at noting that a positive repugnancy between the existing statute and the appropriations statute is sufficient to indicate repeal of the earlier statute.
the cardinal rule that repeal by implication is disfavored,see tennessee valley,at.posadas,at,is even stronger when the two acts were enacted close in time,see morf bingaman.holding that r epeal by implication is not favored,especially where the one act follows close upon the other,at the same session of the legislature.the comptroller general relied on morf in an opinion letter in which he concluded that when two acts were under consideration and enacted on the same day,one could not conclude that congress intended the statute to govern and therefore nullify the earlier statute.see patrick leahy chairman,committee on agriculture,nutrition,and forestry senate,comp,wl.as the comptroller general explained,s uch proximity in time of enactment is forceful evidence that congress intended the two statutes to stand together.id.at see also gao principles at explaining that when two statutes are enacted on the same day,the presumption that congress intends both statutes to stand together is even stronger and the approach is to make every effort to reconcile the statutes so as to give maximum effect to both.
in the instant case,not only were sections and n enacted on the same day,but they were enacted as part of the same legislation.thus,absent a clear indication of congressional intent to the contrary,it is the court duty to reconcile these provisions,if possible,so that both will have meaning.see united states menasche.stating that t he cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy quoting national labor relations bd.jones laughlin steel.morton,at.t he courts are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments,and when two statutes are capable of,it is the duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.connecticut united states dep t of the interior,cir explaining that the court is required to disfavor an interpretation of a statute that renders language superfluous,cert.denied,d allen oil comm r of internal revenue,cir stating that a statute must,if reasonably possible,be construed in a way that will give force and effect to each of its provisions rather than render some of them meaningless united states blasius,cir noting that t here is a presumption against construing a statute as containing superfluous or meaningless words or giving it a construction that would render it ineffective,cert.dismissed,d.if the court were to interpret section to permanently bar the funding of any locally developed p
