following a remand from a federal district court,the commissioner of social security issued a partially favorable decision on plaintiff cynthia diane claim for title ii disability benefits.dissatisfied,plaintiff once again sought review of the commissioner decision in federal court,but the district court dismissed her complaint as untimely.we consider in this appeal whether a grace period outlined in c should have applied on remand and saved her complaint from dismissal.
an individual seeking title ii disability benefits from the social security administration may obtain judicial review in federal district court of any final decision of the commissioner of social security regarding those benefits made after a hearing to which he was a party.g.on an individual initial application for disability benefits,such a final decision arises in only two circumstances.first,the decision of the administrative law judge alj who held the hearing on the individual claim will become the final decision of the commissioner if the appeals council of the social security administration denies the individual request for further review,a.second,if the appeals council does decide to review the individual claim,the appeals council decision becomes the final decision of the commissioner.id.in either instance,the appeals council must take some action either denying review or issuing its own decision before the individual is considered to have exhausted his or her administrative remedies with the social security administration and may therefore seek judicial review in federal district court.see id.
but what counts as the commissioner final decision differs when the individual case has already gone to federal court and been remanded for further proceedings.in such an instance,and assuming the individual does not file with the appeals council any written exceptions to the alj new decision on remand,the alj decision will become the final decision of the commissioner after remand on the individual case unless the appeals council assumes jurisdiction of the case within sixty days after the date of the alj new decision id.a,c emphases added.put differently,the appeals council does not need to take action before the individual may seek judicial review in federal district court.see id.if the appeals council chooses to do nothing,the alj decision automatically becomes the final decision of the commissioner.id.d.
these differences in finality on an initial application for disability benefits and on remand from a district court influence how we calculate the amount of time the individual has to seek judicial review.in both situations,g applies and mandates that the individual must file his or her civil action within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of the commissioner final decision or within such further time as the commissioner of social security may allow.g.even so,the specific procedural posture of the case changes the practical effect of this statute.
on initial applications for disability benefits,applying g is relatively straightforward.in that scenario,the appeals council,which must take some action,always mails the individual a notice of that action,denying review or issuing its own decision.as such,the default rule under g is that the individual has sixty days from the date the notice was mailed to bring a civil action unless the commissioner has given him or her more time to do so.and under c,the commissioner has done just that pursuant to this regulation,the time limit starts when the individual receives the notice of the appeals council action.further,c provides that f or purposes of this section,the date of receipt of notice shall be presumed to be days after the date of such notice,unless there is a reasonable showing to the contrary.
but on remand,the application of g is a bit trickier.while the alj must mail a notice of its new decision on remand to the individual,see c,b,the appeals council,which has no obligation to act,need not mail a notice to the individual when it decides not to assume jurisdiction over the case,see id.d omitting any language suggesting that the appeals council must mail to the individual a notice of its decision not to assume jurisdiction.in other words,in the situation where the alj decision automatically turns into the final decision of the commissioner after sixty days,no new notice is mailed to the individual informing him or her of that transformation.this makes g somewhat awkward to apply to these situations on remand even though it undoubtedly does apply because the appeals council does not mail a separate notice of this automatic final decision,how can the individual file his or her civil action in federal court within sixty days of the mailing of a notice 
obviously,the individual can not do so.for that reason,g time limit must necessarily begin to run from the day the alj decision automatically transforms into the final decision of the commissioner as one district court aptly put it,t he appeals council inaction triggers the finality of the decision without need for any mailing of a notice of final decision,and a claimant then has sixty days from that date to commence a civil action.harris colvin,wl,at.
but what about c and its grace period can it somehow apply on remand to give an individual an extra five days to once again seek judicial review in federal court even though this regulation speaks in terms of receiving a notice the applicability of c to cases on remand forms the basis of plaintiff appeal today.
plaintiff applied for title ii disability benefits with the social security administration.an alj initially denied her claim after a hearing,and the appeals council denied her request for review.accordingly,the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner from which plaintiff sought judicial review with a federal district court.g.the district court remanded her claim for further administrative proceedings in december.
on august,while on remand,the alj changed course and issued a partially favorable decision on plaintiff claim.the alj mailed a copy of the notice of that decision to plaintiff.in pertinent part,the notice stated the following 
if you do not file written exceptions and the appeals council does not review my decision on its own,my decision will become final on the day following the date of this notice.after my decision becomes final,you will have days to file a new civil action in federal district court.you will lose the right to a court review if you do not file a civil action during the period starting with the day my decision becomes final.we will not send you any more notices about your right to file in federal district court.
notably,plaintiff did not file any written exceptions to the alj decision on remand.similarly,the appeals council did not review the alj decision on its own accord.the alj decision therefore became the final decision of the commissioner once again.
plaintiff thereafter filed a civil action in federal district court on january,challenging the alj decision on remand.the commissioner,however,moved to dismiss plaintiff action on the basis that it was untimely.the commissioner argued that the alj decision became final on october,which was the first day after the appeals council sixty days to assume jurisdiction of the alj august,notice of decision had run.as such,the commissioner calculated that plaintiff had until only december,sixty days after the alj decision became final to file a civil action in federal court challenging the decision.since december was a saturday,however,the commissioner conceded that plaintiff could wait until the following monday,december to file her claim.but because plaintiff nonetheless missed this deadline by several days,the commissioner believed that plaintiff action was.
in response,plaintiff argued that c and its grace period saved her claim from being untimely.by applying this grace period,she claimed that she was presumed to have received the alj august notice of its decision five days later on september.as a result,she maintained that the alj decision actually became final days later on november.but because november was a sun
