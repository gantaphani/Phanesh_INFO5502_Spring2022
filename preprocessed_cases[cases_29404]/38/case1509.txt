appellant sears appeals from the decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court affirming the board of veterans appeals bva determination that the applicable department of veterans affairs dva regulation set the earliest possible effective date for benefits granted for a reopened claim as the date on which a veteran requested reopening,and therefore denying sears request for setting the effective date as of the date of the original application for benefits.because the veterans court correctly upheld the legality of the dva regulation expressly so limiting the earliest effective date for reopened claims,we affirm.
background 
under section c of title,a final decision by the dva on a veteran claim that is not appealed may not be reopened unless statutorily authorized.c.the statute provides only two grounds on which otherwise claims may be reopened.the ground at issue in this appeal is the production of new and material evidence.id.section provides that,i f new and material evidence is presented or secured with respect to a claim which has been disallowed,the secretary shall reopen the claim and review the former disposition of the claim.
if the evidence later presented by a veteran is deemed new and material and service connection is granted,the dva must then determine the effective date for benefits.section a of title,which governs the effective date for benefits,provides 
t he effective date of an award based on an original claim,a claim reopened after final adjudication,or a claim for increase,of compensation,dependency and indemnity compensation,or pension,shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found,but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.
id.a emphasis added.the dva has issued a regulation which specifically provides that the effective date for an award following submission of evidence is the d ate of receipt of new claim or date entitlement arose,whichever is later.q ii.thus,the dva regulation treats a reopened claim as a new claim.in effect,it interprets application therefor in the statute to mean the application to reopen,not the original application for benefits.
in the case at bar,the veteran,virgil lawton served in the army from july to july.lawton was initially denied service connection for stress disorder in.in october,lawton filed an application to reopen his prior claim for service connection on the ground of new and material evidence.lawton was awarded service connection in august,with an effective date of october,the time when he filed his request to reopen.on appeal,the bva denied an earlier effective date,finding that a and the implementing regulation required that the earliest possible effective date of the service connection was the date of the application for reopening.the veterans court affirmed the decision of the bva in august,finding 
no support in the law for the appellant position that the c ourt should read section a mandate that the effective date for a reopened claim shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor as referring to the date of receipt of the original claim rather than the claim to reopen.
sears principi,emphasis in original.the veterans court also concluded that congress expressly specified that a claim reopened after final disallowance is distinct from the original claim that came before it,and a reopened claim is a new claim for purposes of the language of q ii.id.at.
on appeal to this court,appellant argues that the dva regulation,section q ii,is inconsistent with sections and of title,and is thus invalid.further,to the extent this court finds that the plain language of sections and does not alone invalidate the regulation,the appellant argues that we must still invalidate the regulation because it is inconsistent with the policy permeating title.

discussion 
in determining the validity of agency regulations,the first inquiry is whether the applicable statute provides a clear statement of congressional intent on point.the supreme court has stated 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.

here,appellant argues that the dva regulation in question conflicts with the language of sections and.as noted above,section provides for the reopening of an otherwise final claim upon presentation of new and material evidence,and section,that the earliest effective date for benefits is the date of application therefor for an original claim,a claim reopened after final adjudication,or a claim for increase.according to the appellant,the dva regulation,which treats a claim reopened for new and material evidence as a new claim such that the application therefor is the request to reopen is inconsistent with the unambiguous language of sections and,in that these sections clearly characterize reopened claims as old claims that have been revived.
the appellee agrees that the language of sections and is unambiguous,but disagrees as to its meaning.according to the appellee,the language of section clearly differentiates three types of claims an original claim,a claim reopened after final adjudication,and a claim for increase,each of which has a separate and distinct application date.thus,according to the appellee,an original claim and a reopened claim are separate claims under section a,and each has a separate date of application therefor.
to the extent the parties seek to characterize sections and a as unambiguously calling for one interpretation over another,we disagree.rather,the language of these two sections is subject to multiple interpretations.we thus look to the legislative history for guidance as to the congressional intent behind these provisions.
the parties agree that prior to,the effective date of a reopened claim was the date of the request for reopening.this rule was based on two statutes.first,provided that u nless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter,the effective date of an award of compensation,dependency,and indemnity compensation,or pension,shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found,but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.second,stated that w here a claim has been finally disallowed,a later claim on the same factual basis,if supported by new and material evidence,shall have the attributes of a new claim.because a reopened claim had the attributes of a new claim,the effective date for a reopened claim was the filing date of that claim,not the original claim.
in,congress repealed section and amended section,now section.notably,congress did not include the language stating that reopened claims have the attributes of a new claim.the appellee asserts,however,that this language was no longer needed,because section now section specifically defined three separate types of claims,an original claim,a claim reopened after final adjudication,or a claim for increase.
the appellant,on the other hand,argues that a senate report on the amendments undercuts the appellee reading
