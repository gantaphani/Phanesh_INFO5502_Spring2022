on december,the accommodation committee sent gooden a notice to employees seeking disability retirement the december letter.the december letter informed gooden that the postal service was obligated to provide reasonable accommodation to permit her to perform the essential functions of her position.it also informed gooden that,should reasonable accommodation not be possible,she had the right to request reassignment to a vacant position subject to the terms of applicable collective bargaining agreements.the december notice also enclosed a form that could be returned,which is reproduced below 
if no request is received within ten working days from receipt of this notice,the postal service will assume you do not wish to be considered for reasonable accommodation.

this court is without authority to review the substantive merits of disability determinations,or the factual underpinnings of such determinations.lindahl office of pers,d.rather,review is limited to determining whether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights,a misconstruction of the governing legislation,or some like error going to the heart of the administrative process.id.quoting scroggins united states.
b.the accommodation requirement 
gooden argues that the aj erred in requiring gooden to request accommodation in order to prove that accommodation of her disability in the position of city letter carrier was unreasonable.gooden argues that the aj findings themselves demonstrate that accommodation was unreasonable by finding that the position required certain essential duties,that gooden disability prevented her from performing those essential duties,and that due to gooden restrictions,there was no accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential duties.gooden therefore argues that we should reverse the board decision and hold that gooden has proven that accommodation of her disability in the position was unreasonable 
the government does not directly respond to this issue.indeed,the government appears to concede that accommodation was not possible,stating that given the apparently undisputed fact that medical problems prevented gooden from performing hours a day the essential duties of a city letter carrier,it sic unclear how the usps could have made a satisfactory accommodation to permit her to continue to perform the duties of her official position.rather,the government argues that delceg office of personnel management,requires a factual determination of the availability of accommodat
