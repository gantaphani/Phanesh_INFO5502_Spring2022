this is a petition to review the judgment of the department of labor benefits review board.the board upheld retired miner john oliver claim to black lung benefits from his longtime employer,energy west mining company.energy west petition asserts two grounds for relief.first,it claims the board benefits award is not supported by substantial evidence.second,energy west argues that its liability to oliver should be transferred to the black lung disability trust is,to the the government destroyed the records associated with a prior claim filed by oliver in.the company argues that the destruction of these records deprived it of a fair opportunity to defend oliver present claim,in violation of the due process clause.after careful review,we deny the petition in both respects.
the black lung benefits act blba or act,et,compensates coal miners who become totally disabled after contracting pneumoconiosis,or black lung disease,on the job.the act defines pneumoconiosis as a chronic dust disease of the lung and its sequelae,including respiratory and pulmonary impairments,arising out of coal mining employment.b.it is caused by inhaling coal dust into the lungs over a long period,and encompasses a cruel set of conditions that afflict a significant percentage of the nation coal miners with severe,and frequently crippling,chronic respiratory impairment.mining ass dep t of labor,quoting usery turner elkhorn mining,d.black lung benefits are normally paid by a miner employer,but if no employer is held responsible,the claim is paid from the black lung disability trust fund black lung trust administered by the government,mining ass n,at.
to obtain benefits under the act,a miner must demonstrate that he satisfies three conditions he or she suffers from pneumoconiosis the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mining employment and the pneumoconiosis is totally disabling.wyoming fuel,owcp,cir a.the miner must initially file a claim with a district director of the office of workers compensation programs owcp.either side may appeal the district director decision to an administrative law judge alj,then to the board of benefits review,and finally to the court of appeals for the circuit in which the miner injury occurred.mining ass n,at c,as incorporated by the blba at a.
oliver began his mining career with energy west in.over the course of some years,he worked at two of energy west utah coal mines.at various times,he worked as a shuttle car operator,a belt man,and finally a bath house attendant.all of these activities exposed him to coal dust.oliver was also exposed to dust though not of the coal variety through his work as a cattle rancher.he now suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,a progressive and debilitating narrowing of the airways.oliver now experiences shortness of breath,coughing fits,and difficulty lifting things.he is on continuous oxygen treatment.
though copd is not one of the diseases doctors call pneumoconiosis,it can nevertheless qualify under the legal definition of the term if it arises out of coal mining employment.a longstanding interpretation of the blba recognizes that congress intended to compensate miners for a broader class of lung diseases that are not pneumoconiosis as that term is used by the medical community.andersen,owcp,cir see also gulf western indus.ling,cir.as we noted in andersen,the labor department codified this interpretation at a.the regulation defines legal pneumoconiosis to encompass any chronic lung disease or impairment and its sequelae,including any chronic restrictive or obstructive pulmonary disease arising out of coal mine employment.a see also andersen,at.copd arises out of coal mining employment if it is significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by,dust exposure in coal mine employment.b.because copd is most frequently caused by cigarette smoking and is commonly found among the general population,we have held that a miner whose claim to black lung benefits is based on copd is not entitled to the ordinary rebuttable presumption that his or her disease arose out of coal mining employment provided he worked in the mines for at least ten years.andersen,at,c b establishing presumption.
oliver filed his first claim for black lung benefits in.because owcp destroyed the records associated with that claim in pursuant to its policy,we know very little about the claim adjudication aside from the fact that it was denied.a memo left in place of the file suggests that,while oliver had established the first two elements of his claim pneumoconiosis arising out of coal mining employment,the claim was denied because he failed to show he was totally disabled in.following the denial of his original claim,oliver continued to perform mining work for energy west until his retirement in.
oliver filed his present claim for benefits in.because it follows a prior denial,it is a subsequent claim that must also be denied unless the claimant demonstrates that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement has changed since the date upon which the order denying the prior claim became final.d citations omitted.under the applicable regulations,the adjudication of a subsequent claim is subject to special procedures.first,any evidence submitted in connection with any prior claim shall be made a part of the record in the subsequent claim.d.then,limiting the inquiry to those conditions of entitlement on which the prior denial was actually based,d,if the reason for the denial relates to the miner physical condition,the subsequent claim may be approved only if new evidence submitted in connection with the subsequent claim establishes at least one applicable condition of entitlement,d.once the claimant establishes one of the previously denied elements solely on the basis of new evidence,any prior findings on the remaining elements are deprived of preclusive effect.d.finally,if the claimant prevails,his or her benefits are limited to the period after the prior claim was denied.d.
the destruction of oliver claim file threw a wrench into these procedures.because owcp destroyed it,the evidence associated with the prior claim was not made a part of the record as d requires.as a result,both sides were deprived of whatever support that evidence might have lent them with respect to two of the three elements.ordinarily,after establishing one of the elements by new evidence alone,a claimant would be entitled to rely on both old and new evidence to support the other two.instead,oliver was forced to establish all three elements of his claim by new evidence rather than just one,while energy west was forced to defend all three elements without the ability to counter or impeach new evidence with old.
in a hearing before the alj,each side pressed its case on the basis of expert medical testimony.though the regulations establish four possible methods of proving a black lung,a biopsy,applicable legal presumptions,and a physician diagnosis based on objective medical evidence and supported by a reasoned medical opinion,a the alj found that oliver could not prove his case by any of the first three methods.as a result,his proof consisted of the testimony of three doctors morgan,his treating physician,and poitras and james.energy west introduced rebuttal opinions from two of its own experts,farney and fino.
in a thorough opinion,the alj found oliver experts more credible than energy west,placing particular reliance on the opinion of the treating physician.on the issue of the first two oliver had pneumoconiosis and whether it arose out of coal mining alj credited the opinion of all three of oliver doctors.she concluded that james and poitras offered,opinions that were,importantly,consistent with the opinion of oliver treating physician,morgan.alj op.at.she also noted that,unlike most copd sufferers,oliver has never been a smoker.id.at.by contrast,farney conclusion for the company that oliver exposure to coal dust had been quite minimal was simply not credible.both oliver and a,mcelprang,gave credible and convincing descriptions of oliver job site as a place filled with coal dust.mcelprang testified that the bath house was a filthy place and that coal dust was everywhere,and that in the mines themselves,it was so dusty that the mine operator could not see the shuttle car by the time it was loaded with coal.id.at.the alj similarly accorded less weight to fino opinion that oliver suffered from asthma not pneumoconiosis because fino never examined oliver,but instead based his opinion solely on medical records his opinion,moreover,conflicted with those of the other physicians,none of whom diagnosed oliver with asthma.id.at.
on the issue of total disability,the alj credited two of oliver physicians morgan and poitras,and neither of the company.farney opinion was not and conflicted with some of the alj own factual findings that oliver job required moderate exertions with periods of heavy labor.id.at.and fino opinion was similarly unpersuasive because he argued that test results that qualify as disabling under the regulations were in fact normal.id.at.chiefly on the basis of these credibility determinations,the alj found in favor of oliver on all elements of his claim,and ordered energy west to pay benefits.
the alj also rejected energy west argument that the destruction of the claim file has the effect of depriving it of due process of law.energy west contended that it was fundamentally unfair for the government to order it to pay benefits to oliver when it was the failed in its charge to preserve the file and produce it for use in this proceeding.energy west argued it should be excused as the responsible party because it was unable to mount a meaningful defense,and liability for oliver benefits should be borne instead by the black lung trust administered by owcp.the alj disagreed,holding that the lost file did not impair the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.
on appeal,the board of benefits review affirmed the alj in all respects.this petition for review followed.because oliver injury allegedly occurred in utah,we have jurisdiction to review the board decision.broyles,owcp,cir.we will first address its conclusion that the benefits award was supported by substantial evidence,and then turn to energy west due process challenge.
our task is to determine whether the board properly concluded that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence.hansen,owcp,cir bd.op.at.in making this assessment,we will not reweigh the evidence considered by the agency,but only inquire into the existence of evidence in the record that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support its conclusion.hansen,at kaiser steel,owcp,cir.we are especially mindful that the task of weighing conflicting medical evidence is within the sole province of the alj,hansen,at,and that where medical professionals are in disagreement,the trier of fact is in a unique position to determine credibility and weigh the evidence,id.at.
given that standard,we have no trouble concluding that the board decision has adequate support.the company objections chiefly consist of challenges to the alj credibility determinations.the most significant of these is an objection to the alj special reliance on the opinion of the treating physician,so we will clarify that the alj acted properly in this respect.
labor department regulations require an alj to perform a inquiry when considering the report of a claimant treating physician.first,the alj must consider the extent of the physician familiarity with the claimant in light of four factors the nature of the relationship,and specifically whether the physician treated the claimant for respiratory or pulmonary conditions,the duration of the relationship,the frequency of treatment,and the extent of treatment.d.second,if these factors warrant,the alj may choose to give that physician opinion controlling weight,provided that the weight given to the opinion of a miner treating physician shall also be based on the credibility of the physician opinion in light of its reasoning and documentation,other relevant evidence and the record as a whole.d.
the alj properly applied the regulatory framework to morgan opinion.first,the alj gave due consideration to the circumstances attending morgan report.specifically,she found that morgan had been oliver treating physician since that morgan had treated oliver for his respiratory problems on a frequent basis,including caring for him during hospitalization and that,therefore,morgan was in a unique position to render an opinion in this matter.alj op.at.on that basis,the alj made a preliminary finding that if morgan opinion proved credible,it may be entitled to a controlling weight.id.energy west has not challenged the accuracy of the alj findings with respect to the first prong of the d analysis.then,though she ultimately declined to treat morgan opinion as controlling,the alj decided to accord it great weight because it appeared,and consistent with the record evidence.alj op.at.
energy west claims the decision to credit morgan opinion lacks adequate support because it was equivocal.morgan recognized two contributing causes to oliver copd coal mine dust and dust exposure due to cattle ranching.but as the board explained,oliver was not required to establish that coal mine dust was the only cause of his copd it is enough that his respiratory disease was significantly related to,or substantially aggravated by mining exposure to coal dust.cornett benham coal,cir b.morgan concluded oliver copd was significantly related to his dust exposure in the coal mines,alj op.at,which is all the regulation requires.his opinion was therefore not equivocal about the relevant legal question,and a reasonable mind could certainly accept the alj decision to credit it.given her preliminary findings that morgan had extensive experience treating oliver for respiratory disease,the alj decision to rely heavily on his credible opinion was consistent with the regulations.
energy west also appears to quarrel with the rationality of the treating physician rule as such.the company complains that a physician opinion is only as forceful as its power to persuade.pet.br.at.no doubt.but whether a medical opinion is ultimately persuasive depends on the very factors enumerated in the regulation the nature and length of the relationship,the frequency and extent of treatment,the reasoning and support contained in the opinion,and the opinion consistency with other evidence.it is precisely the object of d to structure the alj credibility assessment by requiring her to consider whether,in light of these factors,the treating physician opinion really is persuasive after all.see mining ass n,at.we have long recognized the good sense of affording,in appropriate circumstances,special deference to the opinion of the doctor most familiar with the patient,hansen,at recognizing treating physician rule in this circuit,since codified with some modifications by d micheli,owcp,cir same,though we of course agree with energy west that this deference must not be abject.treating physicians opinions should not automatically be presumed to be correct.peabody coal groves,cir.but here,the alj deference to morgan was manifestly not abject stopping short of treating his opinion as the regulation contemplates,d the alj simply treated morgan opinion as especially persuasive while considering the merits of each expert report on each issue.
having properly applied the treating physician rule,the alj was within her rights to afford great weight to morgan opinion.the rest of energy west potpourri of objections to the alj credibility determinations do not warrant significant discussion.this court can not substitute its assessment of the credibility of experts for that of the alj,and thus can not accept energy west invitation to reexamine the weight of the medical evidence supporting the alj decision.both the board and the alj have shown their work.we therefore sustain the alj findings for substantially the same reasons given by the board in its opinion.
we next turn to the company argument that it was deprived of due process of law by being forced to litigate this case without the contents of oliver claim file.pursuant to its policy,owcp destroyed the file nineteen years after it was closed,in.energy west contends that,without the missing records,it was unable to mount a meaningful defense to oliver present claim.as a result,the company argues that the agency can not now require it to pay benefits to oliver without violating the due process clause.it all the same to oliver,though if energy west is excused from liability,his claim will be paid from owcp black lung trust.see island creek coal holdman,cir agency failure to preserve records deprived employer of due process liability imposed on black lung trust lane hollow coal,owcp,cir agency excessive delay in giving notice to employer of black lung claim rendered imposition of liability unfair.but because energy west can not demonstrate prejudice resulting from the destruction of oliver claim file,we are unable to agree that imposing liability on the company would violate due process.
the due process clause protects against the deprivation of life,liberty,or property by fundamentally unfair or unreliable procedures.the government must provide a litigant with a fair opportunity to mount a meaningful defense to the proposed deprivation of its property.consolidation coal borda,cir quoting lane hollow,at.in some cases,it will be unnecessary for a party to show any specific prejudice in order to establish that it was prevented from mounting a meaningful defense.for example,when the government entirely fails to give notice of a claim,or delays so excessively in providing notice that the party ability to mount a defense is impaired,due process is offended regardless whether the party can show prejudice the unfairness of such a procedure impugns its results.betty b coal,owcp,cir lane hollow,at.
but apart from core violations such as the failure to give notice or any opportunity to be heard,when as here a party complains about the course of administrative proceedings,that party must demonstrate that the adjudication was infected by some prejudicial,fundamentally unfair element.betty b coal,at lane hollow,at noting prejudice requirement for due process challenges to the course of criminal proceedings.that is because the constitution is concerned with procedural outrages,not procedural glitches.litigation is rarely pristine and is filled with risk evidence gets lost,witnesses lie,judges err.the due process clause does not protect against these missteps as such.its interest is only in whether an adjudicative procedure as a whole is sufficiently fair and reliable that the law should enforce its result.thus,energy west must demonstrate that the contents of oliver lost claim file were so vital to its case that it would be fundamentally unfair to make the company live with the outcome of this proceeding without access to those records.
energy west proposes three ways in which it was prejudiced by the destruction of oliver claim file.first,it appears to suggest that whenever the government loses or destroys evidence that might impact a future adjudication,due process has been violated.second,the company argues that materials in the original claim file might support a statute of limitations defense in the present action.third,energy west says that without the ability to compare the evidence introduced in this case with that introduced in,it is impossible for oliver to demonstrate or energy west to refute that one of the applicable conditions of entitlement has changed since the denial of the original claim.d citations omitted.we reject each of these contentions.
energy west correctly points out that d instructs that a ny evidence submitted in connection with any prior claim shall be made a part of the record in the subsequent claim,and this instruction was not complied with in this case.but we are unable to agree that this failure is,by itself,sufficient to establish a due process violation.no one knows what the evidence in the destroyed file would show certainly there is no specific reason to believe it supports energy west position in this litigation.and even in the criminal context,when the government destroys evidence not known to be exculpatory for example,a blood sample that has not been tested,due process is not offended in the absence of prosecutorial bad faith.california trombetta,d united states smith,cir united states beckstead,cir we do not imagine that the due process clause holds the government to a higher standard when it seeks to require a coal company to pay disability benefits to one of its employees than when it seeks to deprive a citizen of his or her physical freedom.here there is no allegation that owcp acted in bad faith or with knowledge that the contents of the destroyed file would favor energy west.the undisputed evidence is that owcp destroyed the file because it thought it would no longer be useful after nineteen years gathering dust.perhaps,in hindsight,that was unwise in light of the liberality with which successive black lung claims would be filed and the continuing relevance of prior evidence in subsequent claims.but lack of foresight is not the same as deliberate misconduct.in the absence of the latter,the mere failure to preserve that may be helpful to one or the other party in some hypothetical future not violate the fifth amendment 
the sixth circuit decision in holdman,on which energy west heavily relies,is not to the contrary.in that case,owcp,remarkably,lost a critical part of the record the transcript of the claimant own testimony during an ongoing adjudication,making it impossible to evaluate the alj findings on appeal.the board concluded it could not resolve the appeal without the completed record,and repeatedly dismissed it over a period of seven years.holdman.at.fourteen years after his original decision awarding seven years after the claimant had died awaiting final alj was asked to reconstruct the record for the board review.but because the missing evidence was critical to the resolution of the claim,the alj concluded that the case could not fairly be resolved without it.id.the sixth circuit concluded that this conduct implicated the company core due process rights,and excused it from liability.id.at.
this case does not present such fundamental concerns.the critical fact in holdman was not the unadorned loss of evidence,but rather the centrality of that evidence to the dispute and the resulting impossibility of fairly assessing the alj findings without considering one of the key pieces of evidence on which those findings were actually based.but as we will discuss,see infra parts iii.b and c,oliver claim file can not be said to be similarly critical to this adjudication.in fact,it is irrelevant to the issues on which energy west claims to have been prejudiced by the file destruction.
energy west next suggestion of prejudice relates to the statute of limitations.under the regulations,a miner must bring a black lung claim within three years after a medical determination of total disability due to pneumoconiosis has been communicated to him,a,and there is a presumption that all black lung claims are timely filed,c.energy west argues that materials in the claim file might reveal that oliver received a communication of total disability from a physician long ago,thereby rendering his current application untimely.petr.br.at.
energy west is mistaken.because black lung is a progressive disease,miners are permitted to file successive claims if a claimant is not found to be totally disabled at the time of their initial claim for benefits,he or she can at a later time and demonstrate that the disease has advanced to point of incapacity.for this reason,we have previously recognized that a final finding by owcp that a claimant is not totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis repudiates any earlier medical determination to the contrary,and resets the statute of limitations for filing a black lung claim.wyoming fuel,at citing sharondale ross,cir.but it is not necessary to have the actual prior findings in front of us.as our sister circuit has explained,a new limitations period begins after every denial of a black lung claim,provided the miner works in the coal mines for a substantial period of time after the denial and a new medical opinion of total disability due to pneumoconiosis is communicated to him.sharo
