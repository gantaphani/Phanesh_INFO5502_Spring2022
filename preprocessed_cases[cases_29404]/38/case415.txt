ruby heston heston filed an application for disability benefits which was denied,and now appeals the district court decision upholding the denial of benefits.heston challenges the decision of the administrative law judge alj on three grounds failure to state reasons for rejecting the report of john haun,plaintiff treating physician lack of substantial evidence to support the alj finding that her testimony was not credible and wrongful application of rule of the guidelines instead of rule in the determination that she can perform substantial gainful work.
the commissioner argues that it is not necessary to reach the merits of heston claims because of her failure to challenge the preliminary finding at step two of the sequential process that she does not have a severe impairment.in addition,the commissioner asserts that heston claims are without merit.
for the following reasons,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
