the claim at issue in this case was brought under the public safety officers benefits act psoba or act of.codified as amended at supp.ii.the united states appeals an august,order of the united states court of federal claims holding that nancy hawkins,a member of the washoe county nv volunteer mounted posse,was a public safety officer who died as a direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,and therefore met the act requirements for an award of a death benefit to her survivors,the plaintiffs.hawkins united states.in the opinion accompanying the order,the court of federal claims construed law enforcement officer,which like a firefighter is a species of public safety officer,as defined in the act to encompass not only officers who enforce criminal law,but also persons who have no criminal law enforcement authority such as those who enforce only civil law.the court also invalidated c,the regulation in which the bureau of justice assistance bja,a unit of the department of justice charged with implementing the act,defined line of duty,a term not defined in the psoba itself.because the court of federal claims incorrectly construed law enforcement officer and erred by failing to defer to the bja definition of line of duty,we reverse the court judgment of entitlement and vacate the court invalidation of c.

calvin hawkins and donna hawkins plaintiffs are the surviving spouse and minor child,respectively,of nancy hawkins.hawkins was a deputy sheriff in the washoe county nv volunteer mounted posse.hawkins was appointed as a deputy sheriff by washoe county sheriff vincent swinney under the authority of nevada revised statute on december,hawkins was called by sheriff swinney to join a mounted horse posse to wild horses that were entering upon and causing damage to private property in washoe county.the posse consisted of deputies on horseback and in patrol cars,as well as overhead helicopter support.during the,hawkins was thrown from the horse she was riding and knocked unconscious.hawkins never regained consciousness and died as a result of craniocerebral and blunt force trauma injuries on december.
following hawkins death,plaintiffs submitted a death benefit claim under the psoba with the bja on june,the bja reviewed the claim and issued a decision on june,finding that,although a member of the volunteer mounted posse,hawkins was not a public safety officer within the meaning of the act.the bja found that hawkins did not meet the definition of law enforcement officer,the only relevant species of public safety officer,because she had no law enforcement authority and therefore her survivors were ineligible for the death benefit under the act.
plaintiffs appealed the decision within the department of justice,and in accordance with bja regulations,an appeal hearing was held on february,before an independent hearing officer.the hearing officer issued a determination on october,affirming the bja denial of the death benefit.the hearing officer concluded that the facts were insufficient to establish that members of the washoe county sheriff posse were vested with the requisite law enforcement authority to qualify them as law enforcement officers under the psoba.the hearing officer based his decision on the following factors that there was no evidence that hawkins had authority to enforce criminal law that rounding up wild horses is a general law enforcement agency activity rather than an activity specifically involving enforcement of the criminal law and that hawkins was neither authorized to carry firearms nor exercise police power,and had received no formal training.moreover,the hearing officer concluded that even if members of the mounted posse had authority,to quell riots,there was no evidence that hawkins was engaged in such crime fighting at the time of her death.
plaintiffs appealed the hearing officer determination to the bja director pursuant to on february.in the absence of a final decision by the director,plaintiffs filed a complaint on november,in the court of federal claims seeking the survivor benefit under the psoba and also attorney fees the united states filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record on march.the court issued its decision on august,denying the motion and entering a final judgment for plaintiffs in the statutory amount of.hawkins.at.
in its decision,the court held that hawkins was a public safety officer who died in the line of duty under a.in doing so,the court first held that the bja final decision did not properly apply congress statutory definition of public safety officer.the court held that to be a public safety officer,plaintiffs had to prove only that hawkins was serving in a public agency in an official capacity and as a law enforcement officer.id.at see also supp.ii.
the court held that hawkins served in an official capacity because she was sworn in as a deputy sheriff and,under nevada revised statute,had all the duties devolving on the sheriff of the county,including,as set forth in nevada revised statute,the duties of keeping the peace,serving process,making arrests.hawkins.at.thus,the court reasoned that contrary to the assertions of the united states,hawkins did indeed have authority to arrest,carry a firearm,and fight crime as a duly appointed deputy sheriff,although she did not actually do so or perform other criminal law enforcement duties during her three year tenure with the sheriff department.id.
the court also relied on hawkins supposed arrest authority under nevada law to find that she was indeed a law enforcement officer for purposes of the psoba.id.at.in doing so,the court rejected the government assertion that,to be a law enforcement officer,hawkins had to have been involved in crime control or reduction or enforcement of the criminal laws.id.at.the court acknowledged that hawkins was not certified by the state,had received no formal training as a law enforcement officer,and further had no authorization to carry a firearm.id.the court also acknowledged that hawkins experience was limited to social and ceremonial activities,search and rescue,protection and preservation of property,participation in fund raisers,mounted crowd control,and traffic direction and control.id.at.nevertheless,the court seized onto the absence of the word criminal in the statutory phrase enforcement of the laws,and reasoned that congress broadly defined law enforcement officer to include even those who enforce only the civil law.id.at congress did not define a law enforcement officer to exclude those who enforce civil laws.therefore,the court determined as a matter of fact and law that hawkins was a law enforcement officer under the psoba.id.
finally,the court held that the bja decision that hawkins did not die in the line of duty was contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.id.at.as a basis for this holding,the court stated that the psoba legislative history was replete with lobbying efforts by the department of justice doj to limit line of duty to exclude accidental deaths,but that the doj lost that battle because congress declined to do so.id.at.the court also reasoned that congress intent in enacting the psoba was for the families of all law enforcement officers involved in enforcement of the laws,whether criminal or civil,to be eligible for psoba survivor benefits,if they died enforcing those laws.id.at.since the bja definition of line of duty as set forth in c does not extend to individuals involved in the enforcement of civil law,the court held that the regulation undermine s congress direction,it is contrary to law,as well as arbitrary and capricious,and entitled to no deference.id.accordingly,the court entered a final judgment of liability.id.

ii.discussion 
in reviewing administrative denial of a benefit under the psoba,the court of federal claims is limited to reviewing whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action by government officials involved and whether substantial evidence supports the decision.chacon united states.on appeal,we review the judgment of the court of federal claims de novo,applying this deferential standard anew.greeley united states,in psoba case,finding that bja factual finding that traumatic injury was not a substantial factor in fire chief death was supported by substantial evidence,and reversing court of federal claims judgment to the contrary.
the government argues on appeal that the bja regulatory interpretation of the term law enforcement officer is entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.according to the government,the court of federal claims erred in concluding that law enforcement officer in constitutes the unambiguously expressed intent of congress to cover individuals who solely enforce civil law.the government asserts that the statutory phrase enforcement of the laws in is actually ambiguous,since the term laws may encompass many different types of law or only criminal law.given this ambiguity,the government asserts that the bja interpretation of the psoba as requiring that law enforcement officer s involved in the enforcement of the laws actually be involved in the enforcement of criminal law rather than purely civil law warrants chevron deference because it is consistent with the intent of congress to protect the families of those involved in crime control and reduction.the government asserts that congress intent is demonstrated here in the plain meaning of the statute contextual language,the act legislative history,and a recent statutory clarification.in contrast,plaintiffs argue that the statutory definition of law enforcement officer is not ambiguous.plaintiffs assert that the phrase enforcement of the laws stands by itself in the definition of law enforcement officer,and that this definition includes all employees of public safety agencies who enforce the laws,whether criminal civil.accordingly,plaintiffs argue that the bja interpretation of is not entitled to deference under chevron.
for the reasons set forth below,we need not decide between the positions of the government and the plaintiffs.rather,we hold the statute is clear and therefore chevron deference has no application here.
when we are confronted with a challenge to an agency interpretation of a term of a statute it has been charged with administering,this court engages in the familiar analytic process articulated in chevron.we always first determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.we do so by employing the traditional tools of statutory construction we examine the statute text,structure,and legislative history,and apply the relevant canons of interpretation.delverde,srl united states,see also chevron,at.if we find that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect,chevron,at,and the issue then devolves into whether the agency acted in accordance with that intention.delverde,at.on the other hand,if we conclude that congress either had no intent on the matter,or that congress purpose and intent is unclear,the next question for the court is whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statutory language at issue.see also chevron,at.footnote omitted.with regard to the latter step,the court need not conclude that the agency construction was the only one it permissibly could have adopted to uphold the construction.chevron,at.rather,so long as the agency construction of the term in the statute is reasonable,chevron requires a federal court to accept the agency construction even if the agency reading differs from what the court believes is the best statutory interpretation.cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.
the precise question at issue in this case is whether the term law enforcement officer as defined in supp.ii includes officers who solely enforce civil law.statutory construction is a matter of law that we review de novo.see,abbott united states.in construing a statute,we begin with its literal text,giving it its plain meaning.timex,united states.moreover,w e must try to read the statute as a whole,to give effect to all of its parts,and to avoid,if possible,rendering language superfluous.delverde,at.
as noted above,congress defined law enforcement officer in supp.ii as an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction,or enforcement of the laws,including,but not limited to,police,corrections,probation,parole,and judicial officers.given the absence of the modifier criminal before laws in the statutory phrase enforcement of the laws,the court of federal claims read the phrase literally to mean all categories of law.hawkins.at.this approach is incorrect,however,since courts can not focus on the phrase enforcement of the laws in isolation.instead,we must follow the cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context since a phrase gathers meaning from the words around it.hibbs winn,d internal quotation marks omitted see also dynamics land cline,d dole united steelworkers of,d statutory interpretation is not guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence,but look s to the provisions of the whole law.
when the phrase enforcement of the laws is read in context,it is clear that congress intended for law enforcement officer to cover individuals who enforce criminal law,rather than merely civil law.in this regard,we note that all of the other elements defining law enforcement officer in plainly involve criminal laws,crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction including but not limited to,police,corrections,probation,parole,and judicial officers.supp.ii emphases added.thus,even though the phrase enforcement of the laws standing alone does not expressly exclude those who only enforce civil law,we find that the language of the provision as a whole evidences congress intent to limit law enforcement officer s to individuals involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction or enforcement of the criminal law.
