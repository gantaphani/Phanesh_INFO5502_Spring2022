the appellants are citizens of the federated states of micronesia who reside in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi.this case concerns the appellants claims that they are entitled to receive benefits from the nutrition assistance program nap,even though their status is that of aliens in cnmi.the appellants originally received benefits under the program,but because they are aliens,they became ineligible to receive benefits after the passage of the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of welfare reform act,et.the statute vested authority in the secretary of agriculture the secretary to waive the restrictions for aliens receiving nap benefits in cnmi and specified territories.the waiver process is to be carried out with the cooperation of the governments of cnmi and the specified territories.any such waiver requires the consent of congress,which can be given by failure to object within days.
the secretary indicated by letters to congress his intention to waive the applicability of the welfare reform act provisions for cnmi that preclude the appellants from receiving the benefits.he did so under the assumption that the cnmi wished to extend the benefits to those individuals that received benefits prior to the passage of the welfare reform act.upon learning that the cnmi government did not desire the waiver,the secretary did not issue it.
the twelve appellants sued the secretary and several government officials of cnmi contending that they were entitled to the nap benefits once the secretary had indicated his intention to waive the restrictions and congress did not object.they further contend that the actions of the cnmi governor violated their rights under the equal protection clause of the united states constitution.
the district court had jurisdiction pursuant to,a and and granted summary judgment for the defendants.we have jurisdiction under,and we affirm the judgment of the district court.
background 
appellants are citizens of the federated states of micronesia who are residing in the cnmi.they were deemed eligible for and received nap benefits until january.under the nap,the cnmi distributes nutritional assistance to qualifying members of the community in the form of coupons.the nap exists pursuant to the authority granted to the secretary under c,which provides in part t he secretary of agriculture is authorized to extend,in his discretion,programs administered by the department of agriculture to the northern mariana islands under this authority,the united states department of agriculture and the cnmi department of community and cultural affairs execute a memorandum of understanding each year governing the operation of the nap.the program is federally funded by the usda food stamp budget.although similar in its purpose and in many of its features,the nap is not part of the food stamp program.unlike the food stamp program,the nap is funded by a capped block grant rather than a mandatory appropriation.thus,applicants for nap benefits who satisfy eligibility criteria can have their benefits denied or reduced once payments under the program reach the capped amount of the federal grant.
appellants nap benefits were terminated as a result of the congressional enactment of the welfare reform act on august.see,stat,codified at et.the welfare reform act imposes a number of welfare restrictions on the receipt of federal public benefits by aliens.section of the welfare reform act provides that,with certain exceptions,an alien who is not a qualified alien is ineligible for any federal public benefit.see.the term federal public benefit includes any grant provided by an agency of the united states or by appropriated funds of the united states and any welfare,health,disability,food assistance,or any other similar benefit provided by an agency of the united states or by appropriated funds of the united states.c a,b.nap benefits are federal public benefits within the meaning of c.an alien is defined as any person not a citizen or national of the united states.a.a qualified alien is an alien who,at the time he or she applies for,receives,or attempts to receive a federal public benefit,falls into one of the categories enumerated in the welfare reform act.see b.the appellants do not fall within any of the enumerated categories.
section of the welfare reform act does provide an exception for individuals who have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence under the immigration and nationality act.see a b.these aliens residing in the cnmi are not qualified aliens under that exception.under article iv of the compact of free association compact entered into between the united states and the federated states of micronesia fsm,citizens of micronesia 
may enter into,lawfully engage in occupations,and establish residence as a nonimmigrant in the united states and its territories and possessions without regard to paragraphs,and of section a of the immigration and nationality act 
compact,reprinted at note.however,the compact provides that 
t he right of such persons to establish habitual residence in a territory and possession of the united states may be subjected to nondiscriminatory limitations provided for in those statutes or regulations of the territory or possession concerned which are authorized by the laws of the united states.
compact b,reprinted at note.although generally united states constitutional and statutory laws apply in the cnmi pursuant to the covenant to establish a cnmi of the northern mariana islands in political union with the united states of america covenant,most federal immigration statutes do not apply.instead the cnmi enacts and enforces its own immigration laws.see covenant,reprinted at note hillblom united states,cir.under a cnmi immigration law established in,aliens can not acquire permanent resident status.see,codified at.accordingly,it is undisputed that the appellants,who are citizens of micronesia,do not fit within any of the enumerated categories and therefore are not qualified aliens under the terms of the welfare reform act.
after enactment of the welfare reform act,the cnmi and the usda executed a memorandum of understanding for the fiscal year.the memorandum of understanding terminated nap benefits for those recipients who no longer qualified under the welfare reform act.in november,the nap forwarded termination notices to nonqualifying recipients,including appellants,advising them that their benefits would be terminated on january.
subsequently,the secretary notified congress of his intention to waive or modify the eligibility requirements for the nap programs of the cnmi pursuant to c.the secretary request was premised on the view that the cnmi would like the authority to continue to provide nap benefits to the same categories of individuals that were provided benefits before the welfare reform act took effect.as required under c,the secretary sent letters to the respective chairmen of the appropriate congressional committees.congress did not act to stop or modify the secretary proposal within the waiting period specified in c.
upon expiration of the period,allen ng,the usda regional administrator for the western region,wrote a letter to cnmi governor pedro tenorio advising him that the secretary now has the authority under c to waive the provisions of the welfare reform act.the letter requested that governor tenorio submit proposed modifications to the existing nap memorandum of understanding identifying which legal aliens cnmi intends to make eligible for nap benefits.finally,ng stated that s hould cnmi decide to reestablish the eligibility of some,or all,legal aliens,usda will determine whether the proposed modifications fit within the limitations of the proposed waiver.
governor tenorio responded to ng expressing the cnmi reluct ance to accept the usda waiver.the governor stated that he did not wish to encourage under the fsm compact to establish habitual residence in the cnmi,absent employment,or absent an alternate means of.he further explained that an influx of under the fsm compact not only places a burden on the nutrition assistance program but also places a burden
