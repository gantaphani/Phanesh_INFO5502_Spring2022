plaintiff steven nolan was a police officer for the city of anaheim anaheim his last assignment was as a patrol officer.pursuant to government code section nolan has applied for permanent disability retirement benefits on the ground that threats and harassment by other anaheim officers have rendered him incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his duties in the state service.italics added.the question presented is what,for the purposes of section,is meant by state service 
state service,nolan contends,refers to the applicant last employer.therefore,nolan argues,in order to qualify for disability retirement,he need only show he is incapable of continuing to perform his duties as a patrol officer for anaheim.we disagree.we conclude that in order to qualify for disability retirement under section,nolan will have to show not only that he is incapacitated from performing his usual duties for anaheim,but also that he is incapacitated from performing the usual duties of a patrol officer for other california law enforcement agencies.assuming nolan makes such a prima facie showing,the burden will then shift to anaheim to show not only that nolan is capable of performing the usual duties of a patrol officer for other california law enforcement agencies,but also to show that similar positions with other california law enforcement agencies are available to nolan.by similar positions,we mean patrol officer positions with reasonably comparable pay,benefits,and promotional opportunities.
factual and procedural background 
nolan began work as a police officer with anaheim in.he was number one in his sheriff academy class and received outstanding ratings early in his career.in,upon transferring to the gang unit,nolan reported what he believed to be excessive use of force by fellow officers.as an apparent consequence,nolan experienced strained relations with other members of the gang unit,and he voluntarily returned to patrol duty in.
five months later,after an internal affairs investigation failed to substantiate any misconduct on the part of the other officers,disciplinary charges were brought against nolan for violation of department rules.the charges included unbecoming conduct,unsatisfactory performance,misuse of sick time,and improper handling of evidence.nolan was fired,and he took the case to arbitration.the arbitrator ordered him reinstated,but suspended for five days.
shortly after the arbitration,nolan received two threatening telephone calls and numerous telephone.he believed the calls were placed by anaheim police officers.one caller warned him to always wear his vest,an apparent allusion to being shot at,and the other said,welcome back,you fucking dead.as a consequence,nolan filed for disability retirement he also filed a civil whistleblower suit seeking damages for wrongful termination.
in the whistleblower suit,the jury awarded nolan for the wrongful termination,but reduced the award by on the ground he could have found comparable employment.in addition,the jury awarded nolan for emotional stress.
in this disability matter,the administrative law judge found that nolan suffered no mental incapacity and recommended denial of his request.anaheim adopted the decision,and nolan filed this action,seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the city to grant him disability retirement.
the superior court found that nolan was permanently incapacitated for the performance of his duties as a police officer for anaheim.the court based its finding on the testimony of a psychologist retained by nolan,concurred in by a psychiatrist retained by the city insurance carrier,that he was not emotionally and mentally able to work as a police officer due to his fear for his personal safety and the retaliation he had already experienced the court further found that nolan fear of retaliation was based,in part,on the likelihood that he could not count on fellow officers for backup in time of need.the court noted that his post termination arbitration proceeding and his civil whistleblower suit had established that the police department did not have sufficient reason to terminate him and that the termination was in retaliation for his informing on fellow officers he believed used illegal force on suspects.the court further noted that even the psychiatrist retained by the city stated that nolan fears were reasonable.
the court of appeal reversed and remanded the cause for reconsideration of the administrative record under what it held to be the appropriate standard,whether nolan is mentally incapacitated for state service,perform police services throughout the state 
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal,which reversed the judgment of the trial court,and we remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
ii.discussion 
the rules governing statutory construction are well settled.we begin with the fundamental premise that the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent.people trevino cal th,d,people gardeley cal th,d.to determine legislative intent,we turn first to the words of the statute,giving them their usual and ordinary meaning.trevino,at,d,trope katz cal th,d.when the language of a statute is clear,we need go no further.however,when the language is susceptible of more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.granberry islay investments cal th,d,people woodhead cal d.
the statutory context of this case was recently summarized in pearl,supra,cal th,d.the legislature enacted the public employees retirement law et,to effect economy and efficiency in the public service by providing a means whereby employees who become superannuated or otherwise incapacitated may,without hardship or prejudice,be replaced by more capable employees,and to that end provide a retirement system consisting of retirement compensation and death benefits.id.under its provisions,certain persons,including police officers,are eligible for special disability retirement benefits if they are incapacitated for the performance of duty as the result of an industrial disability.id,italics added.thus,upon retirement for such a disability,a peace officer shall receive a disability allowance of percent of his or her final compensation plus an annuity purchased with his or her accumulated additional contributions,if any,or,if qualified for service retirement,the member shall receive his or her service retirement allowance if the allowance,after deducting the annuity,is greater.id.these benefits are free from federal income taxes.a.pearl,at,d.
the provision of the public employees retirement law perl at issue here is section,which provides for disability retirement for a member who is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his or her duties in the state service.section provides in pertinent part if the medical examination and other available information show to the satisfaction of the board,or in case of a local safety member,other than a school safety member,the governing body of the contracting agency employing the member,that the member is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his or her duties in the state service and is eligible to retire for disability,the board shall immediately retire him or her for disability,unless the member is qualified to be retired for service and applies therefor prior to the effective date of his or her retirement for disability or within days after the member is notified of his or her eligibility for retirement on account of disability,in which event the board shall retire the member for service.
again,the question presented is what,for the purposes of section,is meant by state service 
nolan contends that for a police officer,a local safety member,to demonstrate he or she is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his or her duties in the state service,the officer need only show an incapacity to continue functioning in the contracting agency employing the member.
we disagree.as the court of appeal observed,section does not refer to the employee last employing department it refers to state service.section defines state service as service rendered as an officer of the state,the university,a school employer,or a contracting agency,for compensation when sections and are read together,it becomes clear that state service,for the purposes of section,means all forms of public agency service that render an employee eligible for the benefits of section.therefore,in order for nolan to qualify for disability retirement under section,he will not only have to show he is incapacitated from continuing to perform his usual duties for anaheim,but also that he is incapacitated from performing the usual duties of a patrol officer for other california law enforcement agencies covered by the perl.
the position taken by nolan would lead to results that would clearly be at variance with the fundamental policies that led the legislature to enact the perl.as previously stated,the legislature enacted the perl to effect economy and efficiency in the public service by providing a means whereby employees who become superannuated or otherwise incapacitated may,without hardship or prejudice,be replaced by more capable employees,and to that end provide a retirement system consisting of retirement compensation and death benefits,italics added.nolan asserts that no other law enforcement agency in the state would be willing to hire him because he has accused fellow officers of misconduct,is perceived as a troublemaker for challenging his termination and bringing a whistleblower suit,and has a history of anxiety,depression and fear.however,in response to questions at oral argument,nolan counsel also insisted that nolan would be entitled to permanent disability retirement even if several police departments in communities surrounding anaheim were to offer him positions that were in all relevant respects similar to the position he held in anaheim,and his psychological disability did not extend to the other departments.we find it inconceivable that the legislature,in enacting the perl to effect economy and efficiency in the public service,intended to grant an applicant permanent disability retirement benefits under such circumstances.
nolan contends,however,that the granting of such a windfall is compelled by the body of case law that has developed in the courts of appeal regarding light duty assignments.as nolan points out,under the light duty doctrine,a police officer is not considered to be incapacitated if a permanent light duty position the officer is capable of performing is available within that department.see,barber retirement board d.barber craver city of los angeles d.craver retirement board d.
the light duty cases are distinguishable.the seminal light duty cases involved construction of disability retirement provisions of city charters.barber,supra,d at.san francisco craver,supra,d at.los angeles,supra,d at.san francisco.therefore,the question addressed in each of those cases was whether the applicant was capable of filling a permanent light duty assignment that was available in the applicant department nolan has not brought to our attention,nor has our own research revealed,a light duty case addressing the relevance of the availability of appropriate light duty assignments in other cities.a decision,of course,does not stand for a proposition not considered by the court.people harris cal d.therefore,the light duty cases are simply not apposite.
in its brief,amicus curiae,the california public employees retirement system calpers,warns that a standard of the sort we adopt a peace officer seeking permanent disability retirement must show not only that he is incapacitated from performing his usual duties for his last employer,but also that he is incapacitated from performing the usual duties of his last assignment for other california law enforcement not be administrable.such a test would be impossible to administer,calpers contends,because it requires assumptions about what services are required at other departments or employers other than at the city of anaheim.while it may be possible to imagine some duties that other police departments require of police officers,uniform circumstances of employment around the state can not be presumed.
calpers has set up a straw man.doubtless,the duties required of,for example,patrol officers are not uniform throughout the state.however,that is beside the point.the question is what are the usual duties of a patrol officer mansperger public employees retirement system d.mansperger.
in mansperger,the court of appeal was called upon to construe former section.added by stats,ch,repealed by stats,ch.it provided any patrol or local safety member incapacitated for the performance of duty as the result of an industrial disability shall be retired for disability,pursuant to this chapter,regardless of age or amount of service.italics added.the mansperger court held that incapacitated for the performance of duty,for the purposes of former section,meant the substantial inability of the applicant to perform his usual duties.mansperger,supra,d at.the court acknowledged that the applicant,a state fish and game warden,could no longer lift or carry heavy objects,but observed the necessity for doing so was a remote occurrence in a fish and game warden job.id.at.the court also acknowledged that fish and game wardens occasionally need to make physical arrests,but observed that such occasions were not a common occurrence for a fish and game warden.id.at.the evidence showed the applicant could substantially carry out the normal duties of a fish and game warden.id.at.therefore,the court held,the board,and the trial court,properly found that petitioner was not incapacitated for the performance of duty,within the meaning of section of the government code and,therefore,that he was not entitled to the disability pension which he sought.id.at,italics omitted.
with all due respect to the expertise of calpers in administering the perl,determining the usual duties of a patrol officer should not be that difficult.every civil service employer must describe the usual duties of every position.
finally,while the legislature,in enacting the perl,was concerned to effect economy and efficiency in the public service,it expressly intended to do so without hardship or prejudice to employees who become superannuated or otherwise incapacitated.to deny nolan disability retirement benefits on the ground he is capable of working for other california law enforcement agencies would clearly work a hardship on him if,as he claims,no other law enforcement agency would,in fact,be willing to hire him because he has blown the whistle on misconduct by fellow officers.therefore,if nolan shows not only that he is incapacitated from performing his usual duties for anaheim,but also that he is incapacitated from performing the usual duties of a patrol officer for other california law enforcement agencies,the burden will shift to anaheim to show not only that nolan is capable of performing the usual duties of a patrol officer for other california law enforcement agencies,but also that similar positions with other california law enforcement agencies are available to him by similar positions,we mean patrol officer positions with reasonably comparable pay,benefits,and promotional opportunities.
iii.disposition 
we affirm the judgment of the court of appeal reversing the judgment of the trial court we remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this decision.
i agree with the majority opinion insofar as it rejects nolan argument that he can claim disability retirement benefits on the sole basis that he has become physically or psychologically incapacitated to work as a police officer for the city of anaheim.on the contrary,he must show that his physical or psychological condition prevents him from performing the usual and customary duties of a police officer anywhere in the state.and once he does present such evidence,the city must have an opportunity to rebut it.
but that is the end of the matter.if nolan has a general incapacity for police officer duties,he is entitled to a pension.otherwise,he is not.the majority opinion thus errs in its holding that nolan may retire for disability,even if he has no general incapacity,unless the city can show that similar positions with other california law enforcement agencies are available to him,d at,at,fn.omitted,italics added.
the majority effort not to penalize nolan for his whistleblowing activities is understandable,but it is an example of good intentions gone awry.the statutory scheme specifies that an eligible local safety member may be retired for disability if the member is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his or her duties in the state service,italics added as the result of an industrial disability,subd.a.the statutes nowhere intimate that a disability pension is available to an officer who has a general physical and mental ability to perform,but simply can not secure a position.unemployability is not the same thing as incapacity.the disability retirement system is not an unemployment insurance system.
as sole support for the available positions theory it invents,the majority opinion cites section.this statute declares that the purpose of the pension system for public employees is to effect economy and efficiency in the public service by providing a means whereby employees who become superannuated or otherwise incapacitated may,without hardship or prejudice,be replaced by more capable employees italics added.the majority opinion posits that to deny nolan a pension when no similar positions are available would cause him hardship and prejudice.
but the retirement scheme is intended to ease hardship or prejudice only for those eligible employees who are no longer productive because they have become either superannuated,or incapacitated by industrial injury,italics added see also,subd.a,and incapacitated means physically or mentally unable to perform anywhere in the state,not just for a particular employer.section affords no license to carve out a hardship or prejudice exception to the statutory requirement that a disability retiree be incapacitated by injury.
the facts of nolan case may be sympathetic,but the rule proposed by the majority opinion presumably would apply in less compelling circumstances.law enforcement work is stressful by nature,and serious conflicts may routinely arise.as the court of appeal noted,p eace officers and firefighters sometimes put in for a disability retirement based on mental incapacity which derives fundamentally from the fact that they are getting along with their colleagues and from fear about the way fellow officers will behave toward them in the future.the concern arises that an officer whose difficulties with coworkers have made it psychologically impossible to continue in that agency,but not elsewhere,could receive lifetime disability benefits simply on evidence that other agencies would not wish to hire him,or that the job market was full.but haywood american river fire protection dist.th,d haywood disability retirement not intended for one simply unwilling to return to current agency because of personality conflicts after being terminated for nonmedical cause.
moreover,if entitlement to a disability pension depends on whether similar suitable employment is unavailable elsewhere,numerous complications of proof will be presented.if the issue is general unemployability,what evidence on that issue will suffice if the issue is job availability,how broad an area must the search for other openings cover at what moment,or over what period,must the unavailability exist such questions threaten to become the tail that wags the dog in proceedings to determine whether a locally,but not generally,incapacitated officer may retire for disability.
of course,an eligible local safety member may do so if difficulties that arose with a particular employer have produced a general psychological incapacity to perform the usual and customary duties of a peace officer,regardless of location.the line between unable and merely unwilling can be fine.see haywood,supra,th,d.nonetheless,if nolan anaheim experience produced a genuine personal fear,so severe as to render him dysfunctional,that,wherever he went,his record would follow,and he would face unbearable ostracism,threats,and lack of backup at times of danger,i agree he may secure a disability pension.
nothing in the court of appeal disposition prevents nolan from presenting such evidence on remand.accordingly,i would affirm the judgment of the court of appeal.
california public employees retirement system pers manages the pension benefits provided to more than million public employees,retirees,and their families under the public employee retirement law perl,et steven nolan,a police officer for the city of anaheim,whose employees are members of pers,applied for a disability retirement based on a mental depression and anxiety stemming from fear that he would be killed or injured for lack of backup by fellow officers were he to return to duty in the anaheim police department.the majority holds that to qualify for disability retirement nolan must show not only that he is incapacitated to perform his usual duties for the anaheim police department,but also that his incapacity precludes him from performing the usual duties of a patrol officer for other california law enforcement agencies,d at,at.that holding subverts the clear intent of the legislature,overrules some years of pers administrative practice and precedent,as well as court decisional law,and sketches a new and unworkable test of disability.therefore,i can not and do not join the majority.
after steven nolan graduated from the sheriff academy at the top of his class,the city of anaheim hired him in.in,he joined the gang investigative unit,but after observing instances of what he believed to be excessive force by fellow officers,in he sought and received a transfer back to patrol duty.when a department investigation failed to substantiate his allegations of misconduct by the gang unit officers,nolan himself was charged with and found to have violated certain department rules,leading to his dismissal in.
in august,an arbitrator reversed the dismissal and ordered nolan reinstatement.soon nolan began receiving anonymous calls threatening his life and the president of the anaheim police association warned him in the association newsletter,if you want your job back it is still here but i wo work with you.nolan depression led him to apply for disability retirement in september.
an administrative law judge took evidence,and in october he denied nolan application,finding nolan had failed to establish his substantial inability to perform his usual duties and therefore was not mentally incapacitated.the city of anaheim adopted that decision.
nolan petitioned the superior court for a writ of mandate.the court reviewed the administrative record,which included reports from three mental health professionals who had interviewed nolan.william winter,the only one to have seen nolan repeatedly,concluded after the last interview that nolan was suffering from anxiety disorder and could not return as a police officer with the city of anaheim,or with any other municipality in southern california,but might be able to be a police officer in a distant state such as illinois where his problems with the city of anaheim were unlikely to catch up with him.samuel dey was of the view that nolan was suffering from depression and as a result his ability to function in the work setting would be significantly impaired.in the opinion of melvin schwartz,nolan did not have a psychiatric injury,although his fear of personal harm were he to return to work was a realistic concern.the superior court found that nolan fears make it emotionally and mentally,although not physically,impossible for him to return to law enforcement,and concluded that nolan suffered a permanent psychological disability.accordingly,in october the court issued a writ directing the city to find nolan permanently incapacitated from working for the city of anaheim,and thus enti
