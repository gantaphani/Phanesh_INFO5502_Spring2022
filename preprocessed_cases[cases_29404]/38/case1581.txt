jose appeals from the decision by the court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court on december,affirming the denial by the board of veterans appeals board of his claims for service connection for a neck disability and increased rating for a low back claim.west.we,and remand.
served in the army for fifteen years,from july to july.no preexisting conditions were noted on his entrance exam.in august,he sought medical treatment for what his service medical records describe as neck pain of two months duration with no history of trauma.a cervical spine taken at that time was normal.in january,began complaining of low back pain after lifting heavy equipment.his medical records indicate ongoing complaints of low back pain until his discharge.
at the time of his separation from service,submitted a claim for service connection for a low back injury beginning in january and neck pain beginning in august.the regional office ro of the department of veteran affairs va in wichita,kansas,granted service connection for the lower back injury and rated it at percent disabling.service connection for the neck pain,however,was denied based on the lack of evidence of a pathological neck disorder.appealed the decision on both claims and was afforded a hearing in december.
after taking testimony from,the hearing officer ordered a medical examination,which took place in january.although his turned up normal during this medical examination,gave an account to the medical examiner of his history of back and neck pain.he also informed the physician of an neck injury that allegedly took place in,when a large metal bumper was dropped on his neck.consequently,the medical examiner recorded diagnoses of lumbar muscle strain for the low back pain and h istory of trauma to the cervical area with residual pain for the neck pain.low back disability rating was subsequently increased to percent by the hearing officer.however,service connection for neck pain was again denied.
in june,the board determined on appeal that further development was necessary for both the neck and low back claims,and remanded the case for additional medical testing and examinations.specifically,the board requested that an opinion be provided by the orthopedist regarding the likelihood of a relationship between the neck symptomatology noted in service and any current cervical spine pathology.
during the subsequent neurological examination in july,again provided a history of episodic low back pain,and neck pain stemming from his alleged injury.with regard to the neck,the examiner found tenderness at discs,no evidence of radiculopathy,and normal bulk,tone,and power with no evidence of muscle wasting or motor weakness.as to the low back,the examiner found tenderness at discs,some decreased sensation of the left thigh,and low back pain upon bending.the examiner noted that cervical spine performed in early july showed minimal narrowing and slight reversal of lordosis at discs,and that lumbar spine revealed minimal degenerative changes and narrowing of the spaces at discs and.the examiner ultimately diagnosed slight reversal of lordosis at,lumbosacral sprain,and left radiculopathy.
also underwent a spinal examination in july.the orthopedic examiner noted three sets of cervical spine the january,which were normal the early july,which showed very small and early osteophyte on the anterior aspect of,good disc spaces,normal neural foramina,and no arthritis or evidence of trauma and the late july,which were found to be entirely normal.the lumbar spine consistently showed osteophytes on and.after conducting a physical examination,the orthopedic examiner determined that was able to carry out the duties of his job,and concluded that t he physical findings and the radiologic findings do not reveal a definite or specific cause of the complaints in the neck and low back.therefore,i am not able to correlate well the complaint of chronic pain with the clinical findings.
in august,a magnetic resonance image mri was conducted on cervical neck and lumbar low back spine.the mri report showed degenerative disc disease with mild bulging in the lumbar spine,but came up negative with regard to the cervical area.the august report of va electromyography emg and nerve conduction velocity ncv studies of neck and back showed no definite abnormalities.
after all the examinations were completed,the board found that the preponderance of the evidence was against claims for service connection for a neck disability and an enhancement in the rating for his low back disability.concerning the neck disability,the board noted the va orthopedic examiner statement that clinical and radiologic findings did not reveal a source or cause of the veteran complaints of neck pain,nor did the clinical findings substantiate the veteran belief that his neck pain was secondary to lower back pain.in the absence of evidence that had a neck disability that was shown by medical records to be related to an injury,the board denied his claims for service connection for a neck disability.regarding the low back disability,the board evaluated the veteran claim under a,diagnostic code dc intevertebral disc syndrome.the board considered the tenderness and the discomfort experienced by the veteran during his physical examination,but concluded that a rating higher than percent was not warranted.in doing so,it stated that t he nature of the original injury has been reviewed and the functional impairment that can be attributed to pain or weakness has been taken into account,citing addressing functional loss and limitation of motion due to pain on use and requiring inquiry into weakened movement,excessive fatigability,incoordination,pain on movement,and limitation of motion.
appealed to the veterans court.with respect to his claim for service connection for pain arising from an neck injury,the veterans court held that the board did not err,on the facts in this case,in denying the grant of service connection.in particular,the veterans court affirmed the board factual finding that there was not adequate medical evidence of any present disability related to the appellant service.the board,as well as the veterans court,concluded that the reference to history of trauma to the cervical spine area with residual pain in medical records did not establish a medical connection between the alleged neck injury and currently experienced pain.in short,the board and the veterans court concluded that the record failed to show a connection between the neck trauma incident and current neck pain.thus,the veterans court stated that there is a plausible basis in the record for affirmance of the board intensely denial of service connection for the neck condition.
to be sure,the veterans court unlike the board did state that pain alone,without a diagnosed or identifiable underlying malady or condition,does not in and of itself constitute a disability for which service connection may be granted.although understands that the veterans court statement about pain alone is at most an alternative to the veterans court assessment of the medical evidence as described urges this court to decide his appeal solely on the issue of whether the pain alone statement is a correct statement of law.
regarding the low back disability,the veterans court found that the board decision had complied with the mandates of an intervening precedential opinion issued by the va general counsel addressing dc.the veterans court further found no evidence of exceptional or unusual circumstances that would render the schedular rating inadequate.hence,the veterans court affirmed the board denial of both of claims.
