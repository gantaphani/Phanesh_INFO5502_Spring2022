kelvin schexnayder sued hartford life and accident insurance company hartford under the employee retirement income security act of erisa,stat.schexnayder asserted that hartford wrongly denied him disability benefits.the district court granted summary judgment to schexnayder,holding that hartford abused its discretion in denying schexnayder claim.in addition,the district court granted schexnayder attorneys fees.for the following reasons,we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment to schexnayder,but reverse the district court order granting schexnayder attorneys fees.
factual and procedural background 
schexnayder worked for cf industries as a chemical operator from february until june,when severe back and leg pain forced him to cease working.although doctors performed back surgery on schexnayder in,he continues to suffer from recurrent pain in his back and extremities,rendering him at least partially disabled.
schexnayder was covered by a long term disability insurance plan the plan sponsored by cf industries for its employees.the plan was funded by a group disability insurance policy issued by continental casualty.pursuant to an endorsement,hartford life group insurance became the underwriting company for this policy in addition to funding the benefit plan,hartford had sole discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits under the plan and to interpret its terms and provisions.
after schexnayder ceased working and filed for benefits under the plan,he was entitled to receive up to months of disability payments if hartford determined that he was unable to perform his regular occupation.after this initial period,schexnayder was entitled to disability benefits only if he was unable to engage in any occupation for which he was or became qualified.concluding that schexnayder was disabled from his regular occupation as a chemical operator,hartford paid schexnayder disability benefits under the plan for his initial,month regular occupation period.during this period,the social security administration the ssa determined that schexnayder was totally disabled,meaning that he could not perform any work,and it authorized him to receive disability payments.after receiving this award,schexnayder promptly reimbursed hartford for the disability payments he had received through the ssa.
in november,hartford notified schexnayder that his regular occupation payments would end in november and that the information it had received from his doctors did not support a finding that he remained disabled from working in any occupation.schexnayder disputed this determination and provided additional medical documentation in an effort to show that he was totally disabled.hartford decided to extend schexnayder benefits beyond november while it continued to consider his disability claim.after further review,hartford informed schexnayder that as of january,he would receive no further benefits under the plan because the medical and vocational information it had examined did not support the conclusion that schexnayder remained disabled from any occupation.schexnayder appealed this decision through hartford internal appeals process.accordingly,hartford conducted a final review of the evidence.in june,hartford informed schexnayder that it would uphold its decision to terminate benefits because schexnayder was functionally capable of performing a number of occupations requiring only a sedentary level of exertion.
schexnayder then filed suit in federal court seeking review of hartford decision to terminate his disability benefits.in august,the parties submitted cross motions for summary judgment.the district court granted schexnayder motion,concluding that hartford abused its discretion in terminating schexnayder disability benefits.in addition to reinstating schexnayder benefits under the plan,the court ordered hartford to pay past disability benefits retroactive to january,including interest,and schexnayder attorneys fees and costs.the district court entered a final judgment and hartford timely appealed.

benefits determination 
in reviewing the plan administrator decision,we take into account several different considerations.metro.life ins.glenn,d.these factors are and must be weighed together before determining whether a plan administrator abused its discretion in denying benefits.id.any one factor may act as a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced,the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor inherent or importance.id.
the interaction between the factors and the substantial evidence test is a relatively new issue after the supreme court decision in glenn.we have considered the interplay in only one prior published which we found that the conflict of interest was a minimal factor and that the evidence was more than sufficient to support the denial of benefits.at.however,a reviewing court may give more weight to a conflict of interest,where the circumstances surrounding the plan administrator decision suggest procedural unreasonableness.glenn.at.applying glenn method of review,we give more weight to the conflict of interest because hartford decision here suggests procedural unreasonableness.
