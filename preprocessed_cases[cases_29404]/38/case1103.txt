the federal emergency management agency fema and the fish and wildlife service fws appeal from an adverse summary judgment and grant of injunctive relief.the district court found that fema and the fws failed to comply with section of the endangered species act,with regard to fema administration of the national flood insurance program in the florida keys fema and the fws maintain that section a of the endangered species act does not apply to fema provision of flood insurance and that fema has,in any event,fully complied with section.we affirm.
statutory framework 
to resolve the questions before us,we must first address the interaction between two congressional mandates the national flood insurance act of,and the endangered species act of.
a.the national flood insurance act 
congress passed the national flood insurance act of nfia to provide affordable flood insurance throughout the nation and to encourage sensible land use that would minimize the exposure of property to flood damage and loss.d f flick liberty mut.fire ins,cir.toward that end,the nfia authorizes fema to establish and carry out the national flood insurance program nfip.
before insurance is provided within a community,however,the nfia requires that the community satisfy certain eligibility criteria.specifically,fema is required to issue flood insurance only once it has determined that a community has 
evidenced a positive interest in securing flood insurance coverage under the flood insurance program,and 
given satisfactory assurance that by december,adequate land use and control measures will have been adopted for the state or area or subdivision which are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use developed under section of this title,and that the application and enforcement of such measures will commence as soon as technical information on floodways and on controlling flood elevations is available.
id.emphasis added.the statute also establishes that a fter december,no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided under this chapter in any area or subdivision thereof unless an appropriate public body shall have adopted adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions which fema finds are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use under section of this title.id.a.
thus,fema is required to make flood insurance available in only those areas that have evidenced interest in securing flood insurance through the nfip,and adopted adequate land use and control measures that are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use developed by fema pursuant to.id.c,a.in order to ascertain whether a locality interested in participating in the nfip has adopted adequate land use and control measures,fema is authorized to conduct studies,id.a,and,on the basis of those studies and other relevant information,to develop the comprehensive criteria referenced above.those criteria must be designed to encourage,where necessary,the adoption of state and local measures that will 
constrict the development of land which is exposed to flood damage where appropriate,
guide the development of proposed construction away from locations which are threatened by flood hazards,
assist in reducing damage caused by floods,and 
otherwise improve the land management and use of areas.
id.c.the criteria now in effect are set forth in fema regulations at.the criteria relevant here are discussed below.
in addition to guiding fema issuance of flood insurance,the nfia requires fema to implement a community rating system program that provides discounts on flood insurance premiums in communities that establish additional floodplain management regulations that exceed the minimum criteria set forth in fema eligibility criteria.b.congress established the community rating system to serve four purposes 
a to provide incentives for measures that reduce the risk of flood or erosion damage that exceed the criteria set forth in section of this title and evaluate such measures 
b to encourage adoption of more effective measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions 
c to encourage floodplain and erosion management and 
d to promote the reduction of federal flood insurance losses.
b.the endangered species act 
the endangered species act of esa is the most comprehensive legislation for the preservation of endangered species ever enacted by any nation.valley auth.hill,d.its stated purposes were to provide a means whereby the ecosystems upon which endangered species and threatened species depend may be conserved and to provide a program for the conservation of such endangered species and threatened species.b.the plain intent of congress in enacting this statute was to halt and reverse the trend toward species extinction,whatever the cost.valley,at.in short,the preservation of endangered species was to be considered the highest of priorities.id.at.at the most basic level,this goal translated into the esa requirement that the secretaries of commerce and the interior maintain a list of endangered and threatened species listed species and designate their critical habitats.the fws administers the esa with respect to species under the jurisdiction of the secretary of the interior,and the national marine fisheries service,not relevant here,administers the esa with respect to those under the jurisdiction of the secretary of commerce see ass of home builders defenders of wildlife,d,a,b.
at the heart of this dispute,and of congress plan to preserve endangered and threatened species,is section of the esa,which places affirmative obligations upon federal agencies.section a provides that all federal agencies shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary of commerce or the interior,utilize their authorities in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter by carrying out programs for the conservation of endangered species and threatened species.a.
the mandate of section a is even clearer 
each federal agency shall,in consultation with and with the assistance of the secretary of commerce or the interior,insure that any action authorized,funded,or carried out by such agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species which is determined to be critical,unless such agency has been granted an exemption for such action pursuant to subsection h of this section.
id.a.thus,section a imposes two obligations upon federal agencies.the first is procedural and requires that agencies consult with the fws to determine the effects of their actions on endangered or threatened species and their critical habitat.id.b.the second is substantive and requires that agencies insure that their actions not jeopardize endangered or threatened species or their critical habitat.id.a.
regulations implementing the procedural consultation requirement provide for an optional,informal consultation between the acting agency and the fws prior to a determination that formal consultation is required.formal consultation is a process between the fws and the federal agency that commences with the federal agency written request for consultation under section a of the act.id.it is required if an acting agency determines that any action it takes may affect listed species or critical habitat.id.a.following formal consultation,the fws is required to issue the acting agency a written statement setting forth the fws opinion,and a summary of the information on which the opinion is based,detailing how the agency action affects the species or its critical habitat.b a referring to the fws written statement as its biological opinion.
if the fws finds jeopardy or adverse modification to a listed species or its critical habitat,the fws shall suggest those reasonable and prudent alternatives which it believes would not violate subsection a.b a.in response to an opinion finding jeopardy or adverse modification,the acting agency must comply with the substantive mandate of section a and either terminate the action,implement the proposed alternative,or seek an exemption from the endangered species committee pursuant to e.ass of home builders.at.
before discussing the interplay of the nfia and the esa in this case,we summarize the relevant facts of this lengthy proceeding.
ii.background of this case 
in,the fws determined that fema administration of the nfip in the florida keys potentially jeopardized the existence of the florida key deer by effectively authorizing the development that pushed the key deer to the brink of extinction.in,however,fema refused the fws request for formal consultation,asserting that the esa did not apply to the nfip.
in,the plaintiffs,which we hereafter collectively refer to as the wildlife organizations,filed this suit seeking an injunction requiring fema to comply with section a of the esa by formally consulting with the fws about the impact of its administration of the nfip on the key deer.the wildlife organizations adopted the fws argument that the nfip encouraged new development that threatened the meager population of key deer with extinction.key deer stickney.key deer i.after a bench trial,the district court agreed and entered a memorandum opinion and final declaratory judgment in the wildlife organizations favor,requiring fema to consult with the fws.id.at.the court retained jurisdiction over the case to enforce the injunctive relief granted.id.at.fema did not appeal that ruling.
in compliance with this ruling,fema consulted with the fws regarding the impact of the nfip on the key deer and nine other endangered or threatened species.in,the fws issued its opinion,which found,among other things,that the nfip,as administered in the florida keys,jeopardized the continued existence of the key deer and eight other listed species.in accordance with its regulations and the esa,the fws recommended reasonable and prudent alternatives rpas to the manner in which fema administered the nfip to avoid placing the key deer and other listed species in jeopardy.the rpas provided for review by the fws of new development within the suitable habitat of the listed species.in compliance,monroe county conditioned the grant of building permits to landowners on the completion of fws review.during that review,the fws was to determine whether the proposed project may or would not adversely affect endangered or threatened species or designated critical habitat.depending upon the answer,the fws would take appropriate action to ensure compliance with the esa.in the rpas,the fws also recommended that fema evaluate monroe county compliance with the consultation procedure,notify the county of violations,and treat violations as substantive deficiencies pursuant to.the county failure to correct the deficiencies would result in probation or suspension of its participation in the nfip.
finally,the rpas also included conservation recommendations under section a of the esa.specifically,the fws recommended that fema provide incentives in the form of reduced insurance premiums for completion of a comprehensive,habitat conservation plan.fema adopted the rpas and conservation recommendations in.
in,the wildlife organizations filed an amended complaint in the original lawsuit,adding the fws as a defendant and challenging the adequacy of the rpas and the accompanying conservation recommendations under the esa and the administrative procedure act.the wildlife organizations claimed that the rpas failed to insure that the nfip would not jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or their critical habitat pursuant to a that fema was not adhering to the fws review suggested in the rpas and that the conservation program adopted by fema did not satisfy section a.
before the district court ruled on for summary judgment,fema and the fws reinitiated consultation.the new consultation apparently arose from a provision of the rpas that required a second consultation if monroe county failed to complete a habitat conservation plan within four years,which in fact the county failed to do.in,the fws issued a second opinion assessing the threat that fema administration of the nfip posed to the listed species in the florida keys.it concluded that the nfip jeopardized eight of the ten species considered in,but that the rpas adequately protected the listed species.accordingly,it simply reiterated its recommendation that fema continue to implement the same reasonable and prudent alternatives rpas suggested in and the same conservation recommendations made in pursuant to section a,even though the challenges to the rpas contained in the first amended complaint had not been resolved.the wildlife organizations correspondingly amended their complaint in order to challenge the rpas,the conservation recommendations,and fema decision to adopt them.
on march,the district court granted the wildlife organizations motion for summary judgment,finding that fema had not satisfied its obligation under section a to carry out programs to conserve species and that neither fema nor the fws had satisfied their obligations under section a.key deer brown.key deer ii,d.on september,the district court enjoined fema from providing any insurance for new developments in the suitable habitat of the listed species in monroe county pending further consultation and compliance with its order of march.key deer brown.key deer iii,d,
iii.discussion 
fema and the fws challenge the district court grant of summary judgment and injunctive relief,arguing that 
section a of the esa does not apply to fema administration of the nfip 
section a of the esa does not require fema to perform an independent analysis of the fws proposed reasonable and prudent alternatives before adopting them 
section a of the esa does not require agencies to develop programs for the conservation of listed species and 
the district court exceeded its authority by issuing an injunction that is allegedly inconsistent with the esa and the nfia.
we address each argument in turn 
whether section a of the esa applies to fema administration of the nfip 
a regulation promulgated jointly by the secretaries of commerce and the interior provides that section applies to all actions in which there is discretionary federal involvement or control.during the pendency of this appeal,the supreme court had the opportunity to rule upon the validity of that regulation.it upheld the regulation as reasonable and affirmed that section a covers only discretionary agency actions and does not attach to actions that an agency is required by statute to undertake once certain specified triggering events have occurred.ass of home builders.at.therefore,the primary issue for us to consider regarding section a of the esa is whether fema has any discretion in its administration of the nfip such that it is bound by the requirements of section a.fema and the fws argue that this case is similar to national association of home builders and that fema does not have the required discretion under the nfia.we disagree.
the supreme court defined the requisite discretion for section a of the esa as the discretion to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself.id.at.this does not,as the parties conceded at oral argument,require the statute at issue to use environmental terminology for agency discretion to be found there is no test.see,in re operation of.river,cir finding sufficient agency discretion in administration of the flood control act of,which required the consideration of flood control and navigation,primarily,in agency construction of a dam and reservoir system.accordingly,we ask whether fema has discretion in administering the nfip to consider the protection of endangered or threatened species as an end.
in operating the nfip,fema is required to make flood insurance available in those areas with adequate land use and control measures,as judged by comprehensive eligibility criteria developed by fema.c.fema develops the eligibility criteria pursuant to the authority conferred by c.that provision requires fema to consider studies and investigations,and such other information as it deems necessary to develop comprehensive criteria designed to encourage,where necessary,the adoption of adequate state and local measures which,to the maximum extent feasible,will,in addition to reducing the development of land,otherwise improve the land management and use of areas.id.emphasis added.this statutory scheme bears little resemblance to the scheme in national association of home builders,where no discretion was found.
in national association of home builders,the supreme court considered the interplay between the seemingly conflicting mandates of the clean water act cwa and the esa.the cwa established the national pollution discharge elimination system npdes,which is designed to prevent harmful discharges into the nation waters.ass of home builders.at.although the environmental protection agency epa initially administers the npdes permitting system for each state,it must transfer that permitting authority to a state upon application and satisfaction of nine statutory criteria.id.those criteria test the authority under state law of the administering agency to carry out the npdes program.id.at.the respondents before the court argued that the epa has discretion to consider listed species in making an npdes transfer decision.id.at.the court rejected the argument,stating that n othing in the text of the cwa operative provision authorizes the epa to consider the protection of threatened or endangered species as an end in itself when evaluating a transfer application.id.additionally,the court noted that to the extent that some of the cwa criteria may result in environmental benefits to marine species,there is no dispute that the state at issue has satisfied each of those statutory criteria.id.in other words,although the cwa requires the epa to consider whether a state has the legal authority to enforce applicable water quality standards,the permit transfer process does not itself require scrutiny of the underlying standards or of their effect on marine or wildlife.id.at.
here,by contrast,congress set out several purposes for fema to consider in fema development of the criteria relevant to its assessment of whether a requesting locality has adequate land use and control measures in place.c.moreover,those purposes are broad and contemplate restriction of land development and consideration of whether a locality measures will otherwise improve land management and use.therefore,although fema is required to issue flood insurance to localities that satisfy certain criteria,fema itself is charged with developing those criteria and enjoys broad discretion in so doing.see wildlife fed fema,d,finding that fema has discretion in its development of the eligibility criteria.
fema also enjoys broad discretion in its implementation of the community rating system program pursuant to b.see id.at finding that fema has discretion in designing the community rating system program.congress directed fema to design the program and,in its discretion,to reward localities with discounted insurance premiums for the adoption of floodplain management regulations that exceed the minimum criteria discussed above.b.among the purposes congress directed fema to consider in designing the program is the protection of natural and beneficial floodplain functions.id.b b.we find that the language of b provides ample discretion for fema to consider listed species.
based upon our review of the nfia scheme for the development of eligibility criteria and of the purposes served by the community rating system program,we are satisfied that fema has discretion to consider endangered and threatened species in its administration of the nfip.indeed,this finding is consistent with fema own regulations implementing the nfip,wherein wildlife and environmental concerns are considered.see b imposing the condition that certain communities r equire a setback for all new development from the ocean,lake,bay,riverfront or other body of water,designated by the administrator according to the erosion hazard and erosion rate,and depending upon the geologic,hydrologic,topographic and climatic characteristics of the community land,and explaining that t he buffer may be used for wildlife habitat areas id.b requiring that communities seeking an exception from the obligation to adopt adequate flood plain regulations shall explain in writing to fema the nature and extent of and the reasons for the exception request and shall include sufficient supporting economic,environmental,topographic,hydrologic,and other scientific and technical data,and data with respect to the impact on public safety and the environment id.c requiring that communities,in adopting floodplain regulations,consider d iversion of development to areas safe from flooding in light of the need to prevent environmentally incompatible flood plain use id.b requiring that participating states maintain the ability to e stablish minimum state flood plain management regulatory standards consistent with other federal and state environmental and water pollution standards for the prevention of pollution during periods of flooding.
fema and the fws alternatively argue that even if fema has the requisite discretion to consider the effects of its administration of the nfip on listed species,the issuance of flood insurance is not a legally relevant cause of the development in the florida keys that threatens the listed species.we are not persuaded.
by its terms,section a of the esa applies to any action authorized,funded,or carried out by the agency at issue.a see also providing examples of agency action.the applicable regulations direct agencies,in considering whether formal consultation is required,to determine whether any action may affect listed species or critical habitat.a.a later portion of the same regulation confirms that agencies must consider the effects of the action as a whole.id.c.the e ffects of the action include the direct and indirect effects of an action on the species or critical habitat,and i ndirect effects are those that are caused by the proposed action and are later in time,but still are reasonably certain to occur.id.
this statutory and regulatory framework for determining when an agency action requires section a consultation is materially indistinguishable from the framework of the national environmental policy act nepa considered by the supreme court in department of transportation public citizen,d.the issue in public citizen was whether nepa and the clean air act required the federal motor carrier safety administration fmcsa to evaluate the environmental effects of operations of motor carriers.id.at.the fmcsa was charged with promulgating safety and financial regulations for motor carriers and with granting registrations to motor carriers willing and able to comply with those regulations.id.at.it had no statutory authority to impose or enforce emissions controls or to establish environmental requirements unrelated to motor carrier safety.id.at.after reviewing nepa framework,the court determined that the environmental effects of operations could not be considered effects of the fmcsa issuance of regulations and registrations because the fmcsa simply lacks the power to act on the environmental consequences of what congress required it to do.id.at.the court summarized its holding where an agency has no ability to prevent a certain effect due to its limited statutory authority over the relevant actions,the agency can not be considered a legally relevant cause of the effect.id.at.
although the statutory frameworks considered here and in public citizen are quite similar,the facts of the cases are not.here,fema has the authority in its administration of the nfip,as discussed above,to prevent the indirect effects of its issuance of flood insurance by,for example,tailoring the eligibility criteria that it develops to prevent jeopardy to listed species.therefore,its administration of the nfip is a relevant cause of jeopardy to the listed species.this is confirmed by the fws own interpretation that section applies to the nfip and its findings made during formal consultation with fema that the nfip jeopardizes listed species because development is encouraged and in effect authorized
