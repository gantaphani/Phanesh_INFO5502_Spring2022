sultan mental illness dates to at least when he was hospitalized after threatening his mother with a knife.in the previous year he had missed many days of school and had occasionally experienced auditory hallucinations.treating psychologist stanley patterson,noted that sultan mother had a long history of chronic schizophrenia and tentatively diagnosed sultan with separation anxiety disorder.patterson wanted further tests to rule out schizophrenia.although sultan prognosis was somewhat guarded,patterson believed it could improve if sultan continued to take medication and participate in therapy.
since then sultan has been treated by numerous providers of psychological and psychiatric care.in the mid he was seen regularly by joshua nnanji,for schizophrenic diathesis and attention deficit disorder.nnanji treatment notes from that time report that sultan was doing well on a combination of ritalin for attention deficit disorder,olanzapine an antipsychotic,and serzone an antidepressant.in sultan began seeing grey woodman,whose notes report that sultan was of normal intelligence and did not appear to be hallucinating or delusional or indeed with any thought disorder and he does seem to be oriented to time,place and person.when sultan subsequently began experiencing hallucinations and difficulty controlling his anger,woodman increased his olanzapine dosage and reported that this helped a good deal.
