when deciding whether to offer lqa for the dcc position at camp hansen pursuant to the instruction and the order,the deputy commanding general of the mcbj considered both the recruitment need and the expense to the agency.the deputy commanding general prior experience showed that there were many qualified,candidates for the various dcc positions for whom lqa was not needed as a recruitment incentive.indeed,it was known that many marines like roberts wished to remain in okinawa in civilian positions after retirement.the deputy commanding general also determined that there were insufficient funds to support lqa for dcc positions in okinawa without reallocating funds from other programs.after considering both recruitment need and expense,the deputy commanding general determined that lqa was not necessary for these dcc positions.in april,the marine corps posted job announcement number ok job announcement,which listed a job vacancy for deputy camp commander for camp operations at camp hansen.the hiring process confirmed the lack of recruitment need determination when fourteen qualified,candidates responded to the job announcement.

discussion 
jurisdiction 
the united states argues that the claims court should have dismissed on jurisdiction grounds.the tucker act provides that the claims court 
shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded either upon the constitution,or any act of congress or any regulation of an executive department,or upon any express or implied contract with the united states,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.
in previous cases,the supreme court and we have addressed the standard for determining whether jurisdiction exists under the tucker act with respect to a claim for money under a statute and regulations.for jurisdiction to exist,the statute and regulations must be such that they can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained.united states white mountain apache tribe,quoting united states testan.it is enough that a statute creating a tucker act right be reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages.id.at.further,the statute and regulations must be as to the class of which plaintiff claims to be a member.casa de cambio comdiv de united states,holding that,even if the regulations were as to third party,they are not as to plaintiff since there is no indication that they were designed to convey rights to members of plaintiff class.the united states main argument is that the act and its implementing regulations are discretionary,and therefore,are not,as required for tucker act jurisdiction.see testan,at fisher united states,en banc.
