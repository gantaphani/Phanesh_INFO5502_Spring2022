jasim abo abi shalash abo ghanim appeals from the district court judgment affirming the social security commissioner denial of his application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.in denying ghanim application for benefits,the administrative law judge alj rejected the opinions of ghanim treating physician and other treating providers as to the severity of his impairments.the alj also found ghanim testimony about the severity of his symptoms not credible.on reconsideration,the social security administration ssa concluded that ghanim was disabled after all,but determined that the onset date for his disability was march,rather than april,as ghanim originally alleged.at issue here is only whether ghanim is entitled to benefits for the intervening period.we hold that the weight the alj accorded to ghanim treating providers and the alj adverse credibility determination are not supported by substantial evidence.we therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings.
background 
ghanim personal and medical history 
ghanim immigrated to the united states in as a refugee from iraq,where he had been imprisoned and tortured for two years.he worked consistently from to in a variety of jobs.in,ghanim brother,who lived in iraq and worked with the united states military,was killed.ghanim was deeply affected by his brother death he had nightmares and trouble sleeping,became very forgetful,and frequently felt unsafe and hopeless.after his brother death,ghanim stopped working.
treating providers 
in july,ghanim began receiving counseling and psychiatric care,first at highpoint medical clinic and then at harborview medical center.at harborview medical center,ghanim met with several different medical professionals,including christine elizabeth youdelis flores,nina spellman geiger,arnp,lawrence mccann,licsw,and john blatchford,licsw.all of these individuals met with ghanim several times over the course of his treatment.their treatment notes reflect both ongoing psychological impairment including depression,difficulty sleeping,nightmares,nervousness,memory loss,and anger and some signs of improvement such as higher energy,higher activity levels,and brighter mood.the treatment notes also show that ghanim was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and stress disorder ptsd,for which he was prescribed numerous and medications.
in march,geiger and mccann submitted a psychological evaluation to the washington state department of social health services.the evaluation contained diagnoses of major depressive disorder and ptsd.the evaluation also noted marked cognitive and social impairment related to ghanim inability to manage social situations in october,youdelis flores and blatchford sent a letter to ghanim attorney,expressing their opinion that d ue to his mental illness,we feel it is highly unlikely ghanim would be able to engage in meaningful adult activities or employment in the near future.in support of this opinion,they referred to his symptoms,including nightmares,intermittent sleep,low energy,and depressed mood,and the diagnoses of ptsd and major depression,recurrent,with psychotic features.
examining physicians 
in june,ghanim was examined by victoria mcduffee,a psychologist.ghanim reported increasing agitation,hypervigilance,nightmares,and daily intrusive thoughts.mcduffee observed that ghanim presented as emotional ly labile,angry,hostile,and resentful and that he appeared paranoid,suspicious of others,and extremely edgy.mcduffee administered a mental status examination,with the following results status score no cognitive impairments,beck depression score severe depression,beck anxiety score severe anxiety she identified a number of severe functional limitations,including inability to relate appropriately to coworkers and supervisors interact appropriately in public respond appropriately to,and tolerate,the pressures and expectations of a normal work setting and maintain appropriate behavior.she diagnosed ghanim with ptsd,personality disorder,major depressive disorder,and generalized anxiety disorder.
in december,at the request of washington department of disability services,ghanim met with wayne dees.dees also administered a mental status exam.he noted that ghanim was generally alert and friendly throughout the evaluation,but mildly irritable at times.he also noted,however,that ghanim presentation was consistent with anxious mood,and his affect was blunted.he concluded that ghanim endorses symptoms of ptsd,including exaggerated startle,hypervigilence,fear and avoidance,intrusive thoughts,emotional numbing,and nightmares.ghanim fared poorly on the cognitive portion of the test,and dees concluded that he has a severely impaired ability to learn and o verall cognitive functioning appears to be impaired.he indicated that ghanim was able to complete simple but not complex instructions.however,dees thought that ghanim cognitive deficits may not be as severe as he claims,and stated that malingering is suspected based on ghanim performance during the evaluation.he did not make a definitive diagnosis of malingering,however,explaining that further evaluation was recommended before a determination could be made.he diagnosed ghanim with depressive disorder nos,ptsd,anxiety disorder nos,and cognitive disorder 
reviewing physicians 
in december,the state agency medical consultant,gerald peterson,performed a mental residual functional capacity assessment.he determined that ghanim only limitation was a moderate limitation in his ability to complete a normal workday without interruption from symptoms.peterson explained that ghanim could perform simple and complex tasks,was described as friendly and cooperative,socialized with friends and attended religious services,and was able to move and find stable employment.in february,another state medical consultant,beth fitterer,reviewed peterson mental residual functional capacity assessment.she noted that updated medical records did not alter the previous opinion and affirmed peterson assessment.neither peterson nor fitterer ever met with ghanim,and it is not clear what medical records they reviewed at the time of their respective assessments.
procedural history 
on october,ghanim applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income,claiming he had been disabled since april.his application was denied.he filed a request for reconsideration,which was also denied.he then requested a hearing before an alj,which was held in december.
at the hearing,ghanim testified about the extent of his impairments.he reported that even with medication,he suffered from constant nightmares.he also testified about his social anxiety,stating that i confine myself to my home,just sitting there because i do want to go outside and interact with people.finally,he explained how his depression caused him to neglect himself.he would allow dirty clothes to pile up.he was afraid to cook because his memory was poor and he would forget things in the oven.he testified that he depended heavily on his friend and caretaker,majid al haider,for assistance with his basic and for much of his limited social interactions.al haider would visit him daily,help him with chores,take him outside,and occasionally take him to spend time with his family.
the only other witness to testify at the hearing was iris brookshire,a vocational expert.the alj sought her opinion on whether a person with ghanim limitations could perform any gainful work in the national economy.to that end,the alj posed a hypothetical question describing an individual who had limited english proficiency but who could understand,remember,and carry out basic tasks,had an average ability to perform sustained work activities,could respond appropriately to supervision and coworkers,and could deal with changes within a stable work environment.the vocational expert opined that such a person would be able to perform work as a kitchen helper and a commercial cleaner.however,if the individual had difficulty completing a normal workday and would miss more than two days of work per month due to his mental health impairments,the vocational expert testified,the individual would not be able to find work as a kitchen helper or commercial cleaner.
ghanim also submitted a letter from al haider in support of his application.al haider described ghanim personal history and his current difficulties.most notably,he stated that ghanim ca do anything without help.he ca cook or wash his clothes.
the alj concluded that ghanim was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act and denied his application for benefits.although the alj found that ghanim suffered from depression and ptsd,he concluded that ghanim functioning remained relatively unimpaired.in doing so,he discounted the opinions of all of ghanim treating providers,finding that their opinions conflicted with the treatment notes in the record and were based on ghanim,which the alj found not credible.the alj also rejected ghanim testimony as not credible,because it conflicted with the treatment records it conflicted with two examining physicians evaluations it conflicted with prior it was belied by the types of daily activities ghanim engaged in and other record evidence cast doubt on ghanim credibility.finally,the alj rejected al haider characterization of ghanim capabilities because it conflicted with ghanim own statements.based on his assessment of the medical and lay evidence,the alj determined that ghanim could follow basic instructions in english,could carry out simple tasks,had the ability to work on a regular basis,and could respond appropriately to supervision and coworkers.relying on the vocational expert testimony,the alj concluded that ghanim could perform his past work as a kitchen helper and a commercial cleaner.
the appeals council denied ghanim request for review.the district court affirmed,and this appeal followed.while this appeal was pending,ghanim filed another request for reconsideration with the ssa.he submitted updated medical records,and this time,the ssa concluded that ghanim was disabled as of march.in light of this development,this case is limited to whether ghanim is entitled to benefits for the period beginning april,and ending march,
ii.standard of review 
we review the district court order affirming the alj denial of social security benefits de novo,and reverse only if the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole or if the alj applied the wrong legal standard.molina astrue,cir citations omitted.even when the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,we must uphold the alj findings if they are supported by inferences reasonably drawn from the record.id.at.however,in conducting our review,we must consider the entire record as a whole and may not affirm simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence.hill astrue,cir quoting robbins soc.sec,cir.
iii.discussion 
to determine whether a claimant is disabled,an alj is required to employ a sequential analysis,determining whether the claimant is doing substantial gainful activity whether the claimant has a severe medically determinable physical or mental impairment or combination of impairments that has lasted for more than months whether the impairment meets or equals one of the listings in the regulations whether,given the claimant residual functional capacity,the claimant can still do his or her past relevant work and whether the claimant can make an adjustment to other work.molina,at quoting a,a ghanim argues that the alj failed to consider a relevant mental impairment at step two.he further argues that,with respect to the mental impairments the alj did consider,his assessment of the medical evidence was not supported by substantial evidence,his adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence,and his rejection of lay witness evidence was not supported by a germane reason.he contends that these errors led to an improper residual functional capacity determination at step four.we address each argument in turn.
step two analysis 
ghanim first argument warrants only a brief discussion.he argues that the alj erred in failing to consider the diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features.ghanim never raised this argument before the district court.accordingly,it is waived,greger barnhart,cir,and we do not address it further.
step four analysis 
at step two,the alj identified two medically determinable severe impairments depressive disorder and ptsd.we turn to the alj determination of ghanim residual functional capacity and ability to perform past relevant work in light of these impairments.
medical evidence 
generally,the opinion of a treating physician must be given more weight than the opinion of an examining physician,and the opinion of an examining physician must be afforded more weight than the opinion of a reviewing physician.holohan massanari,cir c.if a treating physician opinion is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record,it will be given controlling weight.orn astrue,cir internal quotations omitted alterations in original see also c.to reject an uncontradicted opinion of a treating physician,the alj must provide clear and convincing reasons that are supported by substantial evidence.bayliss barnhart,cir.
even if a treating physician opinion is contradicted,the alj may not simply disregard it.the alj is required to consider the factors set out in c in determining how much weight to afford the treating physician medical opinion.orn,at c.these factors include the l ength of the treatment relationship and the frequency of examination by the treating physician,the n ature and extent of the treatment relationship between the patient and the treating physician,the s upportability of the physician opinion with medical evidence,and the consistency of the physician opinion with the record as a whole.c.in many cases,a treating source medical opinion will be entitled to the greatest weight and should be adopted,even if it does not meet the test for controlling weight.orn,at.similarly,an alj may not simply reject a treating physician opinions on the ultimate issue of disability.holohan,at.an alj may only reject a treating physician contradicted opinions by providing specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence.ryan comm r of soc.sec,cir accord holohan,at.
only physicians and certain other qualified specialists are considered a cceptable medical sources.molina,at alteration in original see also a.nurse practitioners and therapists are considered other sources.d.while their opinions must still be evaluated,c,the alj may discount testimony from these other sources if the alj gives reasons germane to each witness for doing so.molina,f d at quoting turner comm r of soc,cir.
ghanim argues that the alj improperly weighed the medical evidence by,among other things,disregarding the opinions of his treating physician and other treating providers.the alj rejected geiger and mccann opinions that ghanim had impaired cognitive and social functioning and youdelis flores and blatchford opinions that ghanim mental illness made it highly unlikely that he would be able to engage in meaningful adult activities or employment in the near future.he rejected these opinions because he regarded them as inconsistent with the treatment notes and ghanim daily activities and because they were based largely on ghanim.
a conflict between treatment notes and a treating provider opinions may constitute an adequate reason to discredit the opinions of a treating physician or another treating provider.see molina,at recognizing that a conflict with treatment notes is a germane reason to reject a treating physician assistant opinion valentine comm r of soc.sec,cir holding that a conflict with treatment notes is a specific and legitimate reason to reject treating physician opinion.here,however,substantial evidence does not support the alj conclusion that the opinions of youdelis flores,blatchford,geiger,and mccann were inconsistent with the treatment notes.
the treatment notes consistently reflect that ghanim continued to experience severe symptoms,including ongoing depression and auditory hallucinations,difficulty sleeping,nightmares,and memory loss.it is true that the notes also record some improved mood and energy level.but such observations must be read in context of the overall diagnostic picture the provider draws.holohan,at lester chater,cir occasional periods are not inconsistent with disability.the fact that a person suffering from depression makes some improvement does not mean that the person impairment no longer seriously affect s his ability to function in a workplace.holohan,at see also ryan,at 
youdelis flores,blatchford,geiger,and mccann opinions about ghanim cognitive and social functioning and ability to engage in meaningful adult activities or employment also do not conflict with ghanim daily activities.such a conflict may justify rejecting a treating provider opinion.see morgan comm r of soc.sec,cir considering an inconsistency between a treating physician opinion and a claimant daily activities a specific and legitimate reason to discount the treating physician opinion.but this principle has no application here because a holistic review of the record does not reveal an inconsistency between the treating providers opinions and ghanim daily activities.although ghanim performed some basic chores and occasionally socialized,the record also reveals that he relied heavily on his caretaker,struggled with social interactions,and limited himself to environments.a claimant need not be completely incapacitated to receive benefits.smolen,at.ghanim limited daily activities are not in tension with the opinions of his treating providers.
the alj also discounted the opinions of the treating providers because they were based largely on ghanim,which the alj found not credible.if a treating provider opinions are based to a large extent on an applicant and not on clinical evidence,and the alj finds the applicant not credible,the alj may discount the treating provider opinion.tomasetti astrue,cir see also bayliss,at.however,when an opinion is not more heavily based on a patient than on clinical observations,there is no evidentiary basis for rejecting the opinion.see ryan,at.here,the letter from youdelis flores and blatchford and the evaluation from geiger and mccann discuss the providers observations,diagnoses,and prescriptions,in addition to ghanim.the alj offered no basis for his conclusion that these opinions were based more heavily on ghanim,and substantial evidence does not support such a conclusion.
in sum,the alj improperly discounted the opinions of ghanim treating providers as to the severity of ghanim condition and his ability to work because the record revealed occasional indicia of improvement,a minimal capacity to perform basic chores,and some reliance by treating providers on ghanim this is not an adequate evidentiary basis to reject the opinions of a treating physician or other treating providers 
ghanim credibility 
in assessing the credibility of a claimant testimony regarding subjective pain or the intensity of symptoms,the alj engages in a analysis.molina,at citing vasquez astrue,cir.first,the alj must determine whether the claimant has presented objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which could reasonably be expected to produce the pain or other symptoms alleged.vasquez,at.if the claimant meets the first test and there is no evidence of malingering,the alj can only reject the claimant testimony about the severity of the symptoms if she gives specific,clear and convincing reasons for the rejection.id.quoting lingenfelter astrue,cir general findings are insufficient rather,the alj must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant complaints.lester,at.
an alj may consider a range of factors in assessing credibility,including ordinary techniques of credibility evaluation,such as the claimant reputation for lying,prior inconsistent statements concerning the symptoms,and other testimony by the claimant that appears less than candid unexplained or inadequately explained failure to seek treatment or to follow a prescribed course of treatment and the claimant daily activities.smolen,at accord orn,at.when evidence reasonably supports either confirming or reversing the alj decision,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the alj.batson comm r of soc.sec,cir.
here,the alj determined that ghanim medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of the alleged symptoms however,ghanim statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible the alj provided several reasons for finding ghanim testimony not credible.
first,the alj rejected ghanim testimony because he found it inconsistent with the treatment records.in support of his conclusion,the alj cited treatment notes that discussed ghanim good eye contact,organized and logical thought content,and focused attention.these observations of cognitive functioning during therapy sessions do not contradict ghanim reported symptoms of depression and social anxiety.the alj also pointed to several portions of the treatment notes that describe ghanim as upbeat,smiling very brightly,and more talkative about positive things,and one note from blatchford expressing surprise at ghanim request for a caretaker.as explained,however,the treatment records must be viewed in light of the overall diagnostic record.see holohan,at,ryan,at.when read as a whole,the treatment notes do not undermine ghanim testimony.rather,they consistently reveal that,despite some occasional signs of improvement,ghanim continued to suffer frequent nightmares,hallucinations,social anxiety,difficulty sleeping,and feelings of hopelessness.
next,the alj rejected ghanim testimony as inconsistent with dees and mcduffee examining evaluations.the alj recited facts from the examining physicians evaluations about ghanim cognitive capabilities and his generally pleasant demeanor.first,the alj reliance on mcduffee and dees observations about cognitive functioning is misplaced ghanim primarily testified that nightmares,insomnia,social anxiety,and depression not any cognitive impairments caused him difficulty.second,the alj improperly some of dees characterizations of ghanim rapport and demeanor instead of considering these factors in the context of dees diagnoses and observations of impairment.see ryan,at holohan,at.for instance,dees also stated that ghanim appeared quite anxious at this time and endorse d symptoms of ptsd,and he diagnosed ghanim with depressive disorder nos,ptsd,anxiety disorder nos.
the alj also concluded that ghanim was not credible because his testimony conflicted with his own previous statements.first,the alj pointed to ghanim prior of social interactions.but ghanim did not testify that he never left his apartment or socialized rather,he testified that he often stayed home because he did not like to interact with people and that he relied heavily on one friend.this testimony is consistent with his prior,which reflect only limited socializing,often with a few friends who assisted with his chores the alj also found ghanim not credible because he sometimes but not always requested an interpreter.ghanim periodic need for a translator does not impugn his credibility as ghanim testified,when he is particularly anxious or aggravated,understanding english becomes more difficult.this explanation is borne out by the record.his treating providers indicated that stress impacts his cognitive functioning and specifically noted that he reported difficulty speaking english when under stress.finally,the alj discounted ghanim testimony because he received unemployment benefits after the alleged onset date of his disability.continued receipt of unemployment benefits does cast doubt on a claim of disability,as it shows that an applicant holds himself out as capable of working.see copeland.bowen,cir.but here,ghanim actually declined unemployment benefits within about a month of his onset date rather than undercut his claim of disability,this prompt refusal of unemployment benefits supports it.
next,the alj found ghanim not credible based on his daily activities.enga
