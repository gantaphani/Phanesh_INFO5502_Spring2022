plaintiff david draegert appeals from a judgment of the united states district court for the western district of new york,richard arcara,judge,dismissing his complaint seeking disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act.the district court granted the motion of defendant commissioner of social security commissioner for judgment on the pleadings,ruling that there was substantial evidence to support the commissioner denial of benefits on the ground that draegert had transferable work skills acquired in his prior job,which enabled him to perform substantial gainful activity.on appeal,draegert argues principally that the commissioner did not meet her burden of proving that he possessed transferable skills,within the meaning of the social security regulations,rather than merely certain abilities or aptitudes.for the reasons that follow,we agree that the commissioner did not meet her burden.we therefore reverse and remand for the commissioner to calculate draegert disability benefits.
background 
the fundamental facts are not in dispute.draegert had a general equivalency high school diploma and had received vocational training as a security safety officer.from until,he worked as a security safety officer at a mental health facility.his responsibilities there included patrolling the grounds,on foot and in a vehicle,in order to protect the residents from trespassers and other hazards,and maintaining fire safety by checking equipment.on occasion,he extinguished small fires and made criminal arrests for trespassing and disorderly conduct.
in march,draegert retired.he was years of age and suffered from coronary artery disease,for which he had undergone surgery.in march,he applied to the social security administration ssa for disability benefits.his application was denied initially and on reconsideration,following which a hearing was held before an ssa administrative law judge alj.at the hearing,draegert described the responsibilities he had had as a security safety officer at the mental health facility,which included those described above,as well as a certain amount of lifting that required medium exertion.he testified that as a result of his heart condition and a debilitating arthritic condition,inter alia,he could no longer perform the duties of that position.
as draegert was a person of advanced age,or older,d,the alj called a vocational expert ve to give an opinion not only as to whether draegert could perform his old job but also as to the transferability of his work skills to new jobs.as the skills draegert acquire d from his past relevant work,hearing transcript tr.at,the ve listed the following 
the ability to learn and apply rules and procedures,which are sometimes hard to understand.the ability to use reason and judgement in dealing with all kinds of people.the ability to think clearly and react quickly in an emergency.the ability to keep physically fit.and the ability to make conclusions based on facts and on one personal judgment 
and the ability to change easily and frequently from one activity to another.
the alj asked the ve to assume that draegert had the residual functional capacity either for sedentary work or for light work except that involving frequent climbing,balancing,stooping,kneeling,crouching,or crawling,see tr,and to opine a whether there were any jobs in the economy that draegert could do,and b whether the skills that draegert acquired in his past relevant work are transferable to the jobs identified by the ve,tr.the ve identified two such jobs,to wit,gate guard,a position,and dispatcher,a sedentary position.for each of those positions,the ve testified that draegert would require months of training.
in a decision dated december,alj decision,the alj ruled that draegert was not entitled to disability benefits.the alj found that the medical evidence establishes the existence of severe impairments,to wit,status post bypass surgery,arthritis in his left hip,coronary artery disease,and hypertension,alj decision at,and that b ecause of the job prolonged standing and walking,the claimant is unable to perform his past relevant work,as it exceeds his residual functional capacity,alj decision at.see also id.at,draegert can not perform his past relevant work as a security safety officer.
however,the alj found that the record did not support draegert position that those impairments prevented him from engaging in substantial gainful activity.id.at.relying on the ve testi mony that there were jobs within the claimant maximum residual functio na l capacity to which the claimant acquired work skills could be transferred with very little adjustment,the alj concluded that draegert had transferable skills and the residual functional capacity for light work,id.at,although he was limited in his ability to climb,balance,stoop,kneel,crouch and crawl,id.at.the alj found that 
t he claimant has acquired work skills that are transferable to the semiskilled work functions of other work 
although the claimant additional nonexertional postural limitations and his ability to do prolonged walking or continuous standing may not allow him to perform the full range of light work,using vocational rule as a framework for decisionmaking,there are nonetheless a significant number of jobs in the national economy and in the sic western new york which he could perform,using skills acquired from his past relevant work.examples of such jobs are gate guard,there being such jobs in the national economy,and in the region and dispatcher,there being million such jobs in the national economy,and such jobs in the western new york region.
considering the claimant residual functional capacity for light work,his age,education,and work experience within the framework of section of regulations and rule,table,of appendix,subpart p,regulations,the undersigned finds that the claimant is not disabled.
alj decision at.the alj concluded that draegert was not under a disability,as defined in the social security act,at any time through the date of this decision,id.at,and denied his claim for benefits.the ssa appeals counsel denied review.
draegert commenced the present action in the district court seeking review of the denial of benefits,contending principally that the commissioner erred in considering the abilit ies identified by the ve as vocational skills.the parties stipulated that,from an exertional standpoint,draegert retained the residual functional capacity to perform the full range of either light or sedentary work,except for his inability to walk for prolonged periods,to stand continuously,or to climb,balance,stoop,kneel,crouch,and crawl they conceded that the only issue was whether the commissioner had properly found that draegert possessed transferable skills that enabled him to perform other substantial gainful activity existing in the national economy.each side moved for judgment on the pleadings the motions were referred to magistrate judge leslie foschio for report and recommendation.
in a report and recommendation dated march,magistrate report or report,the magistrate judge recommended that the district court grant the motion of the commissioner and deny that of draegert.the report stated that 
draegert skills identified by the vocational expert include the abilities to learn and apply rules and procedures which are sometimes hard to understand use reason and judgment in dealing with all kinds of people,think clearly and react quickly in an emergency keep physically fit and make conclusions based on facts and on one personal judgment.the regulations do not define the terms skills,abilities,aptitudes or traits.however,some guidance is provided in social security ruling,which defines a skill as 
knowledge of a work activity which requires the exercise of significant judgment that goes beyond the carrying out of simple job duties and is acquired through performance of an occupation which is above the unskilled level requires more than days to learn.it is practical and familiar knowledge of the principles and processes of an art,science or trade,combined with the ability to apply them in practice in proper and approved manner.this includes activities like making precise measurements,reading blueprints,and setting up and operating complex machinery.a skill gives a person a special advantage over unskilled workers in the labor market.
magistrate report at footnote omitted.stating further that what may otherwise be considered as abilities or aptitudes may constitute skills if they are enhanced by specific work experience,id.at internal quotation marks omitted,the magistrate judge stated that 
draegert abilities are neither so vague,nor vocationally insignificant that they are merely traits.rather,draegert abilities are described in such a way as to indicate that they have been enhanced by his experience as a security safety officer.for example,in draegert past work,he patrolled the grounds of a psychiatric center to ensure the safety of the residents.in that job,draegert had arrested people for trespassing and for disorderly conduct,indicating that draegert had successfully dealt with people who posed a threat to others.draegert also occasionally had to break up altercations between residents,demonstrating that draegert had acquired the ability to subdue mental health patients.draegert was also responsible for maintaining fire safety equipment and had participated in extinguishing several fires in his previous job.although many people in the general population may possess certain traits rendering the m better suited for a job as a security safety officer at a mental health facility,such as patience with those who are mentally disabled,and in situations involving danger,the court finds that such traits would require enhancement before an individual would be allowed to work in such a position,and that such traits would be further enhanced after working as a security safety officer for fifteen years as draegert did.that draegert received specific training before he was allowed to work as a security safety officer further supports this finding.
on this record,the court finds the alj did not err in considering draegert abilities identified by the vocational expert as skills.

in an order dated june,the district court,over draegert objections,adopted the report proposed findings and recommendations and granted judgment in favor of the commissioner.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
on appeal,draegert contends principally that,because he was a person of advanced age,once it was determined a that he was no longer employed,b that he suffered from severe impairments that had lasted more than one year,and c that he was no longer capable of performing his prior work,he was entitled to an award of disability benefits because the commissioner failed to carry her burden of proving that he had vocational skills that were transferable to other jobs.for the reasons that follow,we agree.
title ii of the social security act the act provides that the term disability means an inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.d a.for purposes of this provision,an individual may be determined to be under a disability only if his impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.d a.
ssa regulations establish a process by which the commissioner is required to evaluate a claim for disability benefits.see,bowen yuckert,d bush shalala,cir.in essence,if the commissioner determines that the claimant is not working,that he has a severe impairment,that the impairment is not one that conclusively requires a determination of disability,and that the claimant is not capable of continuing in his prior type of work,the commissioner must find him disabled if there is not another type of work the claimant can do.see id.b f id.part,subpt.p,app.although the claimant bears the general burden of proving that he is disabled under the statute,if the claimant shows that his impairment renders him unable to perform his past work,the burden then shifts to the commissioner to show there is other gainful work in the national economy which the claimant could perform.carroll secretary of health and human services,cir.
in order to take into account the effect of a claimant age and work experience on his ability to engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work,ssa regulations provide that 
i f you are of advanced age age or older,and you have a severe impairment s that limits you to sedentary or light work,we will find that you can not make an adjustment to other work unless you have skills that you can transfer to other skilled or semiskilled work that you can do despite your impairment s.we will decide if you have transferable skills as follows if you are of advanced age but have not attained age,and you have a severe impairment s that limits you to no more than light work,we will apply the rules in paragraphs d through d of this section to decide if you have skills that are transferable to skilled or semiskilled light work see b.
d emphases in original.the ssa table of guidelines grid rules requires that a claimant of advanced age who is at least a high school graduate,who previously held a skilled or job that he can no longer perform but who has the residual functional capacity to perform light work,is not to be found disabled if he has job skills that are transferable but must be found disabled if he does not.see pt,subpt.p,app,rules.
the paragraphs d through d rules referred to in d describe transferability as follows 
what we mean by transferable skills.we consider you to have skills that can be used in other jobs,when the skilled or work activities you did in past work can be used to meet the requirements of skilled or work activities of other jobs or kinds of work.this depends largely on the similarity of occupationally significant work activities among different jobs.
how we determine skills that can be transferred to other jobs.transferability is most probable and meaningful among jobs in which 
i the same or a lesser degree of skill is required 
ii the same or similar tools and machines are used and 
iii the same or similar raw materials,products,processes,or services are involved.
degrees of transferability.there are degrees of transferability of skills ranging from very close similarities to remote and incidental similarities among jobs.a complete similarity of all three factors is not necessary for transferability.however,when skills are so specialized or have been acquired in such an isolated vocational setting like many jobs in mining,agriculture,or fishing that they are not readily usable in other industries,jobs,and work settings,we consider that they are not transferable.
d.although the term skill is not defined in these regulations,it is elucidated in an ssa ruling that is designed to explain the concepts of skills and transferability of skills and to clarify how these concepts are used in disability evaluation,ssr,work skills and their transferability as intended by the expanded vocational factors regulations ssr or ss ruling,wl,at.ssr,states in part,as follows 
skills and their transferability relate to work experience in the definition of disability and to people abilities to do occupations different from those they did before becoming impaired 
a.what a skill is.a skill is knowledge of a work activity which requires the exercise of significant judgment that goes beyond the carrying out of simple job duties and is acquired through performance of an occupation which is above the unskilled level requires more than days to learn.it is practical and familiar knowledge of the principles and processes of an art,science or trade,combined with the ability to apply them in practice in a proper and approved manner.this includes activities like making precise measurements,reading blueprints,and setting up and operating complex machinery.a skill gives a person a special advantage over unskilled workers in the labor market.
