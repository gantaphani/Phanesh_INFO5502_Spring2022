per concurring opinion of gajarsa,circuit judge.
a veterans association and individual veterans challenge regulations of the department of veterans affairs department,that implement the veterans health care eligibility reform act of act,codified at et.they assert that the regulations deny veterans due process,are inconsistent with the act,and are arbitrary,capricious and an abuse of discretion.we reject these contentions and deny the petition for review.
the act directs the department to establish and operate an annual patient enrollment system for providing hospital and medical care to veterans.the act provides for the annual enrollment of individual veterans based upon the veteran application and the assignment of the veteran to one of seven specified priority categories.
the first three categories cover veterans with various degrees of disabilities.a.the fourth category is for v eterans who are in receipt of increased pension based on need of regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound and other veterans who are catastrophically disabled.a.the fifth category is for veterans who are not within one of the first four categories and are unable to defray the expenses of necessary care as defined by a.a.the sixth category covers veterans not within the first five categories and who meet specified criteria,including discharge for a disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty,receipt of a purple heart,service in the mexican border period or world war i,or who were exposed to a toxic substance,radiation,or other conditions,as provided elsewhere in the statute.a.the seventh category is for veterans not covered by the preceding categories and for whom the department determines that medical care is needed.a.the statute provides that medical care will be provided to the categories in the order listed.a.
the act requires the department to maintain its capacity to provide for the specialized treatment and rehabilitative needs of disabled veterans including veterans with spinal cord dysfunction,blindness,amputations,and mental illness within distinct programs or facilities of the department that are dedicated to the specialized needs of those veterans in a manner that a affords those veterans reasonable access to care and services for those specialized needs,and b ensures that overall capacity of the department to provide such services is not reduced below the capacity of the department,nationwide,to provide those services,as of the date of enactment.b.
on july,the department published a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement the act and invited public comments on the proposed rules.july.
on october,the department published the final rules,which were codified at.the regulations cover the enrollment and disenrollment process the medical benefits package which describes the hospital care and medical services that will be provided to enrolled veterans and the procedure for announcing which priority categories will be enrolled for the ensuing annual period,based on the department financial projections.at.the final rule includes extensive discussion of the comments received and explains the changes made and not made in response to those comments.
at that time,the department announced that it would enroll all seven priority categories of veterans for the period october,through september,unless it had to change this determination by subsequent rulemaking announcement.at.
subsequently,the department published an amended directive,vha directive catastrophically disabled veteran evaluation,directive,that provides guidance on the process by which a veteran can request a review and be evaluated for catastrophically disabled cd status.directive includes sample letters for notifying veterans of an outcome of a catastrophically disabled evaluation or the fact that a catastrophically disabled evaluation could not be completed based on the information in the veteran medical records and how to schedule an appointment for a catastrophically disabled examination.directive also summarizes the right of a veteran who disagrees with the department evaluation either to seek reconsideration of a denied claim for benefits under or appeal directly to the board of veterans appeals pursuant to.the directive states that it expires april.
the petition for review challenging the regulations is filed by eastern paralyzed veterans associations,and two of its members.we have jurisdiction over the petition under,c.disabled am.veterans gober.
the petition states that the association two thousand members have sustained spinal cord injuries or have spinal cord dysfunction,and that the two members are catastrophically disabled,have paraplegia and use a wheelchair.except in the discussion of standing in this part,we refer to the petitioners collectively as the association.
the petitioners have presented a plethora of challenges to numerous provisions of the regulations.many of them are insubstantial and do not require individual analysis.we consider below only those contentions that are sufficiently substantial to warrant discussion.
before doing so,however,we address the association standing to maintain this proceeding.the government does not challenge such standing.but since standing involves constitutional limitations on jurisdiction,specifically whether the plaintiff has made out a case or controversy between himself and the defendant within the meaning of art.iii,warth seldin,d,we deem it appropriate to address the issue.
an association has standing when a its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right b the interests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization purpose and c neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.hunt washington apple adver.comm n,d.the association seeks to protect the interests of paralyzed veterans in receiving medical care.this is germane to the purposes of the association which,as a chapter of the paralyzed veterans of america,seeks to assure its members proper and dignified health care.plaintiff petition.the association has alleged that two of its members who are also petitioners in this action,have been incorrectly placed by the department in category seven instead of category four.accordingly,the association has demonstrated that some of its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.finally,as shown below,the association challenges to the department regulations do not require the participation of individual members.
thus,the association has standing to mount its challenges to the regulations.
the association contends that the regulations deny veterans procedural due process because they a do not provide veterans with a meaningful opportunity to participate in the determination of their priority group,and do not tell them b the priority categories in which they have been placed upon enrollment,and c their right to challenge an adverse decision.
a.a veteran seeking to enroll for medical benefits is required to file an application on va form,captioned application for health benefits.this is a,relatively simple form calling for a variety of information,including fourteen questions that the veteran is to answer by circling yes or no.one of these questions is do you have a spinal cord injury.although the form does not contain a space for the veteran to set forth additional information about his medical situation,the veteran presumably may attach to the form any additional relevant material.
the secretary amended directive provides guidance on the process by which a veteran can request a review and be evaluated for catastrophically disabled cd status and permits a veteran to request a catastrophically disabled examination,which will be scheduled and provided.directive.
the act requires the secretary to conduct an annual enrollment of veterans for medical care and to place each veteran in a particular priority category.the department procedure for doing so,which requires him to enroll and assign categories to a large number of veterans expeditiously,provides the veterans with procedural due process.mathews eldridge,d holding that administrative procedures prescribed by the secretary comport with procedural due process even though social security disability benefits are terminated before an evidentiary hearing is held goldberg kelly,d holding that due process requires an evidentiary hearing before terminating welfare assistance because termination of aid pending resolution of a controversy over eligibility may deprive an eligible recipient of the very means by which to live while he waits.
the secretary procedure gives a veteran a full and fair opportunity to make his case.he files a simple application form,may request an examination for catastrophic disability,is informed of his enrollment and his category and of his right to appeal an adverse decision to the board of veterans appeal.the secretary was not required further to give veterans an additional opportunity to participate in the decisional process before the veteran enrollment and priority classification were initially determined.mathews eldridge,at.written submissions adequate in social security disability benefits determination where t he detailed questionnaire which the state agency periodically sends the recipient identifies with particularity the information relevant to the entitlement decision,and the recipient is invited to obtain assistance from the local ssa office in completing the questionnaire.more importantly,the information critical to the entitlement decision usually is derived from medical sources,like the treating physician.
b.the n otification of enrollment status provision of the regulation states 
notice of a decision by a va network or facility director,or the chief network officer,regarding enrollment status will be provided to the affected veteran by letter and will contain the reasons for the decision.the letter will include an effective date for any changes and a statement regarding appeal rights.
d.the n otice of a decision regarding enrollment status includes not only notice whether the veteran has been enrolled but also notice of the priority category in which he has been placed.this is confirmed by the department comments when the rule was promulgated.
commenters asserted that the letter that va sends veterans concerning their enrollment status should indicate which priority group the veteran was placed in we intend to provide this information to enrolled veterans as soon as possible.
the department operating guidelines also indicate that veterans will be informed of their priority classification.directive includes sample letters for giving written notification to a veteran who requested catastrophically disabled cd evaluation.directive,attachments d and both sample letters state whether or not the veteran meet s the definition of a catastrophically disabled veteran for health care purposes.the sample letter for a veteran who is determined to be catastrophically disabled also states based on this determination,your enrollment priority group should change to priority group.official notification of any changes in your priority group will be sent in a separate letter.directive,attachment d.the sample letter for a veteran who is ruled to be not catastrophically disabled is to contain both the reasons for the decision and a summary of the evidence considered by the va advises the veteran how to seek reconsideration of th e decision advises the veteran how to appeal the decision to the board of veterans appeals and encloses the department form,notice of procedural and appellate rights.directive,attachment 
c.the governing statutes and regulations entitle a veteran to seek reconsideration of an adverse decision on entitlement or priority assignment and to appeal such decision to the board of veterans appeals.
the secretary states in his brief that p ursuant to,a veteran may request reconsideration of an initial vha classification determination,including a determination that the veteran did not meet the criteria to be classified as catastrophically disabled and that a veteran also has the option of immediately appealing the initial vha determination to the board of veterans appeals.section sets forth reconsideration procedures regarding claims for benefits administered by the veterans health administration.as noted,under the regulations the n otice of a n enrollment decision will include a statement regarding appeal rights.d.the department comments when the rule was promulgated state that veterans may appeal va decisions regarding enrollment and disenrollment to the board of veterans appeals and the court of veterans appeals.at.veterans have a statutory right to appeal to the board of veterans appeals any decision that affects the provision of benefits to veterans,a,including a veterans health administrative decision concerning enrollment.see also b the board appellate jurisdiction extends to questions of eligibility for hospitalization,outpatient treatment,and nursing home and domiciliary care and for other benefits administered by the veterans health administration.
as the secretary has recognized in his brief,the right of appeal covers a challenge to the priority category to which the veteran has been assigned.there is no reason to believe that the department will deny veterans the right to notice and to appeal that it has provided for in its regulations and pronouncements.
d.the association contends,however,that neither the secretary statements made in promulgating the regulations nor his directive implementing them may be properly considered in determining the constitutional validity of the regulations.in the association view,if the various procedures that the secretary has announced he will follow in administering the regulations are not themselves set forth in the regulations,the latter can not pass constitutional muster.
we disagree.the pertinent inquiry is the practical one whether,considering all the circumstances,the secretary regulations will provide veterans with a full and fair opportunity to present their claims to the secretary.the form in which the procedures to be followed are set in the regulations or in the secretary explanation and not the critical issue.the question is whether the totality of the situation provides the veterans with adequate notice of the judicial disposition of their claim and an adequate opportunity to challenge an adverse ruling.cleveland bd.of educ.loudermill,d the essential requirements of due process are notice and an opportunity to respond.morrissey brewer,d d ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.see also immigration and naturalization serv.ctr.for immigrants rights,d relying upon agency comments on a regulation to support the agency interpretation of that regulation.as we have shown,the regulations and the secretary explanation and implementation of them satisfy that standard.
the association argues that in defining catastrophic disability in the regulations,the department improperly narrowed the scope of priority category four,which the act defines as 
veterans who are in receipt of increased pensions based on a need of regular aid and attendance or by reason of being permanently housebound and other veterans who are catastrophically disabled.
a.the act does not define catastrophically disabled,and the regulations therefore filled this gap by defining that term 
c atastrophically disabled means to have a permanent severely disabling injury,disorder,or disease that compromises the ability to carry out the activities of daily living to such a degree that the individual requires personal or mechanical assistance to leave home or bed or requires constant supervision to avoid physical harm to self or others.this definition is met if an individual has been found by the chief of staff or equivalent clinical official at the va facility where the individual was examined to have a permanent condition enumerated in the regulation.
the association complains that the department definition improperly limited the statutory term catastrophically disabled by adding the requirements that the veterans condition be severely disabling and that it be permanent
