hattie dixon received a belated birthday present on may.on that date,the commissioner of social security determined,on dixon application,that she was disabled as of her birthday february,because then her age,combined with her serious medical condition,limited education,absence of transferable work skills,and ability to perform nothing more than sedentary work,earned her supplemental security income benefits under a guideline.prior to turning,dixon age was not a recognizable factor in deciding whether she was entitled to benefits,and dixon has been trying to get those benefits since when she stopped working.this case focuses,then,on a narrow question does substantial evidence support the commissioner conclusion that she was not disabled,as that term is defined by law,between and the day she turned in.
in the course of her long battle to secure disability benefits,dixon has had three hearings before administrative law judges aljs,two appeals to the social security appeals council,and two reviews by the district court.this is her first visit to this court.
there is no question that dixon is seriously ill.dixon claim that substantial evidence does not support the social security commissioner final decision that she was not disabled during the years prior to her birthday rests on three.first,dixon argues that,in conducting her third administrative hearing,administrative law judge patricia kelly failed to reasonably evaluate the opinions of dixon physicians.second,she argues that alj kelly erred in concluding that dixon could perform sedentary work as long as she was permitted to alternate between sitting and standing.third,dixon argues that the alj unreasonably concluded that dixon could perform a significant number of jobs in the economy despite her impairments.
dixon has a education and,before,did some work as a bus driver and machine operator.she stopped working in october of when she developed pain in the left part of her stomach.in december dixon first applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income,alleging that she was disabled as of september due to a kidney infection and high blood pressure.the social security administration denied dixon applications,and she began the review process.
although alj kelly decision after dixon third administrative hearing is the key matter before us,that decision drew on earlier decisions,so all,where pertinent,will be discussed.at dixon first administrative hearing in october,alj ronald bernoski considered testimony,from a vocational expert,that more than sedentary,unskilled jobs existed in the milwaukee area.after the hearing,in january,michael dawson examined dixon and noted complaints about her diabetes,high blood pressure,knee and back pain.he also assessed her ability to work,indicating that she could lift no more than pounds,could neither stand nor walk for more than hour in an hour workday,and could not sit for more than hours at a time.
alj bernoski issued a decision on april,determining that dixon was not disabled.in making this determination,bernoski found that dixon retained the residual functional capacity for the full range of sedentary work and that she could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.bernoski decision specifically rejected dawson assessment of dixon limited ability to work,noting that dawson physical examination did not reveal any significant abnormalities.the alj also noted that the exam results of dixon regular physicians failed to mention problems with her back or knees.
on august,the appeals council vacated the alj decision and remanded,finding that dixon ability to work was limited to jobs that allowed her to alternate between sitting and standing.dixon testified at a second administrative hearing before bernoski in november and said she took motrin for arthritis and insulin for diabetes.at that time,she also testified that she could stand for no more than minutes at a time,but that she could sit at a job with little difficulty.a vocational expert testified that jobs offering a option existed in the milwaukee area.relying on this evidence,bernoski issued a decision on december,again finding that dixon was not disabled.the appeals council denied dixon request for review,and bernoski finding became the commission er final decision.dixon requested judicial review in the eastern district of wisconsin.on september,the district court remanded,determining that substantial evidence did not support the commissioner final decision that dixon was not disabled 
alj patricia kelly conducted a third hearing in september of.dixon testified that she probably could perform jobs,such as receptionist work,that require little lifting and offer a option,as long as she was permitted to use the bathroom frequently,because when her condition acted up she had to answer the call of nature four or five times a day.on november,alj kelly issued a decision finding that dixon could perform sedentary work that provided a option and that she was therefore not disabled between september,and february.the appeals council found no basis for disturbing this decision.
dixon once again sought judicial review.the parties filed for summary judgment,and magistrate judge patricia gorence held that substantial evidence supported alj kelly decision.and that brings us here,on dixon appeal.
