in this appeal,we clarify a state obligations under the federal medicaid program when paying health centers for services they render to medicaid patients.see bb.
three lower counties community health services,a health center serving poor residents on the lower eastern shore of maryland,commenced this action against the state of maryland department of health and mental hygiene hereinafter maryland or department of health,the state agency that administers the medicaid program in maryland,to obtain a declaratory judgment that maryland violates the medicaid act in four respects maryland does not make fully compensatory supplemental payments at least as frequently as every four months to three lower counties,a health center,for healthcare services provided to medicaid patients maryland fails to compensate three lower counties for emergency healthcare services provided to medicaid patients who are enrolled with managed care organizations with which three lower counties does not have a contract maryland establishes a rate that managed care organizations must pay that is disadvantageous to health centers in providing services to medicaid patients and maryland delegates to managed care organizations the determination of whether supplemental payments are required to be paid to health centers.three lower counties also seeks injunctive relief to require the department of health to comply with the medicaid act in these respects.
the district court granted maryland motion for summary judgment on all four issues.for the reasons that follow,we reverse with respect to the first two issues and affirm with respect to the last two,and we remand this case to the district court to grant three lower counties appropriate relief.
three lower counties community health services,located in princess anne,maryland,has provided healthcare services since to the poor residents of somerset and wicomico counties,operating a community health center under the public health service act.three lower counties receives federal grant funds under of that act.to qualify for those funds,health centers must be located in a medically underserved area or serve a specially medically underserved population comprised of migratory and seasonal agricultural workers,the homeless,and residents of public housing.a.in addition,the public health service act requires that such health centers deny no patient healthcare services due to the patient inability to pay,see id.k g iii i,and,more pertinent to this litigation,that they provide healthcare services to medicaid enrollees,see id.k e.
the federal medicaid program provides federal financial assistance to states that choose to participate in the program and requires the states to reimburse healthcare providers who provide services to medicaid enrollees.the purpose of the medicaid program is to enable states to furnish medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent children whose income and resources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.states need not participate in the program,but if they choose to do so,they must implement and operate medicaid programs that comply with detailed federally mandated standards.antrican odom,cir.
one federal requirement is that a state medicaid plan provide payment for services rendered by health centers fqhcs.see a id.a c id.l.fqhcs are defined as health centers that receive,or meet the requirements for receiving,grants under of the public health service act.id.l.three lower counties is therefore not only a health center receiving funds under the public health service act but also,by definition,an fqhc receiving funds under the federal medicaid program.
from through,the federal medicaid program required states to reimburse fqhcs for percent of each fqhc costs which are reasonable.a c repealed.congress purpose in passing this percent reimbursement requirement was to ensure that health centers receiving funds under of the public health services act would not have to divert public health services act funds to cover the cost of serving medicaid patients.the report of the house budget committee accompanying the legislation describes this payment guarantee specifically as follows 
medicaid payment levels to health centers cover less than percent of the costs incurred by the centers in serving medicaid patients.the role of these health centers is to deliver comprehensive primary care services to underserved populations or areas without regard to ability to pay.to the extent that the medicaid program is not covering the cost of treating its own beneficiaries,it is compromising the ability of the centers to meet the primary care needs of those without any public or private coverage whatsoever.
to ensure that federal public health service act grant funds are not used to subsidize health center or program services to medicaid beneficiaries,states would be required to make payment for these fqhc services at percent of the costs which are reasonable and related to the cost of furnishing those services.

to relieve health centers from having to supply new cost data every year,congress amended the medicaid act in to implement a new prospective payment system based on average historical costs plus a factor.the new prospective payment system,which began with fiscal year,required state medicaid plans to provide for payment for such services provided by an fqhc in an amount calculated on a per visit basis that is equal to percent of the average of the costs of the center or clinic of furnishing such services during fiscal years and which are reasonable.bb.that is,under the new system,each health center reasonable costs for providing medicaid services for the years and were added together,and the sum was divided by the total number of visits by medicaid patients in those two years to obtain an average cost rate.this average cost rate for the years and became the baseline rate to be applied in all future years,adjusted by a index the medicare economic index and any change in the scope of services.see bb.
thus,to calculate a health center medicaid payment for each fiscal year beginning and thereafter,the average cost rate calculated for and is multiplied by the number of visits made by medicaid patients in the applicable fiscal year or later,adjusted by the index and for any change in the scope of services.while a health center costs for servicing medicaid enrollees is no longer audited every year,health centers must submit new visit data for each new year.
the maryland department of health has the responsibility of performing these calculations for each fqhc in,determining the center average cost per medicaid visit in and,applying the inflation factor,adjusting for any change in the scope of services,and multiplying that figure by the number of medicaid patient visits to the fqhc in the relevant period.maryland also has the responsibility of ensuring that the health center receive full payment for each medicaid visit,as required by the medicaid act.
there is an added twist in how fqhcs are compensated when a state,such as maryland,operates a managed care program for providing medicaid services.healthchoice,maryland medicaid managed care program,contracts on behalf of maryland with managed care organizations more commonly known as health maintenance organizations or hmos to arrange for the delivery of healthcare services to its medicaid enrollees.unless the managed care organization owns a hospital or clinic,it in turn contracts with healthcare providers,including fqhcs,to deliver the medical services to the medicaid patients.see generally regs.hereinafter comar.
when states,such as maryland,operate the medicaid program through managed care organizations,the contract between the managed care organization and the fqhc usually compensates the fqhc at an amount below that required by the medicaid act.but congress addressed this problem by requiring the states to pay fqhcs a supplemental or payment for the difference between what the managed care organization paid the fqhc and what the fqhc is entitled to be paid under the medicaid act 
in the case of services furnished by a health center pursuant to a contract between the center and a managed care entity,the state plan shall provide for payment to the center or clinic by the state of a supplemental payment equal to the amount if any by which the statutorily required rate exceeds the amount of the payments provided under the contract.
bb a.these supplemental payments shall be made in no case less frequently than every months.id.bb b.thus,even when a state relies upon a managed care system to administer its medicaid program,fqhcs are protected and must receive the full rate calculated pursuant to the methodology outlined in the medicaid act.
in short,under this scheme,an fqhc,such as three lower counties,receives a part of its medicaid payment from the managed care organization and the balance from maryland in the form of a supplemental or payment.
under the practice maryland has adopted,the department of health makes a portion of the supplemental payment in advance,labeling the prospective payment as an interim supplemental payment,and the remaining portion retrospectively,labeling the balance as a payment in reconciliation of the account.it makes the prospective payment every three months,at the beginning of each calendar quarter.because no services have yet been billed for the quarter,the interim supplemental payment is based on the health center historical data for the same quarter in the preceding year.see generally comar.according to three lower counties,the interim supplemental payment invariably fails to close the gap between the managed care organization payments and the amount to which fqhcs are entitled under the medicaid act.according to three lower counties,the shortfall is substantial.for the most recent quarter on which it presented data to the district court,the shortfall was on the order of.the department of health reconciles the shortfall or excess with the fqhc between six and nine months after the end of the quarter for which the interim supplemental payment was made.
under its procedures,maryland requires fqhcs to file their claims for services rendered to medicaid patients with the patient managed care organization.see comar a.it gives fqhcs up to nine months to submit those claims.id.after the fqhc has submitted a claim to a managed care organization,the managed care organization validates and processes the claim and then transmits the claim information to maryland department of health.the department of health totals the number of visits to any particular fqhc over a period and determines whether the interim supplemental payment closed the gap between what the managed care organization paid and what the statutory rate requires.as may be necessary,the department of health makes a reconciliation payment or applies a charge when there has been an overpayment.this is accomplished within months of the end of the accounting period.see generally comar.maryland claims that it waits this long in order to accommodate the period it gives healthcare providers to file claims and to give the managed care organizations time to validate,process,and transmit the claims to the department of health.
three lower counties claims that maryland practices in paying for services provided to medicaid patients results in a substantial and accumulating debt owed by maryland to reconcile its account with three lower counties.three lower counties states that by december,for medical and dental services,it had a cash receivable of.the amount grew to by the end of december.by the end of december,the amount was.according to three lower counties,the cash receivables from the state have amounted to about of its annual revenue and is denying three lower counties much needed cash,preventing the health center from adding approximately six physicians.
three lower counties commenced this action against the department of health seeking a declaratory judgment that the department of health is violating the medicaid act and injunctive relief to require the department of health to comply with the act.three lower counties contends specifically that maryland is not complying with the medicaid act in four respects to reimburse three lower counties,it uses an interim payment system with subsequent reconciliation,creating deficiencies that extend beyond four months,in violation of bb it refuses to reimburse three lower counties for services provided to medicaid enrollees in need of emergency care it requires managed care organizations to pay three lower counties a higher rate than that charged to,thereby deterring managed care organizations from contracting with three lower counties and it requires three lower counties to submit claims for payment to the patients managed care organization rather than to the department of health directly.on for summary judgment,the district court entered judgment in favor of the department of health on all four issues.this appeal followed.
for its principal argument on appeal,three lower counties contends that maryland fails to comply with bb of the medicaid act by not making fully compensatory supplemental payments at least every four months.it argues that maryland interim payments result in inaccurate approximations of what is owed to three lower counties,creating deficiencies that extend far beyond four months.
maryland agrees that bb requires that supplemental payments be made at least every four months,but maryland notes that the medicaid act does not specify the maximum amount of time between the supplemental payment and the service to which it relates.it argues that it meets the frequency requirement by making interim supplemental payments and that it is free to reconcile any deficiency at a later time because the frequency of payments required by bb is not tied to the date when the services were provided to the medicaid patient.maryland thus contends that because it makes a payment every four months,it meets its obligations.
the district court,in ruling in favor of maryland,did not address the text of bb.rather,the court reasoned that it would be too administratively burdensome for the department of health to make a fully compensatory supplemental payment to fqhcs at least once every four months.the court explained,in view of the current realities of medicaid administration,it would seem impossible for the department of health to supply payment in the manner three lower counties insists is required by statute.in essence,the district court recognized a burdensomeness defense to the requirements imposed by bb.
we begin with the text,for the supreme court has stated time and again,notwithstanding the administrative complexities of implementing a federal program,courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.connecticut national bank germain,d.when the statutory language is plain,the sole function of the least where the disposition required by the text is not to enforce it according to its terms.arlington cent.sch.dist.bd.of educ.murphy,d internal quotation marks omitted.
section bb a provides that a state must make a supplemental payment to the fqhc equal to the amount if any by which the rate exceeds the amount of the payments provided under the managed care contract.emphasis added.moreover,states must make these fully compensatory payments in no case less frequently than every four months.bb b.the operative language of the statute for this case are the words equal to.the supplemental payment must be equal to the difference between the payment made by the managed care organization and the rate fixed by the medicaid act.thus,the statute plainly provides that a state must make fully compensatory supplemental payments no less frequently than every four months.
maryland method for compensating fqhcs,and three lower counties in particular,is inconsistent with these requirements.maryland interim supplemental payments are not fully compensatory,but only approximations of full supplemental payments,and maryland acknowledges that its interim supplemental payments are usually insufficient,requiring later reconciliation payments.indeed,three lower counties argues that maryland interim supplemental payments a
