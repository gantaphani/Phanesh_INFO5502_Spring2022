robert lary,lary seeks review of the decision of the merit systems protection board board in,denying his petition for enforcement of a prior settlement agreement with the united states postal service the usps.because we hold that the usps breached the settlement agreement by not providing needed documents in a timely fashion and that the breach was material,we vacate the board decision and remand for entry of a decree of specific performance and an order of back pay and other relief consistent with this opinion.
background 
lary,a longtime employee of the usps,suffers from obstructive sleep apnea,a disorder that affects his breathing and thereby disrupts his sleep,often causing excessive drowsiness.as a consequence of this disorder,lary was frequently late for his job as a tour window technician at the benson united states postal station in omaha,nebraska.
on february,the usps issued lary a notice of proposed removal charging him with unacceptable to maintain a regular work.on march,lary was removed from his position effective march.pursuant to b,lary had until one year after his effective termination date,or march,to file a disability retirement application with the office of personnel management opm.
on or about april,lary appealed his removal to the board,charging the usps with violating the americans with disabilities act of,and the family and medical leave act of.on july,the parties entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement,pursuant to which lary agreed to withdraw with prejudice his appeal and all other claims filed,never to seek or accept reinstatement to the usps,and to accept a removal for medical inability to perform his job duties due to sleep apnea.
the usps made a number of return promises in the agreement.it agreed to vacate the march,decision letter removing lary and the earlier notice of proposed removal,and it agreed that those documents would be removed expunged from lary official personnel folder and all other official files of the agency.resp t app.the usps also agreed to issue a new ps form that will indicate medical inability to perform as the reason for lary removal.id.crucially,the usps agreed to provide lary three documents in connection with lary application for disability retirement within two weeks of the execution of the settlement.id.at emphasis added.those documents were the supervisor statement,the agency certification of reassignment and accommodation efforts and the disability retirement checklist.under the disability retirement regulations,these three documents are required in order to determine whether the individual meets the eligibility requirements set forth in.a see also opm standard form,documentation in support of disability retirement application,available at.gov forms html sf.asp requiring the forms as part of the disability retirement application process.
the usps thus agreed to provide lary,in the documents,with the statements necessary for lary to meet the eligibility requirements of,including that the applicant was being removed for medical reasons that accommodation efforts had been futile that lary performance was deficient and that the deficiency in lary performance was expected to continue indefinitely.see.the parties agreed to cooperate and communicate in good faith to implement the terms of the settlement.pursuant to c i,the board accepted the settlement agreement into the appellate record and retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreement.
the usps,as called for in the settlement agreement,issued a new ps form indicating medical inability to perform as the reason for removal.however,it is undisputed that the usps did not provide the three documents in connection with lary disability retirement application within two weeks of the settlement agreement,as provided for by the agreement.in fact,the agency did not provide the three documents,completely and correctly filled out,until may,well after the march,deadline for lary disability retirement application,and after lary counsel had contacted the usps several times to request the documents.
ultimately the usps itself filed lary disability retirement application with opm,but this was not until may.on august,opm rejected the application by letter because it was filed more than one year from lary separation on march.lary did not seek review of opm decision.however,on july,lary filed a petition for enforcement with the board,alleging that the usps had breached its obligations under the settlement agreement.
the administrative judge aj rejected all of lary claims.the aj held that the usps failure to provide the needed documents in a timely fashion was not material because lary was ultimately responsible for prosecuting his retirement application and,under opm regulations,he could have filed an incomplete application with opm before expiration of the deadline and that application would still have been timely.the aj also rejected lary claim that the usps violated the terms of the settlement agreement when,in the new ps form,the usps referenced the first board decision,which,in turn,had made reference to lary being removed for reasons.the aj reasoned that the settlement agreement did not contain language precluding the usps from referencing the first board action.
lary appealed the aj decision to the full board,and an equally divided board affirmed.board member sapin dissented,urging that the usps had materially breached the agreement because it had prevented lary from timely applying for disability retirement benefits,which was the essential purpose of the settlement agreement.pet r app.at.addressing the question whether lary unreasonably delayed in filing his application,board member sapin reasoned that the agency did nothing to inform lary that he alone was responsible for making the deadline and that lary reasonably believed that the agency would file his application for him.lary timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the board decision must be affirmed unless it is found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation or unsupported by substantial evidence.c yates merit.prot.a settlement agreement is a contract,and its construction is a question of law which this court reviews de novo.conant office of pers.the question whether a breach of a contract is material is a mixed question of law and fact.gilbert dep t of justice.at the same time,w here,as here,the facts are undisputed,the determination of whether there has been material with the terms of a contract necessarily reduces to a question of law.id.at.
we first consider whether there was a material breach of the settlement agreement.that there was a breach is clear,and the government itself does not dispute this fact.the government failed to provide the three documents referenced in the agreement within the specified timeframe.thus the question becomes whether the breach was material.
in determining materiality courts often look to whether the breached obligation is an important part of the contract.see thomas dep t of hous.and urban,a breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance,or goes to the essence of the contract.citing arthur corbin,corbin on contracts.here the government failure to timely provide the three documents was central to the settlement agreement.the agreement expressly stated that the usps would complete the required documents in connection with lary application for disability retirement.resp t app.at.the documents were the very same ones that opm required the usps to complete before lary application could be considered complete.see opm standard form,documentation in support of disability retirement application,available at.opm.gov forms html sf.asp listing the forms as required.under these circumstances it is clear that the government breached an important obligation.
