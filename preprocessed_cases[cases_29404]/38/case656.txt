this case,which involves disputes about the medical services that arkansas provides to needy children,returns to this court following two prior appeals and remands for further proceedings.in its first appeal,the arkansas department of human services adhs challenged a district court injunction that forced it to keep its child health management services chms program as part of its state medicaid plan.we held that,pursuant to the medicaid act,children had an enforceable right to early and periodic screening,diagnosis,and treatment epsdt services.pediatric specialty care.dep t of human,cir hereinafter pediatric i.we reversed the injunction,however,to the extent that it required adhs to continue the chms program as part of its state plan.id.at.so long as the state continued to pay for services when prescribed by a doctor,we reasoned,the state fulfilled its obligations under the medicaid act.id.at.we then remanded for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court considered the plaintiffs procedural and substantive due process claims.the district court held that adhs violated the procedural due process rights of the plaintiffs by attempting to change the chms program without first conducting a study about the effect such a change would have on the efficiency,economy,quality of care,and access to care,as required by a a.it further held that adhs had engaged in conscience shocking behavior by trying to reduce medical services to needy children based on political and fiscal motivations.on appeal,we affirmed the district court ruling on the plaintiffs procedural due process claim.pediatric specialty care.dep t of human,cir hereinafter pediatric ii.as to the substantive due process claim,however,we held that adhs attempt to move chms services for cost savings was not conscience shocking,and thus reversed the district court contrary holding.id.at.we again remanded for further proceedings.
on remand,the district court considered,among other things,damages claims against kurt knickrehm,ray hanley,and roy jeffus,all current or past supervisors of adhs knickrehm,hanley,and jeffus moved for summary judgment,asserting they were entitled to qualified immunity.adhs contended that it was entitled to absolute immunity under the eleventh amendment because it was an agency of the state of arkansas.the district court granted the motion as to knickrehm,but denied it as to hanley and jeffus.although its order expressly disposed of all of the defendants other summary judgment claims,it was silent regarding adhs eleventh amendment argument.
on appeal,hanley and jeffus contend that the district court erred in denying their claim for summary judgment based on qualified immunity.adhs argues that the district court erred in failing to grant it summary judgment based on eleventh amendment immunity.we find no error in the district court conclusion that hanley and jeffus are not entitled to summary judgment on this basis.on adhs eleventh amendment claim,we agree that it must be dismissed from the suit as an agency of the state.our review of the record,however,indicates that the plaintiffs have sought prospective injunctive relief from adhs by suing its directors,and adhs has admitted that its officials can be sued for the purpose of seeking prospective injunctions.thus,we affirm in part,but direct the district court on remand to dismiss adhs from the suit.
background 
much of the background of this dispute has been recounted in our prior opinions of pediatric i and pediatric ii,and will not be fully restated here.the plaintiffs include medical clinics that provide epsdt services to special needs children in arkansas and recipients of those services.the services are provided for the purpose of increasing the functional levels of developmentally impaired children.these services have been offered in arkansas through the chms model,which extends diagnostic and evaluative services,pediatric day treatment,and various therapies to children from six months to six years of age.pediatric ii,at.
over the past several years,adhs has tried to curtail its payments for chms services.in november of,adhs issued a press release stating that it would restructure the chms program,terminating day treatment and therapeutic programs,resulting in a savings of several million dollars.as relevant to this appeal,the plaintiffs have alleged that hanley,jeffus,and the adhs employed a system requiring prior authorization for chms services solely for reasons without consideration of the medical necessity of the services.
the prior authorization regime was operated by arkansas foundation for medical care afmc,an independent organization that contracted to provide this service to adhs.beginning in july of afmc was presented with applications for chms services,and was tasked with determining whether the requested services were medically necessary based on a review of the child medical records.first,a nurse reviewer received a chms provider request for prior authorization.if the nurse reviewer did not approve the plan,it was sent to a physician reviewer.if the physician reviewer denied the services,the provider could ask for reconsideration,and the plan would be reviewed by a second physician.nurse reviewers may not override a doctor decision to recommend services.
at some point while hanley was director,he changed the prior authorization process so that the afmc would review not only whether the service requested was of a medically necessary type,but also inquire as to the medically necessary amount of the service.this essentially led to a wholesale reduction in chms services from six hours per day,per child to no more than three and to four hours per day,per child.
the plaintiffs presented evidence from their expert,sharon ramey.ramey testified that six hours per day of services is most effective for needy children.the district court believed that ramey testimony,taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs,raised an inference that the prior authorization procedure reduction in chms services was based on considerations other than the medical necessity of the children.
john whitaker was a doctor reviewer who worked for afmc.he testified that afmc used guidelines that only permitted nurses to approve up to three and hours of chms services for children.he stated that he would not generally approve six hours of chms services for a child because,in his view,a child could not be expected to get beneficial results for more than four hours per day of a chms program.he further testified that,at the request of nurse supervisor amy carson,he had developed what he termed rote denials or canned denials,which were denial letters that nurses were supposed to use for certain types of claims that were easily disposed of.
according to whitaker,it came to his attention in december of that one of afmc nurse reviewers,tilerra coats,was reducing chms services far greater than she should have been,and misusing his denial codes.whitaker began to institute quality control on coats work,randomly checking the entire file in which she would recommend reduced services.on each occasion,whitaker subsequently approved the child for more care than coats had.in some instances,despite whitaker direction,the ultimate decision was not changed,and the child would receive less care than whitaker had authorized.whitaker also discovered that coats was often altering his approvals to provide less service to the children.whitaker brought this problem to the attention of carson,coats supervisor,but nothing was done to correct matters.in fact,when whitaker audited some of his past charts,he noticed that carson had actually signed off on charts that coats had altered.on further inquiry,carson had written on a number of these files what she believed was the rationale for the files not accurately reflecting the services approved by whitaker.most often her explanation was merely her own opinion stating that she did not believe the services were necessary,or supporting coats opinion to that effect.neither coats,carson,nor any other nurse,however,is permitted to change a physician recommendations for chms services.whitaker also discovered that some of his charts had been altered in a manner that made the children under review appear not to qualify for either the extent or degree of services he approved.when whitaker sought an explanation for this,written notes on at least one of his charts indicated that his authorized service was not given because the directive i received from adhs was to only approve unit of per day.whitaker dep.at.
whitaker was also informed that coats was other nurses work,and would often change the recommendations to approve fewer services for the children.in these instances,coats would typically erase the prior nurse review so that it looked like hers was the only review.whitaker was not aware of any instance in which a nurse reviewer,either intentionally or mistakenly,increased the amount of services approved over what a physician had recommended.whitaker eventually reported this wrongdoing to susan keathley,who brought it to the attention of moody,the medical director for afmc.
brenda gassaway is a registered nurse who was formerly employed as a nurse reviewer by afmc.she began working for afmc on april,and was fired on july.gassaway stated that she knew about the problem of coats changing doctors files as early as january of.gassaway had been passing on this information to her supervisor,carson,for a year and a half.carson told gassaway that they would have to handle matters carefully because coats and kenya harbin,director of the review department,were close friends.
in early july of,gassaway was called into a meeting with harbin and susie moore,the director of human resources.the meeting concerned whitaker claims of nurse wrongdoing.according to gassaway,moody sent the matter back to harbin for investigation,and she then interviewed each of the nurse reviewers to determine who had helped whitaker discover the altered files.gassaway denied involvement,but told harbin that she knew coats was altering doctors decisions.harbin responded that they had reviewed the matter and found those allegations unsubstantiated.at that point,gassaway concluded that the sole purpose of the meeting was to determine if whitaker had acted inappropriately in auditing coats work and if anyone had helped him.eventually,harbin accused gassaway of copying charts for whitaker,which gassaway continued to deny.as the meeting concluded,gassaway again told harbin to correct afmc wrongdoings.harbin response was to tell gassaway not to discuss the meeting with anyone else gassaway was fired a week later for insubordination and failure to follow the chain of command.
when asked at his deposition about how afmc interacts with chms providers,moody stated that afmc regularly puts out memos to assist chms providers in knowing what kind of documentation is required.gassaway disagreed 
no,that was not the truth.the truth is no matter what chms providers ask for you do give it to them ever until they beg for it,and then you show up with someone who does know so that you can say,the person you need is not here.that the truth.
gassaway dep.at.
gassaway believed that coats was not only changing doctors charts,but also altering other nurses work to reduce approved services.when asked what might motivate coats to alter doctors and nurses files,gassaway stated,b ecause she crazy.id.at.she elaborated that coats had stated that she did not think that any child deserved any services whatsoever,and that the chms program was just expensive daycare.when asked again what incentive coats had to illegally reduce the services,gassaway speculated that it was because of the cost savings attributable to afmc reviews.gassaway stated that both carson her direct supervisor and harbin an afmc vice president had stated that afmc reports,which were reports generated and published to adhs about the amount of money afmc had saved adhs through the review process,justified adhs renewing afmc contract.gassaway termed this as the general sentiment at afmc,which every employee is aware of.as she stated,i worked there for four years and i saw the patterns of how the programs are worked and it just seems that the goal is always to cut services and to make chms centers jump through hoops to get the kids approved so that they just quit.id.at.she also testified that she received written and oral directives from carson,which carson had in turn received from shirley wilson,a former director of adhs,that they should generally deny certain requests for services,such as those requested for children with only a single disability.
based in large part upon the deposition testimony of gassaway and whitaker,the district court determined that individual defendants hanley and jeffus were not entitled to qualified immunity.the court noted that the plaintiffs sought damages for the violation of clearly established rights to medicaid services.as to whether the evidence supported the inference that such a violation occurred,the court stated 
plaintiffs alleged and have offered sufficient evidence that a second layer of the prior authorization process was implemented by the individual capacity defendants resulting in an reduction in the scope and duration of day treatment recommended by the chms providers.consequently,all medicaid eligible children were allegedly denied their full array of recommended treatment.plaintiffs contend that this reduction has violated the equal access provision of the medicaid act as well as entitlement to day treatment in accordance with a.there is sufficient evidence in the record to raise a reasonable inference that the conduct of defendants reduced the quality of care available to low income children as compared to other children in the general population.moreover,there is sufficient evidence that costs for the additional hours of care may be borne by the chms providers to such an extent that it jeopardizes the future availability of their services.finally,according to gassaway,elimination of such services is the goal of the prior authorization practices engaged in by afmc with the encouragement and tacit approval of defendants.
dist.order of,at.
the court did not specifically rule on the issue of whether adhs,as an agency of the state,was entitled to summary judgment on the basis of eleventh amendment immunity.this interlocutory appeal by hanley,jeffus,and adhs followed.
qualified immunity of hanley and jeffus.
ordinarily,a party can not appeal from a denial of summary judgment.pool sebastian county,arkansas,cir.there is an exception to this rule for government officials whose motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity is denied.id.under this exception,we may immediately review the issue of whether the defendants engaged in conduct that violated the plaintiffs clearly established rights.see also harlow fitzgerald,d holding that government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.
we must first consider whether the medicaid act confers any federally enforceable rights upon the plaintiffs.this question has been largely answered by our prior opinions in this case.the claims for damages made by the plaintiffs here relate only to two subsections of the medicaid act a count four of the complaint,and a a count three of the complaint.in pediatrics i and pediatrics ii,respectively,we specifically held that each of these subsections created enforceable federal rights.pediatrics i,at holding that a created enforceable rights for recipient beneficiaries,which chms providers could assert on behalf of the beneficiaries pediatrics ii,at over ten years ago,our court held that a a created enforceable rights for medicaid recipients and providers.we find it entirely appropriate for the plaintiffs to base their procedural due process claim on their clearly established rights to have equal access to quality medical care as defined by a a.citation omitted.thus,the argument that there is no federally enforceable rights here is at odds with both the law of the case doctrine and the principle of stare decisis
