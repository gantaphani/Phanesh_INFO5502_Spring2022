brenda licausi petitions for review of a decision of the merit systems protection board,docket no,sustaining the ruling of the office of personnel management opm that she was not entitled to reinstatement of her disability retirement annuity.we affirm.
licausi was employed as an administrative assistant with the internal revenue service.in,she filed for and received disability retirement under the civil service retirement system csrs based on chronic phlebitis of both legs,a condition that left her unable to perform the duties of her position.she received a disability retirement annuity from that time until the year.in that year,opm notified licausi that because she had earned more than percent of the current rate of pay of the position from which she had retired she was considered restored to earning capacity and was no longer entitled to continue receiving disability benefits.see a.the following year,licausi sought reinstatement of her disability annuity.she asserted that she no longer met the percent earnings threshold and that she continued to be disabled because of phlebitis.opm denied licausi request for reinstatement.in its initial decision on her reinstatement request,opm concluded that there was no medical evidence to show that your original cause for disability retirement,recurring phlebitis,still exists or of sic the same severity.on licausi request for reconsideration,opm sustained the denial of benefits on the ground that your medical condition for which you were retired has not recurred.
licausi appealed to the merit systems protection board,which conducted a hearing on the appeal.following the hearing,the administrative judge to whom the case was assigned upheld opm decision denying licausi request for reinstatement of her disability retirement benefits.the administrative judge concluded that a lthough the objective clinical findings indicate that licausi suffers from superficial phlebitis of the right leg,her medical evidence does not indicate that her ability to perform the duties of her administrative assistant or any other position is impaired.finding that licausi had failed to establish that her condition restricted her from performing any of the duties of her position or any other activities,the administrative judge concluded that she had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she continued to be disabled and further concluded that the evidence did not indicate that her condition negatively affects her ability to work or to perform as an administrative assistant.accordingly,the administrative judge ruled that although licausi may not be as productive as she would like she does not continue to be disabled.
although we have jurisdiction to review decisions of the merit systems protection board in disability retirement cases,the scope of our review is limited to correcting errors involving important procedural rights,a misconstruction of the governing legislation,or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.lindahl office of pers,d.we may not review the factual underpinnings of disability determinations.anthony office of pers.
licausi argues that in order to be entitled to reinstatement of her disability benefits she was required to show only that the medical condition that led to her retirement either persisted or had recurred.it was improper,she contends,for the administrative judge to require her to demonstrate that because of her medical condition she could not perform the duties of her former position.in advancing that argument,she relies on the disability retirement statute,and the corresponding opm regulation.
neither the statute nor the regulation provides support for licausi legal argument.the pertinent subsection of the csrs disability statute,e,provides that a disability annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of an earning capacity provision,and whose earnings in any subsequent year fall below percent of the current rate of pay for the retiree former position,may obtain reinstatement of benefits if the retiree has not been reemployed in a federal position and has not recovered from the disability for which he was retired.likewise,the opm regulation provides that when a disability annuity stops,the individual must again prove that he or she meets the eligibility requirements in order to have the annuity reinstated.a.in the case of a disability annuitant whose earning capacity has been restored but who thereafter loses his or her earning capacity,the regulation provides that benefits will be reinstated if the annuitant has not recovered from the disability for which retired.id.e.the opm regulations define disability to mean inability,because of disease or injury,to render useful and efficient service in the employee current position,or in a vacant position in the same agency at the same grade or pay level for which the individual is qualified for reassignment.id.that definition tracks the language of the disability retirement statute,which describes an employee as disabled if he or she is unable,because of disease or injury,to render useful and efficient service in the employee position and is not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.a.
the term disability,as used in the csrs disability statute and regulations,thus contemplates not only the existence of a qualifying medical condition but also the inability to render useful and efficient service in the employee position or another similar position.for that reason,the statutory and regulatory requirement that the employee prove that he or she has not recovered from the disability for which retirement was granted necessarily implies that the employee must prove not only the existence of a medical condition,but also that the medical condition is disabling in nature,that it prevents the employee from rendering efficient and useful service in the employee position or an equivalent position.
the requirement that the employee seeking disability retirement prove that the medical condition in question prevents him or her from rendering efficient and useful service applies both to the employee initial application for disability retirement,see trevan office of pers,and in other contexts as well.for example,the merit systems protection board has held that the employee has the burden of proving that he or she continues to suffer from the same disabling medical condition or injury and that the medical condition or injury continues to prevent the employee from rendering useful and efficient service in his or her position regardless of whether the issue is the employee continuing right to benefits,the right to reinstatement of benefits after a finding of recovery,or the right to reinstatement of benefits after a restoration of earning capacity.see smith office of pers,proceeding to terminate benefits pion office of pers,proceeding to reinstate benefits after termination for recovery rountree office of pers,proceeding to terminate benefits dougherty office of pers,proceeding to reinstate benefits after termination for restoration of earning capacity mcmakin office of pers,proceeding to terminate benefits.because the retiree bears the burden of establishing his or her disability in each of these situations,the retiree is not entitled to resumption or retention of disability benefits simply by showing that his or her medical condition is similar,or even identical to,the condition that resulted in an initial determination of retirement eligibility.the retiree must also show that the medical condition is disabling,that it prevents the retiree from rendering useful and efficient service in the position from which he or she retired.see dougherty,at mcmakin,at.accordingly,we reject licausi argument that she was entitled to reinstatement of her disability merely upon showing that she continued to suffer from the medical condition that led to the initial finding of eligibility for disability retirement and was not required to show that her condition made it impossible for her to render useful and
