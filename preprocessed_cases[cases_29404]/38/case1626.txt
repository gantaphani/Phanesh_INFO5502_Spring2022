we conclude that welfare and institutions code section under which the state of california,rather than its counties,pays for ancillary outpatient services for medi cal eligible patients ages to in an institution for mental diseases imd remains a valid law 
in reaching this conclusion,we find that welfare and institutions code section presence in the california statutes is not the result of a legislative amendment to a repealed act,which is a legislative action proscribed under government code section and further find that welfare and institutions code section which requires the state to recover from counties payments for certain ancillary services,when medi cal coverage is unavailable did not shift funding from the state to the counties for ancillary outpatient services to medi cal eligible imd patients ages to,and did not impliedly repeal section.accordingly,we shall reverse the judgment.
factual and procedural background 
we draw much of our background from the able summary of facts and procedure the trial court provided in its ruling.
medicaid,medi cal,and payment of services for imd patients 
medicaid is a cooperative program under which the federal government and participating state governments share the costs of medical treatment for generally individuals.et california medicaid program is known as medi cal.et.
imd are hospitals,nursing facilities,and other institutions that primarily treat and care for patients with mental diseases.i.nearly all individuals placed within imd are gravely disabled by mental disease and unable to provide for themselves most imd patients qualify for medi cal.
under federal medicaid law,the federal government does not pay for services to imd patients between the ages of and.a xvii b connecticut of income maintenance heckler,d.the federal government deems care in mental institutions a state responsibility this policy is known as the imd exclusion hereafter,federal imd exclusion.heckler,supra,at,fn.d at,fn.as to that exclusion,federal medicaid law does not prohibit states from paying for imd services as a medicaid benefit.
statutory scheme involving state medi cal funding of imd ancillary services 
in,california the state added a medi cal benefit by enacting section.that section provides that the state will pay for ancillary outpatient services for imd patients ages to,the patients within the federal imd exclusion.ancillary outpatient services generally constitute physician services,prescription drugs,and laboratory,dental,vision,psychiatric and psychological services,performed outside the imd.
after section enactment in,the state and the counties divided financial responsibility for imd patients as follows for a patient within the federal imd exclusion who is eligible for medi cal,counties pay for the patient core,basic,institutional imd services,and the state pays for ancillary outpatient services and for a patient within the federal imd exclusion who is not eligible for medi cal,counties generally pay for both the core services and the ancillary outpatient services generally,persons who are not medi cal eligible are undocumented persons.et.
shortly after section was enacted in,the legislature amended it to include a sunset provision.stats,ch,stats,ch.
the specific focus of this appeal involves two assembly bills assembly bill reg.sess.hereafter,assembly bill and assembly bill reg.sess.hereafter,assembly bill collectively,assembly bills and,that concern subsequent sunsetting legislation regarding section.assembly bill,enacted in,sought to extend the original sunset provision an additional year.stats,ch.and assembly bill,enacted in,sought to eliminate the sunset provision altogether,thereby making section effective indefinitely.stats,ch.assembly bills and each were enacted as urgency legislation budget trailer bills during fiscal budget disputes that were typical at the time of their enactments.we will set forth the specific language of these two bills when we discuss them in detail later.
all parties agree that,at least until section was enacted in,the state paid for ancillary outpatient services,in line with section,for medi cal eligible imd patients within the federal imd exclusion.section requires the state department of mental health dmh now the state department of health care services or dhcs to recover imd ancillary payments that were made to counties by the state when medi cal coverage is unavailable or by the federal government given the federal imd exclusion.
following section enactment,the state through a dhcs memorandum in hereafter,dhcs memorandum,and a dmh letter in hereafter,dmh letter informed imd that medi cal,state funding does not cover the costs of ancillary outpatient services for medi cal eligible imd patients within the federal imd exclusion,and directed health care providers of those services to bill counties,rather than the state,for such services.we will set forth section language when we discuss it later.
procedural background 
twenty california counties the counties have been plaintiffs in the lawsuit at issue here a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief against defendants the state and its pertinent officials dhcs and dmh 
in their petition,the counties allege that the dhcs memorandum and the dmh letter are invalid because they are inconsistent with welfare and institutions code section,which requires the state to pay for ancillary outpatient services for medi cal eligible imd patients within the federal imd exclusion,and they constitute underground regulations adopted in violation of the state administrative procedures act,subd.a.
in their complaint,the counties similarly seek a declaration that the subject memorandum and letter are invalid,and a prohibiting the state from applying them against the counties.
the state responds that section was repealed by virtue of its original sunset provision and section shifted funding from the state to counties for ancillary services for medi cal eligible imd patients within the federal imd exclusion.
the trial court denied the counties petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive relief,and issued a declaratory judgment in favor of the state.the court concluded that the subsequent sunsetting amendments to section assem.bills were void because they were enacted after the statute had already sunset by its own terms in.thus,in the absence of section,the state did not promulgate an underground regulation by issuing the dhcs memorandum and the dmh letter and ancillary outpatient services for medi cal eligible imd patients within the federal imd exclusion are not eligible for funding from the state.
discussion 
to resolve the issues on appeal,we must interpret the statutes at play sections and.
interpreting statutes against a backdrop of undisputed facts,as here,presents questions of law that we determine independently.our objective in interpreting a statute is to determine legislative intent so as to effectuate the law purpose.the first thing we do is read the statute,and give the words their ordinary meanings unless special definitions are provided.if the meaning of the words is clear,then the language controls if not,we may use various interpretive aids,such as the statutory context and framework,and legislative history.schnyder state bd.of equalization th,fns.omitted department of fish game anderson cottonwood irrigation dist.th.
i.the interpretation of section 
the legislature first enacted section in to read exactly as it does today notwithstanding section a state statute that recognizes the federal imd exclusion,ancillary outpatient services,pursuant to section delineating such services,for any eligible individual who is years of age or over,and has not attained years of age and who is a patient in an institution for mental diseases imd shall be covered regardless of the availability of federal financial participation,regardless of the federal imd exclusion.stats,ch,eff.july.
we will refer to this legislative expression,consistently set forth since,as the section substantive provision.
shortly after section was enacted in,the legislature amended it to include a sunset provision this is original sunset provision.pursuant to this amendment,the section substantive provision was now set forth in subdivision a and the sunset provision in subdivision b,which stated,this section,substantive provision shall remain in effect only until july,and as of that date is repealed,unless a later enacted statute that is chaptered on or before july,deletes or extends that date.stats,ch,eff.july.
that brings us to the two assembly bills concerning the issue of section later sunsetting assembly bill in and assembly bill in.these two bills comprise the focus of this appeal in terms of section interpretation.
regarding section,assembly bill set forth the section substantive provision in subd.a,and a new sunset provision in subdivision b,which stated,this section,substantive provision shall remain in effect only until july,and as of that date is repealed,unless a later enacted statute that is chaptered on or before july,deletes or extends that date.stats,ch,eff.july.
although assembly bill was a later enacted statute in the wording of section original sunset provision quoted above,assembly bill was not chaptered on or before july,as section original sunset provision required for the section seamless sunset extension.the legislature adopted assembly bill,prior to july,as a health budget trailer bill urgency legislation to implement the fiscal year budget act that fiscal year began on july,but the governor did not approve assembly bill until july,and the secretary of state did not chapter it until july.stats,ch.
regarding section,assembly bill set forth the section substantive provision,and deleted the sunset provision altogether and consequently also deleted the subdivision designations a and b,so that section again read as it did when originally enacted in,just the substantive provision quoted above.stats,ch.
this is the way section still reads.again,though,the later enacted statute of assembly bill as required by the wording of assem.bill sunset provision was not chaptered on or before july.the legislature adopted assembly bill on july,as a health budget trailer bill urgency legislation to implement the fiscal year budget act the governor approved it on august,and the secretary of state chaptered it on august.stats,ch.
the state contends that section was repealed,under its original sunset provision,on july,and that assembly bills and,as purported subsequent amendments to section,were void under government code section,which states,a statute amending a section of a repealed statute is void.see fletcher prather cal,sutherland,statutes and statutory construction ed.amendatory acts,hereafter,sutherland since an amendment alters,modifies,or adds to a prior statute,a repealed statute can not be amended that which does not exist can not be amended.
the counties maintain that assembly bills and constitute new enactments of section following brief repeal periods,in line with legislative intent to keep the section substantive provision on the statutory books.we agree with the counties.
viewing assembly bills and as new enactments of welfare and institutions code section,rather than as amendments to the repealed section,furthers the legislature intent to extend section duration,tracks the plain statutory language detailed previously,and does not violate the principle of government code section.
in assembly bills and,the legislature acted twice with respect to sunset dates for section first,to extend the sunset date and then to delete it altogether.these are not the actions of a legislative body that intended to get rid of section,but rather to maintain it.
tracking the plain statutory language,assembly bill enacted section effective july,after section had been repealed by its terms from july,original sunset date through july.similarly,assembly bill enacted section effective august,without a sunset date,after section had been repealed by its terms from july,the assembly bill sunset date through august.throughout this entire statutory history,the section substantive provision has read the same.consequently,section substantive provision has been the law since its original enactment on july,and the state treated it as such until,after was enacted in,and remains the law today we will later discuss,except for two brief periods when that substantive provision was repealed by section own terms july,through july,and july,through august.furthermore,all parties agree that,under section substantive provision,the state pays for ancillary outpatient services for medi cal eligible imd patients within the federal imd exclusion.
the language the legislature used in assembly bills and setting forth the provisions of section arguably acknowledged the context in which these two bills were enacted budget trailer bill legislation enacted as urgency legislation given the prolonged budget battles typical of the day.so,if assembly bills and were chaptered before the sunset dates relevant to them respectively,july,and july,they would operate seamlessly as amendments of those sunse
