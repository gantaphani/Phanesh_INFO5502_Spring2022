this case involves a dispute over the amount of compensation petitioner stacey heinzelman heinzelman is entitled to receive under the national childhood vaccine injury act of,to vaccine act.the secretary of health and human services the government appeals the final decision of the united states court of federal claims,which affirmed the special master decision that petitioner compensation under the vaccine act should not be reduced by the amount of benefits she is eligible to receive through social security disability insurance ssdi.see heinzelman sec y of health human.heinzelman sec y of health human,wl,claims lexis.may.because we agree that ssdi benefits should not be taken into account in calculating heinzelman actual or anticipated loss of earnings under a a,and that ssdi does not fall within any of the categories of authorized offsets under g,we affirm.
background 
heinzelman was born in.on december,she received a flu vaccine,and within thirty days thereafter she was hospitalized for guillain barre syndrome gbs a disorder affecting the peripheral nervous system.
before heinzelman developed gbs,she was employed as a hairstylist earning per year.at this stage in the proceedings,it is undisputed that,due to her injury,heinzelman will never be able to work again and is eligible to receive ssdi benefits of approximately per year.
on january,heinzelman filed a petition for compensation under the vaccine act alleging that the flu vaccine caused her to develop gbs.in a december decision,the special master found that heinzelman proved,by a preponderance of the evidence,that the flu vaccine caused her injury and that she was entitled to compensation.heinzelman sec y of health human,wl,at,claims lexis,at.that decision is not at issue on appeal.
in may,the special master issued a separate ruling regarding the amount of compensation to which heinzelman is entitled.in that decision,the special master rejected the government argument that heinzelman eligibility for ssdi benefits should be considered in determining her compensation under the vaccine act.specifically,the special master found that heinzelman anticipated ssdi income should not be taken into consideration in calculating her actual or anticipated loss of earnings under a a and ssdi is not a federal health benefits program within the meaning of g,and therefore her compensation should not be offset based on her eligibility for ssdi benefits.
on december,the special master entered final judgment awarding heinzelman,plus an annuity to cover future medical expenses.of the lump sum awarded,was to compensate heinzelman for her lost earnings.according to the government,heinzelman lost earnings award would have been roughly less had the special master taken her anticipated ssdi benefits into account.
the government moved the court of federal claims to review the special master final judgment awarding damages,which incorporated both the december decision granting compensation under the vaccine act,and the may ruling regarding offset.in june,the court of federal claims affirmed the special master decisions in their entirety.in relevant part,the court agreed that ssdi benefits should not be taken into account in determining heinzelman compensation under.the government timely appealed that issue to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to f.
discussion 
the sole question on appeal is whether a petitioner compensation under the vaccine act should be reduced by the amount of ssdi benefits she is eligible to receive.resolution of this question involves the interpretation and interplay between two provisions of the vaccine act a a which provides compensation for lost earning capacity and g which offsets the compensation award where the petitioner is expected to receive payments under certain other programs.because statutory interpretation is a question of law,we review the trial court determination de novo.aull sec y of health human.
where,as here,the petitioner has suffered a injury after attaining the age of eighteen,and her earning capacity is impaired by that injury,her compensation under the vaccine act includes compensation for actual and anticipated loss of earnings determined in accordance with generally recognized actuarial principles and projections.a a.the act provides,however,that the vaccine program is not primarily liable,and that an award under the vaccine act is offset to the extent the petitioner is entitled to receive payments from certain specified programs.specifically,g provides that 
payment of compensation under the program shall not be made for any item or service to the extent that payment has been made,or can reasonably be expected to be made,with respect to such item or service under any state compensation program,under an insurance policy,or under any federal or state health benefits program other than under title xix of the social security act usca et medicaid or by an entity which provides health services on a prepaid basis.
on appeal,the government argues that the special master and the court of federal claims erred in concluding that ssdi benefits should not be considered in determining compensation under the vaccine act.specifically,the government argues that heinzelman eligibility for ssdi benefits should have been considered either as part of the lost earnings calculation under a a or as an offset under g.in the alternative,the government argues that of the vaccine act is ambiguous,and that principles of sovereign immunity weigh against exposing the federal government to further liability.
in response,heinzelman argues that a a does not authorize offsets to a petitioner lost wages award congress did not include ssdi as one of the specifically enumerated offsets in g and the plain language of the vaccine act is unambiguous,such that the doctrine of sovereign immunity does not compel a reading of the act which is sympathetic to the government views.for the reasons explained below,we agree with heinzelman on each point.
section a a 
as noted,when certain qualifications are satisfied,a a authorizes compensation for actual and anticipated loss of earnings.the question of whether lost earnings requires a deduction for ssdi benefits is a question of statutory interpretation,and our analysis begins with the language of the statute.youngblood sec y of health human,citing k mart cartier,d.when interpreting a statute,however,the court must look not only at the particular statutory provision in question,but also at the language and design of the statute as a whole.id.citing k mart,at.it is a principle of statutory interpretation that a statute is to be construed in a way which gives meaning and effect to all of its parts.saunders sec y of health human,citing united states nordic,d noting the settled rule that a statute must,if possible,be construed in such fashion that every word has some operative effect.
here,the court of federal claims began its analysis by noting that loss of earnings is not defined in the statute.the court looked to black law dictionary,which defines earnings as r evenue gained from labor or services,from the investment of capital,or from assets.heinzelman.at quoting black law dictionary ed.using this definition,the court found that the starting point for the lost earnings calculation is the amount of earnings during the past,present,future loss periods.id.
looking to the relationship between a a and g,the court of federal claims agreed with the special master that a authorizes compensation,while g takes it away in certain situations.specifically,the court found that the focus of a a is to establish a baseline for compensation earnings not earned because of the vaccine injury and ssdi provides a degree of mitigation of lost earnings,but does not change the calculation thereof.id.accordingly,the court of federal claims concluded that heinzelman ssdi benefits should not be considered in the first instance when calculating her lost earnings under a a id.at.
on appeal,the government argues that ssdi income must be considered in calculating heinzelman actual and anticipated loss of earnings under a a because she suffers no such loss to the extent that ssdi income received for the injury would substitute for income that she would otherwise have received from an employer.appellant br.because heinzelman previously earned per year and is eligible for per year in ssdi,the government claims that she has an anticipated loss of earnings of only per year.according to the government,this interpretation is consistent with the vaccine act goal of placing petitioners in the position they would have been,but for the injury.
in support of its position,the government relies primarily on a special master decision jelly secretary of health human services,wl,claims lexis,in jelly,the special master addressed whether,in calculating the petitioner lost earnings under a,he should reduce the petitioner gross earnings by the amount of taxes she likely would have paid had she received those earnings.wl,at,claims lexis,at.at the outset,the special master stated that the obvious purpose of an award for lost earnings under the program is to put the petitioner in the same financial situation where she would have been but for the injury.id.at,claims lexis,at.given this purpose,the special master noted that the tax reduction seemed conceptually appropriate,in order to ensure that petitioner will receive only those amounts that she would have actually received had she been able to work.id.at,claims lexis,at.after reviewing the statutory context,the special master concluded that,when an award for lost earnings is made under a a only lost earnings should be awarded.id.at,claims lexis,at.
according to the government,j ust as taxes must be taken into account in determining the amount of a petitioner lost wages,so must substitute income be considered.appellant reply.to the contrary,although this court has recognized that it is appropriate to deduct federal and state income taxes when determining a lost earnings award under the vaccine act see euken secretary of health human services,it does not follow that ssdi benefits should likewise be deducted.indeed,nothing in the statute supports equating the two.
first,in calculating lost earnings,it makes sense to consider net rather than gross earnings,since the amount received at any given point in an earnings history would necessarily be less taxes owed or deducted.this is consistent with the generally recognized actuarial principles incorporated into a a.ssdi is not something which is netted out so as to reflect actual earnings,however it is a compensatory figure designed to compensate for a loss of actual earnings.thus,if ssdi is to be considered at all it would need to be characterized as an offset to earnings,an offset which would be deducted under g.
looking to the overall structure of the vaccine act,we agree with the special master and the court of federal claims that a gives compensation while g provides for offsets where compensation is made via one of the enumerated programs.this reading flows from the text and structure of the statute,and is consistent with the underlying purpose of the vaccine act,which is to provide compensatory damages for injuries.saunders,at.
treating ssdi payments as a deduction under a is inconsistent with the principle that we must give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute and should avoid rendering any of the statutory text meaningless or as mere surplusage.sharp united states,quoting duncan walker,d internal quotation marks omitted.if,as the government argues,compensation program payments are factored into the lost earning calculation under a a,then there would be no need for a separate provision g that specifically identifies the types of offsets that reduce the amount of compensation recoverable under the vaccine act.we are also mindful that we should avoid construing a statute in a way which yields an absurd result.hellebrand sec y of health human.the government position is at odds with this principle,and we decline to adopt an approach that would have payments under certain compensation programs reduce the amount of lost earnings under a a,while others such as state workers compensation program awards are deducted under g.simply,there is no textual support for the government position that ssdi payments should reduce heinzelman lost earnings compensation under a a.
finally,the government argues that the legislative history supports its position that a a should take into account ssdi benefits.specifically,the government points to the following language in the legislative history p ayment of compensation is not to be made for items or services for which payment has been made or can be expected to be made by other public or private entities,sess,reprinted in.the government omits the very next sentence,however,which states thus,if an insurance program or a health maintenance organization pays or is obligated to pay for health care services,the program is not to pay for these same services.id.in other words,closer review of the portion of the legislative history cited reveals that it does not specifically address lost earnings under a a,and instead is geared towards the types of insurance programs and health maintenance organizations discussed under g.accordingly,the legislative history does not alter our reading of the plain language of the statute.see glaxo operations uk quigg,noting that,where the statutory language is unambiguous,we consider the legislative history of the act,but only to determine whether a clear intent contrary to the plain meaning exists.
because neither the text of the vaccine act nor the legislative history suggests that ssdi benefits should be deducted from a lost earning calculation under a a,we agree with the court of federal claims that heinzelman eligibility for ssdi benefits should not be considered when deciding her loss of earnings under that provision.
given our conclusion that ssdi benefits do not reduce the amount of lost earnings under a,we turn our attention to g,which enumerates when a petitioner is not entitled to compensation under the vaccine program because certain other programs provide compensation.in relevant part,the statute requires an offset for payments made under any state compensation program,under an insurance policy,or under any federal or state health benefits program other than medicaid.g it is undisputed that the offset provision in g only applies here if ssdi benefits qualify as a federal health benefits program.see oral argument at,available at i do believe that is the only category that federal social security disability insurance benefits would fall into.
the court of federal claims affirmed the special master decision that ssdi does not qualify as a federal health benefits program.specifically,the court found that ssdi is not a health benefits program simply because it requires an applicant to have a physical disability unlike medicare,ssdi does not provide applicants with health insurance benefits ssdi compensates applicants for loss of income since they are disabled and no longer able to work and ssdi does not necessarily pay for an applicant medical expenses.heinzelman.at.the court further noted that,just because g exempts one title of the social security act medicaid does not mean that all other titles should be considered federal health benefits program offsets.id.accordingly,the court agreed with the special master that heinzelman ssdi payments should not offset the compensation she is entitled to receive under a.
on appeal,the government contends that ssdi is a federal health benefits program because it is related to an individual health status.in particular,the government argues that congress acknowledged a relationship between ssdi and health status,since an individual becomes eligible to receive medicare benefits after months of eligibility for ssdi benefits and the court of federal claims narrow reading of the phrase health benefits program is inconsistent with the principle that the vaccine program is generally a secondary payer.appellant br.the government arguments are not.
as the court of federal claims recognized,ssdi is not a federal health benefits program simply because it requires an applicant to have a physical disability.heinzelman.at.this is
