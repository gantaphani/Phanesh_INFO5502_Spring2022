patricia jackson appeals the district court dismissal of her challenge to the administrative denial of her application for supplemental security income ssi,filed under title xvi of the social security act ssa,c.the district court dismissed the complaint as untimely,because it was not filed within the statute of limitations,enumerated in g,for federal court review of ssi denials.on appeal,jackson contends that the district court erred in dismissing her complaint,because the doctrine of equitable tolling applied to excuse her tardy filing.after thorough review,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
the facts relevant to our equitable tolling analysis are these.on august,jackson sought ssi benefits for injuries she sustained in an automobile accident earlier that month.on february,following a hearing,an administrative law judge alj denied jackson petition on the ground that her injuries did not qualify as disabilities under the ssa.on april,the ssa appeals council the appeals council denied jackson request for review.at this point,the alj decision became final,subject to federal court review under g and c.in its letter the appeals council unambiguously advised jackson to file her complaint in the united states district court for the judicial district in which she lives within sixty days from the date of her receipt of the letter.jackson barnhart,civil action.additionally,the appeals council informed jackson that the council would assume that jackson received this letter days after the date on it unless you show us that you did not receive it within the period.id.thus,according to the terms of the april,letter,and consistent with the statute of limitations,jackson was required to file her complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of alabama on or before june.
instead,on june,jackson filed a pro se complaint challenging the commissioner denial of her ssi claim in the state circuit court of montgomery county,alabama.then,on july,that court dismissed jackson complaint for lack of jurisdiction.thereafter,on july,days after g statute of limitations had expired,jackson filed a complaint in the united states district court for the middle district of alabama.
appellee,the commissioner of social security the commissioner,promptly moved to dismiss jackson petition under rules b and b of the federal rules of civil procedure,on the ground that the complaint was untimely filed.on december,the district court granted the commissioner motion to dismiss.this appeal followed.
we review de novo the district court dismissal of jackson complaint for failure to satisfy the statute of limitations,accepting as true the allegations contained in the complaint.byrd macpapers,cir.the question of whether equitable tolling applies is a legal one subject to de novo review.cabello,cir.
on appeal,jackson bases her challenge to the district court dismissal of her g complaint on the theory of equitable tolling.specifically,jackson says that congress has made explicit its intention that equitable tolling apply to the ssa statute of limitations.in addition,jackson challenges the district court application of burnett new york central railroad,d,a case discussing equitable tolling in the context of the federal employers liability act fela,to the facts of her case,citing the ssa more permissive approach to equitable tolling.
we consider two threshold questions first,whether the doctrine of equitable tolling applies to the statute of limitations period embodied in g,and if so,what showing a claimant must make before the court may toll the ssa statutory period.
it is by now axiomatic that the united states is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued,and congress alone determines how and when the united states may be sued for judicial review of administrative orders and judgments.lehman nakshian,d quoting united states testan,d.in g,congress waived sovereign immunity by giving the federal courts jurisdiction to review and modify or reverse the commissioner decisions.see huie bowen,cir.as such,the remedies outlined in that statute are the exclusive source of federal court jurisdiction over cases involving ssi.h no findings of fact or decision of the commissioner of social security shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.again,in pertinent part,that statute provides that a claimant may obtain review of the commissioner decision by filing a civil action commenced within sixty days after the mailing to him of notice of such decision or within such further time as the commissioner may allow.such action shall be brought in the district court of the united states for the judicial district in which the plaintiff resides g emphasis added.owing to the explicit discretion g affords,the supreme court has held that application of a traditional equitable tolling principle to the requirement of g is fully consistent with the congressional purpose and is nowhere eschewed by congress.bowen city of new york,d quotation marks omitted.
thus,as a preliminary matter,it is clear that the doctrine of equitable tolling is available to a claimant whose g challenge in the district court was untimely.we must also determine,however,precisely what showing a claimant must make before a court may actually toll the statute.we have not had occasion to address this question in a published opinion.
we do so now and hold that traditional equitable tolling principles require a claimant to justify her untimely filing by a showing of extraordinary circumstances.in an unpublished opinion,waller comm r.cir,we held,in the context of g,that traditional equitable tolling principles require a claimant to justify her untimely filing by a showing of extraordinary circumstances.id.at.the extraordinary circumstances standard,we explained,may be met where the defendant misleads the plaintiff,allowing the statutory period to lapse or when the plaintiff has no reasonable way of discovering the wrong perpetrated against her id.
the second circuit has addressed the applicability of equitable tolling to g statute of limitations and has defined the claimant burden this way t he doctrine of equitable tolling permits courts to deem filings timely where a litigant can show that he has been pursuing his rights diligently and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way.torres barnhart,cir quoting pace diguglielmo,d see also davila barnhart,d,pointing out that,in the context of g,the p laintiff bears the burden of establishing the exceptional circumstances that warrant equitable tolling.
we think the law clearly requires that a finding of extraordinary circumstances is necessary before a court may equitably toll the ssa statutory period,and this determination is reserved for extraordinary facts.cabello,at quotation marks omitted.this result should not be surprising in view of the deference congressionally mandated periods of limitations demand.baldwin county welcome ctr.brown,d procedural requirements established by congress for gaining access to the federal courts are not to be disregarded by courts out of a vague sympathy for particular litigants.passenger morgan,d noting that equitable tolling is to be applied sparingly.moreover,requiring a claimant to justify equitable tolling of the ssa statute of limitations by establishing extraordinary circumstances is fully consistent with our approach to equitable tolling in other contexts.
thus,for example,in cabello,we required plaintiffs suing under both the alien tort claims act atca,and the torture victim protection act tvpa,to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances prevented them from filing their claims within those statutes limitations periods.at quotation marks omitted we must determine whether the facts of this case demonstrate extraordinary circumstances sufficient for equitable tolling.this is a determination because a finding of extraordinary circumstances is reserved for extraordinary facts.specifically,we said e quitable tolling is appropriate in situations where the defendant misleads the plaintiff,allowing the statutory period to lapse or when the plaintiff has no reasonable way
