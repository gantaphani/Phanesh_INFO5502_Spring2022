phillip andre appeals from the order of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court that dismissed part of his appeal for lack of jurisdiction and affirmed the rest.andre west.the veterans court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over andre appeal insofar as it related to claims of clear and unmistakable error that andre had raised for the first time on appeal.the veterans court also concluded that andre had abandoned the claims of clear and unmistakable error that he had asserted before a regional office ro of the department of veterans affairs va and the board of veterans appeals bva or board and that the bva had adjudicated.the court therefore affirmed the decision of the board as to those claims.we affirm.
background 
andre served on active duty in the united states navy from october of to january of.in march of,he filed a claim for service connection and benefits relating to a mental disorder.id.at.the louis,missouri ro denied the claim on june.the ro determined that andre suffered from a personality disorder that predated his service,that the disorder had not been aggravated by his service,and that,after andre left the service,the disorder had matured into the psychosis for which he sought benefits.id.andre did not appeal the ro denial of his claim.in august of,however,the bva reopened andre claim and found his mental disorder schizophrenia to be service connected.in september of,the ro implemented the board decision by granting andre a disability rating,effective june.id.
in march of,andre filed a claim with the ro asserting clear and unmistakable error cue in the decision that had denied him service connection and benefits andre advanced two grounds in support of his claim first,that the denial of service connection in was factually erroneous and second,that the va had failed to discharge its duty to assist him in preparing his claim,as currently required by.after the ro denied his cue claim,andre appealed to the bva.in a may,decision,the board held that the ro decision did not contain clear and unmistakable error.first,the board determined that the ro had based its denial of service connection on a consideration of all the facts then in the record.second,relying on caffrey brown,the board ruled that a breach by the va of its duty to assist andre in the preparation of his claim could not constitute a ground for the assertion of a claim of clear and unmistakable error.
andre appealed the bva decision to the veterans court.before the veterans court,andre presented,for the first time,additional allegations of clear and unmistakable error in the ro denial of service connection.specifically,andre argued that the ro had committed cue because it had failed to apply b,which governs determinations of service connection relating to chronic diseases,and b,which provides for the presumption that a claimant was sound before entering the service.andre.at.andre also argued that because his cue claims raised legal arguments in a collateral attack on the propriety of a va decision,the veterans court should review the denial of service connection de novo.in his principal brief before the veterans court,andre did not mention the two cue claims that he originally had presented to the ro and appealed to the board the claim that the ro decision lacked factual support and the claim that the va had breached its duty to assist him in the preparation of his claim.id.
in a july,order,the veterans court held that it lacked jurisdiction under a to consider the cue claims.the court relied on its decision in sondel brown,in which it articulated the unassailable premise that the court does not have jurisdiction to review a claim of cue unless it has been previously adjudicated by the board.because andre had not raised before the board,and the board accordingly had not considered,the cue claims that andre presented for the first time on appeal,the veterans court concluded that the jurisdictional prerequisite of a final board decision addressing those claims was lacking.therefore,as to those claims,the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.andre.at.at the same time,the court held that andre had abandoned the two cue claims that had been considered by the board but were not raised in his principal brief.finally,the veterans court rejected as meritless andre argument that his assertion of a cue claim should cause the ro allegedly erroneous denial of service connection to be subjected to de novo review.andre.at.accordingly,the court affirmed the decision of the board as to the claims it had decided.
discussion 
pursuant to a,we have jurisdiction to review a decision of the veterans court with respect to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof that was relied on by the court in making its decision.under that rubric,we have jurisdiction over andre appeal because the appeal concerns the veterans court interpretation of its jurisdictional statute,a.we review legal issues,including whether the veterans court properly declined to assert jurisdiction pursuant to its authority under section a,without deference.maggitt west.the veterans court jurisdictional statute is to be construed narrowly and with precision and with fidelity to the terms by which congress has expressed its wishes,bailey west,quoting cheng fan kwok ins,d.
on appeal,andre makes three arguments.first,he contends that the veterans court erred by refusing to assert jurisdiction over his cue claims.second,he argues that he did not abandon the cue claims that he presented to the bva and that the bva decided by failing to raise them in his principal brief before the veterans court.finally,he renews his contention that the veterans court should review de novo a prior va decision collaterally attacked pursuant to a cue claim.for the reasons that follow,we hold i that the veterans court did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the cue claims andre raised for the first time on appeal and ii that we are without jurisdiction to consider the abandonment issue.our affirmance of the veterans court jurisdictional ruling renders moot andre argument that the veterans court should review de novo an ro decision that is collaterally attacked in a cue claim.
whether the veterans court had jurisdiction to consider the cue claims that andre raised for the first time on appeal.
the jurisdiction of the veterans court is defined by a.the statute provides that the court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the board of veterans appeals.review by the veterans court shall be on the record of proceedings before the secretary and the board.b.andre argues that the decision of the bva rejecting the two cue claims he had asserted before the ro constituted a decision under section a for purposes of vesting the veterans court with jurisdiction to consider his cue claims.in support of his argument,andre points to the statement in maggitt west that the veterans court has jurisdiction to hear arguments presented to it in the first instance,provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the veteran claim.at.
in maggitt,the veteran filed claims in and for service connection for asthma,a knee condition,and a skin disorder.ros denied the claims,and the veteran did not appeal the denials.id.at.in,maggitt sought to reopen his claims for these conditions.he also requested service connection for a back condition.after the ro denied the four claims,maggitt filed a timely notice of disagreement nod with the bva pursuant to a.the board denied maggitt request to reopen the asthma,knee condition,and skin disorder claims.the board also denied service connection for the back claim.id.maggitt appealed the board decision to the veterans court,and before the court he made two arguments in support of his claims that he had not presented to the board.the veterans court ruled that,because maggitt had failed to present what it termed two new issues to either the ro or the board,the court did not have jurisdiction to consider the issues.id.at.maggitt appealed to this court,arguing,inter alia,that the veterans court had erred in holding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider his new arguments.
we reversed the ruling of the veterans court on the jurisdictional issue.in our decision,we interpreted the veterans court jurisdictional grant under a as allowing the court to consider arguments on appeal from the board as long as two requirements are met.first,the veterans court may review a board decision only if the appeal was initiated by an nod filed on or after november.id.at see veterans judicial review act of,stat.second,in order to invoke the veterans court jurisdiction,the veteran appeal must challenge a decision of the board with respect to the benefit sought by the veteran.maggitt,at.we concluded that this interpretation of a decision,which refers to the denial or acceptance of a veteran claim for benefits instead of a particular argument in support of that claim,allows the veterans court to consider arguments in support of a claim irrespective of whether the veteran raised the arguments before the board.accordingly,we concluded that the veterans court has jurisdiction to hear arguments presented to it in the first instance provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the veteran claim.id.at.
the government argues that,unlike the veteran in maggitt,who simply raised new arguments in support of a claim for benefits that already had been adjudicated by the board,andre raised before the veterans court claims that had not been the subject of a board decision.thus,according to the government,the section a jurisdictional predicate of a board decision was lacking in andre case.in advancing this argument,the government relies on our decision in ledford west.
in,the veteran in ledford was granted a disability rating for his schizophrenia,based on individual unemployability.in,the ro changed the rating from disability to schedular.this change,which had the effect of terminating ledford individual unemployability benefits,was made pursuant to va circular.the circular provided that a schedular evaluation will be assigned if unemployability is directly attributable to a condition.id.at.in,a va examiner determined,based upon an examination of ledford,that ledford schizophrenia was in partial remission.the ro therefore reduced ledford schedular rating to.ledford filed an nod with the bva in which he objected to the reduction.in,after several remands for further factual development,the board reinstated the schedular rating and set april,as the effective date for the reinstatement.id.thereafter,in november of,ledford filed an nod alleging that the effective date was improper because the ro had committed clear and unmistakable error in when it reduced his schedular rating.after the board confirmed the effective date,ledford appealed to the veterans court.id.at.
before the court,ledford challenged for the first time the ro decision changing his disability rating to a schedular rating.ledford argued that va circular was invalid because it was neither published in the federal register nor subject to notice and comment under the administrative procedure act,see a,apa.he also argued that the circular was invalid because it violated his due process rights under the united states constitution.in making this argument,ledford asserted that the circular was inconsistent with a va regulation generally prescribing that a individual unemployability rating can be reduced only upon proof of employability by clear and convincing evidence,an evidentiary standard that ledford asserted had not been met in his case.ledford,at.the veterans court characterized ledford challenge to the rating decision as a cue claim and concluded that,because the claim had not been raised before the board,it lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate it.id.the court therefore dismissed that portion of ledford appeal.id.
we affirmed the decision of the veterans court.noting that section a grants the veterans court the power to affirm,modify,or reverse a decision of the board or to remand the matter as appropriate,we concluded that the court jurisdiction is premised on and defined by the board decision concerning the matter being appealed.ledford,at.since the board had never issued a decision concerning the ro decision to change ledford rating from disability to schedular,there existed no predicate board decision on which the court could rely to assert jurisdiction.instead,the board decision from which ledford appealed involved the propriety of the board effective date for his reinstated benefits,which was legally and logically distinct from the ro decision to modify his underlying disability rating.accordingly,ledford had to have presented an nod specifically challenging the determination in order to vest jurisdiction in the veterans court over that determination.while his legal reasoning supporting such a challenge need not appear in the nod,an nod must have indicated disagreement with a specific determination.id.at.absent the prerequisite of a board decision,we held that section a precluded the veterans court from asserting jurisdiction.
maggitt and ledford both teach that,in order for the veterans court to have jurisdiction under a,the court must have before it a decision of the bva within the meaning of section a.in maggitt,we concluded that the veterans court had before it a decision of the bva on,and therefore had jurisdiction over,maggitt asthma,knee condition,and skin disorder claims.as a result,it was error for the court to hold that it lacked jurisdiction to consider new arguments in support of those claims.in ledford,on the other hand,we concluded that the veterans court did not have before it a decision of the bva on,and therefore did not have jurisdiction over,ledford apa and constitutional claims relating to the schedular change.as we explained in maggitt ledford never requested the reinstatement of his individual unemployability benefits from the board accordingly,the veterans court did not have jurisdiction over ledford claim,and thus lacked the authority to consider ledford constitutional and statutory challenges to the agency decision that terminated those benefits.at.
we agree with the government that ledford rather than maggitt controls this case.the reason is that andre,unlike the veteran in maggitt,did not raise in the veterans court new arguments in support of claims that had been presented to and decided by the bva.rather,like the veteran in ledford,he raised in the veterans court distinct from had never been presented to or decided by the bva.because there was no board decision on those claims,the veterans court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate them.
our decision turns on the fact that andre case involves cue claims.in russell principi,en banc,the veterans court addressed the scope of its jurisdictional mandate to review denials of cue claims 
the necessary jurisdictional hook for this court to act is a decision of the bva on the specific issue of clear and unmistakable error.for a claimant to raise such an issue for the first time before this court and request us to act de novo is tantamount to requesting plenary review over decisions that are not within our jurisdiction.
in other words,each specific assertion of cue constitutes a claim that must be the subject of a decision by the bva before the veterans court can exercise jurisdiction over it.
as noted above,in congress enacted the statutes that govern claims of cue before the ro and the board.the ro cue statute is codified at.in pierce principi,we stated that the legislative history of section reveals congress awareness and approval of the decision in russell and we pointed out that the house and senate reports discuss russell as setting forth the current state of the law which was to be codified by section.at 
unlike a claim for benefits,a cue claim subsumes a specific allegation of error.that is,both in name and in logic,a cue claim is not a generalized assertion of entitlement to benefits.rather,it is an assertion that that the ro committed a particular clear and unmistakable error.
the party bringing a cue challenge to a final ro decision bears the burden of proving that the decision was based on a clear and unmistakable error.this burden is not satisfied by the mere a
