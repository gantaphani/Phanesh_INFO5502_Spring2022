ken stout stout appeals the final decision of the merit systems protection board board dismissing his appeal as untimely filed,without a showing of good cause for the delay in filing.stout dep t of treasury,no,final order stout dep t of treasury,no,initial decision.given specific allegations and substantial evidence of mental illness,and conflicts between his and the government evidentiary submissions,we conclude that stout was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his asserted incapacity to file his appeal by the deadline shown in his removal letter.accordingly,we vacate and remand with instructions that the board hold such a hearing.
background 
stout has suffered from cerebral palsy since birth.for some fifteen years,stout worked at the san bernardino,california branch of the internal revenue service irs or agency as a revenue agent.on august,the irs informed stout of his proposed removal.by letter dated september,he was removed from his position effective september.the removal letter enclosed a copy of the board regulations,and specified that t o be timely,an appeal to the board must be filed anytime during the period beginning with the day after the effective date of this action and ending thirty calendar days after that date.stout appeal was thus due no later than october.
stout filed his appeal with the board on december,on the appeal forms,stout indicated that he wanted a hearing.stout also explained the reason for the late filing as follows 
i went into a deep depression and the fact that i am disabled and lives alone just exaggerated matters.i relied on friends and family for support as i found it difficult to even get out of bed,not alone go to grocery shopping or fixed myself something to eat.i did not fill any important documents out timely consequently i am currently living financially off friends and credit cards 
as medical evidence of his condition,stout attached an october,letter from his psychiatrist,stating he had been treating stout at the kaiser permanente san bernardino psychiatry clinic since june,and opining that stout symptoms of depression and anxiety were caused by the stress at his work.
the administrative judge aj acknowledged receipt of stout appeal by order dated december,acknowledgment order.the aj explained that 
to establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness,you must identify the time period during which you suffered from the illness submit medical evidence showing that you suffered from the alleged illness during that time period and explain how the illness prevented you from timely filing your appeal or a request for an extension of time.lacy department of the navy.
on january,stout again requested a hearing on january,he submitted a written response to the acknowledgment order,stating 
at the time of appellant removal,he was diagnosed with severe depression and stress brought on by and exacerbated by his removal.during the three months following the removal,which took place on september,appellant continually suffered from severe depression,insomnia,and anxiety.as a result of the insomnia,stress,anxiety,and depression,appellant motor skills were increasingly diminished.he suffered from difficulty and at times inability to walk,drive a vehicle,and conduct other daily affairs as a result of the exacerbated condition.
stout maintained that these circumstances were beyond his control and affected his ability to comply with the time limits set forth by the board procedures.along with the written response,stout filed clinic progress records from kaiser permanente documenting his medical appointments between june,and december,and an initial evaluation form from the department of psychiatry at kaiser permanente dated june.
the irs responded on february,alleging that stout submission failed to establish that he still suffered from an illness during the relevant time frame,between october,the due date for stout appeal,and december,the date stout actually filed his appeal.the clinic progress records,the agency argued,showed rather that stout reported feeling better on november.similarly,the agency contended that on december,stout treating physician observed that he goes gambling,feels good,and has no complaints of depression.
the agency further claimed that stout pro se activities during the period of delay show that he was not mentally or physically unable to timely file his appeal or to request an extension of time to do so.the agency submitted an affidavit from an irs labor relations specialist,colleen blaikie blaikie,who testified that during the september to october time period,she had received several telephone calls from stout,marveen stout his mother,and linda gomez his friend gomez,regarding stout disability retirement and worker compensation applications.the agency also presented evidence that on november,stout requested that the office of worker compensation program owcp reconsider the denial of his benefits.the handwritten request for reconsideration,signed by stout,explained that 
d ue to my medical condition medicine from physician for work related stress termination,i have mentally not been able to complete any of the information or forms.
as of i was finely in a condition with the necessary help from a friend and district director to congress to complete all forms request for my workman comp.
the medication for my stress has not allowed me to be able to complete any of the necessary request or forms with out requesting help on my behalf.the additional termination from my federal job has added additional stress mentally and financially.i am under complete doctor care.
emphasis added.based upon stout november owcp filing and his alleged admission to owcp as to his improved condition,the agency reasoned that stout was able to file his appeal to the board at least by november.
on february,stout submitted additional materials,including a statement addressing the agency submissions,an affidavit from his mother,and affidavits from his friends and,gomez,jose martinez,and sheridan.stout alleged that his removal from the irs resulted in severe depression and stress,which exacerbated his cerebral palsy and rendered him both physically and mentally unable to realize that there was a time frame to appeal the removal.in response to the agency assertions that appellant or persons acting on his behalf contacted blaikie regarding his removal and benefits,stout represented that 
t he research,contact and pursuit of these benefits were conducted by my friend,linda gomez,whose affidavit demonstrates the quantity of help that she provided and my mother,marveen stout.in addition,the fax sent granting the agency permission to discuss the status of the claim was written by marveen stout and only signed by me.this information is verified by affidavit from each party.linda gomez also filed the workers compensation appeal on my behalf.
similarly,the gomez,martinez,and sheridan affidavits asserted that upon his termination from the irs,stout mental condition deteriorated,leaving him unable to complete the disability retirement and worker compensation forms without help from family and friends who performed all of the research necessary and actually wrote the submissions themselves.
on march,the aj dismissed stout appeal as untimely,finding that stout failed to show that his physical psychological condition s affected or impaired him to the point that he was unable to either file a timely appeal or request an extension of time within which to do so.initial decision at.the aj reasoned that the medical evidence submitted neither showed the incapacitating impact of stout psychological condition on his ability to manage his affairs nor explained the severity of his symptoms throughout the entire period of delay.
the aj further found that,given the substantial help stout received from his mother and gomez in completing and filing documents pertaining to his benefits,he has not shown that he could not have asked for help in pursuing his board appeal during the period after the removal was effected.id.citing marquez office of pers,dismissing an untimely appeal,stating,inter alia,that appellant was not so incapacitated that he could not have asked for assistance in appealing his case.
most importantly,the aj emphasized stout november,request for reconsideration to the owcp as significant circumstantial evidence that he was not physically or mentally incapable of filing his appeal to the board or requesting an extension of time to file the appeal from september through december.id.at citing gareis dep t of the interior,appellant failed to show that his mental and physical condition prevented him from filing a petition for review during the entire period of delay where appellant pursued other benefits during that period.the aj thus concluded that 
even if the appellant had shown that he was so impaired during the early portion of the relevant period september,through november,that he was prevented from filing an appeal or requesting an extension,and that he was unable to obtain any assistance in filing a timely appeal,i find that he was able to file his appeal as of november,and did not do so until december,a period of days.see jordan postal service,aff,table appellant failure to show that mental or physical condition prevented him from timely filing or requesting an extension during the entire period of the delay constituted a failure to show good cause to excuse the untimeliness.

the initial decision became final on november,when the board denied stout petition for review.b.stout timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction over appeals from all final decisions of the merit systems protection board under a,and heard oral argument on september.
discussion 
stout presents several arguments on appeal.stout contends,among other things,that the board improperly denied him a hearing on the timeliness of his appeal.as with any decision of the board,we must affirm the decision not to hold such a hearing unless the decision is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.because a hearing on the question of timeliness is not required by statute or regulation,whether to hold such a hearing is a matter of discretion with the board.see womack merit.prot,no abuse of discretion in denying a hearing on timeliness where no disputed issues of fact required resolution we thus review the board denial of an evidentiary hearing on the issue of timeliness for abuse of discretion.see hutchison merit.prot.
the board argues on appeal that no issues of material fact warranted a hearing on the timeliness of stout appeal.we disagree.the aj initial decision rested on two critical findings stout failed to show that he could not have asked for help in pursuing his board appeal during the period following his removal or at least during the days following november,and stout requested reconsideration of the denial of his worker compensation claim on november,demonstrating that he was not physically or mentally incapable of filing his appeal to the board as of that date.the latter finding led the aj to conclude that stout was not incapacitated throughout the entire period of delay,between october and december.
with regard to the first finding,we are troubled by the aj determination that stout had some obligation to show he was unable to request assistance from his family and friends in filing his board appeal when there is at least some evidence to suggest that stout mental condition precluded his comprehension of the filing deadline.in marquez,the appellant did not claim that he was unaware of the deadline to appeal the denial of his retirement annuity application.having filed his appeal two and a half years late,the appellant attempted to establish good cause for the delay simply by submitting a letter from his physician stating that appellant suffered from high blood pressure and arthritis.in dismissing the appeal as untimely,the board explained that the 
appellant claim of poor health alone is not sufficient to establish a medical condition that rendered him immobile and unable to function on his own behalf every day of the nearly year delay period.the appellant has not claimed that he could not leave his bed or that he was incapacitated to the point that he could not have asked someone to assist him in appealing his case.the appellant doctor has corroborated the appellant arthritis and high blood pressure but has not provided any analysis of the severity of these conditions.thus,the appellant has not shown that his poor health precluded him from taking any affirmative action to prosecute his appeal during the entire month period.
at emphasis added.
unlike the appellant in marquez,stout alleged he was not able to understand the procedures and deadline for appealing his removal.in fact,as the aj noted,stout averred that he was unable to even read the agency entire removal letter until reading it to his attorney over the telephone in december.information as to where and when to appeal,of course,comes at the end of a removal letter.in view of stout representations that he was not mentally sound enough to appreciate the filing deadline,the aj partial reliance on marquez is misplaced.while requests for assistance in filing an appeal are,in appropriate circumstances,considered as part of the good cause inquiry,an appellant knowledge or awareness of the filing deadline must form a prerequisite to such consideration.an appellant can not be taxed for failure to seek assistance with a deadline which he did not comprehend.accordingly,only if such knowledge is established does the inquiry turn to whether the appellant possessed the mental competence to ask for assistance.even then,an appellant must have capacity to do more than simply hand a removal letter to a relative and say,take care of this.he must also have the capacity to cooperate effectively with the relative so that the appeal can be filed.to the extent dictum in marquez can be read to the contrary,it is specifically disapproved.
in this case,stout asserted he was unable to comprehend that there was an october,deadline to appeal his removal from the irs.although the agency adduced no contrary evidence,it nonetheless suggested that stout must have known of the deadline because he received the removal notice setting forth the board appeal procedures via certified mail on september.moreover,the blaikie affidavit proffered by the agency stated that o n september,she received a telephone call from ken stout asking for a copy of the evidence file regarding his removal action.stout recognition of the filing deadline is thus in dispute.stout soundness of mind to ask for help also poses an evidentiary conflict.absent resolution of these factual disputes,the aj reliance on stout failure to ask his family and friends for assistance in filing his board appeal was improper.
the aj assumption that,considering all of the help that he received,stout failed to show he could not have asked for help is particularly unreasonable given stout affidavit testimony that she was not aware that stout could appeal his removal or had to appeal his removal within a certain timeframe and that she never read a copy of the removal notice.while the aj purported to credit this evidence,he nonetheless relied on the fact that stout mother did not expressly deny blaikie testimony that she had faxed stout a copy of stout removal notice on october.on petition for review,stout submitted a second affidavit from his mother,specifically denying that she had ever received a copy of her son removal letter from blaikie.while this second affidavit did not result in reconsideration of the board initial decision,it further establishes yet another factual dispute material to stout proffered good cause.
with regard to the board other critical findings,the record before us,although incomplete,also abounds with conflicting evidence and contrary inferences therefrom as to stout mental state.stout represented to the board that as a result of the severe depression and stress caused by his removal from the irs,he was both physically and mentally unable to realize that there was a time frame to appe
