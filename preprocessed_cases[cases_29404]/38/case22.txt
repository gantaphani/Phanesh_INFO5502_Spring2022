as an incentive to attorneys to bring supplemental security income ssi claims,the commissioner of the social security administration ssa,for more than a decade,has paid directly to qualified attorneys a fee of no more than percent of the successful recovery of benefits to clients.see.d b.when the federal government administers state supplementary payments for the state,that amount of state payments is included in benefits.see.but when the state chooses to administer its own payments,the state amounts are not included as benefits for the purpose of attorney compensation.see id.
so when massachusetts chose in to administer its own benefits,rather than rely on federal administration of its supplementary payments as it had done in the past,that had the effect of reducing the fees paid to attorneys representing massachusetts ssi claimants.the attorney here argues that the commissioner can not exclude state supplementary payments from the amount included in benefits.giving deference to the agency,as we must,we conclude the commissioner can do so.
we may and do make the assumption that we have federal appellate jurisdiction.we affirm the district court order granting summary judgment to the commissioner.
attorney marshall moriarty represented a client in a claim for ssi benefits before the ssa in.moriarty and his client had entered into an agreement in june,providing that,subject to the ssa approval,if ssa favorably decides the claim s,moriarty would receive a fee equal to the lesser of or the maximum allowable fee that,as of the date of this agreement,is.
in,moriarty client received a partially favorable decision,in which the ssa granted him in federal and state back payments.this amount included federal ssi payments the client was owed from november through april as well as massachusetts state supplementary payments from november through march the time period during which massachusetts state supplementary were federally administered.however,in april,massachusetts changed its practice and began administering its own program of supplementary payments.at that point,such payments were no longer included in the ssa calculation of back payments for purposes of payments to attorneys.
upon learning that the ssa attorney fee award did not include percent of the massachusetts state supplementary payments,moriarty wrote a letter to the ssa seeking in additional fees.the ssa office of the regional counsel moriarty informing him that benefits are calculated only on the basis of federally administered benefits and do not include state supplementation unless federally administered.
the commissioner position is that moriarty attorney fee award can be based only on the granted by the ssa,and so it can not include a percentage of the massachusetts state supplementary payments from april through april.if massachusetts had continued its prior practice of having the federal government administer the program,then moriarty would have gotten percent of the total state and federal payments.because massachusetts changed its practice,the commissioner says that not only will moriarty not receive the same amount of attorney fees but he is also forbidden to seek the shortfall.
in august,moriarty filed a complaint for declaratory relief and petition for writ of mandamus in the federal district court.the parties for summary judgment.on december,the district court entered judgment in favor of the commissioner.moriarty colvin,d.this appeal followed.
under title xvi of the social security act,the ssa administers ssi to eligible individuals who have attained age or are blind or disabled.id.states may choose to supplement federal ssi benefits with optional state supplementary payments.see bouchard sec y of health human,citing.massachusetts has chosen to do so.states providing these supplementary payments can administer the payments on their own or enter into an agreement with the commissioner under which the commissioner makes supplementary payments on the state behalf.see a b.states that administer their own supplementary payments may establish their own criteria for determining eligibility requirements as well as the amounts.c.
when states choose to have the federal government administer the state supplementary payments,the federal government assume s complete control over the administration of the payments.bouchard.at.these states then reimburse the federal government for the state portion of the payments disbursed and pay an administrative fee.see d.to be clear,the states do not hold separate hearings whether or not they use the federal government to administer their supplementary payments.see regs.the commissioner determination of eligibility for ssi benefits automatically qualifies the claimant for the state supplement.see id.the majority of states administer their own supplementary payments some states do not provide supplementary payments at all.
as originally enacted,the ssi program did not authorize the withholding of ssi benefits from the claimant award to pay the claimant attorney his or her fees in successful adjudications.see bowen galbreath.however,in,the social security protection act added a subparagraph to d,providing that when a claimant is awarded benefits,the commissioner of social security shall pay out of such benefits to such attorney the attorney fees,subject to certain limitations,a,stat,see a,d b.since,the commissioner has interpreted benefits under the ssi program as including any federally administered state payments,but not including supplementary payments administered by the state.temporary extension of attorney fee payment system to title xvi,codified at see also ssa program operations manual system gn b in a title xvi only claim,benefits are the total amount of federal and federally administered state payments accumulated to the claimant and his or her spouse because of a decision favorable to the claimant.accordingly,a percentage of state supplementary payments is not included as part of the attorney fees the ssa awards in states that administer their own supplementary payments.it is this percentage of the massachusetts state supplementary payments that moriarty seeks.
we address the commissioner argument that we lack subject matter jurisdiction to decide this case under,federal courts have jurisdiction to review agency action.see califano sanders.however,two statutes may potentially withdraw jurisdiction h,which provides no action against the united states,the commissioner of social security,or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section or of title to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.and a c,which provides the decision of the administrative law judge or other person conducting the review of the amount which would otherwise be the maximum attorney fee shall not be subject to further review.
the answer to the jurisdictional question is not clear.however,resolving this case on the merits by affirming the grant of summary judgment has the same consequences as concluding that we do not have jurisdiction.because the jurisdictional question is a question of statutory jurisdiction,not article iii jurisdiction,see parella ret.bd.of emps.ret,cir,we believe that this is a case in which we may and should bypass the jurisdictional question.royal siam chertoff,cir see also global naps,verizon new england,cir explaining that w hen confronted with challenges to jurisdiction,id.at,and the case readily can be resolved in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction,we may decline to decide the jurisdictional issues,id.at quoting restoration masonry,grove,cir.the commissioner agrees we have the authority to do so.
