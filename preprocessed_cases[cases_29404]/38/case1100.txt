the facts of this claim against a florida nursing home for neglect and abuse are simple and not in dispute.however,the question of law as to the interplay between the florida wrongful death act fwda and the federal medicare secondary payer statute msp is an issue of first impression in this court.
charles burke burke or decedent resided in a gainesville nursing home for approximately eighteen months.in november,burke was removed from the nursing home and admitted to a gainesville medical hospital.on january,he died in the hospital as a result of failure,secondary to sepsis and wound infection.during burke approximate three month hospital stay,the secretary of the department of health and human services secretary or hhs,on behalf of medicare,paid for burke medical care 
one of burke surviving children,carvondella bradley bradley,was named as personal representative of burke estate.bradley,on behalf of the estate and the ten surviving burke children,presented a wrongful death claim in a demand letter to burke nursing home and its liability insurance carrier,asserting nursing home abuse and neglect under florida law 
bradley settled the wrongful death tort claims for,the full amount of the nursing home liability insurance policy limits settlement was made without filing suit.burke nursing home tendered the settlement amount and bradley executed a release of all claims of the estate and the surviving children against the nursing home and its liability insurance carrier 
bradley notified the secretary of the settlement proceeds and associated legal fees and costs.the secretary refused to recognize that the medical expense claim had been settled for less than.she asserted that under the msp,b b ii,and its attendant regulations,c,the secretary had the authority to claim the total amount of medical expenses,less procurement costs,or a net amount of.the secretary gave the estate sixty days to pay medicare 
counsel for the children and the estate filed with the probate court an application for the court to adjudicate the rights of the estate and the rights of the children in regard to the compromised sum received in settlement of their claims see thompson hodson,so d,where the personal representative receives a nonspecific settlement offer in a wrongful death action,he or she is obligated to apportion the proceeds between the estate and the survivors in a reasonable and equitable manner or to seek court approval of an apportionment hess hess,so d.
counsel for the children and the estate gave adequate notice to medicare of the probate court proceedings and invited the secretary participation.the secretary declined to appear or to participate 
the state probate court ordered 
c the court after having heard sworn testimony on the potential value of each independent claim,and after calling on its own experience in the range of values each child claim potentially carried,finds that the values asserted by the personal representative counsel in this motion are reasonable,and the court adopts and specifically finds that each of the respective ten survivors claims holds a value of at least.the court notes that medicare has asserted a claim of lien based upon payments of.therefore,the court finds that the total,full value of this case had the total,full value been collectible.
d based upon principles of equity,the court determines the medical expense recovery in the instant cause is.the court has calculated such figure based on such component contribution to the total full value,if such value were collectible.the court has not prioritized the recovery of medical expenses over the recovery on each of the respective survivors claims.further,the court determines the independent survivors claims recovery in the instant cause is.the court has likewise calculated such figure based on all survivors claims contributions to the total,full value.the court has likewise not prioritized the recovery on each of the respective survivors claims over the recovery of medical expenses.
emphasis added.
the secretary refused to accept the probate court determination that she would only recover.relying upon language contained in a document entitled medicare secondary payer manual,the secretary responded that she would not recognize the probate court allocation of liability payments to losses unless and until payment was based on a court order issued on the merits of the controversy.see msp manual cms pub.chapter,where t he only situation in which medicare recognizes allocations of liability payments to losses is when payment is based on a court order on the merits of the case 
the secretary contended that the probate court decision was merely advisory in nature or superceded by federal law.the estate paid medicare under protest,perfected its administrative appeal,and exhausted its administrative remedies 
the case proceeded as an appeal to the district court from a final decision of the secretary,wherein the surviving children filed their brief in opposition to the secretary decision,the secretary filed her brief in support of her final decision,and the case became ripe for district court review.
the district court,adopting the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge,held that the secretary interpretation of the msp,b b ii,and its attending regulations,c,c,c,was reasonable.the district court also relied heavily upon the language contained in the medicare field manual.accordingly,the district court held that medicare was entitled to reimbursement in the amount of,not,for conditional medical expense payments paid on behalf of the decedent.this appeal follows.
we review de novo the district court interpretation of the msp federal statute in relation to the fwda as a question of law over which this court review is plenary.see united states endotec,cir.in reviewing the district court analysis of the secretary decision,we may reverse the district court if its decision is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,not in accordance with law,or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole.health,health human,cir citations omitted.
the burke surviving children contend that the fwda controls.as previously stated,under florida law,in a recovery for wrongful death action,children of the decedent may recover for lost parental companionship,instruction,and guidance and for mental pain and suffering from the date of injury.stat.the fwda contemplates that damages allowed an estate are separate and distinct from damages recoverable by the deceased survivors.see hartford ins.goff,so d,south shore hosp.easton,so d.florida courts have repeatedly held that proceeds from a wrongful death action are not for the benefit of the estate,rather,that they are the property of the survivors and compensation for their loss.see scott estate of myers,so d,continental nat.bank brill,so d.here the children right of action under the fwda is an individual property right,not derived from the estate 
the secretary relies upon the msp,enacted in to reduce federal health care costs by transforming medicare from the primary payer to the secondary payer,with a right of reimbursement.see united states baxter int l,cir.the msp makes medicare the secondary payer for medical services provided to medicare beneficiaries whenever payment is available from another primary payer.cochran health care financing,cir.this means that if payment for covered services has been or is reasonably expected to be made by someone else,medicare does not have to pay see b a i such payment is conditioned on medicare right to reimbursement if a primary plan later pays or is found to be responsible for payment of the item or service.id.nowhere in the definition of primary plan are listed surviving children with tort property beneficiary rights.id.
in this case,bradley,as personal representative,on behalf of the estate and the ten surviving burke children,settled wrongful death claims for abuse and neglect brought under the fwda with the nursing home and its liability insurance carrier.the total,undifferentiated amount of the settlement was.the issue of first impression in this case is therefore whose property is the settlement the settlement involved the medical expenses and costs recovered by the estate and subject to the msp statute,along with the,tort property claims of the surviving burke children for lost parental companionship,under state law,and not subject to the msp statute 
under florida law,any claim of the estate is separate and distinct from the claim of a survivor.all loss of consortium or companionship recoveries are the property of the person who incurred the loss.not the secretary of hhs.a child loss of parental companionship claim is a property right belonging to the child.not the secretary of hhs.the burke children loss of parental companionship claims do not include the decedent medical expenses,as a claim for medical expenses belongs only to the estate.only the estate allocated share of the proceeds is subject to the province of the secretary 
there is a particularly troubling contained in this appeal.here counsel for the estate and for the survivors,out of an abundance of caution,notified the secretary of the in settlement proceeds recovered,and invited her view as to the proper division of the funds in an adversarial probate court proceeding.the secretary asserted that she was entitled to the total amount of medical expenses,less procurement costs 
at this point,the conflicting claims to the fund had never been made the subject of any court proceeding counsel properly turned to the florida probate court for a proration,filing an application with the probate court to adjudicate the rights of the estate and rights of the children the rights of the secretary to the compromised sum received in settlement of the claims 
the secretary declined to take any part in the litigation although at all times her position was adverse to the interests of the surviving children.the probate court made the allocation,finding that the secretary should recover the sum of.yet,still,the secretary,citing no statutory authority,no regulatory authority,and no case law authority,merely relied upon the language contained in one of its many field manuals and declined to respect the decision of the probate court.
in essence,the secretary is asserting that its field manual is entitled to deference under chevron,natural resources defense council.the supreme court has stated that agency interpretations contained in policy statements,manuals,and enforcement guidelines are not entitled to the force of law.united states r f properties of lake county,cir citing christensen harris county,ordinarily policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,all of which lack the force of not warrant deference see shalala guernsey memorial,definition in hhs medicare provider reimbursement manual is a prototypical example of an interpretive rule that does not require notice and comment,and therefore do es not have the force and effect of law and is not accorded that weight in the adjudicatory process we conclude that the deference given to the language in the field manual in this case by the secretary and the district court is misplaced.
counsel for the survivors and the estate acted sensibly,in a manner.the nursing home neglect claim was settled for the full value of the available insurance.clearly,if the language of the field manual applied,in practice,it would lead to an absurd result forcing counsel to file a lawsuit would incur additional costs,further diminishing the already paltry sum available for settlement.this flies in the face of judicial and public policy.
the secretary position is unsupported by the statutory language of the msp and its attending regulations.the secretary ipse dixit contained in the field manual does not control the law.the district court also erred in relying upon the advisory language contained in a field manual as the rationale for its opinion upholding the actions of the secretary.
there is a second reason that the secretary position,as adopted by the district court,is in error.historically,there is a strong public interest in the expeditious resolution of lawsuits through settlement.see,hines anchor motor freight,mcdermott,amclyde.throughout history,our law has encouraged settlements.see united states industries,cir.trailer equip.deal,cir delancy paul fire marine ins,cir johnson occidental fire and cas.of north carolina.cir the secretary position would have a chilling effect on settlement.the secretary position compels plaintiffs to force their tort claims to trial,burdening the court system.it is a financial disincentive to accept otherwise reasonable settlement offers.it would allow tortfeasors to escape responsibility 
without citing any statutory authority,regulatory authority,or case law authority,the secretary and the district court reliance upon language in a field manual is unpersuasive the secretary is not entitled to any share of the burke surviving children loss of parental companionship claims 
under our de novo review,we conclude that the district court erred in upholding the decision of the secretary because it was unsupported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole.see.health,at.we reverse,finding the secretary entitled to the sum of,as determined by the allocations of the probate court,and remand to the district court for further proceedings.
reversed and remanded with instructions.

i would affirm the decision of the district court in this case,and therefore i write in dissent.like the district court,i recognize that when this court reviews the decisions of the secretary of health and human services,we must abide by those decisions unless they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,not in accordance with law,or unsupported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole.med.ctr.of clearwater,sebelius,wl,at cir,quoting alacare home health,sullivan,cir alteration and internal quotation marks omitted.under this standard,i believe we are required to abide by the actions taken by secretary sebelius here.
as the majority notes,the facts of this case are straightforward burke developed severe bed sores while he was in the care of a nursing home facility.he was hospitalized,and eventually succumbed to failure secondary to sepsis and wound infection.medicare conditionally paid for his hospital treatment,subject to reimbursement from any payment made by the nursing home liability insurance carrier.after the plaintiffs,through the personal representative of burke estate,received an undifferentiated settlement of from the nursing home insurer,medicare requested that it be reimbursed for burke medical expenses.rather than administratively appeal the agency initial determination,however,the plaintiffs proceeded to the probate court of alachua county,florida,which simply adopted the plaintiffs proposed allocation of a mere to medicare and the remaining to themselves.the secretary was never made a party to that proceeding.the probate court received no evidence nor any adversarial presentation.
applying the express provisions of the agency medicare secondary payer manual,the secretary declined to recognize the probate court allocation because it was not based on a determination of the merits of the case.the medicare secondary payer manual is a lengthy and comprehensive agency manual governing the complex workings of the medicare secondary payer program and reflects the longstanding policy of the agency.while the majority opinion is correct when it says that such policy statements and guidance interpretations are not entitled to the force of law,it ignores what is required of us in the way of deference to agency interpretations of the complex statutory and regulatory schemes they administer.statements and guidance interpretations such as the medicare secondary payer manual reflect a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance,fed.express holowecki,quoting bragdon abbott,and they should not be lightly disregarded.in my view,the secretary interpretation of the medicare secondary payer statute and regulations embodied in the manual is entitled to some deference see also,united states mead,explaining that agency interpretations may merit some deference given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to the agency and the value of uniformity in its administrative and judicial understandings of what a national law requires quoting skidmore swift.because i find the agency guidance sufficiently persuasive on the record before us,i would affirm the secretary decision under the deferential standard of review applicable to our review of agency decisions.

at the time,no allocation was made in regard to the settlement lump sum as to the wrongful death claims of the ten surviving children,and the claim of the estate.in view of the limited insurance coverage,no evidence in the record of other nursing home assets,and the ever present hazards of trial,counsel for the estate and the children determined that the policy limit settlement was a practical and efficient alternative to filing suit.no party in this record has suggested that this settlement was not a reasonable disposition,though it obviously represented a considerably diminished compromise.there is speculation in the record that the potential value of the loss of companionship claims to the children was estimated to be over,or per child.at the time,no allocation was made in regard to the settlement lump sum as to the wrongful death claims of the ten surviving children,and the claim of the estate.in view of the limited insurance coverage,no evidence in the record of other nursing home assets,and the ever present hazards of trial,counsel for the estate and the children determined that the policy limit settlement was a practical and efficient alternative to filing suit.no party in this record has suggested that this settlement was not a reasonable disposition,though it obviously represented a considerably diminished compromise.there is speculation in the record that the potential value of the loss of companionship claims to the children was estimated to be over,or per child.
