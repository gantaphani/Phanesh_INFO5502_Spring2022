maria pinto appeals the denial of her claims for social security disability benefits under and for supplemental social security income disability benefits under.although the administrative law judge alj found that pinto speaks very little english and that she can not bend or stoop more than occasionally,he concluded that she could perform her past relevant work.because her past work does not comport with these restrictions either as actually performed or as generally performed,we remand for further factual findings.
maria pinto applied for disability insurance benefits in,claiming that she was unable to work due to left foot pain,hypertension,and depression.after her claim was denied through administrative proceedings,pinto requested a hearing before an alj.through an interpreter at the hearing,pinto testified that she was born in el salvador in,attended school there only until the third grade,and arrived in america in.she lives with her son and and their children.she speaks very little english 
from her arrival in america until april,pinto worked as a hand packager at dolores canning.as actually performed,her job required her to engage in bending constantly.the alj found that pinto could stoop,climb,and balance only occasionally.
at her hearing,the following exchange took place between the alj and the vocational expert 
q assume we have an individual of the same profile as pinto and an individual currently years of age with minimal education in another country.an individual who is neither litera te in e nglish nor able to communicate in e nglish and work experience as you described.now,assume first that the individual had the following limitations only.first that the individual could lift pounds occasionally,and pounds frequently,could stand and walk hours out of an hour day and at least hours at a time.no impairment noted in sitting,and the only impairments noted were that climbing,balancing,stooping,kneeling,crouching and crawling were said to be limited as occasionally in your opinion as a vocational expert,would the individual as described in the hypothetical be able to perform past work as a hand packager 
q all right,and the restriction,i guess particularly the issue would be stooping would particularly be an issue with that job 
a you r honor,the occupation of hand packager requires stooping according to the dictionary of occupational titles on a negligible basis.b ased on my own experience,i would modify that to say occasional.
q okay,all right,so at least as the job is generally performed it requires only occasional stoopin a nd the other postural requirements that i recited to your earlier 
a the other postural requirements are negligible.
not discussed at the hearing was the fact that,according to the definition of hand packager in the dictionary of occupational titles,the job requires an ability to r ecognize the meaning of two or words,c ompare similarities and differences between words and between series of numbers,and write and speak simple,grammatically correct sentences dot appendix c iii.the alj also failed to mention that uncontroverted evidence indicated that pinto job as actually performed at dolores canning required constant stooping and bending.
apparently basing his decision on the above exchange,the alj came to the following conclusion 
the claimant is sic years old and has a third grade education.she is illiterate in english.given her vocational profile and residual functional capacity as previously stated,the vocational expert testified that claimant could return to her past relevant work as a hand packager.therefore,for the reason that claimant can return to her past relevant work,i find that she is not disabled.
the commissioner of social security adopted the findings of the alj.after the appeals council declined pinto request for review of the alj decision,she appealed to district court for the central district of california.the parties consented to the case being heard by a magistrate judge.that court affirmed the alj ruling.this timely appeal followed.
we review de novo a district court order upholding the commissioner denial of benefits.schneider commissioner of social sec,cir.we may set aside a denial of benefits if it is not supported by substantial evidence or it is based on legal error.morgan commissioner of soc.sec,cir citations and quotations omitted.
the alj determination was made at step four of a disability determination process.at step four,claimants have the burden of showing that they can no longer perform their past relevant work.e and e clem sullivan,cir.once they have shown this,the burden at step five shifts to the secretary to show that,taking into account a claimant age,education,and vocational background,she can perform any substantial gainful work in the national economy.f and f.moore apfel,cir.
although the burden of proof lies with the claimant at step four,the alj still has a duty to make the requisite factual findings to support his conclusion.ssr.see and,and,and this is done by looking at the residual functional capacity and the physical and mental demands of the claimant past relevant work.e and e the claimant must be able to perform 
the actual functional demands and job duties of a particular past relevant job or 
the functional demands and job duties of the occupation as generally required by employers throughout the national economy.
ssr.this requires specific findings as to the claimant residual functional capacity,the physical and mental demands of the past relevant work,and the relation of the residual functional capacity to the past work.ssr.
pinto argues that the alj committed reversible error when he indicated in his questioning of the vocational expert that he was basing his decision only on whether pinto could perform her past relevant work as generally performed without making a finding about her past relevant work as actually performed.we have never required explicit findings at step four regarding a claimant past relevant work both as generally performed and as actually performed.the vocational expert merely has to find that a claimant can or can not continue his or her past relevant work as defined by the regulations above.see villa heckler,t he claimant has the burden of proving an inability to return to his former type of work and not just to his former job.
this is not to say,however,that the alj is in any way relieved of his burden to make the appropriate findings to insure that the claimant really can perform his or her past relevant work.this case vividly demonstrates the difficulty for the reviewing court where sufficient findings are not made.according to the facts before this court and the alj assessment of pinto limitations or restrictions,ssr,pinto physical restrictions prevent her from continuing her past work as actually performed,and her language restrictions prevent her from continuing her past work as generally performed.
we do not know whether the alj conclusion that pinto could perform her past relevant work addressed her work as actually or generally performed.the regulations advise an alj to first consider past work as actually performed,and then as usually performed.id.we will proceed in a similar manner.
social security regulations name two sources of information that may be used to define a claimant past relevant work as actually performed a properly completed vocational report,ssr,and the claimant own testimony,ssr.pinto provided both of these,and both indicated that her job at dolores canning required constant standing,bending and stooping in fact,she would stand for the entire shift packing and lifting boxes.nothing was introduced into the record to contradict this testimony,and the alj did not make any adverse findings.however,the alj did find that pinto could not stoop,climb,or balance,more than occasionally.this finding is contrary to a conclusion that pinto could continue her past work as actually performed.occasionally does not mean constantly.
turning to the question of pinto past relevant work as generally performed,we begin by observing that the best source for how a job is generally performed is usually the dictionary of occupa
