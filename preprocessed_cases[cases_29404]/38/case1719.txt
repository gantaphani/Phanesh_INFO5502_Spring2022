in a notice to vacate dated march,the agency informed petitioner that he had days to quit,vacate,and deliver up possession of the premises.on may,pursuant to a disposition and development agreement,the agency sold the property to a private developer named irving moskowitz.in a certified letter dated may,beryl weiner,counsel for moskowitz,advised petitioner about the transfer of title.
in her correspondence,attorney weiner referenced the agency notice to vacate and stated that the period ended on june.counsel further stated,you were previously informed that moskowitz is willing to permit you to remain in possession for a longer period of time,subject to your vacating the premises on a notice.however,until an agreement in writing is signed between moskowitz and you,you will be required to vacate the premises by june.

also on june,the agency relocation agent,kalian associates,sent frank bartha a letter confirming a june conversation.a copy of the letter was sent to petitioner.the relocation agent apprised bartha that a letter regarding a change in ownership of the premises had been sent to petitioner in error by moskowitz attorney.the letter should have been sent to bartha instead,in that he was the master lessee.with respect to relocation benefits,the relocation agent stated that a s far as relocation benefits are concerned,i stated to you that in that letter an offer of extension of tenancy was made to kong.i suggested that you should meet with kong and find our sic if he is planning to pursue this offer of extension.you would be involved in this process since you are the master lessee.if you and kong agree with the new owner on the extension terms,you will continue to pay rent and kong can continue in business at that location.at the conclusion of the extension term,kong will be eligible for relocation benefits.at that time the remaining term of your lease will be evaluated and a determination will be made if it has any value.italics added.
the relocation agent also informed frank bartha that,since their conversation,he had met with petitioner,who was very interested in applying for the extension past june.petitioner told the relocation agent that he had contacted bartha and the new owner in order to make arrangements for an extension agreement.
on june,frank bartha,as tenant,executed a new lease with moskowitz,as landlord.moskowitz signed the lease on june.the lease was for a term of one year and was subject to termination upon six months notice.as a result,petitioner remained on the premises,conducting business as the barthas sublessee.
on february,kalian associates sent petitioner a number of referrals for possible replacement sites.in a letter dated february,moskowitz gave petitioner and frank bartha notice that the current term of his lease with bartha would end on april,and that he would not renew the lease for another term.in a responsive letter dated march,petitioner advised moskowitz that his notice of nonrenewal was insufficient to terminate the lease,in that he had failed to give him the required six months notice.in petitioner view,the lease consequently had renewed automatically for another term.
thereafter,in a letter dated april,moskowitz informed frank bartha and petitioner that he was giving notice that he was terminating the lease agreement that he executed in june with bartha as of six months from the date of this notice.the lease therefore was slated to end on october.
on april,petitioner wrote to moskowitz,telling him that his april letter and notice of termination was unacceptable.among other things,petitioner claimed that moskowitz was required to give six months notice before the current term of the lease ended.
on october,attorney weinberger informed frank bartha in writing that the notice period for termination of the lease that was signed between bartha and irving moskowitz,has expired.demand is hereby made that the premises be vacated immediately.in particular demand is hereby made that you have your subtenant,veisna kong,vacate the premises so that possession thereof may be delivered immediately to moskowitz.attorney weinberger further advised that unlawful detainer proceedings would be instituted if the premises were not vacated immediately.when petitioner failed to leave the premises,moskowitz filed an action for unlawful detainer against the barthas and petitioner.moskowitz prevailed and a writ of possession of real property was issued.on december,petitioner was evicted from the premises.he has since relocated his donut business.
on july,petitioner filed a claim with the agency for relocation benefits in the amount of.on august,petitioner forwarded a second letter to the agency,requesting a meeting with the agency appeal board.petitioner also had several telephone conversations with the agency agents or employees regarding his claim for relocation benefits.
procedural background 
on september,petitioner filed a verified petition for writ of mandate,along with supporting memorandum of points and authorities.although petitioner cited code of civil procedure section,thereby characterizing his writ as one for administrative mandate,the trial court treated his petition as one for traditional mandate under code of civil procedure section petitioner asked that a writ be issued,directing the city to pay him the costs he incurred in relocating his donut shop.petitioner also filed a request,asking the trial court to take judicial notice of three los angeles superior court cases involving other tenants on the veady property that were forced to vacate in due to the agency acquisition of the property.
in december,the agency filed its answer to the petition for writ of mandate.in january,the agency filed its opposition to the writ petition,as well as a request that the trial court take judicial notice of the first amended complaint for inverse condemnation and precondemnation damages filed by petitioner in kong city of hawaiian gardens redevelopment agency super,county,no.finally,the agency filed an objection to kong request for judicial notice.
thereafter,petitioner filed what he entitled administrative record.on january,in response to the agency opposition,petitioner filed a reply and supplemental brief in support of his writ petition and a separate declaration of his attorney,anthony parrille,which included as one of the exhibits excerpts from the deposition of leonard chaidez.this deposition testimony was taken in moskowitz meat and provisions,super,county,no,an unrelated action.
the agency objected to petitioner purported administrative record on the ground that it was untimely and no foundation had been laid for any of the exhibits contained therein.it also argued that review by way of administrative mandate code civ,was inappropriate.the proper avenue was traditional mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section.in addition,the agency objected to attorney parrille declaration and the deposition excerpts of leonard chaidez on the ground that they were untimely.with regard to the exhibits,the agency further argued that they were irrelevant and that no foundation had been laid.
at the hearing on petitioner writ petition,the trial court observed that petitioner administrative record was not a proper administrative record.the court noted,as it had observed in its tentative decision,most of the documents in the administrative record could be made admissible with a declaration from petitioner.the trial court did not want to waste everyone time and efforts.it noted,however,that if the agency insisted on strict compliance,it would sustain its objections and continue the matter to give petitioner time to lay an appropriate foundation.in light of the trial court indication that it was prepared to make a ruling on the merits,the agency subsequently withdrew its objections to the administrative record.
the trial court denied petitioner request for judicial notice,concluding that the other cases were irrelevant.the court granted the agency request for judicial notice regarding petitioner inverse condemnation case and admitted the evidence by reference as well as exhibits to the various pleadings filed.lastly,the trial court sustained the agency objections to attorney parrille declaration and leonard chaidez deposition testimony.
on january,the trial court denied petitioner request for writ relief.it further ordered that its tentative decision be filed and deemed its statement of decision.the court found that petitioner kong received notification of his possible eligibility for relocation benefits on july,and a notice to vacate on march.prior to having to vacate,however,the property was sold to irving moskowitz.kong,as per his sublease with sublessors frank and dorothy bartha,continued to occupy the property and to operate bartha donuts for the duration of his sublease.indeed,it was not until december year after kong sublease with the barthas had expired,and at least months after the barthas lease with moskowitz had kong vacated the property.kong has thus failed to establish that he vacated the property as a direct result of respondent agency acquisition of the property over years earlier.that frank bartha cc to petitioner was advised in a letter of june,that kong might want to pursue an extension of the term during which he could still be eligible for relocation benefits does not mean that kong is entitled to benefits now,over years later,for being forced to vacate at the expiration of his sublease.indeed,the letter in question contemplates circumstances in which,at the very least,kong vacated before the expiration of bartha lease.the court therefore concluded that petitioner failed to establish that he is a displaced person within the meaning of,et,or that respondent agency has a clear,present,ministerial duty to pay him relocation benefits.
on february,in its amended judgment denying petition for writ of mandate,the trial court denied the petition for the reasons set for th in the court written statement of decision incorporated herein by reference.in addition,judgment was entered in favor of the agency.
contention 
petitioner contends he was a displaced person entitled to relocation benefits.we agree.

the resolution of this appeal is not governed by the substantial evidence standard of review as the agency maintains.rather,the trial court findings are subject to our independent review,in that the decisive facts are undisputed.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.stated otherwise,because this case requires the application of law to undisputed facts,we review the trial court decision de novo.see harustak wilkins th,d,jv city and county of san francisco th,d metric man,unemployment ins.appeals bd.th,d.moreover,we review the trial court result,not its reasons.economic empowerment foundation quackenbush th,fn,d.
