the underlying issue in this case is whether a citizen applying for disability benefits under the social security act has satisfied an exception to the general rule that alien beneficiaries can not receive benefits if they have resided outside the united states for six consecutive calendar months,t a t.as the case comes to this court on appeal from a judgment affirming the denial of benefits following a remand to the social security administration ssa,it involves an unauthorized remand by the district court to an agency that failed to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities to assist the applicant.notwithstanding these procedural errors,because the claimant has failed to make a prima facie showing that he was entitled to receive benefits,we affirm the judgment affirming the agency denial of benefits.
the qualification for benefits at issue revolves around the claimant assertion that he had worked the requisite time in qualified employment to come within an exception to the general ban on alien beneficiaries receiving benefits.title ii of the social security act,et,provides monthly insurance benefits to qualified individuals who the ssa determines are unable to work because of a disability.see also id.at.whether a person qualifies for benefits depends largely on whether he has acquired the requisite number of quarters of coverage,or qcs.see id.at a.for calendar years since,the number of qcs that a worker earns is based on a comparison of his total covered earnings to the amount designated in ssa regulations as sufficient to qualify for one qc during that year.c,a see also pt,subpt.b,app.thus,a worker earns one qc if his total covered earnings equal the amount designated in the regulations as sufficient to qualify for one qc during that year,and a worker receives two qcs by earning twice the amount specified in the regulations for a single qc.a.a worker can not earn more than four qcs in any given year,but because the system is based on total annual earnings,an individual need not work the entire year to earn four qcs.for instance,a person could work for one quarter of the calendar year and earn four qcs if his covered earnings during that period were four times the amount required by regulation for one qc.similarly,a person could earn two qcs if his covered earnings were twice the amount required for one qc whether he worked for three days or half of the year or for the full calendar year.
importantly,only earnings that are covered under social security count toward the calculation of a worker qcs.see id.at.work performed within the united states is generally covered,subject to a few exceptions.id.at.the earnings of students who work as employees of the school they are attending,for example,are not covered under social security.id.at.likewise,work performed by foreign students attending school in the united states is excluded from employment that is covered for purposes of calculating qcs.id.at.
additional provisions of the social security act apply to citizens attempting to receive disability insurance benefits.as pertinent here,t of the act provides that alien beneficiaries can not receive benefits for any month that occurs after they have been outside the united states for six consecutive calendar months.t a see also a.this provision has two relevant exceptions an alien beneficiary who has accrued at least forty qcs,or who has resided in the united states for a period totaling at least ten years,is eligible for benefits regardless of his absence from the united states.t see also b i.these two exceptions to the nonpayment provision do not apply,however,if the beneficiary is a citizen of a foreign country that has a social insurance or pension program of general application,t,or if the beneficiary resides in a foreign country to which the mailing of government benefits is prohibited,t.
an individual who is certified as disabled by the ssa,pursuant to,must file an application to receive benefits.as part of the application,the claimant must provide the ssa with evidence of eligibility.id.at.by definition,evidence is any record,document,or signed statement that helps to show whether the claimant is eligible for benefits.id.at.with regard to proof of a claimant earnings,however,the only conclusive evidence is an official statement of earnings provided by the ssa,which maintains an earnings record for each person whose employment is covered under the social security program.c a.if there is an error in the earnings record,it may be corrected pursuant to.a claimant,or his legal representative,can obtain,on request,a copy of the claimant official ssa earnings statement from the agency free of charge.see c a,a a,b.
narayanan krishnan appeals on behalf of his brother and next friend,narayanan deviprasad the district court affirmance of ssa denial of disability benefits to the claimant on the basis of his failure to meet an exception to the general rule that alien beneficiaries can not receive benefits if they have resided outside the united states for six consecutive calendar months.t a t.the brother also appeals the denial of his motion to vacate its earlier remand allowing ssa to supplement the administrative record on which it based its eligibility decision.through appointed counsel the brother urges the court not only to reverse the judgment of the district court,but also to provide equitable relief in the form of disability benefits to the claimant.we hold that the district court erred in remanding the case to ssa,and that ssa violated its regulations.these errors,however,are insufficient to overcome the fact that the original administrative record demonstrates the claimant ineligibility for benefits hence,the cases on which his brother relies for equitable relief are inapposite.
the claimant is a citizen of india who came to the united states on august,to pursue a masters degree at worcester polytechnic institute polytechnic.from september through may,when he graduated,the claimant worked as a teaching assistant at polytechnic.following graduation,he worked in the united states as a computer software engineer.in may,the claimant was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.over the next five years,he traveled to india periodically for psychiatric treatment and evaluation,but he suffered relapses each time he returned to the united states.since april,the claimant has been living in india continuously,where he remains in the care of his brother.
the claimant filed an application for social security disability insurance benefits on may,on the basis of disability stemming from schizophrenia.ssa psychiatrist agreed that the claimant suffers from paranoid schizophrenia,and determined that his disability began april.by a memorandum of february,ssa advised the american consulate in bombay of its disability determination,and requested that the claimant physician in india and his brother complete the forms necessary to process the benefits claim.the american consulate responded on april,by submitting paperwork to the ssa that showed that the claimant condition is permanent and deteriorating that he is a resident of india and that he had been living outside the united states since april,had no plans to return to the united states,and had authorized his brother to serve as his payee.
on october,the ssa informed the claimant that his disability claim had been awarded,effective february,but that payments to him had been suspended,pursuant to t,because he had been residing outside the united states for more than six months.the claimant requested reconsideration of the ssa decision,asserting that he had earned qcs.to support his claim,the claimant attached to his request a handwritten chart with his place of work and earnings by year.in a series of administrative appeals,ssa rejected the claim,failing on three separate occasions to respond directly to the claimant assertion of qcs.first,by letter dated february,the director of ssa office of disability and international operations denied reconsideration because the claimant had not satisfied any of the exceptions to the general rule that benefit payments are not made to aliens who have lived outside the united states for more than six months.second,an administrative law judge alj,on september,denied an appeal on the grounds that the claimant had not lived in the united states for the last six months and did not qualify under any exceptions to the residency requirement.third,in february,the appeals council denied a request for review on the same grounds,rendering the alj decision the final decision of ssa.in the latter two appeals,the claimant had requested counsel,but none appeared on his behalf.
the brother of the claimant filed suit on august.the district court appointed counsel for the brother,and the parties filed for summary judgment.the brother argued that because the claimant had more than forty qcs,he qualified under an exception to the general bar against paying benefits to alien beneficiaries.ssa countered that the claimant had not accrued forty qcs,and submitted,as evidence,computerized extracts of his work history that had not been included in the administrative record,purporting to show that the claimant had accrued only thirty qcs.at a hearing,the brother argued that he was entitled to a judgment on the administrative record,while ssa argued that the case should be remanded for good cause so that it could supplement the record with the certified extracts of the claimant work history.the brother responded that there was no good cause for ssa failure to include the earnings history in the original administrative record.on september,over the brother objection,the district court ruled that the new evidence counsels in favor of additional agency proceedings,and because there was good cause shown,remanded the case pursuant to sentence six of section g of the social security act,g.krishnan apfel,at,emphasis added.
on remand,an alj held a hearing on march,at which the brother,who was represented by counsel,submitted documents,including pay stubs from the claimant work at polytechnic,purporting to show that the claimant had earned qcs.ssa submitted the computerized employment extracts it had first brought to the district court,and argued that because social security taxes were not withheld from money paid to the claimant for his work at polytechnic,he had earned less than forty qcs.by decision of april,the alj agreed with ssa,finding that the claimant had earned less than forty qcs because o n campus work which is done by foreign students is excluded from employment a.
the district court affirmed ssa remand decision.krishnan massanari,d.rejecting the brother position that he was entitled to judgment based on the original administrative record,the court noted that the administrative record had not included a printout of the claimant earnings record a standard exhibit in the administrative record of nearly every disability case.id.at.upon reviewing the supplemented administrative record on remand,the court found that substantial evidence supported the alj decision that the claimant had not accrued forty qcs.accordingly,the district court denied the brother motion for summary judgment and motion to vacate the earlier remand.
on appeal,the brother renews his contention that the claimant qualified for benefits under an exception to the nonpayment provision for alien beneficiaries because the claimant had earned more than forty qcs,and contends that the district court remand under sentence six was unlawful and that he is entitled to benefits based on the original administrative record.
section g,which governs judicial review of final ssa decisions,authorizes only two types of remands those pursuant to sentence four and those pursuant to sentence six.melkonyan sullivan,d.under sentence four,a district court may remand for further proceedings in conjunction with a judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing the decision of the commissioner.g.a remand is entirely different.sullivan finkelstein,d.the district court does not affirm,modify,or reverse the commissioner decision it does not rule in any way as to the correctness of the administrative determination.melkonyan,at.at.rather,the district court remands either because the commissioner requested a remand before filing his answer,or there is new evidence which is material and there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.g see also shalala schaefer,d.the principal feature that distinguishes the two types of remands is that in a remand,the district court disposes of the action by a final judgment and relinquishes jurisdiction,whereas in a remand,the district court retains jurisdiction over the action pending further development by the agency.id.at.at.a remand is therefore appealable,finkelstein,at.at,while a remand is considered interlocutory and thus.accordingly,in a remand,there is no final judgment until ssa returns to the district court to file ssa additional or modified findings of fact and decision,g,and the district court enters a judgment.melkonyan,at.at.
the brother and ssa are in agreement on appeal that the district court erred when it remanded his case under sentence six of g without finding the statutory prerequisites.on de novo review,herbert acad.of,cuddy carmen,we agree.neither of the conditions for a remand were met.ssa did not file a motion to remand before answering the complaint,and neither the district court nor the parties pointed to any new evidence omitted from the administrative record for good cause shown.evidence is new only if it was not in existence or available at the time of the administrative proceeding.finkelstein,at.at see also melkonyan,at.at.here,the evidence to be added on remand ssa computerized extracts of the claimant earnings and any pay stubs or other information in the claimant possession had been available from the beginning of the administrative proceedings.the district court remand under sentence six was therefore erroneous.
nor can we sanitize the district court error,as ssa contends,by holding that the district court could have entered a remand.the district court made no substantive ruling on the correctness of ssa decision,which is a necessary prerequisite to a remand,melkonyan,at.at.neither did the court relinquish its jurisdiction over the litigation.its order stated that the court maintains jurisdiction over this action pending completion of the additional agency proceedings,and directed the parties to appear for a status conference by a date certain.to conclude that despite the plain language of the court order,the remand nevertheless could have been entered pursuant to sentence four,not only threatens to render the statutory language of that sentence meaningless,but also threatens to create a judicial quagmire for a remand might have left the district court without jurisdiction to enter the judgment now on appeal.
ssa reliance on richmond chater,cir,to overcome the jurisdictional implications of a remand,is misplaced the only issue in richmond was whether the appellate court had jurisdiction to reach the merits of the appeal,id.at,and the court was not presented with a remand under either sentence four or sentence six.in richmond,the district court had remanded a benefits claim case to ssa without indicating whether the remand was issued under sentence four or six,and without entering a final judgment affirming,modifying,or reversing the decision of the commissioner,g.id.the district court later modified the remand order to a final order to allow the claimant counsel to apply for attorney fees.id.at.still later,the district court vacated the final order so that it could retain jurisdiction over the case after remand.id.the seventh circuit stated that the district court could not issue a final judgment and retain jurisdiction,and that if the district court had relinquished jurisdiction,the appellate court did not have jurisdiction over the appeal.id.at.the seventh circuit concluded that the district court had intended to retain jurisdiction over the case and,even though erroneous,that intended jurisdiction was a sufficient basis for appellate review.id.at.unlike the instant case,the seventh circuit did not need to consider whether to construe a remand under sentence four or vice versa rath
