the issues on appeal before this court are ones of statutory construction.we must decide whether certain claims are premised on statutes and are therefore within the jurisdiction of the united states court of federal claims pursuant to the tucker act,a,and the indian tucker act.the court of federal claims dismissed for lack of jurisdiction over the claims brought by the samish indian nation samish because some of their allegations were not premised upon any statute that was,and the allegations reliant on statutes were limited by other statutes.we affirm the court of federal claims decision that it lacked jurisdiction over some of the samish allegations because the tribal priority allocation tpa system is not.we conclude,however,that the trial court ability to provide a monetary remedy under the state and local fiscal assistance act of revenue sharing act is not limited by operation of the anti deficiency act.we therefore reverse the trial court dismissal of the samish revenue sharing act allegations and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
this case is the latest in a series of suits filed by the samish to obtain treaty rights and benefits from the united states government the samish efforts to be federally recognized and acknowledged for statutory benefits are more fully discussed in samish indian nation united states,fed.cl,samish i and samish indian nation united states,samish ii but are briefly summarized below.
before,the department of the interior department through the bureau of indian affairs bia accorded tribes federal recognition on an ad hoc basis.kahawaiolaa norton,cir.in,the bia created an unofficial list of tribes recognized by the united states.according to the bia,the list was not intended to be a list of federally recognized tribes as such and was derived from its unofficial files.samish ii,at.the list did not distinguish between tribes based on their treaty recognition status because,at that time,the bia lacked the legal basis to determine which tribes were treaty recognized.id.the samish were included on the list.
in,the bia created another unofficial list restricted to tribes with a formal organization approved by the bia.id.the samish did not appear on that list due to an arbitrary omission by the bia.greene babbitt.concluding that the omission of the samish from the unofficial list was arbitrary.although the bia created the list,it lacked the legal authority to determine which tribal groups would be accorded federal recognition.the list nonetheless became the basis for the bia classification of tribes in the future.samish ii,at.according to the bia employee who prepared the list,the bia relevant records from have been lost.id.
in the early,congress began conditioning federal benefits to the tribes and their members on formal federal recognition as determined by the department.the final regulation establishing the formal procedure for federal recognition of the tribes was published by the department in.see procedures for establishing that an american indian group exists as an indian tribe,codified at pt.as the current version of that regulation makes clear,federal acknowledgment does not create immediate access to existing programs.c.a tribe may participate only after it meets the specific program requirements,if any,and upon appropriation of funds by congress.id.because they were arbitrarily removed from the list of recognized tribes,the samish ceased receiving federal benefits.
in,the samish petitioned the department seeking federal recognition in order to obtain federal program benefits.samish indian tribe babbitt,docket no.indian,office of hearings and appeals,recommended decision dep t of interior.that petition was finally denied fifteen years later by the department following an informal adjudication procedure.final determination that the samish indian tribe does not exist as an indian tribe.as a result,the samish filed an action in federal district court alleging that the department adjudicative procedure violated the tribe due process rights.in,the district court vacated the department determination and remanded the federal recognition petition to be reconsidered under the formal adjudication procedures set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.greene lujan,wl,at,aff sub nom.greene babbitt,cir.this long travail for the samish finally ended when it obtained federal recognition on april.the department published formal notice on that date indicating that the samish was an indian tribe under applicable federal law.final determination for federal acknowledgement of the samish tribal organization as an indian tribe.
on october,the samish filed suit in the court of federal claims seeking money damages under the tucker act and the indian tucker act,which waive the sovereign immunity of the united states with respect to certain actions.these statutory provisions only waive the sovereign immunity of the united states.damages,if any,must be premised on statutes.in their first amended complaint,the samish sought damages for the deprivation of their statutory benefits as a result of the government erroneous and arbitrary refusal to recognize the tribe between and,as well as compensation for benefits that the samish had been wrongfully denied since their acknowledgement and recognition as a federal tribe in april.samish i,fed.ci.at.
the trial court dismissed the complaint holding that the statute of limitations in barred all but one of the samish claims and barred the remaining claim.id.on appeal,this court found that the indian self determination and education assistance act,et,and the snyder act,were not with respect to the samish claims.samish ii,at.this court reversed the trial court determination that the samish claim regarding its failure to receive benefits from until was time barred.we then remanded for further proceedings to determine whether the remaining statutes underlying the claim are.id.
on remand,the samish filed a second amended complaint alleging two claims for relief d am,samish indian nation united states,de at.the first claim sought damages under various federal statutes and programs for the government failure to provide the samish with benefits from until.the complaint alleged that either the underlying legal framework of the programs or the statutes creating the programs were d am.compl.at see samish indian nation united states,l,wl,at.july,interim discovery order interpreting first claim.the second claim alleged that the network of programs and statutes providing federal benefits to all tribes created a fiduciary duty that the government breached by failing to provide the samish with benefits d am.compl.at see samish,wl,at interpreting second claim.
the government moved to dismiss the samish complaint and argued that the referenced programs or statutes were not.thus,the samish claims fell outside the scope of both the tucker act and the indian tucker act,and consequently,sovereign immunity was not waived.the court of federal claims issued two opinions explaining why it was granting the motion to dismiss.see samish indian nation united states,fed.cl,samish iii samish indian nation united states,fed.cl,samish iv.on appeal,the samish challenge the trial court dismissal of their claims,but limit their arguments to two programs they allege are,the tpa system and the federal revenue sharing program created by the state and local fiscal assistance act of,stat,commonly known as the revenue sharing act of.
in samish iii,the court of federal claims held that the tpa system was not and,thus,it did not have jurisdiction over either of the samish claims.fed.cl.at.the trial court first found that the tpa system was neither a statute nor a discrete statutory program.id.at.rather,it was merely a budgetary mechanism and,therefore,could not impose a duty on the government.id.at.the trial court discussed united states navajo nation,navajo i,and explained that its analysis must train on specific or statutory or regulatory prescriptions.samish iii,fed.cl.at quoting navajo i,at.applying white mountain apache tribe united states,and navajo i,the trial court next determined that because the tpa system did not create a fiduciary duty on the part of the government or a specific trust,it could not be interpreted as.samish iii,fed.cl.at.
in samish iv,the court of federal claims held that although the revenue sharing act was,to the extent that the samish allegations in its claim relied upon it,the anti deficiency act,rendered those allegations moot.fed.ci.at.the court of federal claims applied agwiak united states,and held that the revenue sharing act usage of the phrases is entitled and shall pay,made it.samish iv,fed.cl.at.the trial court found that the act was because it was framed as an entitlement and included the following language the secretary of the united states department of the treasury shall,for each entitlement period,pay out to each state government and each unit of local government a total amount equal to the entitlement of such unit.id.at quoting stat.at emphasis added.the court analyzed the samish claim for statutory damages under the revenue sharing act,but did not address the samish breach of trust argument or whether the revenue sharing act imposed a fiduciary duty upon the government to provide the samish with funds authorized by the act.
the trial court concluded,however,that its ability to award any damages mandated by the revenue sharing act was limited by the anti deficiency act.samish iv,fed.cl.at.it interpreted the anti deficiency act as prohibiting a court from award ing funds if an appropriation has lapsed unless an aggrieved party files suit before the appropriation lapses.id.at.because the appropriations for the revenue sharing act lapsed in but the samish did not file their lawsuit until,the trial court held that the samish allegations related to the revenue sharing act were moot.id.at.we have jurisdiction over the samish timely filed appeal pursuant to a.
discussion 
this court reviews the court of federal claims dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction and interpretation of statutes without deference.brown united states,western of am.united states.the government argues that it had no duty to treat the samish as federally recognized prior to,and therefore,this court need not even address whether the tpa system or revenue sharing act can be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages.this argument is not persuasive because in samish ii,this court ruled that the government failure to treat the samish as a federally recognized tribe from to was wrongful and arbitrary and capricious.at.the government wrongful failure to recognize the samish gave rise to a damages claim,but two questions remain.the answer to these questions determines whether the government is liable to the samish.the first is whether the court of federal claims has jurisdiction over the samish claim because the tpa system is.the second is whether the anti deficiency act limits the trial court ability to provide a monetary remedy under the revenue sharing act.we address each in turn.
the analysis of whether a law is contains two steps.first,the court determines whether any substantive law imposes specific obligations on the government.if that condition is met,then the court proceeds to the second inquiry,whether the relevant source of substantive law can be fairly interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties the governing law imposes.united states navajo nation,navajo iii quotations omitted.the court of federal claims has jurisdiction if the substantive law at issue is reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages.white mountain,at.
under navajo i and navajo iii,the tpa system,appropriations acts,and statutes authorizing indian programs are not.the condition is satisfied when the text of a statute creates an entitlement by leaving the government with no discretion over the payment of funds.doe united states.in limited situations,the requirement may also be satisfied if the government retains discretion over the disbursement of funds but the statute provides clear standards for paying money to recipients states the precise amounts that must be paid or as interpreted,compels payment on satisfaction of certain conditions.perri united states.as the supreme court explained in navajo i,the analysis must train on specific or statutory or regulatory prescriptions.at.in navajo iii,the supreme court emphasized that the text of the indian tucker act makes clear that only claims arising under the constitution,laws or treaties of the united states,or executive orders of the president are cognizable.at.
although the tpa system secures funds for tribes,it is not a statute or regulation.
according to,tpa means the bia budget formulation process that allows direct tribal government involvement in the setting of relative priorities for local operating programs.the tpa system refers to the bia internal budgeting process,which includes preparation of the bia budgetary requests,presentation of the bia requests to congress,and distribution of congressional appropriations for the operation of indian programs authorized under different statutes.congress has enacted authorizing statutes for some but not all of the specific programs covered by the tpa system,including the johnson act,the indian child welfare act of,the indian child protection and family violence protection act,and the higher education tribal grant authorization act.
in this case,the relevant statutes are the annual appropriations acts that provide the tpa system with funds and the statutes creating the programs supported by tpa funds.after receiving the funds through the appropriations acts,the bia allocates the funds among federally recognized tribes if they are participating in statutorily designated programs pursuant to a contract,the indian self determination and education assistance act,funding compacts,or grant agreements.as the general accounting office has recognized,the purpose of the tpa system is to further indian by giving the tribes the opportunity to establish their own priorities and to move funds among programs accordingly,in consultation with bia.accounting office report to congressional requesters,at july.the appropriations acts do not provide a clear standard for paying money to recognized tribes,state the amounts to be paid to any tribe,or compel payment on satisfaction of certain conditions.see perri,at.
the appropriations acts provide funds to the bia,specifically,sums appropriated f or operation of indian programs.see,appropriations act for,stat.for example,the appropriations act for states 
be it enacted t hat the following sums are appropriated for the department of the interior and related agencies for the fiscal year,and for other purposes,namely for operation,of indian programs by direct expenditure,contracts,cooperative agreements,and grants including expenses necessary to provide education and welfare services for indians either directly or in cooperation with states and other organizations grants and other assistance to needy indians maintenance of law and order management,development,improvement,and protection of resources and appurtenant facilities under the jurisdiction of the bureau of indian affairs for the general administration of the bureau of indian affairs.
stat.the annual appropriations acts and the statutes that establish programs supported by tpa funds do not impose any specific trust obligations on the government beyond the general trust relationship that exists between the government and the tribes.
since its decision in cherokee nation georgia in,the supreme court has recognized the existence of a general trust relationship between the government and the tribes,explaining the tribes relations to the united states resemble that of a ward to his guardian.similarly,congress has recognized that general trust relationship.see,a noting the federal government laws and trust relationship to and responsibility for the indian people.as recently explained in the united states jicarilla apache nation,the trust relationship between the tribes and the government is defined and governed by statutes,wl,june.in jicarilla,the supreme court also ex
