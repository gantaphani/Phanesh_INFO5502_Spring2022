cleveland walton appeals the district court grant of summary judgment affirming the decision by the commissioner of the social security administration that walton was not entitled to disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income under the social security act.the commissioner denial of benefits,and the district court affirmance of that decision,were pursuant to a regulatory interpretation of the social security act by the social security administration,which interpretation provides that a return to work prior to the lapse of a month period after onset of disability and prior to the adjudication of disability precludes a finding that a claimant is disabled and does not allow the award of a trial work period.we hold that the agency interpretation upon which the district court and the commissioner relied clearly contravenes the relevant,and unambiguous,provisions of the social security act.see d a c.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the district court granting summary judgment to the commissioner and denying summary judgment to walton,except with regard to the district court conclusion that walton began substantial gainful activity sga in october,when his earnings exceeded,which latter holding we affirm.
cleveland walton walton,a college graduate in his with a history of psychological problems,was diagnosed with schizophrenia after a period of hospitalization in march.he applied for disability insurance benefits dib and supplemental security income ssi under the social security act act on april,based on his claimed mental disorder with associated depression.his application was denied initially and upon reconsideration.
after an evidentiary hearing on july,an administrative law judge alj concluded that walton was disabled by his mental impairment at the request of the alj,elliott spanier,a psychiatrist,reviewed appellant medical records and opined that walton suffered from schizophrenic disorder with psychotic features,that the impairment met the criteria of a listed impairment and that the impairment had lasted months.
prior to his hearing before the alj,walton advised the alj that he had worked at food lion from may until december,for five or six hours a day,and that he had begun working at the same job on december.based on this information,the alj denied walton a trial work period because walton had demonstrated the capacity for sustained work since may,and because his disability ceased when he began working.
instead,the alj held that walton was entitled to benefits pursuant to a period of disability that commenced on the amended onset date of his impairment,october,date his employment as an suspension teacher was ended on december,date walton started to work at food lion.
subsequently,the social security administration ssa determined that walton may have begun sga within twelve months of his onset date.based on agency policy,walton was not disabled,and was not entitled to benefits,if he had returned to work that constituted sga within twelve months of his disability onset date and prior to adjudication of his claim,even if his impairment had lasted or was expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.consequently,the case was remanded to the alj to assess when walton began sga.
substantial evidence that walton remained mentally impaired was presented at the second hearing.however,the alj did not reach the issue of impairment because he concluded that walton returned to sga in october,when his earnings from his work as a grocery store cashier and stocker exceeded and,because walton was not unable to engage in sga for a continuous period of at least twelve months from his disability onset date,the alj determined that he was not disabled and not entitled to a trial work period,and therefore denied him benefits.
walton sought review of the alj decision,which stands as the final decision of the commissioner of the social security administration commissioner.the district court adopted the proposed memorandum opinion of the magistrate judge and granted summary judgment to the commissioner,holding that the commissioner decision that walton engaged in sga in october and was not disabled and entitled to benefits,was supported by substantial evidence,and that walton was not entitled to a trial work period absent a finding of disability and entitlement to benefits.this appeal followed.
walton does not deny that he worked in october.rather,he claims,inter alia,that his work in october did not constitute sga and that,even if the work did constitute sga,the district court improperly relied upon it because that sga was part of a trial work period and,as such,could not be used as evidence that he was not disabled.the commissioner does not dispute that walton suffered from a mental impairment,nor does he dispute that the impairment lasted for a continuous period of at least months.instead,the commissioner asserts that the district court properly upheld the denial of benefits because,pursuant to the act and agency policy,walton was not under a disability when he engaged in sga during october,prior to the lapse of twelve months from his disability onset date and prior to adjudication of his claim.further,the commissioner claims that because walton was not disabled,he was not entitled to a trial work period.
the commissioner insists that his position is based on the plain language of the statute and that,even if the language of the act were susceptible to another interpretation,deference is owed to the agency interpretation of the act.appellee br.at.this interpretation is expressed in social security ruling ssr and notice of proposed.march,nprm 
while we recognize chevron deference where such deference is due,see generally chevron,natural resources defense council,d,we nonetheless reject the commissioner judgment in this case.in the first place,agency interpretation of the act is not appropriate because the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous.moreover,even if interpretation were required,the commissioner assumes either a duration period or adjudication requirement and does violence to the grammatical structure of the with the very statute it purports to elucidate.we are bound to reject such constructions.id.at.
consequently,the district court holding that walton was not under a disability when he engaged in sga prior to the lapse of twelve months from his onset date and prior to adjudication of his claim,and its holding that walton was not entitled to a trial work period,are reversed.
beyond question,the statutory language speaks clearly to the issue of whether an individual can be under a disability,even though he engaged in sga prior to the expiration of a period from his disability onset date and prior to the adjudication of his disability and an award of benefits.the statutory language is unambiguous,requires no agency interpretation,and leaves no doubt that neither a duration requirement for the inability to engage in substantial gainful activity nor a requirement that the benefits have been awarded or adjudicated,exists.rather,the relevant provision,d a,defines disability simply as the 
inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.
in addition to the facial clarity of the language,the grammatical structure and logic of the statute further compel the conclusion that the clause,which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months,refers to the impairment,not to the inability to engage in sga the clause manifestly does not modify substantial gainful activity.
in the first place,based solely on grammar and sentence structure,the clause modifies the prepositional phrase by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.additionally,a single referent for the entire adjectival phrase must exist.thus,as a matter of pure logic,it is clear that the duration clause must modify impairment,and only
