background 
tricare is a military health care benefits program that provides health care benefits to dependents of active duty service members and to retired service members and their dependents.tricare is administered within the department of defense by tma.until recently,the tricare system was divided into eleven geographical regions.tma administered the eleven regions through seven managed care support mcs contracts with prime contractors.the prime contractors,in turn,outsourced the claims processing through subcontracts with one of two private companies,pgba or wps.pgba processed claims under five contracts for nine regions,while wps processed claims under two contracts for the remaining two regions.initial decision.at.
in october of,congress enacted legislation known as tricare for life.pub,div.a,title vii,stat.the legislation addressed a problem confronting individuals qualifying for both tricare and medicare known as dual eligible beneficiaries.namely,prior to the enactment of tricare for life,beneficiaries lost their coverage under tricare upon becoming eligible for medicare.tricare for life remedies this problem by making medicare the primary payer and tricare the secondary payer for dual eligible beneficiaries.as secondary payer,tricare reimburses that portion of a health benefits claim not covered by medicare.passage of tricare for life forced tma to address the processing of the new dual eligible beneficiary claims.tma did this by modifying the mcs prime contracts.the prime contractors in turn modified their subcontracts with pgba and wps.initial decision,at.
in,tma announced that it would restructure tricare under a plan known as tricare next generation or.under the plan,tma will consolidate the mcs contracts from seven contracts covering eleven regions to three contracts covering three regions.also calls for replacing the subcontracting scheme for dual eligible beneficiaries with one standalone contract for processing all dual eligible beneficiary claims,irrespective of geographic region.this new contract is called the tricare dual eligible fiscal intermediary contract or tdefic.tma estimates that,when fully implemented,tdefic will process claims for approximately million dual eligible beneficiaries.id.at.
tdefic provides for a transition schedule.the purpose of the schedule is to allow sufficient time to transition the chosen tdefic contractor into the new system for processing dual eligible beneficiary claims.during this transition period,pgba and wps are to continue processing dual eligible beneficiary claims as subcontractors under the old mcs contracts.in the event more than nine months is needed to make the transition,tdefic allows for extension of the transition period,in which case claims processing is to continue under the old mcs contracts.the original transition dates for tdefic were region on april,regions and on june,regions,and on july,regions and on august,region on september,regions and on october,and region on november.evidentiary hr g tr.at.may,hearing.on may,the date of the court of federal claims final decision,region had already transitioned while regions and were within three weeks of transitioning 
on september,tma issued a rfp for tdefic,to which pgba,wps,and unisys corporation responded with proposals in february of.upon receipt of the proposals,tma conducted an initial evaluation thereafter,it requested and received final proposal revisions from the three offerors.tma evaluated the proposal revisions in june of.the source selection authority then conducted an independent evaluation of the proposals over the course of two weeks.tma ultimately awarded tdefic to wps on july.in total,it took tma approximately six months to conduct the evaluation and award the contract.
on august,pgba filed a bid protest with the gao.the gao issued an automatic stay of the award to wps pending resolution of the protest.however,on august,tma overrode the automatic stay.pgba responded by bringing an action in the court of federal claims to enjoin the override.on september,judge allegra issued an injunction dissolving tma override and reinstating the automatic stay.pgba,llc united states.preliminary injunction.the gao denied pgba protest on november,in re pgba,llc,nos,accounting office,filed under seal,at which time the automatic stay and preliminary injunction expired,pgba,llc united states,order.
on december,pgba filed suit in the court of federal claims,praying for the following relief 
a a declaratory judgment that tma decision to award the tdefic contract to wps is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law 
b an order setting aside the award of the tdefic to wps and 
c such other relief as the court deems appropriate.
compl.at.wps entered the case as an intervening defendant on december.on january,pgba moved for summary judgment on the administrative record.the united states and wps responded with their own for summary judgment.
on march,the court of federal claims ruled that tma had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in awarding tdefic to wps.the court determined that tma had made several prejudicial errors in its evaluation of the technical merits of pgba and wps proposals.specifically,the court found that portions of the rfp lacked clarity,resulting in uneven treatment of pgba,initial decision.at,and that tma had erred in evaluating wps claims processing capabilities,id.at.however,although finding the arbitrary and capricious action by tma prejudicial to pgba,the court concluded that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored allowing tma and wps to proceed with the contract.id.at.therefore,instead of ordering a new solicitation of the contract,the court limited pgba relief to its bid preparation and proposal costs.id.at.
shortly after the court of federal claims filed its decision under seal,pgba asked the court to reconsider its decision.id.at.pgba urged the court to set aside the contract and order a reevaluation as opposed to a new solicitation,a remedy which the court previously considered and rejected.the court denied the motion,explaining that injunctions do not issue for every violation of the law,and that,in this case,equity did not warrant an injunction.id.the court also rejected pgba argument that b,in combination with a,required the court to set aside tma award of tdefic to wps because the court had found tma conduct of the procurement to have been arbitrary and capricious.id.at.
pgba proceeded to file a second request for reconsideration,maintaining that the court was required to set aside arbitrary and capricious agency action and that,in any event,the balance of hardships in the case warranted issuance of an injunction.after conducting an evidentiary hearing on the effects of granting or denying injunctive relief,the court again determined that the balance of hardships did not warrant an injunction.accordingly,the court denied pgba second request for reconsideration.final decision.at.
following the entry of final judgment,pgba timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction under a.

the court of federal claims exercised jurisdiction in this case pursuant to b,which was enacted as part of the administrative dispute resolution act of adra,pub,stat.adra repealed former a and added section b.section b provides in relevant part as follows 
t he unite d states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment on an action by an interested party objecting to a solicitation by a federal agency for bids or proposals for a proposed contract or to a proposed award or the award of a contract or any alleged violation of statute or regulation in connection with a procurement or a proposed procurement 
to afford relief in such an action,the court may award any relief that the court considers proper,including declaratory and injunctive relief except that any monetary relief shall be limited to bid preparation and proposal costs.
in exercising jurisdiction under this subsection,the court shall give due regard to the interests of national defense and national security and the need for expeditious resolution of the action.
in any action under this subsection,the court shall review the agency decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section of title.
b.section of title,which is part of the administrative procedure act apa,pub,stat,provides in relevant part as follows 
the reviewing court shall 
hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions found to be 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.
pgba first argument on appeal is that once the court of federal claims found tma award of tdefic to wps to be arbitrary,capricious,and prejudicial to pgba,it was required,pursuant to section b of title and section a of title,to set aside the award without regard to the balance of hardships.according to pgba,section b simply provides the court of federal claims with the authority to grant injunctive relief.continuing,pgba argues that interpreting section b to allow courts to exercise discretion after arbitrary and capricious conduct has been found,as the court of federal claims did,would render section b superfluous.that is because,pgba reasons,section b instruction to consider matters of national defense and national security before reaching judgment would be unnecessary if courts already had discretion in deciding whether to issue injunctive relief.
pgba argues that we have never held that the court of federal claims has discretion with respect to setting aside arbitrary and capricious contract awards.in addition,pgba cites forest guardians babbitt,cir,and disabled american veterans secretary of veterans affairs,in support of its argument that in,shall means shall and that,consequently,courts do not have discretion to decide whether to set aside arbitrary and capricious government action.finally,pgba explains that its interpretation of the statutory language is consistent with the legislative history.according to pgba,in adra congress enacted section b in order to give the court of federal claims scanwell jurisdiction over bid protests and thereby eliminate the discretion district courts had historically exercised under scanwell in determining whether to set aside arbitrary and capricious awards 
the government and wps collectively,defendants respond that the court of federal claims correctly read section b as incorporating the arbitrary and capricious standard of review of a,not its mandate that a reviewing court shall set aside agency action found to be arbitrary and capricious.defendants argue that this interpretation is consistent with section b,which gives the court of federal claims discretion in fashioning relief.defendants disagree with pgba argument that such a reading would render section b superfluous.according to defendants,section b is simply a provision,which instructs courts to give extra consideration to issues of national defense and national security before reaching judgment in a case.defendants argue that their interpretation is consistent with jurisprudence recognizing equitable discretion in fashioning relief in bid protest cases,see,cincinnati elecs.kleppe,cir william wilke,dep t of the army,cir steinthal seamans,and that there is no evidence that congress intended to change the law when it enacted section b.finally,defendants state that we have not previously held that courts have discretion in fashioning relief in bid protest cases simply because we have never questioned the established equitable practice of the trial court.br.for at.
the parties contentions frame the issue well.the question before us is whether the reference in b to merely incorporates the arbitrary and capricious standard of review from section a,or whether it means that the reviewing court must set aside any action it finds arbitrary or capricious without consideration of the relative harms of such action.for the reasons which follow,we agree with the government and wps that section b only incorporates the standard of review of section a and therefore does not deprive a court of its equitable discretion in deciding whether injunctive relief is appropriate.we thus hold that,in a bid protest action,section b does not automatically require a court to set aside an arbitrary,capricious,or otherwise unlawful contract award.
first,we think that the plain language of section b supports this interpretation.the statute states that courts shall review the agency decision pursuant to the standards set forth in section of title.b emphasis added.this indicates that courts are to employ the standards of in reviewing an agency decision.the statute does not say anything,however,about remedying agency decisions found to be unlawful.section a of title,in turn,provides two standards a standard for relief the reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency action,findings,and conclusions and a standard of review for determining when to apply the required relief found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.in short,when read together,sections b and a compel the conclusion that section b only incorporates the arbitrary or capricious standard of review of section a.
this construction is consistent with the language of b,which,through use of the permissive may,provides the court of federal claims with discretion in fashioning relief.interpreting section b as requiring the court to enjoin all agency decisions found to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise unlawful,would read the discretionary language out of section b by effectively rewording the statute to read 
courts may award any relief that the court considers proper,including declaratory and injunctive relief,except that the court must issue an injunction setting aside the contract,and except that any monetary relief shall be limited to bid preparation and proposal costs.
additionally,interpreting the statute as allowing discretion does not render b superfluous.see hibbs winn,d t he rule against superfluities instructs courts to interpret a statute to effectuate all its provisions,so that no part is rendered superfluous.defendants correctly explain that section b merely instructs courts to give due regard to the issue of national defense and national security in shaping relief.
nor is our interpretation inconsistent with this court precedent.as noted by pgba,several of our decisions have quoted the mandatory language of.see,banknote of am.united states,r w flammann gmbh united states,emery worldwide airlines,united states,impresa construzioni geom.domenico garufi united states.however,none of these decisions directly address the issue of whether an award that is found arbitrary and capricious must be set aside.this likely explains why we have not always used mandatory language when referring to the standard of review for bid protests.see impresa,at under the apa standards that are applied in the scanwell line of cases,a bid award may be set aside if emphasis added see also emery,at explaining that impresa correctly stated that a bid award may be set aside if emphasis added.our interpretation is also consistent with decisions of the court of federal claims.see,gentex united states,stating that,before a permanent injunction will issue,a party must show it has succeeded on the merits it will suffer irreparable harm if such relief is not granted the balance of the hardships tips in the movant favor and an injunction will serve the public interest.
pgba cites to decisions of other circuits,as well as to federal circuit decisions outside the bid protest context,to support its contention that the word shall in requires the reviewing court to issue an injunction once it has found arbitrary and capricious conduct on the part of the procuring agency.these decisions are inapposite,however.forest guardians,from the tenth circuit,concerned as applied through the endangered species act,not adra.at.in addition,the case related to section,not to the standard of review from section a relevant to bid protest cases similarly,disabled american veterans involved the issue of judicial review of regulations of the department of veterans affairs pursuant to.at.section of title states that judicial review shall be in accordance with chapter of title.this is a broad incorporation of chapter of title.this case involves a much narrower incorporation,specifically section a of title in connection with bid protest actions.
finally,there is no evidence that congress intended to abolish the tradition of equitable discretion in issuing injunctive relief when it enacted section b in adra.prior to january,district courts exercised concurrent jurisdiction with the court of federal claims over government contract procurement challenges under scanwell jurisdiction.see emery worldwide,at impresa,at.in,however,congress amended the tucker act by enacting adra.in addition to section b,the amending statute contained a sunset provision which gave the court of federal claims exclusive jurisdiction over bid protests on january.adra,pub,d,stat.at see also emery worldwide,at.the legislative history indicates that,by giving the court of federal claims exclusive jurisdiction and thereby abolishing scanwell jurisdiction,congress intended to increase the uniformity of bid protest and government contract law.see cong.rec.daily ed.june,statement of cohen explaining that adra is designed to increase the efficiency of our procurement system by consolidating jurisdiction over bid protest claims in the court of federal claims and to increase the uniformity of the law and reduce forum shopping.although it abolished scanwell jurisdiction in an effort to create uniformity,nothing indicates congress intended to eliminate the court of federal claims discretion in deciding whether to issue injunctive relief.see impresa,at under the adra,all bid protest actions under the apa are now reviewed under the standards applied by district courts in the scanwell line of cases.
pgba next argues that even if the court of federal claims did not err in its construction of b,it did err in treating pgba action as one for injunctive rather than declaratory relief.the court of federal claims determined that pgba requested relief amount ed to a prayer for injunctive relief because it would bar wps and the government from going forward with the tdefic as awarded and effectively mandate a new round of solicitation,proposals,evaluations,and a new contract award.initial decision.at.pgba argues that this characterization ignored its claim for declaratory relief.pgba motivation for distinguishing between declaratory and injunctive relief appears to be a desire to avoid the equitable calculus associated with injunctive relief.br.for appellant at explaining that wps was entitled to have tma action set aside and declared invalid without having to meet the injunctive tests.defendants counter that pgba is asking to have the award set aside,which is coercive and has the same practical effect as an injunction 
we agree with the government and wps that the nature of the relief sought by pgba was injunctive.pgba complaint requested that the court of federal claims declare the award to wps arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law that the court issue an order setting aside the award of the tdefic to wps and that the court grant whatever other relief it deemed appropriate.the court of federal claims determined that tma acted arbitrarily and capriciously in awarding the contract to wps.in addition,it awarded pgba its bid preparation and proposal costs.pgba still claims that it is entitled to further relief in the form of an order setting aside the award and thereby stopping performance by tma and wps under tdefic.this is tantamount to a request for injunctive relief.see,samuels mackell,d explaining that when the practical effect of the two forms of relief will be virtually identical,the propriety of declaratory and injunctive relief should be judged by essentially the same standards.citizens for a representative assembly governor of,cir a declaratory judgment is not available as an academic exercise,and the coercive effect of one here would encounter all of the objections to injunctive relief.the court of federal claims properly viewed pgba suit as an action for injunctive relief.it therefore did not err in looking to the traditional equitable factors in determining whether to set aside award of the contract to wps.
pgba final argument on appeal is that even if its request for a declaration setting aside the award to wps was properly viewed as a request for injunctive relief,the court of federal claims abused its discretion in withholding such relief.in deciding whether a permanent injunction should issue,a court considers whether,as it must,the plaintiff has succeeded on the merits of the case whether the plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm if the court withholds injunctive relief whether the balance of hardships to the respective parties favors the grant of injunctive relief and whether it is in the public interest to grant injunctive relief.see amoco prod.vill.of gambell,alaska,d the standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success.
the court of federal claims denied pgba request for injunctive relief in its original decision on march,as well as in its denial of pgba first request for reconsideration.initial decision.at.on may,in response to pgba second request for reconsideration,the court held an evidentiary hearing in order to create a complete record regarding the consequences of granting or denying injunctive relief.final decision.at.based largely on testimony from this evidentiary hearing,the court denied pgba request for injunctive relief and entered f
