petitioner robin boyd was a mail processor for the united states postal service from to.on march,she applied for immediate retirement based on disability.she also applied for disability retirement annuity benefits under the federal employees retirement system fers.
by letter dated june,the office of personnel management opm notified boyd that it had approved her application for disability retirement annuity benefits.the letter explained that opm would provide her with monthly interim fers benefits in the amount of approximately of her actual fers benefits.the letter further explained that boyd would not receive fers benefits until opm received confirmation that she had applied for social security disability benefits.the letter directed boyd to apply for social security benefits and to notify opm when she applied for those benefits.
in a separate paragraph,the letter contained the following directive,in boldface type if the social security administration awards you monthly benefits,you must immediately notify us of the amount and the effective date of the monthly benefit.
the june,letter also explained that boyd fers benefits would be offset by any social security benefits she received.the offset for the first year would be of her social security benefits the offset after the first year would be of her social security benefits.see also a.the letter then stated,also in boldface type 
because the fers disability benefit must be reduced by percent of any social security benefit payable for months,social security checks should not be negotiated until the fers benefit has been reduced.the social security checks will be needed to pay opm for the reduction which should have been made in the fers annuity.
boyd admits that she received the june,letter.she then applied for social security benefits and continued receiving interim fers benefits.
on august,the social security administration advised boyd that she was entitled to monthly social security benefits starting with the month of august.boyd provided a copy of that notice to opm in september.
opm did not immediately reduce boyd fers benefits by the amount of her social security benefits.nor did boyd refrain from negotiating the social security checks she received.instead,she negotiated the social security checks.five months later,on january,opm sent boyd a letter stating that her fers benefits had been adjusted in light of the social security benefits she had received since august,and advising her that she had been overpaid for the months of august through december in an amount totaling.the letter stated that opm would recover the overpayment by offsetting her fers benefits in monthly installments of beginning in april.
on february,boyd requested a waiver of her obligation to reimburse opm for the overpayment alternatively,she requested a reduced payment schedule based on financial hardship.to support her request,she enclosed a completed opm financial resources questionnaire in which she detailed her financial condition.following that request,opm refrained from withholding funds from her monthly benefits,pending resolution of the waiver issue.
in a letter dated december,opm advised boyd of the requirements for a waiver of the reimbursement obligation.opm informed her that it needed an updated financial resources questionnaire from her in order to make a fair decision on her request for waiver of the overpayment.
boyd did not send opm an updated financial resources questionnaire,and on january,opm denied her request for a waiver.the denial letter stated that,b ased on the evidence of record,including your written submissions,opm finds that recovery of the overpayment would not be against equity and good conscience.however,upon considering boyd financial resources questionnaire,opm adjusted her repayment schedule and reduced the monthly offset by more than half,from to.
proceeding pro se,boyd appealed opm denial to the merit systems protection board.in her appeal form,she elected and provided an email address to receive notifications of filings and orders.
on february,the administrative judge assigned to boyd appeal ordered her to submit any evidence and argument in support of her appeal within days.boyd did not file anything.the administrative judge then issued an order directing boyd to show good cause for her failure to respond,explaining that absent a response,the administrative judge would decide the case without a hearing and based solely on the written record.boyd again filed nothing.
the written record included boyd opm file.but missing from the opm file was the financial resources questionnaire that had been attached to her february waiver request only the first page of that waiver request was included,which did not include her responses to the questionnaire.
based on the written record,the administrative judge affirmed opm denial of a waiver.the administrative judge found that boyd had not demonstrated eligibility for a waiver because,a lthough she timely notified opm after she was awarded social security disability benefits,she was not without fault regarding the overpayment.specifically,the administrative judge found that boyd had neither alleged nor proved that she did not receive opm june,letter,and that a s such,she was instructed not to negotiate any social security benefits checks until her fers payment had been reduced.boyd was not without fault,the administrative judge ruled,because she had failed to set aside the social security checks as the june,letter had directed.the administrative judge did not reach the question whether collection of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience.
with regard to the adjustment of the repayment schedule,the administrative judge noted that boyd did not submit a financial resources questionnaire in the appeal or offer other evidence regarding her monthly income and expenses.for that reason,the administrative judge concluded that there was no evidence to refute the reasonableness of the reduced payment schedule proposed by opm.
boyd filed a petition for review by the full board.she submitted new evidence of financial hardship and alleged that she had not received any of the administrative judge communications.she explained that although she had arranged to be notified of all board proceedings by email,her fianc√© had deleted the emails sent by the board,thinking they were spam.
the board affirmed the administrative judge decision that boyd was not entitled to a waiver of her repayment obligation.the board concluded that she was not entitled to a waiver because opm had instructed her not to negotiate the social security benefits checks,yet she had done so.the board also found that any shortcomings in the record before the administrative judge were the result of boyd lack of due diligence.with respect to boyd reassertion of her claim of financial hardship,the board found that in light of her failure to offer evidence regarding her monthly income and expenses,there was no reason to disturb the administrative judge decision affirming opm adjusted monthly repayment schedule.
boyd argues that the board abused its discretion in determining that she was at fault for the overpayment even though she notified opm of her award of social security benefits,by failing to consider evidence of financial hardship she had submitted to opm and to the board,and by finding that she had not shown good cause for her failure to respond to the board electronic notices.
regarding opm collection of fers overpayments,b provides,in pertinent part 
recovery of payments under this subchapter including fers annuity benefits may not be made from an individual when,in the judgment of the office of personnel management,the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience.
the statute delegates to opm the authority to determine what constitutes without fault and recovery that would be against equity and good conscience.opm has done so by regulation,et,and through published policy guidelines interpreting its regulations.ret.ins,office of pers,policy guidelines on the disposition of overpayments under the civil service retirement system and the federal employees sic retirement system policy guidelines.
as pertinent here,the regulations provide that a recipient of an overpayment is without fault if performed no act of commission or omission which resulted in the overpayment.one of the considerations bearing on the finding of fault is whether the recipient accepted a payment which knew or should have known to be erroneous.id.a.the regulations state that recovery is against equity and good conscience when,among other factors,recovery would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought.id.a.
opm policy guidelines explain in more detail what is required for a waiver of fers benefits overpayments under the regulations.the guidelines state in general,an individual is not without fault if,inter alia,accepted a payment which knew to be erroneous or should have known to be erroneous.policy guidelines.however,the guidelines also provide an exception to the determination of fault 
prompt notification exception.individuals who accept a payment in excess of the amount to which they are entitled will automatically be found without fault,regardless of whether they knew or should have known that the payment was erroneous,if they promptly contact opm and question the correctness of the payment.in general,an individual must contact opm within days of the receipt of the overpayment,a prompt notification requirement.note this rule provides an exception to the general rules cited above by allowing certain persons who knowingly accept overpayments to be found without fault if they demonstrate good faith by promptly bringing the overpayments to opm attention.however,the fact that they suspected or knew that they had received an overpayment as evidenced by their contacting of opm will have a bearing on equity and good conscience determinations.see the rule,guideline.
policy guidelines.
the rule,to which the prompt notification exception refers,states 
individuals who are aware that they are receiving overpayments are obligated by the principles of equity and good conscience to set aside the amount overpaid pending recoupment by opm.thus,an individual who accepted a payment which suspected or knew to be erroneous but who is found without fault under the prompt notification exception is obliged to set the overpaid money aside pending recovery by opm unless there are exceptional circumstances,recovery by opm in these cases is not against equity and good conscience.note exceptional circumstances would involve extremely egregious errors or delays by opm,a failure to issue a written decision within years of a debtor request for waiver.financial hardship is not an exceptional circumstance.
policy guidelines internal citations omitted.
as the quoted passages from the opm policy guidelines make clear,an individual who is overpaid but who promptly notifies opm of the overpayment is categorically deemed to be without fault.for such an individual,the remaining question is whether recovery of the overpayment would be against equity and good conscience.under the rule,if that individual suspected or knew that he or she had received an overpayment and therefore had an obligation to set aside the overpaid funds,the individual is not eligible for a waiver under the equity and good conscience standard and would be entitled to relief only under the more exacting exceptional circumstances standard.
opm argues that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge finding of fault,and that the administrative judge properly declined to consider the equity and good conscience factor.but opm guidelines are directly contrary to opm position before this court.in this appeal,opm ignores the prompt notification exception and does not explain why that exception is inapplicable to boyd.contrary to opm argument,the prompt notification exception plainly applies to boyd situation,because after the social security administration informed boyd that she had been awarded social security benefits,she notified opm within days of her receipt of social security benefits for august.
the board has applied the prompt notification exception in similar circumstances,with opm acquiescence,maxwell office of pers,opm stipulated below that the appellant was without fault james office of pers,b oth opm and the administrative judge apparently found that the appellant response to opm questionnaire stating that he was receiving social security disability payments was sufficient to meet the prompt notification requirement so as to render him without fault.
we conclude that boyd is without fault under the plain terms of opm guidelines.the administrative judge contrary finding was based on an erroneous interpretation of the law.see gose postal,fed.cir.
opm next argues that even if the prompt notification exception applies,it does not justify a waiver in this case.opm points out that boyd has raised only a claim of financial hardship according to opm,she was required to show exceptional circumstances in order to be eligible for a waiver.as opm policy guidelines make clear,the exceptional circumstances standard is much more demanding than the equity and good conscience standard,as exceptional circumstances are limited to extremely egregious errors or delay by opm.but opm argument skips an important step.
as noted,for a person like boyd who is without fault,the opm guidelines require a determination whether that person suspected or knew that he or she had received an overpayment.the administrative judge,however,did not decide that critical question.opm takes the position that there was no need for the administrative judge to do so.opm argues that boyd must demonstrate exceptional circumstances to obtain a waiver,and notes that she has only alleged and put forth evidence of financial hardship,which is not an exceptional circumstance.policy guidelines.
we find no support in the opm policy guidelines for opm argument.the rule is clear it applies if the recipient of a payment knew or,at a minimum,suspected that the payment was erroneous.policy guidelines.the rule does not apply to individuals who do not know or suspect they are being overpaid.those individuals do not know that the money does not belong to them,and may act in good faith when they fail to set aside the overpayments.see okonski office of pers,appellant could not reasonably have been expected to set aside money if he did not have a reason to know that it was an overpayment.
to place unknowing individuals in the same position as knowing individuals is an unreasonable interpretation of the guidelines,as it renders the language requiring knowledge superfluous.policy guidelines individuals who are aware that they are receiving overpayments are obligated by the principles of equity and good conscience to set aside the amount overpaid pending recoupment by opm.thus,an individual who accepted a payment which suspected or knew to be erroneous is obliged to set the overpaid money aside see also id.t he fact that they suspected or knew that they had received an overpayment as evidenced by their contacting of opm will have a bearing on equity and good conscience determinations.
the analysis is therefore different for unknowing individuals,for whom the equity and good conscience test applies.and for such persons,financial hardship can serve as a basis for finding that recovery is against equity and good conscience.a.
even though the question of knowledge was not answered below,opm argues that boyd knew of the overpayment based on the administrative judge finding that boyd received the june notice.opm points out that boyd followed the instruction in the notice to inform opm of her award of social security benefits.according to opm,that proves she understood the notice,which also instructed her not to negotiate her social security benefits therefore,according to opm,she knew she was supposed to set those payments aside.
this may be enough evidence from which to infer knowledge.but boyd argues it is not,both because the june letter was less clear than opm contends and because of her personal circumstances this is a factual debate for the board to resolve in the first instance.becau
