birdeye middleton appeals from the decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court affirming the decision of the board of veterans appeals the board denying a disability rating in excess of for his diabetes.see middleton shinseki,wl.june,unpublished.because the veterans court did not err in interpreting the governing regulations and we lack jurisdiction to review the veterans court application of the regulations to the facts,we affirm.
background 
middleton served on active duty from january to february.he first sought compensation for his type ii diabetes mellitus in october.in july,a department of veterans affairs va regional office ro granted service connection,assigning a disability rating of pursuant to,diagnostic code dc.see in re middleton,slip op.at.middleton sought an increased rating in,which the ro denied in march after a va physical examination.id.middleton filed a timely notice of disagreement,and the ro issued a statement of the case soc in december.id.middleton then filed an appeal,and the ro issued a supplemental soc in january.id.
in december,the va provided middleton with a further physical examination that confirmed the diagnosis of type ii diabetes mellitus.for that condition he was treated with three oral hypoglycemic agents and daily injections of the drug byetta.id.at.byetta is a synthetic peptide that induces the body to secrete endogenous insulin.in august,the board again denied a rating increase despite middleton assertions that he met the criteria for a rating on the grounds that his diet was restricted,his activities were regulated,and he used an oral hypoglycemic agent.id.
the board found that middleton was only entitled to a rating.it stated,though middleton is on a restricted diet,has regulation of activities,and uses an oral hypoglycemic agent,he does not use insulin to regulate his diabetes.in re middleton,slip op.at.the board further found that neither middleton va treatment records nor records from his private physician mentioned that he required insulin,and that treatment records from january through june of specifically referred to him as a dependent diabetic.id.at.
the board ultimately found that,while byetta is a medication used to control diabetes,it is not insulin,and therefore the medical evidence of record showed that middleton did not require insulin.id.at.the board emphasized that the u se of insulin is a necessary element for the percent rating the fact that middleton has not been required to use insulin thus precludes his being assigned this increased rating.id.
middleton then appealed to the veterans court and again argued that he was entitled to a rating in excess of.the court disagreed and affirmed the denial by the board because medical evidence did not show that middleton was prescribed insulin.middleton,wl at.middleton argued that treatment with byetta injections was analogous to,yet admittedly not identical to,requiring insulin,but the court held that the plain language of dc recites insulin and does not include a supposed substitute.id.
middleton also argued that his diabetes was more closely related to the criteria for a rating and that,which provides that the higher of two evaluations will be assigned if the veteran disability picture more nearly approximates the criteria required for that rating,was applicable to his claim.id.at.the veterans court nevertheless held that did not apply because,following its own precedent in camacho nicholson,a veteran could not be rated at for diabetes when he only satisfied two of the criteria for that rating,as did middleton.id.
this appeal followed.
discussion 
our jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court is limited by statute.we have exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof by the veterans court and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.id.c.we may not,however,absent a constitutional challenge,review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.id.d.we therefore generally lack jurisdiction to review challenges to the board factual determinations or to any application of law to fact.see,johnson derwinski.but we do have jurisdiction here to determine the proper interpretation of a regulation such as dc.see amberman shinseki,exercising jurisdiction over review of veterans court interpretation of regulation with rating schedule forshey principi,en banc.
section of the va regulations sets forth a schedule of disability ratings for diseases of the endocrine system.see.within that schedule,diagnostic code prescribes ratings for diabetes mellitus.see,dc.the code recognizes five levels of disability,expressed in terms of percentages,which represent as far as can practicably be determined the average impairment in earning capacity resulting from the corresponding descriptions of a veteran condition.see.the code reads as follows 
middleton maintains that the veterans court misinterpreted the r equiring insulin criterion of the and ratings in dc as requiring the direct administration of insulin.he asserts that the term refers more generally to a need for insulin,not a specific method of obtaining it,and that even though he was not administered the substance insulin exogenously he still requires insulin because he takes other medications such as byetta injections that cause his body to secrete insulin endogenously.middleton argues that the court interpretation limiting the regulation to require a prescription for a specific medication is inconsistent with the benefits scheme and regulatory history,which focus on the severity of the impairment and how well a veteran diabetes is controlled.moreover,he contends that interpretations of ratings that rely on specific medications rather than impairments become obsolete as new drugs are introduced therefore,any ambiguity should be resolved in favor of referencing symptoms,whether insulin is needed for control regardless whether it is directly injected or endogenously created after administering a medication such as byetta.the secretary argues that the plain language of dc unambiguously recites r equiring insulin,which should be given its ordinary meaning and does not encompass using an drug as analogous to using insulin.
we conclude that the veterans court did not err in interpreting dc,as its plain language reciting the criterion r equiring insulin for each of the and ratings clearly requires that the veteran is administered insulin.see lockheed widnall,to interpret a regulation we must look at its plain language and consider the terms in accordance with their common meaning.
in contrast to the position taken by middleton,the code does not authorize a rating premised on the administration of another medical compound or pharmaceutical agent than the substance insulin,reserving that rating only for those circumstances r equiring insulin,restricted diet,and regulation of activities,dc.the context of the code also demonstrates that,when the va intended to specify treatment for diabetes with another substance,it identified such treatment directly.specifically,a rating provides for two possibilities r equiring insulin and restricted diet,or oral hypoglycemic agent and restricted diet,which expressly distinguishes between treatment via administration of insulin and treatment via administration of an oral hypoglycemic agent.if,as middleton asserts,those regulatory provisions are obsolete,then it is not for us to rewrite them.
as currently specified,r equiring insulin means being administered insulin.to read that criterion otherwise would be to ignore the plain language in the code that specifies alternative treatments if requiring insulin does not mean administering insulin,then that criterion could arguably be satisfied by the alternative of administering an oral hypoglycemic agent or any other diabetes medication,and there would have been no reason for the secretary to have expressly provided for such an alternative possibility.accor
