gayle snyder petitions for review of the final order of the merit systems protection board board.the board affirmed the decision of the office of personnel management opm denying the petitioner claim for survivor annuity benefits under the civil service retirement system csrs as the former spouse of robert ruff.snyder office of pers,no,july.we vacate and remand.
background 
gayle snyder and robert ruff divorced in after over thirty years of marriage.the wisconsin divorce court entered an order entitled addendum to marital settlement agreement for qualified domestic relations csrs plan court order.the court order was submitted to opm which notified snyder that the order was suitable for processing and would provide her with an apportionment benefit payable on ruff retirement,and a survivor annuity payable upon his death.
ruff was an employee of both federal and state governments during the entire marriage.several years after the divorce,in july,he retired from federal government service.although opm had previously notified snyder that the court order was sufficient to provide her with a survivor annuity,it changed its determination.between and,snyder and opm exchanged several letters in which opm made various determinations about the order suitability.finally,in a letter she received march,opm stated that the order did not comply with opm regulations for the awarding of a former spouse survivor annuity.snyder appealed opm finding to the board.
while ruff lives,the court order provides no payments to snyder prior to ruff retirement.after his retirement,the court order provides snyder with of the actuarial equivalent value of ruff pension benefit which accrued during the period of their marriage.
in providing for snyder after ruff death,the court order contains the following provision 
vi.death of participant and survivor for treatment of former spouse of participant as surviving spouse of participant for purposes of surviving spouse pension benefit,other survivor benefits.
the assignment of benefits to the alternate payee shall not be reduced,abated or terminated as a result of the death of the participant.pursuant to section p of the code,the former spouse of the participant,namely gayle ruff,shall be treated as the surviving spouse of the participant for purposes of survivor benefits accrued during the period described in section ii c about sic in accordance with sections a ii and of the code.
snyder argued to the board that this provision provides her with a survivor annuity.
the board administrative judge found that t he only permissible interpretation of the agreement is that appellant is to be treated as surviving spouse only for survivor benefits.snyder office of pers,no,slip op.at.the administrative judge rejected snyder argument that the first sentence of section vi must provide for survivor benefits.rather,he found that it meant that any lump sum payment shall not be reduced,abated or terminated as a result of the death of the participant,slip op.at.
the administrative judge also noted that snyder argued that it was the parties intent to provide her with a lifetime benefit,but held that because the court order is clear and unambiguous on its face,the use of parol evidence would be inappropriate.id.nevertheless,the administrative judge noted that ruff testimony was credible and consistent with his interpretation of the order.id.
the administrative judge initial decision became the final decision of the board after the board denied the petition for review.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
board decisions may be set of aside if they are arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with the law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence c.
within the csrs,a survivor annuity provides the survivors of an employee with recurring payments.a former spouse may participate as a survivor to an employee survivor annuity pursuant to statute 
a former spouse of a deceased employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent expressly provided for in terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or property settlement agreement incident to such decree.
h emphasis added.opm regulations provide further guidance regarding how a survivor annuity must be described in a court order in order to properly provide the former spouse with a survivor annuity.
on appeal,snyder argues,as she did to the board,that section vi of the court order entered at her divorce provides her with a survivor annuity.she asserts that the board erred in its determination that the first sentence of the section provided only a benefit.rather,she argues that the intent of the parties and the clear language of the agreement evince the meaning of the provide her with a lifetime benefit.she argues that the administrative judge erred in permitting ruff testimony regarding the intent of the agreement while excluding hers.she also argues that because opm waited until after her former spouse retirement to rescind its initial decision,it should be estopped from doing so.
first,we address the administrative judge finding regarding the meaning of section vi of the court order.snyder concedes that the second sentence of section vi means only that she will be treated as the survivor for purposes of a survivor benefit.however,she disagrees with the administrative judge finding that the first sentence of the section also refers to a survivor benefit.the first sentence states,the assignment of benefits to the alternate payee shall not be reduced,abated or terminated as a result of the death of the participant.since the only benefits to which she was entitled under the agreement were a portion of ruff pension,snyder argues that this was the benefit that should not be reduced as a result of his death.snyder also states that the administrative judge may have reached an erroneous conclusion based on a finding that snyder benefits would necessarily decrease if they were converted from being a portion of ruff pension to a survivor annuity.she states that this was erroneous because a survivor annuity is not necessarily less than her apportionment of ruff pension.
opm agrees with snyder that the administrative judge erred in finding that the first sentence of section vi refers to a survivor benefit.agreeing with snyder contentions,opm states,i t would make no sense to state that survivor benefits can not be reduced or terminated by the very event that would trigger entitlement to those benefits.therefore,opm agrees with snyder that the first sentence of section vi must address benefits that snyder was already receiving at the time of ruff death.that is,the first sentence must be referring to the portion of ruff retirement benefits snyder would be receiving pursuant to section 
opm therefore repudiates the administrative judge analysis and both parties agree that the administrative judge erred in his rationale for finding that the first sentence of section vi did not provide for a survivor annuity.we therefore proceed to the alternative basis that opm presents on appeal as to why the first sentence of section vi is deficient to provide the benefit.
opm argues that section vi of the court order is deficient for purposes of providing snyder with a survivor annuity because it does not satisfy b.the regulation cited by opm contains two requirements 
any court order that provides that the former spouse portion of the employee annuity shall continue after the death of the employee or retiree,by using language such as will continue to receive benefits after the death of the employee,that the former spouse will continue to receive benefits for his or her lifetime,or that benefits will continue after the death of the employee,but does not use terms such as survivor annuity,death benefits,former spouse annuity,or similar terms is not a court order acceptable for processing.
here,section vi of the court order includes the sentence,the assignment of benefits to the alternate payee shall not be reduced,abated or terminated as a result of the dea
