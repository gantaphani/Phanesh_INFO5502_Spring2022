this is the second time this case has reached us on appeal.in our first opinion,sturgeon county of los angeles th sturgeon i,we reaffirmed the principle that judicial compensation is a state,not a county,responsibility.we found that by providing substantial employment benefits to its superior court judges,defendant county of los angeles the county violated article vi,section of our constitution,which requires that compensation for judges be prescribed by the legislature.thus we reversed an order granting the county motion for summary judgment on plaintiff harold sturgeon claim payment of the employment benefits was unlawful.
shortly after we filed our opinion in sturgeon i and while the legislature was in a special session,the legislature passed and the governor signed legislation which addressed the constitutional defect we identified in sturgeon i.in particular,the legislation required that all counties continue to provide sitting judges with whatever benefits the counties had provided as of july.the legislature permitted the counties to terminate this obligation,but not with respect to sitting judges and only after giving the administrative office of the courts and any affected judges days notice.
on remand sturgeon asserted the legislation was invalid on three grounds.he argued the legislation was outside the scope of the governor proclamation calling the special session,did not adequately prescribe benefits judges are to be provided,and in any event violated equal protection principles by continuing a statewide system of unequal judicial benefits.the trial court rejected these contentions and granted the county motion for summary judgment.
the legislation sturgeon challenges,as enacted,implemented an interim response to the constitutional issues we addressed in sturgeon i.as we shall explain,the legislation fell within the scope of the governor proclamation,adequately prescribed the benefits that must be provided to judges and did not intrude upon any judge right to equal protection of the laws.accordingly,we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
sturgeon i 
sturgeon commenced these proceedings in april by filing a taxpayer lawsuit against the county under the provisions of code of civil procedure section.sturgeon lawsuit challenged the county annual payment of employment benefits to judges sitting in the county beyond the salary prescribed by the legislature and in addition to employment benefits,including health care,disability insurance and life insurance provided to the judges by the state.in fiscal each judge in los angeles was eligible to receive in benefits from the county,which amounted to approximately percent of their prescribed salary and cost the county approximately million.among other claims,sturgeon alleged the benefit payments violated article vi,section of the california constitution,which in pertinent part requires that the legislature prescribe compensation for judges of record.the trial court granted the county motion for summary judgment,finding no merit in sturgeon claims under article vi,section.sturgeon also claimed the benefits were barred by the trial court funding act of,et stats,ch,were unlawful gifts of public funds and amounted to an unlawful waste of public funds.the trial court rejected those claims as well.
on appeal we agreed with sturgeon article vi,section contention and reversed the order granting summary judgment.sturgeon i,supra,th at.we held the benefits the county provided were compensation within the meaning of the constitution and had not been prescribed by the legislature.ibid.we noted however that while the requirement of the constitution that the legislature prescribe judicial compensation was important,it was not onerous and required only that the legislature consider the specific issue and,at a minimum,establish or reference identifiable standards by which benefits would be provided to judges.ibid.
senate bill 
our opinion in sturgeon i was filed on october,and modified on november,on december,the governor issued a proclamation calling the legislature into a special session.the proclamation convened the legislature in pertinent part to consider and act upon legislation to address the economy,including but not limited to efforts to stimulate california economy,create and retain jobs,and streamline the operations of state and local governments.during the special session,the legislature passed senate bill.senate bill,which the governor signed on february.senate bill became effective on may.

proceedings on remand 
on remand and following the legislature enactment of senate bill,the county again moved for summary judgment,arguing the legislature had remedied the deficiency we identified in sturgeon sturgeon opposed the county motion and moved for summary judgment himself.as we have noted,sturgeon argued senate bill was beyond the scope of the governor special session proclamation,did not adequately prescribe the benefits the county provided,and did not provide equal benefits which sturgeon argued was required by the equal protection provisions of the state and federal constitutions.the trial court granted the county motion,denied sturgeon and entered judgment in favor of the county.sturgeon filed a timely notice of appeal.
