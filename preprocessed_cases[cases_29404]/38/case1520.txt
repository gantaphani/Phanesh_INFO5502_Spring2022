background 
factual background 
terry served on active duty in the army from december of to may of.when he entered the army,he underwent a medical enlistment examination.no defect was noted in his vision at that time,nor were any visual defects noted in an examination performed in.however,terry service medical records do reveal a diagnosis of central serous retinopathy of the left eye in may of,terry eyes were examined at the va medical center in oklahoma city,oklahoma.the examiner diagnosed terry with presbyopia.as explained below,presbyopia is a refractive error of the eye that develops with age.
ii.procedural history 
in march of,terry filed a claim for service connection for his presbyopia with the ro in muskogee,oklahoma.the ro denied the claim on the ground that the evidence failed to show a disability for which service connection could be established.see terry,no.ss,slip op.at.the board affirmed the ro denial of the claim.id.at.the board determined that presbyopia is a refractive error of the eye,which is a constitutional or developmental abnormality,and is not a disability under va law.id.at.the board concluded that c was a bar to terry claim for service connection for presbyopia because the regulation provides that refractive error of the eye is not a disease or injury within the meaning of veterans benefits statutes.id.at.the board therefore held that terry was not entitled to compensation for the condition.id.
the veterans court subsequently affirmed the board decision.terry,slip.op.at.in so doing,the court rejected terry challenge to the validity of c by relying upon winn brown.id.at.in winn,the court upheld the validity of section c in the face of a challenge by a veteran with a personality disorder.winn.at.terry now appeals the decision of the veterans court upholding c and affirming the denial of his claim.on appeal,terry urges that section c is invalid as applied to his claim for service connection for presbyopia.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
our jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court is limited by statute.forshey principi,en banc.we have exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under section,and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.c.our authority extends to deciding all relevant questions of law and we can set aside a regulation or an interpretation of a regulation relied upon by the court of appeals for veterans claims when we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations or in violation of a statutory right or without observance of procedure required by law.jones west,see d.our authority does not extend to the ability to review factual determinations or the application of a law or regulation to a particular set of facts,unless a constitutional issue is presented.d.no factual issues are presented in this case.the sole issue on appeal is terry challenge to the validity of c.because terry challenges the validity of a regulation,we have jurisdiction pursuant to.the veterans court rejection of that challenge presents an issue of law that we review de novo.principi.
ii.terry challenge to the validity of c 
on appeal,terry argues that,to the extent it prohibits compensation for refractive error of the eye and,in particular,for presbyopia,c is contrary to,and.according to terry,the va secretary exceeded his authority under those statutes by promulgating section c to exclude visual refractive error of the eye from disabilities for which compensation is payable.he urges us to invalidate that portion of the regulation.the government responds that the va interpretation of sections,and,as embodied in c,should be given deference as a permissible interpretation of the statutes by the agency charged with their implementation.the government urges us to uphold the validity of the regulation.
in reviewing an agency construction of a statute that it administers,we address two questions,as required by the supreme court decision in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.the first question is whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.id.at.if so,this court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,congress has not spoken directly to the issue or if the statute is ambiguous with regard to that issue,this court addresses the second question of whether the responsible agency has rendered an interpretation that is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.
we begin with the statutory language.blue chip stamps manor drug stores,d the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.sections and of title of the united states code authorize the secretary of veterans affairs to provide compensation to a veteran for disabilities that result from injuries or diseases that occur in the line of duty during times of war and during times of peace,respectively.section provides as follows 
for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,in the active military,naval,or air service,during a period of war,the united states will pay to any veteran thus disabled and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from the period of service in which said injury or disease was incurred,or preexisting injury or disease was aggravated,compensation as provided in this subchapter uscs et,but no compensation shall be paid if the disability is a result of the veteran own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.
sections and make it clear that if a disability can not be attributed to an injury or a disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty,the disability is not compensable.we therefore must consider the meaning of the terms injury and disease to determine congress intent with respect to the scope of compensable disabilities.these terms are not defined in title.thus,congress has not directly spoken to the precise question at issue nor has congress specifically prohibited any particular definition of injury and disease.see chevron,at.in the absence of an express definition,we presume that congress intended to give these words their ordinary meanings.asgrow seed winterboer,d.
dorland illustrated medical dictionary defines the term injury as harm or hurt usually applied to damage inflicted on the body by an external force.dorland illustrated medical dictionary ed.it defines the term disease as any deviation from or interruption of the normal structure or function of a part,organ,or system of the body as manifested by characteristic symptoms and signs the etiology,pathology,and prognosis may be known or unknown.id.at.these definitions do not render the statute ambiguous.consequently,we are not faced with the situation in which statutory language gives rise to interpretive doubt that must be resolved in favor of the veteran.see brown gardner,d.at the same time,however,these definitions do not fill the gap le
