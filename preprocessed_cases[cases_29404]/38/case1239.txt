eric cunningham filed a petition with the merit systems protection board mspb to enforce a settlement agreement he entered into with the united states office of personnel management opm,his former employer.cunningham alleged that opm disclosed details about him to another employer and thereby violated a confidentiality provision in that agreement.the mspb found that opm breached the agreement and offered cunningham the only remedies its jurisdiction permitted rescission and reinstatement.when cunningham declined to pursue those remedies,the mspb dismissed his petition.
cunningham then filed suit against the united states in the court of federal claims claims court,seeking monetary damages for breach of contract.the court found that it had subject matter jurisdiction under the tucker act over the suit,cunningham united states,but ruled that the suit was barred by res judicata because the mspb had already issued a final judgment on the merits of cunningham claim,id.at.
while we agree with the claims court that it possessed jurisdiction under the tucker act to hear cunningham claim for breach of contract,we do not agree that res judicata bars his claim.because jurisdictional limits on the mspb remedial authority did not permit cunningham to seek monetary damages for opm breach of contract,the mspb prior judgment does not preclude his suit in the claims court.accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the claims court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
cunningham worked as a criminal investigator in the inspector office of opm from february,until his termination on january.he appealed his termination to the mspb,alleging that opm discriminated against him based on his marital status.during the second day of an administrative hearing at the mspb,cunningham and opm agreed to a settlement.
under the terms of the settlement agreement,cunningham agreed to withdraw his appeal with prejudice,while opm agreed to pay him.the agreement designated the director of opm human resources office as the contact point for reference inquiries about cunningham service as a criminal investigator.in response to such inquiries,the director was permitted to disclose only cunningham date of employment and years of federal service.the agreement also required opm to remove cunningham termination letter from his personnel file.furthermore,the agreement included a confidentiality provision that prohibited both parties from disclosing the terms of the agreement and prohibited cunningham from disclosing information about his grievance.on october,the mspb entered the settlement agreement on the record for purposes of enforcement.
in july,cunningham was offered a position as a background investigator with the united states investigation service usis,a private company that contracts with federal agencies to perform background investigations.after completing a background investigation,usis told cunningham to report to the next training class in the fall of.usis also informed cunningham that it anticipated receiving a new contract from opm,and that opm would conduct its own background investigation.
cunningham reported for training on october.less than one week after cunningham had commenced initial training,the general manager of usis informed cunningham that he was being suspended without pay at the direction of opm security office.cunningham remained suspended until february,when he was terminated by usis.following his termination,he contacted opm and requested a copy of his personnel file.the file contained a document showing that two opm employees neither of whom was the director of human resources had discussed cunningham termination and subsequent appeal to the mspb with opm background investigator.
on march,cunningham filed a petition with the mspb to enforce the settlement agreement with opm.on july,an administrative judge found that opm had materially breached the agreement.the administrative judge explained,however,that enforcement would not be an effective remedy because the mspb lacked authority to award damages for opm breach.instead,cunningham was only entitled to rescind the agreement and reinstate his initial appeal.the administrative judge noted that,if cunningham elected to rescind the settlement agreement and reinstate his appeal,he would be required to reimburse the government for the payment made to him under the terms of the settlement.
on january,the mspb issued a final order adopting the findings of the administrative judge.the mspb sent the case back to the administrative judge to provide cunningham with the option of rescinding the agreement and reinstating his appeal.on february,cunningham informed the administrative judge that he only wanted compensation for his damages caused by opm breach of the settlement agreement he did not want his appeal to be reinstated.the next day,the administrative judge dismissed cunningham petition for enforcement.
on february,cunningham filed a suit in the claims court,seeking monetary damages for opm breach of the settlement agreement although the claims court found that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction under the tucker act,cunningham.at,it dismissed the suit on the basis of res judicata,id.at.

discussion 
on appeal,the government challenges the claims court jurisdiction over the suit,arguing that the settlement agreement is a consent decree over which the mspb has exclusive jurisdiction.cunningham challenges the claims court decision that his suit is barred by res judicata.we review de novo the claims court decision that it possessed subject matter jurisdiction over cunningham claim.holmes united states,adair united states.we also review de novo the claims court dismissal of cunningham claim on the basis of res judicata.acumed llc stryker.
because the united states has sovereign immunity,it can be sued only if it expressly consents to suit.united states navajo nation,d.the united states has waived sovereign immunity for breaches of contract via the tucker act,which provides that t he united states court of federal claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the united states founded upon any express or implied contract with the united states.a.
we have long held that disputes over settlement agreements are governed by contract principles.see greco dep t of the army.however,we have only recently addressed the circumstances in which tucker act jurisdiction may extend to a settlement agreement between a federal agency and one of the agency employees.in holmes united states,and vandesande united states,we found that the claims court possessed jurisdiction under the tucker act to entertain claims alleging breaches of settlement agreements for title vii complaints.under our decisions in holmes and vandesande,the claims court has subject matter jurisdiction over cunningham suit.
in holmes,we resolved a split of authority in the claims court over whether tucker act jurisdiction extends to a claim alleging breach of an agreement that settled an employee title vii action.the majority view at the time was that the claims court lacked jurisdiction over such claims because title vii statutory scheme provided for exclusive review of title vii actions in district courts.see griswold united states,collecting cases this court has consistently held that it lacks jurisdiction to hear claims alleging the breach of a title vii settlement agreement due to the comprehensive statutory scheme established under title vii of the civil rights act.we rejected that view and held that a suit against the government alleging breach of a settlement agreement is fundamentally a suit to enforce a contract and therefore within the reach of the claims court jurisdiction under the tucker act.holmes,at.
at the same time,we cautioned that the alleged breach of a settlement agreement does not necessarily give rise to tucker act jurisdiction.the plaintiff must demonstrat e that the agreement could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of a breach.id.at.a settlement that involved purely relief such as a transfer from one office to another would not suffice for establishing tucker act jurisdiction.id.the plaintiff in holmes had alleged that the department of the navy the navy breached two agreements settling title vii employment actions.under the terms of the settlement agreements,the navy agreed to expunge a suspension letter from holmes personnel file and to document that he had resigned for personal reasons.id.the navy also agreed to provide holmes with a neutral reference in response to inquiries from future employers.id.at.based on these terms,we found that the settlement agreements contemplated money damages.
we think that,in the context of the two agreements,the purpose of documenting and expunging holmes record clearly was to prevent holmes from being denied future employment based on his record as the navy maintained it prior to the agreements.in short,the agreements inherently relate to monetary compensation through relationship to holmes future employment.further,there is no language in the agreements indicating that the parties did not intend for money damages to be available in the event of breach.
in holmes,the government argued that one of the agreements at issue was a consent decree over which the claims court could not exercise jurisdiction.id.at.we disagreed with the government characterization of the agreement and thus declined to address the question of whether the claims court could exercise jurisdiction over a claim alleging a violation of a consent decree.id.but not long after our decision in holmes,we addressed the relationship between consent decrees and tucker act jurisdiction in vandesande united states.
in vandesande,the plaintiff sought damages in the claims court for her federal employer breach of a settlement agreement.the agreement,which settled a title vii claim,had been incorporated into a final order by an eeoc administrative law judge.the claims court dismissed the plaintiff suit on the basis that tucker act jurisdiction did not extend to a settlement agreement that had been incorporated in a consent decree entered by another court or administrative entity.id.at.
we reversed,holding that a settlement agreement,even one embodied in a decree,is a contract within the meaning of the tucker act.id.at quoting angle united states,cir.we noted that the supreme court has recognized that consent decrees have a dual character,possessing attributes of both contracts and judicial orders.vandesande,at citing united states itt cont l baking,d.the legal status of a title vii consent decree,we explained,will depend upon the nature of the case.id.at.when a plaintiff seeks to obtain the benefit of the bargain struck by the plaintiff and the government in an underlying settlement agreement,the plaintiff is enforcing a contract.see id.at.if a settlement agreement was no longer enforceable as a contract once incorporated into a consent decree,the effect would be to divest the court of federal claims of its tucker act jurisdiction by the simple act of a court or agency adopting the agreement.we are unaware of any act of congress that would allow for such an outcome.see also franklin mason mabus,transferring a federal employee claim alleging a breach of a title vii settlement agreement from a district court to the claims court because permitting the district court to reserve exclusive enforcement of the settlement agreement would reduce the scope of the claims court jurisdiction and thus violate the rule that neither a court nor the parties has the power to alter a federal court statutory grant of subject matter jurisdiction.
under our decisions in holmes and vandesande,the claims court possesses subject matter jurisdiction to hear cunningham claim.
the circumstances of opm alleged breach are substantially similar to the circumstances of the navy alleged breach in holmes.as in holmes,the purpose of the key settlement terms is to prevent the former employee from being denied future employment based on his record as the agency maintained it prior to the agreement.holmes,at.the settlement agreement here limited what information opm could disclose and required opm to remove cunningham termination letter from his personnel file.cunningham,like the plaintiff in holmes,alleges that his former government employer damaged his future employment prospects by breaching the agreement.moreover,there is no language in the agreement indicating that the parties did not intend for money damages to be available in the event of breach.id.at.we thus find that the settlement agreement between cunningham and opm could fairly be interpreted as contemplating money damages in the event of a breach.see id.at.
the government points to two differences between the settlement agreements at issue in holmes and the settlement agreement at issue in this case.first,the agreements in holmes were not incorporated into consent decrees,whereas the agreement here was adopted in a consent decree by the mspb.second,the agreements in holmes settled title vii claims,whereas the agreement here settled a claim arising under the civil service reform act csra,which defines the authority of the mspb.see.neither difference warrants depriving the claims court of subject matter jurisdiction.
we answered the government first point in vandesande.like the plaintiff in vandesande,cunningham is seeking to enforce the underlying settlement agreement in order to obtain the benefit of his bargain with his former government employer he is not asking the claims court to enforce the mspb order.the fact that the settlement agreement was incorporated into a decree does not strip the agreement of its character as a contract.see vandesande,at.
as for the government characterization of vandesande as depending upon the specific statutory scheme under which the original claim arose,appellee br,we see no language in vandesande that ties its holding to the specific statutory scheme of title vii.on the contrary,we suggested that the nature of the case the content of the underlying agreement and the manner in which the plaintiff sought to enforce that agreement determined whether the claims court had tucker act jurisdiction.vandesande,at.that reasoning applies with equal force to an agreement settling a dispute arising under the csra.
we also find unpersuasive the government contention that the comprehensive scheme of the csra bars cunningham from seeking monetary damages for breach of contract in the claims court.in holmes,we rejected that notion as it applied to title vii.see holmes,at.as the claims court correctly noted here,the remedial schemes of the csra and title vii are similar.cunningham.at in much the same way as the csra established a comprehensive and integrated review scheme for the resolution of federal personnel disputes,title vii established an exclusive,administrative and judicial scheme for the redress of federal employment discrimination.quoting united states fausto,d brown servs,d.
moreover,the adjudication of cunningham claim for monetary relief does not involve the review of a personnel action.see fausto,at holding that the comprehensive scheme of the csra precludes tucker act jurisdiction over the review of an agency personnel determination bobula united states dep t of justice,holding that the little tucker act does not confer jurisdiction over a settlement agreement that requires the court to review the underlying personnel action.cunningham suit does not require the claims court to review the facts or law underlying his initial discrimination grievance against opm.nor does his suit demand equitable relief that might require opm to undertake a personnel action.rather,cunningham is seeking money damages to compensate for income he would have earned from his private employer had opm not breached the settlement agreement.see holmes,at emphasis added explaining that a statutory scheme does not preclude a suit for money damages in the event of breach that is separate from,or in addition to,the relief the regulation provides.
therefore,we hold that cunningham suit for money damages under the tucker act falls within the claims court jurisdiction.
having determined that the claims
