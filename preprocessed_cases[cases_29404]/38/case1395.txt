lizzie mayfield appeals a december,final decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court affirming a decision of the board of veterans appeals board denying mayfield claim for dependency and indemnity compensation dic because her husband death was not service connected,and upholding the board determination that a letter sent to mayfield provided her with notice as required by the veterans claims assistance act vcaa,a.mayfield nicholson.mayfield iii.we agree.in addition,one consideration is beyond our jurisdiction as factual.for the reasons discussed below,we affirm in part and dismiss in part.
this case is before this court for the second time on appeal.see mayfield nicholson,mayfield ii.we reiterate the facts described in mayfield ii to the extent that they are necessary for understanding the nature of this appeal now before us.
mayfield first filed her claim for dic in upon her husband death from congestive heart failure due to coronary artery disease in december,the department of veterans affairs va regional office issued a notice of decision denying mayfield dic claim on the ground that mayfield failed to establish any causal relationship between her husband military service and his death.mayfield filed a notice of disagreement,and in june,the regional office issued a statement of the case soc stating that no medical evidence has been presented which provides a link between mayfield death and his military service.mayfield appealed to the board,which remanded the case to the regional office in december to comply with the recently enacted vcaa.
the vcaa was enacted in november to require the va to assist veterans claiming va benefits.congress passed the legislation in response to a july decision of the veterans court,morton west,holding that the va did not have any duty to assist veterans in developing their claims to benefits unless the claims were.the vcaa eliminated the claim requirement and imposed upon the va the burden of provid ing a substantial amount of assistance to a claimant seeking benefits.cong.rec,explanatory statement by the house and senate committees on veterans affairs see also sanders nicholson.
as part of this assistance,the va is required to notify claimants of what they must do to substantiate their claims.a.this statute,entitled notice to claimants of required information and evidence,provides 
upon receipt of a complete or substantially complete application,the secretary shall notify the claimant and the claimant representative,if any,of any information,and any medical or lay evidence,not previously provided to the secretary that is necessary to substantiate the claim.as part of that notice,the secretary shall indicate which portion of that information and evidence,if any,is to be provided by the claimant and which portion,if any,the secretary,in accordance with section of this title and any other applicable provisions of law,will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.
id.the statutory notice requirement of a is implemented in b,which provides in pertinent part 
when va receives a complete or substantially complete application for benefits,it will notify the claimant of any information and medical or lay evidence that is necessary to substantiate the claim.va will inform the claimant which information and evidence,if any,that the claimant is to provide to va and which information and evidence,if any,that va will attempt to obtain on behalf of the claimant.va will also request that the claimant provide any evidence in the claimant possession that pertains to the claim.
the va duty to notify under the vcaa can not be satisfied by various communications from which a claimant might have been able to infer what evidence the va found lacking in the claimant presentation,as such notices do not contain the same content or serve the same purpose as a notification.mayfield ii,at.thus,to comply with a,the va must provide vcaa notice prior to its initial unfavorable decision.see pelegrini principi.
on december,the regional office issued a letter to mayfield,requesting that she identify all health care providers who treated her husband as well as any medical treatment received by him in the period immediately preceding his death.in response,mayfield submitted forms authorizing her husband physicians to release his medical records and submit any medical evidence surrounding his death.on march,the regional office sent mayfield a second letter presumably meant to serve as the notice required by the vcaa.the letter explained what had been done to assist in mayfield claim and what information or evidence the va still needed.
mayfield responded with a letter requesting a medical opinion on the likelihood that her late husband service disability was related to his death.the va obtained a medical opinion from a va physician concluding that a connection between mayfield service disability and his death was unlikely.accordingly,in january,the regional office issued a supplemental statement of the case ssoc explaining the reasons for its decision denying service connection for the cause of mayfield death.
the case returned to the board on appeal,where the board concluded that the va had satisfied the notice requirements of the vcaa with its december letter,june soc,and january ssoc.for inexplicable reasons,however,the board opinion did not mention the march letter.the veterans court affirmed the decision of the board,albeit on the basis of the march letter.specifically,the veterans court held that the va had fulfilled its obligations under the vcaa based on the court analysis of the march,communication not relied on by the board.mayfield nicholson.mayfield i.
on appeal,this court reversed and remanded,holding that the veterans court decision violate d the principle of administrative law that a court reviewing an agency decision generally may not sustain the agency ruling on a ground different from that invoked by the agency.mayfield ii,at.the veterans court remanded for a determination by the board in the first instance whether the march communication satisfied the notice requirements of the vcaa.
the board issued a supplemental decision in december in which it concluded that the march communication fulfilled the va notice obligations under the vcaa,and the veterans court affirmed in mayfield iii.the veterans court upheld the board determinations that the march letter provided adequate notice under the vcaa,the january ssoc was a subsequent decision on her case,and harmless error was a basis for finding that the notice was adequate.
specifically,the veterans court stated that,although the march letter provided that mayfield was to provide any evidence that supports her dic claim,it was supplemental to the more specific notice she was provided in previous communications.the veterans court rejected mayfield argument that the vcaa requires the va to notify the claimant that evidence from a particular specialist is necessary to substantiate a claim,stating that such action would improperly require assessing and weighing the information prior to rendering a decision on the claim.
the veterans court also affirmed the board finding that the january ssoc served as an adjudication of mayfield dic claim appealable to the board.mayfield argued that,even if the march communication satisfied the vcaa,the va failed to issue an adjudication decision from which she could appeal.in particular,mayfield pointed out that the cover sheet of the ssoc stated that it was not a decision on the appeal.the veterans court found mayfield argument to be without merit,stating that the ssoc complied with all applicable due process and notification requirements and therefore constituted a readjudication decision.the veterans court considered that the its nature being supplemental to the sufficient to put mayfield on notice that she had days in which to appeal as provided in the soc.
finally,the veterans court upheld the board finding that any defect in the timing of the a notice was harmless error,rejecting mayfield contention that the board could not consider harmless error under the statutory provisions governing the board.t
