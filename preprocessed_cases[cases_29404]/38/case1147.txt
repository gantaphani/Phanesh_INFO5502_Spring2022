this case involves an effort on behalf of some participants in the medicare part d prescription drug program to to government efforts to recover payments mistakenly made to those participants.the district court issued an injunction ordering the secretary of health and human services the secretary to refund monies to those participants who had,at the secretary request,returned the errant payments and to notify all recipients of a right to request waiver of repayment.this court stayed the injunction.the plaintiffs have over the course of the litigation invoked two statutory bases for relief.plaintiffs also brought constitutional claims,which the district court did not reach.as to the claim under b,we find that the district court lacked jurisdiction and the second claim,under,clearly lacks merit.thus,we vacate the injunction and remand.
medicare part d,established by the medicare prescription drug,improvement,and modernization act of,pub,stat,offers subsidized prescription drug insurance coverage.a.whereas under medicare parts a and b the government pays providers on participants behalf for goods or services received,under part d the government contracts for and subsidizes insurance plans offered by private,insurers.id.
part d participants pay monthly premiums to their insurers.see id.a.most make these payments directly,but about have opted to have the social security administration ssa deduct the amount of their part d premium from their monthly benefits under title ii of the social security act and transmit that sum,on the participant behalf,to the insurer.id.b d a see also a f.the ssa,which plaintiffs have not sued,administers,survivor,and disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act health and human services hhs administers the various medicare programs found under title xviii of that act.since the ssa,directed by the commissioner of social security the commissioner,has been independent of hhs.see social security independence and program improvements act of,pub,stat.title ii id.title xviii.
in a monumental gaffe in early august,the ssa wrote to some participants,stating w e will no longer deduct money for your health plan premium s from your monthly benefits.amended,ex.b,joint appendix.the letter also said,without further explanation,that the addressee would be receiving a check in a specified amount,coinciding with the recipient premium for the month.the average payment was,for a total of some million.the parties agree these payments were all made in error.in early september,the secretary requested repayment of the funds by the end of that month,but indicated that i f returning the amount in full presents you with a hardship,you may request to make monthly installment payments for as many as seven months.see id.ex.a.the secretary letter also stated accurately that despite the mistaken payment to the insured,prescription drug coverage will continue uninterrupted.id.
on september,action alliance and the gray panthers collectively the alliance,advocacy organizations whose membership includes many part d participants,filed suit in district court seeking injunctive,declaratory,and mandamus relief on statutory and constitutional grounds.the plaintiffs later amended their complaint to add lucy carolyn loveall,a part d participant who received a check for,a sum which she spent and states she is now unable to repay.the complaint rested in part on,which allows the government to recover funds where more than the correct amount is paid under th e medicare subchapter for items or services furnished an individual,b,but provides for government waiver of this recovery 
there shall be no adjustment as provided in subsection b of this section nor shall there be recovery in any case where the incorrect payment has been made with respect to an individual who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purposes of subchapter ii,survivors,and disability insurance or subchapter xviii medicare of this chapter or would be against equity and good conscience.
the alliance asserted that part d participants who received erroneous payments were entitled,under,to written notice of their right to seek waiver of repayment and an oral hearing prior to recovery of such payments.amended compl.at.the district court rejected this claim,noting that applies only to payments for items or services such as under medicare parts a and b,and thus that its waiver provision did not encompass erroneous premium refunds.action alliance of senior citizens leavitt,d.
but the court observed that medicare part a and b participants who authorize ssa to withhold their premiums under those parts do enjoy a waiver right for erroneous premium refunds.internal ssa policy guidelines,in the form of its program operations manual system poms,create such a right on the basis of title ii general waiver provision,b.action alliance,d at see also social security administration,program operations manual system hi.
section addresses adjustment or recovery of incorrect payments to title ii social security beneficiaries w henever the commissioner of social security finds that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made to any person under this title ii subchapter.a.section b goes on to say 
in any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made,there shall be no adjustment of payments to,or recovery by the united states from,any person who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.
although the poms was silent as to waiver for erroneous refunds of part d premiums,the district court believed that the statutory scheme required that part d beneficiaries receive the same treatment as those under parts a and action alliance,d at.it ordered the secretary to the erroneous payments to part d participants who had repaid them and to notify all recipients of a right to request a hardship waiver.
the secretary challenges the injunction on a number of grounds,most pertinently that the district court erred as a matter of law in concluding that the statutes and regulations governing overpayment of benefits and premiums under medicare parts a and b apply to premium refunds under medicare part d.the district court relied primarily on two statutes in support of the asserted waiver right also invoked by the alliance on appeal b,which is the source of the waiver right provided in poms for part a and b beneficiaries,and c,which,though applicable only to provision of items and services,also indicated a general embrace of waiver on grounds of equity and good conscience.before reaching either ground,however,we consider the court jurisdiction despite the government failure to assert its lack until we called for briefing on the subject.see midwest independent transmission system operator,ferc,describing court independent obligation to be certain of its jurisdiction.
jurisdiction of b claim.the alliance asserts that the district court had jurisdiction over its b claim under the federal question and mandamus statutes,and,as well as title ii separate judicial review provision,g.but the alliance and the individual plaintiff failed to present a b claim to the commissioner of social security before seeking review the omission deprives the federal courts of jurisdiction to consider the claim under g,and,because that route was fully available to the alliance,precludes jurisdiction under the other provisions.
the starting point for analysis is h,which provides 
no findings of fact or decision of the commissioner of social security shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.no action against the united states,the commissioner of social security,or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section or of title to recover on any claim arising under this title ii subchapter.
by its plain terms,then,h bars title ii claims against any officer of the united states thus including the secretary and applies to any claims arising under this subchapter.
the alliance makes clear as it must,given a requirement of a pa
