introduction 
appellants william bandt and byron ellsworth are former employees of the county of san diego county and are members of the san diego county retirement association association.the association is administered by the board of retirement board.the county is a public agency that elected to establish the association pension fund pension fund or fund pursuant to the county employees retirement law cerl.the board manages the pension fund pursuant to article xvi,section of the california constitution and the cerl,et.under the cerl,counties make contributions to their members pension funds to cover the normal accrual of liabilities and may make additional contributions to cover any amortized unfunded liability in the fund.
in march,the county increased the pension benefits for members of the association,including appellants,by approximately billion.this increase in benefits caused a corresponding increase in the liabilities of the pension fund.prior to this increase in benefits,the county decided that rather than amortizing the full amount of the billion increase,it would voluntarily reduce the unfunded liability in the pension fund by issuing pension obligation bonds in the amount of million.
in september,the board performed its annual actuarial valuation of the pension fund,as of june.the june valuation reflected the huge increase in liabilities in the pension fund caused by the billion in benefit enhancements.however,the valuation did not take into account the million voluntary deposit the county made to the fund in october from the issuance of the pension bonds because,as a result of litigation unrelated to this case,the county was unable to deposit the proceeds from the sale of the pension bonds into the pension fund until october.
in may,at the county request,the board approved an interim valuation of the pension fund as of october,for the purpose of reflecting the county million voluntary contribution to the pension fund.the effect of the board action in adopting the interim actuarial valuation was to reduce the amount of the county employer contribution to the fund for the fiscal year from what the county would otherwise have had to contribute based on the june,valuation.
appellants filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief and a petition for writ of mandate challenging the board decision to adopt the october,interim actuarial valuation of the pension fund.appellants claimed that the board action violated section,subdivision b,which provides in relevant part,a retirement board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries shall take precedence over any other duty.the trial court denied appellants petition for writ of mandate and dismissed their complaint.on appeal,appellants renew the claim they raised in the trial court.
appellants acknowledge that the county increase in retirement benefits was generous,and that it undisputedly benefited the association members.appellants do not dispute that the board had the authority to perform the october,interim valuation and acknowledge that,if the board had not performed the october,interim valuation,the county million voluntary contribution would have been reflected in its june,valuation.appellants concede that the board has the power to establish a reasonable amortization period for the system unfunded liability,which may not exceed years.appellants also acknowledge that the county october voluntary contribution of million from the pension bonds dramatically lowered the amount of unfunded liability in the pension fund.appellants do not contend that the october interim valuation was actuarially unsound.
appellants further concede that if the board had reached an agreement with the county that the county would voluntarily contribute million to the pension fund only on the condition that the board conduct an interim valuation to reflect the payment,it would have been acting in the interest of its members in doing so.appellants only argument is that,having received the county million voluntary payment without promising to conduct such an interim valuation,the board was constitutionally required under section to maximize the amount of money in the pension fund in the short run by refusing to conduct an interim valuation that would take into account the million payment.
we conclude that there is no constitutional principle that prohibited the board from recognizing the county voluntary contribution to the pension fund through an interim valuation.section does not require that the board maximize the county employer contribution at the earliest possible moment.on the contrary,it is undisputed that the board may,under section,exercise its judgment to allow the county to pay for increased retirement benefits over a period of up to years.if it is within the board discretion to do this,then it is also within the board discretion to decide to reflect the receipt of the county october extraordinary voluntary payment to the fund at the time it was made.
before the board decided to recognize the million voluntary contribution,the association actuary had informed the board that the fund was in sound financial condition.the trial court found that the board action would not impair the ability of the fund to pay benefits to its members.the fact that the county had just granted members a billion increase in benefits,that it had paid for half of those increased benefits in a single year,and that it was facing the prospect of laying off employee members due to fiscal difficulties encountered in,further supports the conclusion that the board acted in the interests of its members by recognizing the county million voluntary contribution by way of the interim valuation.in fact,three labor employee organizations supported the board decision to adopt the interim valuation.
we conclude that the board did not act against the interests of its members in adopting the interim valuation and,thus,that the board did not act unconstitutionally.the judgment is therefore affirmed.
factual and procedural background 
the pension fund receives its funding from three sources employee contributions,employer contributions from the county and the return on the association investments.government code section sets forth the board authority to perform actuarial valuations in order to determine what the county yearly contribution rate to the pension fund will be.government code section,subdivision a,provides 
an actuarial valuation shall be made within one year after the date on which any system established under this chapter becomes effective,and thereafter at intervals not to exceed three years.the valuation shall be conducted under the supervision of an actuary and shall cover the mortality,service,and compensation experience of the members and beneficiaries,and shall evaluate the assets and liabilities of the retirement fund.upon the basis of the investigation,valuation,and recommendation of the actuary,the board shall,at least days prior to the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year,recommend to the board of supervisors the changes in the rates of interest,in the rates of contributions of members,and in county and district appropriations as are necessary.with respect to the rates of interest to be credited to members and to the county or district,the board may,in its sound discretion,recommend a rate that is higher or lower than the interest assumption rate established by the actuarial survey.no adjustment shall be included in the new rates for time prior to the effective date of the revision.
pursuant to government code section,the county employer contribution is divided into two components a normal contribution rate,and an unfunded liability rate.government code section provides 
notwithstanding section,and in accordance with section or,the board may determine county or district contributions on the basis of a normal contribution rate which shall be computed as a level percentage of compensation which,when applied to the future compensation of the average new member entering the system,together with the required member contributions,will be sufficient to provide for the payment of all prospective benefits of such member.the portion of liability not provided by the normal contribution rate shall be amortized over a period not to exceed years.
in march,enhanced county retirement benefits went into effect.these benefits increased the pension fund liability by approximately billion.prior to this increase in benefits,the county had determined that it would voluntarily reduce the unfunded liability in the pension fund associated with the benefit enhancements,by issuing pension obligation bonds in the amount of million.although the county planned to issue the bonds concurrently with the march increase in benefits so that the increase in the pension fund liability resulting from the benefit increases would be offset by the deposit of the bond proceeds,the issuance of the bonds was delayed due to litigation unrelated to this case.
in september,the association actuary prepared a valuation of the pension fund with an effective date of june,the county had not yet issued the pension obligation bonds as of this date.as a result,the june,actuarial valuation included the liability to the pension created by the billion benefit enhancements,but did not take into account any bond proceeds the fund received from the county.due in large part to the significant increase in liability caused by the benefit enhancements,the june,valuation recommended an increase in the county employer contribution rate from percent of its payroll for the fiscal year to percent for the fiscal year.
on october,the county made a million voluntary payment to the pension fund from the proceeds of its sale of pension obligation bonds.at the board november,meeting,the county chief financial officer,william kelly,spoke.he requested that the board appoint an ad hoc committee to work with the county in evaluating funding options for the pension fund,in view of the significant increase in the fund liabilities caused by the march benefit increases.the board appointed the ad hoc committee and also adopted the employer contribution rate stated in the june,valuation.near the end of the meeting,kelly indicated that,based on the ad hoc committee work,the county might request a reduction in its employer contribution rate.
after the november,meeting,the board and the county explored various funding options for the enhanced benefits as well as the board treatment of the county million contribution to the pension fund.the board weighed the pros and cons of various options over a period of approximately six months,and held several committee meetings to discuss these issues.among the county proposals were that the board adopt an interim valuation as of october,for the purpose of accounting for the board receipt of the million voluntary contribution.in addition,the county proposed that the board lengthen the amortization period for the unfunded accrued actuarial liability uaal in the pension fund to years from the current period for benefit enhancement liabilities,and the current period for other items.
a board subcommittee directed the association actuary to prepare a valuation with an effective date of october.the october interim valuation recognized as an asset the county million voluntary contribution and also recognized approximately million in new offsetting liabilities that were incurred after the june,valuation.in addition,the interim valuation adopted a new amortization period for all uaal in the pension fund.the board approved the october interim valuation at its may,meeting.
the board adoption of the interim valuation had the net effect of lowering the county employer contribution rate for the fiscal year from percent of the county payroll to percent.the association actuary explained to the board that the interim valuation lowered the county employer contribution by between million and million the actuary further explained that approximately million of this change was attributable to the lengthening of the amortization period,and the bulk of the remainder of the change resulted from recognition of the million voluntary payment from the pension bond proceeds.
in may,appellants filed a complaint against the board and the county seeking in relevant part a declaration that the board may,action in approving the october,valuation violated section,subdivision b and a petition for writ of mandate directing the board to utilize the june,valuation and ordering the county to make the employer contribution at the rate required by the june,valuation.
in september,appellants voluntarily dismissed the county as a defendant,without prejudice.shortly thereafter,the parties stipulated to the county intervening as a party in interest.
in february and march,the trial court held a bench trial on appellants complaint.the court issued its statement of decision in may,in which it concluded that the board had not violated section by adopting the october,interim valuation.in june,the trial court entered a judgment denying appellants petition for a writ of mandate and dismissing the complaint.
appellants timely appeal.
discussiona.the board adoption of the october,interim actuarial valuation did not violate the california constitution 
appellants claim the board violated section,subdivision b when it voted to adopt the october,interim actuarial valuation that recognized the county million voluntary contribution to the pension fund,for the purpose of determining the county employer contribution rate for the fiscal year beginning on july,
standard of review 
the parties disagree as to the applicable standard of review both in the trial court and in this court.appellants maintain that the trial court erred by reviewing the constitutionality of the board action under an arbitrary and capricious standard.appellants also contend that their constitutional claim should be independently determined by this court based upon the trial court determination of the material facts surrounding the board adoption of the interim actuarial valuation.the board and the county imply that the trial court properly reviewed the board action under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review and argue that this court should apply a deferential standard of review on appeal 
we need not resolve this issue because we conclude that appellants claim fails under any standard of review.
section sets forth the board duties in its governance of the association pension system 
a.the text of section 
section provides in relevant part 
notwithstanding any other provisions of law or this constitution to the contrary,the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have plenary authority and fiduciary responsibility for investment of moneys and administration of the system,subject to all of the following 
a the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall have the sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of the public pension or retirement system.the retirement board shall also have sole and exclusive responsibility to administer the system in a manner that will assure prompt delivery of benefits and related services to the participants and their beneficiaries.the assets of a public pension or retirement system are trust funds and shall be held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the pension or retirement system and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.
b the members of the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall discharge their duties with respect to the system solely in the interest of,and for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to,participants and their beneficiaries,minimizing employer contributions thereto,and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.a retirement board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries shall take precedence over any other duty.
c the members of the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall discharge their duties with respect to the system with the care,skill,prudence,and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims.
d the members of the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system shall diversify the investments of the system so as to minimize the risk of loss and to maximize the rate of return,unless under the circumstances it is clearly not prudent to do so.
e the retirement board of a public pension or retirement system,consistent with the exclusive fiduciary responsibilities vested in it,shall have the sole and exclusive power to provide for actuarial services in order to assure the competency of the assets of the public pension or retirement system.italics added.
b.the board duty to its participants and beneficiaries under section,subdivision b 
appellants claim the board adoption of the interim valuation constituted a violation of the final sentence of section,subdivision b.this sentence was added,along with other amendments to section,by the passage of proposition in.in order to evaluate appellants claim,we first consider the nature of the duty a retirement board owes to its participants and their beneficiaries that must be prioritized in accordance with the final sentence of section,subdivision b.we conclude that the text of section,subdivision b is ambiguous as to a retirement board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries and the manner in which that duty must be prioritized.however,assuming appellants interpretation of section,subdivision b is correct,we conclude that the board did not violate subdivision b,for the reasons stated in part,post.
this case raises an issue of first impression,as no prior published opinion has interpreted the current version of section,subdivision b.in delaney superior court cal d,the supreme court outlined the principles that govern our interpretation of the california constitution 
in the case of a constitutional provision adopted by the voters,their intent governs.citations.to determine intent,the court turns first to the words themselves for the answer.citations.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature in the case of a statute or of the voters in the case of a provision adopted by the voters.citation.
ballot arguments are accepted sources from which to ascertain the voters intent.delaney,supra,cal d at.
appellants interpretation of section,subdivision b 
appellants define the duty a retirement board owes to its participants and their beneficiaries pursuant to section,subdivision b in various ways throughout their opening brief.in one portion of their brief,appellants assert that t he payment of benefits is the most important duty a retirement board owes to its participants and beneficiaries.italics added.in other places,appellants appear to expand the scope of a retirement board duty,claiming that such a board has a paramount fiduciary duty to provide and protect benefits to participants.italics added.finally,appellants assert an even broader duty,claiming that a retirement board may not take any action which helps a public employer if that action harms the interest of members.italics added.
appellants maintain that the final sentence of section,subdivision b should be interpreted as prioritizing the three purposes of a retirement board set forth in the first sentence of section,subdivision b,namely providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries,minimizing employer contributions,and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the system.appellants argue that t he unambiguous language of the final sentence of section,subdivision b makes it plain that a retirement board fiduciary duty to provide and protect benefits to its participants and their beneficiaries is paramount and can not be subordinated to any lesser objective of minimizing employer contributions,subd.b.
appellants contend that a retirement board does not have any duty to minimize employer contributions pursuant to section,subdivision b.they maintain that section,subdivision b requires that a retirement board give precedence to the board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries over the subordinate objective of minimizing employer contributions.
in their reply brief,appellants continue their reformulation of the duty a board owes to its participants and members,claiming for the first time that section,subdivision b requires that the board give precedence to two other duties contained in other subdivisions of section.specifically,appellants claim that the board failed to give precedence to its duty to assure the prompt delivery of benefits,as specified in section,subdivision a.later,appellants claim,also for the first time,that the board failed to give precedence to its purported fiduciary duty to assure the sufficiency of trust assets to deliver benefits,citing section,subdivisions a,e.neither the board nor the county have had the opportunity to respond to this reformulation of the board claimed duties,and appellants fail to provide any reason for raising these contentions for the first time in reply.accordingly,we decline to consider these arguments.see shade foods,innovative products sales marketing,th,fn,d points raised in the reply brief for the first time will not be considered,unless good reason is shown for failure to present them before.
even if we were to consider these arguments,we would not find them compelling.the duty specified in section,subdivision a is a duty to administer the system in a manner so as to assure the delivery of benefits to members.this provision requires that the board develop an administrative structure to assure that benefits are delivered to members in a timely manner assuring that claims for benefits are processed and paid properly,and not with assuring that the fund is adequately funded.the board decisions regarding the appropriate level of an employer contributions to the pension fund simply do not impact its ability to carry out this duty.
the duty specified in section,subdivision e is expressly related to the board exclusive power to provide for actuarial services.it is not a freestanding provision requiring that the board assure the sufficiency of trust assets to deliver benefits,as appellants contend.appellants expressly state that they are not claiming the interim valuation was actuarially unsound.thus,the board actions in approving the actuary interim report did not constitute a violation of the board actuarial duty to its participants and beneficiaries set forth in subdivision e.
accordingly,we restrict our analysis to appellants interpretation of section,subdivision b as set forth in their opening brief.
ii.section,subdivision b is ambiguous 
the final sentence of section,subdivision b does not expressly define the duty a retirement board owes to its beneficiaries that must be given precedence.the text of section,subdivision b could reasonably be interpreted to mean that the duty that must be given precedence is to act in the interest of participants and their beneficiaries,subd.b,to provid e benefits to participants and their beneficiaries,subd.b,or some other duty defined outside subdivision b.
the text of subdivision b is also ambiguous as to whether or not its final sentence is intended to refer to the three duties or purposes specified in the first sentence.further,it is not clear that the first sentence of section,subdivision b defines three duties of a board member.the first sentence of section,subdivision b refers to duties with respect to the system and outlines three purposes that may be taken by a retirement board.thus,the final sentence of section,subdivision b could be interpreted to state that a board duty to its participants is greater than any other duty it might have,without reference to the preceding three purposes specified in the initial sentence.
on the other hand,the constitutional genealogy and history of section,subdivision b suggests that its final sentence should be interpreted to mean that the board duty to its participants and beneficiaries,as defined in the first sentence of subdivision b,must take precedence over the other two duties specified in the first sentence of subdivision b.
the court in singh board of retirement th,d outlined the purposes behind the enactment of proposition 
proposition was an outcome of california recent budget difficulties and the struggle to find the financial resources to meet budget shortfalls proposition was placed on the ballot by those who opposed assembly bill no,which passed the legislature and was signed by governor wilson.cal.office of research,senate publication,analysis of november ballot propositions analysis at.
briefly,the proposition in question was in response to a bill which had permitted the legislature and the governor to use reserve funds in a retirement system in this case,the state public employees retirement system,or pers to substitute for normal state payments required to fund the freeing state money to help close the budget shortfall.analysis at.assem.bill also transferred pers actuarial functions to the governor by giving him the power to appoint the pers actuary.
the substitution of reserve account funds for state payments and the transfer of actuarial oversight powers away from pers were viewed by opponents as unwise and unfair,and many called it one more raid on the pension system.analysis at.proposition was thus intended by its proponents to insulate the administration of retirement systems from oversight and control by legislative and executive authorities,and also return control of the actuarial function to the retirement boards themselves.this increased level of independence would make the retirement systems less of a target for local and state officials looking for a way to balance a budget.analysis at.
the fact that the purpose of proposition was to protect against legislative and executive raid s of the pension system singh board of retirement,supra,th at,d,is consistent with an interpretation that the final sentence of section,subdivision b was intended to provide that a retirement board duty to its participants and members was paramount,and thus must be placed above any purpose to minimize employer contributions.the placement of the paramount duty provision as the final sentence of section,subdivision b also suggests that it should be interpreted with reference to the preceding sentence.
the legislative analyst interpretation of the last sentence of section,subdivision b contained in the ballot materials presented to the voters prior to the enactment of proposition is consistent with this interpretation 
p roviding benefits is currently one of three basic,and equal,responsibilities of the pension boards.placing benefits as the highest priority could result in higher costs to employers if board decisions increase benefits without equal consideration to the cost for those benefits.ballot,analysis of.
it is unclear from the text of section,subdivision b,whether the board has a secondary duty to minimize employer contributions.the text suggests the existence of such a duty by stating that a board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries shall take precedence over any other duty,subd.b,italics added.however,it could also be argued that the final sentence does not actually define any duties of the board and instead should be interpreted to mean that the board duty to its participants and members is greater than any other unspecified duty the board may have.see city of sacramento public employees retirement system d.city of sacramento.
in city of sacramento,the court interpreted the employer contribution minimization provision contained in section,subdivision b,prior to the addition of the final sentence of that subdivision instructing the board to give precedence to its duty to participants and their beneficiaries.the city of sacramento court expressed skepticism as to whether a retirement board had a duty to minimize employer contributions,but stated even assuming article xvi,section creates a duty to minimize employer contributions,any such assumed duty was subordinate to a retirement board paramount duty to its beneficiaries.city of sacramento,supra,d at.
city of sacramento was decided during the year prior to the passage of proposition,and contains language strikingly similar to that contained in proposition.compare city of sacramento,supra,d at.any duty pers has to minimize employer contributions may not take precedence over its duty to the beneficiaries of the system with,subd.b a retirement board duty to its participants and their beneficiaries shall take precedence over any other duty.accordingly,one could argue that the final sentence of subdivision b should be interpreted as merely constitutionalizing the city of sacramento court statement that a retirement board duty to its participants and members takes precedence over any other possible duty the board may have,rather than to mean that a retirement board in fact has a secondary duty to minimize employer contributions.
iii.for purposes of this decision,we assume that appellants interpretation of section,subdivision b in their opening brief is correct 
we conclude that the language of section subdivision b is ambiguous.however,because none of the ambiguities are material for purposes of our decision in this case,we need not define the precise contours of section,subdivision b in this opinion.rather,we assume for purposes of this decision that the broad interpretation of section,subdivision b offered by appellants in their opening brief is correct.accordingly,in determining whether the board violated section,subdivision b in part,post,we assume,as appellants contend,that the board has a paramount duty to act in the the interest of its members,and that this duty must be given precedence over any other duties the board may have,including any subordinate objective to minimize employer contributions.
neither party has offered a constitutional standard by which this court should determine whether a retirement board has violated its constitutional mandate by acting in a manner contrary to the interest of its members.the law of corporate governance provides one possible standard for determining whether a board action was in the interest of its members.see kovich paseo del mar homeowners th,d.n either a court nor minority shareholders can substitute their business judgment for that of a corporation where its board of directors has acted in good faith and with a view to the best interests of the corporation and all its shareholders.doubtless,there are other standards that are less deferential to a retirement board judgment.however,we find it unnecessary to adopt a precise constitutional standard by which to determine whether the retirement board has violated its duty to act in the interests of its members,because we conclude that under even the broadest sense of the phrase,the board did not act unconstitutionally in this case.
the board action in recognizing the county voluntary contribution to the pension fund did not violate section 
a.the board action in recognizing the county voluntary contribution to the pension fund did not materially affect members benefit security 
appellants claim the board decision to recognize the county voluntary contribution to the pension fund harmed members by decreasing their benefit security,their assurance that benefit promises will be paid when they come due.appellants maintain that it defies common sense to suggest that it is better to have less,rather than more,money in their pension trust fund.appellants contend that the board action had the effect of increasing the amount of uaal in the pension trust fund and that this is,by definition,bad for members because it decreases their benefit security.
a decision that increases uaal is not necessarily bad for members.as the actuary june,valuation makes clear,the primary cause of the increase in uaal in the association pension fund in was an increase in pension benefits valued at approximately billion obviously,such benefit increases do not harm members.if the board were prohibited from increasing uaal,such benefit increases may not have been granted,since the county might have determined that such increases were unaffordable.as the association actuary noted in his june,actuarial valuation in defining uaal 
most retirement systems have uaal.they arise each time new benefits are added and each time an actuarial loss is realized.the existence of uaal is not in itself bad,any more than a mortgage on a house is bad.uaal does not represent a debt that is payable today.
thus,it is not the case that any decision that increases uaal is necessarily harmful to members.
even assuming that an increase in the uaal of the pension fund harmed members by decreasing their assurance that they would receive their benefits,the harm was not material.the trial court expressly found that the board decision did not impair the ability of the fund to pay benefits to its members.this finding was supported by substantial evidence,as to both active and retired members.
the board was advised by the association chief operating officer that adopting the interim valuation would have no impact on the fund ability to keep its pension promise to active and retired members.with regard to retired members,the pension fund was fully funded.with regard to active members,the association chief operating officer reported that the proposed year timeline to retire the uaal would allow for all current unfunded liabilities to be funded on average by the time needed to make payments to the current active employees.the association actuary stated in his october,valuation that the pension fund was in sound financial condition.the association actuary stated in his october,valuation,and the trial court found,that the funded ratio of the pension fund was percent as of that date.the fund had approximately billion in valuation assets as of october.
we conclude that any harm to members in terms of a decrease in their benefit security stemming from an approximately million decrease in the county employer contribution for the fiscal year in the billion fund was not material under the circumstances of this case.
b.the board decision to recognize the county voluntary contribution to the pension fund benefited members 
appellants also claim the board decision to recognize the county voluntary contribution to the pension fund did not benefit members.
appellants take particular issue with the trial court finding that the board decision to adopt the interim valuation provided an incentive to the county to issue pension bonds in the future.as appellants themselves acknowledged in the trial court and reiterated at oral argument in this court,it is clear that the board could have determined that it would be in its members interest for the board to reach an agreement with the county by which the county would make a million voluntary contribution to the pension fund on the condition that the board reflect such a payment through an interim valuation appellants claim is essentially that,having received the county million voluntary payment without such an agreement,the board was required to attempt to maximize the amount of money in the fund in the short run by refusing to conduct an interim valuation.there is no constitutional principle in section,subdivision b that would require the board to act in this manner.on the contrary,it is in the members interest to have the county trust that the board is going to take its secondary,to minimize employer.
appellants argument that the board did not have to provide an incentive to the county to issue pension bonds in the future because the board has the statutory authority to shorten the amortization schedule for the county payment of the unfunded liability supports the conclusion that the board was not required to minimize the amount of uaal in the fund by refusing to adopt the interim valuation.as appellants acknowledge,the board has the power to establish a reasonable amortization period for the system unfunded liability,which may not exceed years,citing government code section.the board power to amortize the fund uaal over a period is consistent with section,subdivision b because it allows the county to grant an increase in benefits and to pay for the increased cost of the benefits over time as the associated pension obligations become due.
if the board may constitutionally exercise its judgment as to the period of time over which uaal is to be amortized,we see no constitutional principle that would prohibit the board from recognizing a voluntary contribution to the pension fund through an interim valuation.the net economic effect of either decision would be the same,the county employer contribution would be spread over a period of time that is consistent with the board judgment as to the amount of funds necessary to adequately ensure the payment of pension obligations 
we conclude that the board could reasonably have determined that the board willingness to provide an interim valuation for the purpose of recognizing county million voluntary payment to the pension fund would encourage the county to make additional future voluntary contributions to the pension fund.
another benefit to members stemming from the board adoption of the interim valuation was the staving off of possible job losses by active members.the board was informed prior to its decision to recognize the county voluntary contribution that the county might have to lay off up to active members if the board refused to adopt the interim valuation.for this reason,three labor employee organizations supported the board decision to adopt the interim valuation.this fact supports the conclusion that the board adoption of the interim valuation was in its members interests.
we reject appellants argument in their reply brief that the board was prohibited from considering its active members interest in retaining their jobs.the primary argument appellants advance in support of this claim is that the board could properly consider only members interests as beneficiaries,and not their interests as employees,in determining whether or not to adopt the interim valuation.even assuming appellants are correct in asserting that the board sole duty is to protect members interests as beneficiaries,the pension of a member who loses his job will be dramatically affected by that job loss.thus,a member interest as an employee is clearly related to his interest as a pension beneficiary.further,the board was informed by the association actuary that job losses could also negatively impact the financial condition of the retirement fund itself.we therefore reject appellants argument that the board was prohibited from considering potential job losses in making its decision to adopt the interim valuation.
appellants remaining arguments for invalidating the board action are unpersuasive 
appellants claim the board action in adopting the interim valuation demonstrates a pattern of trust fund mismanagement favoring the public employer over many years that create d such massive unfunded liability.the facts do not support this assertion.
the actuary valuation for june,indicated that the pension fund was more than fully funded throughout the late.the valuation further stated that the funded ratio decreased from percent as of june,to percent as of june,but that the funded ratio would have been percent on june,without the march retirement benefit increases.in short,the fund was more than fully funded until the county dramatically increased retirement benefits for members in.thus,it was an action that clearly benefited increase in retirement than trust fund mismanagement favoring the county,that caused the increase in the fund uaal.
finally,appellants claim that the board action conflicted with the principle of intergenerational equity,calculating and receiving during each fiscal year contributions which,expressed as percents of active member payroll,will remain approximately level from the present generations of citizens to future generations of citizens.however,there is nothing in section,subdivision b that would require that the board act in a manner consistent with the principle of intergenerational equity.therefore,even assuming the board action conflicted with this principle,we reject the argument that this would violate the constitution.further,as noted above,the primary cause of the dramatic increase in the uaal in the fund and the cou
