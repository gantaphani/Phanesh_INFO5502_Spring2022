randall scarborough scarborough appeals from a dismissal by the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction over his application for attorney fees and expenses under the equal access to justice act eaja.on december,this court entered judgment affirming the dismissal by the veterans court because scarborough fee application failed to comply with the jurisdictional prerequisites of the eaja statute.scarborough principi.scarborough petitioned for review by the supreme court,and on june,the court granted certiorari,vacated our decision,and remanded the case to this court for consideration in light of edelman lynchburg college,d.scarborough principi,d june.
following remand from the supreme court,this court mandate was vacated,the case was returned to the panel,and we requested additional briefing from the parties regarding the applicability of edelman to the current case.scarborough principi.based on the supreme court instruction and the supplemental briefing from the parties,we have reconsidered this case and,once again,affirm the decision of the veterans court,dismissing scarborough eaja application for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
background 
after prevailing in the underlying litigation,but before the veterans court entered its mandate,scarborough submitted an application for attorney fees and expenses to the veterans court under the eaja,d.on october,following the issuance of the mandate,the clerk of the veterans court filed scarborough eaja application.the application contained a showing that scarborough was the prevailing party pursuant to the july remand order his net worth did not exceed the limit for filing under the eaja his attorney had represented him in the matter since august and the attorney had incurred fees and expenses during his representation of the appellant,as detailed in an attachment to the application.
on december,the government filed a motion to dismiss the eaja application for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.the government argued that scarborough had failed to satisfy all of the jurisdictional requirements under the eaja statute because the application was missing an allegation that the government position in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification.on december,scarborough responded by filing an amendment to his eaja application,supplying the previously omitted allegation that the government position lacked substantial justification.
the veterans court examined the eaja statute and held that each of the required parts of an eaja fee application was a jurisdictional requirement that must be met within the filing period,including the requirement that the applicant allege that the government position is not substantially justified.see d b.the veterans court then dismissed scarborough eaja application for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on scarborough failure to allege,within the filing period,that the government position was not substantially justified.id.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction under.

standard of review 
in reviewing decisions of the veterans court,this court shall decide all relevant questions of law,including interpreting statutory provisions.d forshey principi,en banc.this court reviews an interpretation of statutory provisions by the veterans court without deference.jones brown.
the eaja renders the united states liable for attorney fees for which it would not otherwise be liable,and thus amounts to a partial waiver of sovereign immunity.ardestani ins,d.such a waiver must be strictly construed in favor of the united states,and not enlarged beyond what the language requires.united states nordic,d citation omitted.once the government provides the waiver,the terms of its consent to be sued in any court define that court jurisdiction to entertain the suit.united states sherwood.we must,however,take care not to assume the authority to narrow the waiver that congress intended.united states kubrick,d.
in this case,the terms of the waiver are contained in the eaja statute.that statute specifies that an applicant for an award of fees shall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,submit an application 
showing that the applicant is a prevailing party 
showing that the applicant is eligible to receive an award 
showing the amount sought,together with an itemization in support thereof and 
alleging that the position of the united states was not substantially justified.
d b singleton apfel,cir.the specific provision of the eaja at the heart of this case states that 
a party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses which shows that the party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an award under this subsection,and the amount sought,including an itemized statement from any attorney or expert witness representing or appearing on behalf of the party stating the actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed.the party shall also allege that the position of the united states was not substantially justified.
t he starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.santa fe,green,d.we first examine the language to determine the plain meaning of the words used by congress.bazalo west.in the absence of a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary,the statutory language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.consumer prod.safety comm gte sylvania,d.if the statute is clear and unambiguous,that is the end of the matter,for the court must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.sullivan stroop,d citation omitted.however,where the text itself does not clearly exclude alternate interpretations,we look first to the legislative history for illumination of the intent of congress.deluxe united states,citing shriners hosps.united states.
here,the eaja specifies that a party seeking an award of fees shall submit an application within the time limit.d b.the application must include each of the four requirements set forth in the statute.id.the same mandatory language shall is used with respect to the time limit and the other four requirements that make up the application.id.this court and five other courts of appeals have characterized the time limit for submitting a fee application under the eaja as jurisdictional in nature.see bazalo,at mach.united states,see also yang shalala,cir newsome shalala,cir damato sullivan,cir welter sullivan,cir peters sec y of hhs,cir.
the issue in this appeal is whether the fourth requirement of the eaja statute,that the party shall also allege that the position of the united states was not substantially justified,must be satisfied within the period or may be satisfied at some later time and relate back to the timely filing of an incomplete application.the general question of whether the individual requirements of the eaja statute are jurisdictional and must be satisfied within the period was addressed in a number of cases decided by other courts of appeals and by this court in bazalo.the third circuit in dunn united states,cir,found that a failure to itemize the amount sought under the eaja may be corrected after the time limit if no prejudice to the government arises.id.at.in a class action suit against several federal agencies involving radiation contamination by a uranium processing site,dunn and the other named plaintiffs submitted an eaja application that made the proper allegations that plaintiffs were prevailing parties and were eligible to receive a fee award,and that the position of the united states was not substantially justified.id.at.however,the application failed to state the amount sought or to include an itemized statement of the actual time expended and the rate at which the expenses were computed.id.at.the court held that as long as the eaja application was filed within the time limit,the application may be supplemented or corrected after the period,provided that the government was not prejudiced by the defect.id.at.
the majority opinion in dunn in effect cleaved d b into two distinct components,a filing deadline and a standard for pleading 
requiring the filing of a fee claim or any other with the court serves the purpose of establishing a means certain for proving compliance with a time bar.such certainty is required in most situations in the interest of finality and reliance.but once the claim is filed,whether or not it is as complete as it should be,the interests of proof of timeliness and of finality and reliance have been satisfied.what remains is the fleshing out of the details 
the eleventh circuit in singleton adopted the reasoning of dunn and likewise found that an eaja application may be supplemented after the time limit to satisfy the requirements regarding net worth and the government position being not substantially justified.singleton,at.the class action plaintiffs in singleton challenged a policy of the social security administration ssa involving payment of retroactive disability benefits in random fashion,resulting in the loss of medicaid benefits for plaintiffs in certain states.id.at.after the ssa reversed its policy and the court remanded for a determination of retroactive benefits due,the plaintiffs filed an application under the eaja which arguably failed to allege that the plaintiffs met the net worth requirement and that the united states position in the district court was not substantially justified.id.at.the court found that a timely eaja fee application may be supplemented to meet the requirements of d b,but that district courts may order rapid completion of the application or outright deny a request to supplement if the government would be prejudiced.id.at.the court in singleton stated 
while it appears clear from the legislative history that congress intended the filing requirement to be jurisdictional,it is far from apparent that congress intended that strict compliance with the pleading requirements must be accomplished within the same time as filing.
id.quoting dunn,at.
both singleton and dunn venture beyond the plain language of the eaja statute to consider underlying interests in finality and reliance as well as the legislative history.see dunn,at.however,the legislative history,as cited by these cases,is not very enlightening.see singleton,at while it appears clear from the legislative history that congress intended the filing requirement to be jurisdictional,it is far from apparent that congress intended that strict compliance with the pleading requirements must be accomplished within the same time as filing.quoting dunn,at emphasis added.
we read the plain language of the eaja statute to require not only that an application be filed by the deadline,but that it contain averments addressing each of the four other requirements enumerated in the statute.d b.use in the statute of the same mandatory language with respect to the deadline and each of the four enumerated application requirements indicates that all of the requirements must be addressed,if not satisfied,within thirty days in order for a court to assert jurisdiction.while we interpret the statute to require that the application address each of the requirements of the eaja within the period,the statutory language does not mandate strict compliance or foreclose supplementation where the details of the stated jurisdictional averments remain to be fleshed out or corrected.when the application completely fails to address one of the four statutory requirements by the deadline,however,more than a fleshing out of the details remains and the application will be jurisdictionally defective.
in bazalo,we held that the applicant satisfied the jurisdictional eligibility requirement by asserting he was a prevailing party entitled to an award in his eaja application.at.because his initial application satisfied the jurisdictional eligibility requirement,as well as all of the other jurisdictional requirements,this court gave bazalo some latitude to supplement his application to flesh out the missing details of his net worth.id.at.citing dunn,the opinion in bazalo stated that w e agree with the third circuit that while the time limitation should be strictly met,the content of the eaja application should be accorded some flexibility.id.at.
in contrast to dunn and singleton,this court,in bazalo,recognized that the eaja statute contains jurisdictional prerequisites plural.id.at emphasis added.we initially distinguished a requirement of the eaja from a jurisdictional prerequisite,and quoted dunn explication of the finality and reliance justifications for making such a distinction.id.at.however,we stopped short of adopting the holding of dunn,instead both recognizing and analyzing as jurisdictional requirements and jurisdictional prerequisites each of the provisions of the fee application specified by the plain language of the eaja and at the same time according fee applicants some latitude to provide details where a required averment may be less than fully explicated.id.at.
after enumerating the contents of bazalo eaja application,including each of the four requirements of d b,we began our analysis by acknowledging that bazalo had timely met the jurisdictional requirements of the eaja statute and concluded by reiterating that bazalo application of attorney fees and expenses met the jurisdictional prerequisites of the eaja statute.id.at emphasis added.the requirements of the eaja statute were recognized to include a showing that the applicant was a prevailing party,a showing that the applicant was eligible for an award,an allegation that the position of the united states was not substantially justified,and an itemized statement of fees sought.id.the eligibility requirement,the details of which were initially lacking,was both identified as a jurisdictional requirement and found to have been met by bazalo in his initial application.id.what was left was simply a fleshing out of the details of his net worth.
although this court has characterized the four requirements of an eaja application to be jurisdictional,we have recognized that details relating to the requirements may be fleshed out after the deadline in certain circumstances.in this case,scarborough argues that the fourth requirement allegation of a lack of substantial be considered separately from the other requirements and need not be alleged at all before the deadline.in accordance with the supreme court remand of the present case for further review in light of edelman,we reconsider whether the failure to comply with the requirement to allege lack of substantial justification within the deadline is fatal to an eaja application,or whether the applicant is permitted to supplement his application to include the missing allegation after the deadline and to have it relate back to the timely filed,but incomplete,original application.
the edelman case did not involve an eaja application,but rather a claim under title vii of the civil rights act of,civil rights act.after being denied academic tenure at lynchburg college,edelman timely filed a charge with the equal employment opportunity commission eeoc alleging discrimination,exacerbated by discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion.section b of the civil rights act requires charges to be in writing under oath or affirmation containing such information and in such form as the commission requires.id.b.section e provides that a charge shall be filed within one hundred and eighty or in some cases,three hundred days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.id.e.although edelman charge initially did not include an oath or affirmation,he supplemented his original submission by filing a verified form approximately two weeks after the deadline.the district court dismissed the case,concluding that because edelman initial filing did not include an oath,it was not a charge under section and the verified form could not relate back to and provide edelman with a timely filing date.the court of appeals for the fourth circuit affirmed,interpreting sections b and e of the civil rights act in tandem to require that the charge must be verified within the specified time per
