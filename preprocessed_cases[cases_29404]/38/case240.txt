this appeal arises from the district court order granting final judgment to the united states upon claims of payment by mistake of fact and unjust enrichment against appellant tuomey healthcare system,tuomey arising out of alleged violations of the social security act,and awarding damages in the amount of,plus interest.
in the underlying action,the united states alleged that tuomey entered into compensation arrangements with certain physicians that violated section of the social security act,commonly known as the stark law.because the stark law does not create its own right of action,the united states sought relief under the false claims act fca,the united states further asserted equitable claims premised on the alleged stark law violation,including payment under mistake of fact and unjust enrichment.a jury returned a verdict finding that tuomey did not violate the fca,but responded affirmatively to a special interrogatory regarding whether it had violated the stark law.the district court set aside the jury verdict and ordered a new trial on the fca claim.it further ordered that,based on the jury verdict,the united states was entitled to judgment on its equitable claims.
because we conclude that the district court judgment in the united states favor violated tuomey seventh amendment right to a jury trial,we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.because we are remanding this case,we also address other issues raised on appeal that are likely to recur upon retrial.
we begin by setting out the statutory framework that forms the basis for the united states allegations in the underlying proceeding.we first set forth the provisions of the fca,as relevant to this appeal.we then discuss the pertinent provisions of the stark law.
the fca is a statutory scheme designed to discourage fraud against the federal government.a i provides,in relevant part,that any person who knowingly presents,or causes to be presented,a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval is liable to the united states government for a civil penalty of not less than and not more than plus times the amount of damages which the government sustains because of the act of that person.section b defines the term knowingly to mean that a person,with respect to information has actual knowledge of the information ii acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information or iii acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information,with the additional provision that no proof of specific intent to defraud is required.section b further defines,in relevant part,the term claim as any request or demand,whether under a contract or otherwise,for money or property that is presented to an officer,employee,or agent of the united states.
the stark law was enacted to address overutilization of services by physicians who stood to profit from referring patients to facilities or entities in which they had a financial interest.the stark law,and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto stark regulations prohibit a physician who has a financial relationship with an entity such as a hospital from making a referral to that hospital for the furnishing of certain designated health services for which payment otherwise may be made by the united states under the medicare program.a a a hospital may not submit for payment a medicare claim for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral.a b b.the united states may not make payments pursuant to such a claim,and hospitals must reimburse any payments that are mistakenly made by the united states.g c.c,d.however,when a physician initiates a service and personally performs it,that action does not constitute a referral under the stark law.h.
the stark law and stark regulations define a financial relationship to include a compensation arrangement in which remuneration is paid by a hospital to a referring physician directly or indirectly,overtly or covertly,in cash or in kind.a,h.an indirect financial relationship exists if,inter alia,there is an indirect compensation arrangement between the referring physician and an entity that furnishes services.an indirect compensation arrangement exists if,inter alia,the referring physician receives aggregate compensation that varies with,or takes into account,the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the entity furnishing services.c ii emphasis added 
the stark regulations provide that certain enumerated compensation arrangements do not constitute a financial relationship.significantly for our purposes,a subset of indirect compensation arrangements do not constitute a financial relationship if the compensation received by the referring physician is equal to the fair market value for services and items actually provided not determined in any manner that takes into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated by the referring physician for the hospital and commercially reasonable.p.subsection p is known as the indirect compensation arrangements exception.see.at.
we now turn to the contracts that gave rise to this litigation.tuomey is a private,nonprofit corporation incorporated in the state of south carolina.it owns and operates tuomey hospital,located in sumter county,south carolina.tuomey hospital provides inpatient and outpatient health care services.most of the physicians who provide medical services at tuomey hospital are not employed by tuomey but rather practice medicine through specialty physician groups organized as professional corporations.
in early,the members of sumter county gastroenterology specialty group informed tuomey that they were considering whether to perform outpatient surgical procedures,rather than at tuomey hospital.other specialty physician groups that performed outpatient procedures at tuomey hospital were also considering whether to relocate such procedures.the loss of these outpatient surgical procedures posed a serious financial concern for tuomey.to dissuade the specialist physicians from performing their outpatient procedures elsewhere,tuomey sought to enter into agreements with specialist physicians to perform outpatient procedures solely at tuomey hospital.specifically,during and,tuomey negotiated with all of the specialist physicians on its medical staff.one of those physicians was appellee michael drakeford,an orthopedic surgeon,with whom negotiations unsuccessfully ended in.
between january,and november,tuomey entered into compensation contracts with specialist physicians.all of the contracts included essentially the same terms.each contract specified that the physician was required to provide outpatient procedures at tuomey hospital or at facilities owned or operated by it.under each contract,tuomey was solely responsible for billing and collections from patient and payors for outpatient procedures,and the physician expressly reassigned to tuomey all benefits payable to the physician by third party payors,including medicare and medicaid.tuomey agreed to pay each physician an annual base salary that fluctuated based on tuomey net cash collections for the outpatient procedures.tuomey further agreed to pay each physician a productivity bonus equal to percent of the net collections.moreover,each physician was eligible for an incentive bonus that could total up to percent of the productivity bonus.each contract had a term and provided that the physicians would not compete with tuomey during the term of the contract and for two years thereafter.
pursuant to the contracts,the physicians performed outpatient procedures at tuomey facilities.the outpatient procedures generated two billings a professional fee for the physician for his or her services,also known as the professional component and a facility fee for tuomey for providing the space,the nurses,the equipment,also known as the facility component or technical component.subsequent to the performance of the procedures,tuomey submitted claims requesting reimbursement for both the professional fee and the facility fee to payors,including medicare and medicaid.as relevant here,tuomey presented,or caused to be presented,to medicare and medicaid claims for payment of the facility fees generated as a result of outpatient procedures performed pursuant to the contracts 
in october,drakeford filed an action in the district court for the district of south carolina under the qui tam provisions of the fca,b.in september,the united states intervened in drakeford qui tam action as to the issue of whether tuomey submitted false claims as a result of the contracts with the physicians the government subsequently filed its own complaint pertinent to this appeal,the government asserted three causes of action count i false claims act,a presenting claims to medicare and medicaid for designated health services rendered as a result of violations of the stark statute count iv payment under mistake of fact and count v unjust enrichment 
specifically,count i alleged that tuomey knowingly presented,or caused to be presented,false and fraudulent claims for payment or approval to the united states,including those claims for reimbursement for services rendered to patients who were referred by physicians with whom tuomey had entered into financial relationships,the contracts in violation of the stark law.count i further sought the amount of the united states damages,trebled as required by law,and such civil penalties as are required by law.
count iv alleged that the united states had compensated tuomey as a result of mistaken understandings of fact.specifically,it alleged that tuomey was not entitled to receive payment from the united states for services rendered by any physician who was in a financial relationship prohibited by the stark law,and that the united states paid tuomey for such prohibited claims under the mistaken belief that tuomey was entitled to receive payment for these claims.accordingly,the united states claimed that tuomey was liable to it for the amount of the payments made in error to tuomey by the united states.
count v alleged that by obtaining government funds to which it was not entitled,tuomey was unjustly enriched.the united states claimed that tuomey was liable to it for such amounts,or the proceeds therefrom,to be determined at trial.
the government claims under the fca were tried to a jury in march.at the conclusion of the evidence,the district court instructed the jury that the united states had brought the case 
asserting that the defendant has committed fraud under the medicare program the united states alleges that beginning on or about january,and continuing until the present,tuomey presented false claims to the united states by submitting claims in violation of the stark law when tuomey knew that the defendant was not entitled to receive payment for the claims.
the district court further instructed the jury regarding the elements of a stark law violation,as well as the elements of an fca violation.with regard to the stark law,the district court instructed the jury to conduct a inquiry to determine whether tuomey violated the statute.at step one of the inquiry,the jury was to determine whether the contracts are indirect compensation arrangements as defined by the stark law and stark regulations.for the jury to find in favor of the government,it was required to prove that the physicians received aggregate compensation from tuomey,and that such compensation varied with or otherwise took into account the volume or value of the physicians referrals to tuomey.if the jury answered step one in the affirmative,at step two of the inquiry,it was to determine whether tuomey had proven by a preponderance of the evidence that the contracts fell within the indirect compensation arrangement exception.the district court further instructed the jury to determine the number and value of the claims for services that the physicians referred pursuant to the contracts,and for which tuomey received payment from medicare.
with regard to the fca claim,the district court instructed the jury 
t he united states must establish by a preponderance of the evidence the following one,that tuomey presented or caused to be presented to medicare two,false or fraudulent claims for payment and three,that tuomey knew that the claims for payment were false or fraudulent.if you find that the united states has established these elements by a preponderance of the evidence then,of course,you may find a verdict for the united states.
with respect to the second element of an fca violation,whether the claims were false or fraudulent,the district court instructed the jury 
what is false in this case,the united states alleges that certain of the defendant claims were false because tuomey was in violation of the stark law.for purposes of this case,a claim is false if it was submitted to medicare in violation of the stark law.
with respect to the third element of an fca violation,whether tuomey knew the claims for payment were false or fraudulent,the district court instructed the jury 
f or purposes of the fca,a person knows that a claim is false if a person,one,has actual knowledge of the information,or two,acts in deliberate ignorance of the truth or falsity of the information,or,three,acts in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information.it is not necessary that the united states prove that the defendant intended to submit false claims in order to find that tuomey took action knowingly,you would need to find that at least one individual employee or agent of tuomey knew that tuomey was submitting claims to medicare and knew that the claims were false.
the district court further instructed the jury with respect to damages under the fca 
if you find that the defendant has violated the fca,you must then determine the damages sustained by the united states because of the violations.the measure of the united states damages under the fca is the amount of money that the united states paid out by reason of the false claims.defendant compliance with the stark law was a condition of the government payment decision.if the defendant violated the stark law,defendant was not allowed to submit claims for payment to medicare for services that were referred by the physician whose compensation arrangement violated the stark law.and if defendant violated the stark law,medicare was not allowed to pay for any services furnished that were referred by the physicians whose compensation arrangements violated the stark law.therefore,your calculation of damages should be based on what the medicare program paid to the defendant in violation of the stark law if you find the hospital,tuomey,liable under the fca,then you must determine the number of false claims that the defendant submitted to the united states.
the district court provided the jury with a verdict form,with respect to which it instructed the jury 
s ubsection a,regards the stark law.it says,we the jury,find that tuomey,and there are two choices here,violated the stark law or did not violate the stark law s ubsection b regard s the fca.one,we the jury find that tuomey,again,i given you two choices,violated the fca or did not violate the fca two,if tuomey violated the fca,the total damages under the fca,if any,and then you will record on a line that i provided for your use the amount of money you award as damages three,if tuomey violated the fca,how many false claims were submitted by tuomey,if any 
on march,the jury reached a verdict.in subsection a of the verdict form,the jury indicated that it found that tuomey violated the stark law.in subsection b of the verdict form,the jury indicated that it found that tuomey did not violate the fca.because the jury found no fca violation,it indicated no response to either the second or third interrogatories in subsection b,the amount of damages,if any,and the number of false claims,if any.
subsequent to the jury verdict,the parties made several motions.tuomey moved for judgment in its favor on the government equitable claims,including payment under mistake of fact and unjust enrichment.the united states,in response,moved for judgment in its favor on those claims.the united states further moved for judgment as a matter of law under federal rule of civil procedure on the fca claim,or alternatively for a new trial under federal rule of civil procedure on that claim,based on its assertion that the district court erroneously excluded certain evidence regarding tuomey knowledge.
on june,the district court conducted a hearing with respect to those motions.the district court stated that it would deny the government rule motion,but grant the government rule motion.although the government sought a new trial only on the issue of knowledge under the fca,the district court declined to grant a new trial solely on the limited question of knowledge,but instead granted a new trial on the whole issue of the fca.the district court nevertheless indicated that it would grant a judgment in the united states favor on the equitable claims based on the jury finding that tuomey had violated the stark law.
on july,the district court issued two orders.in the first,the district court granted the government motion for a new trial and ordered that it be held on the whole issue of the united states cause of action for violation of the fca,consistent with the separate order being issued by this court concerning the equitable claims.in the second order,the district court addressed the united states motion for judgment in its favor on its equitable claims.it made the following findings of fact pursuant to the jury verdict,tuomey violated the stark law tuomey submitted claims in violation of the stark law,and the united states paid those claims in the amount of.it further made the following conclusions of law under the stark law,claims submitted in violation of that statute and payments made by the government in response to such claims must be repaid to the government and the supreme court of the united states has recognized that where the government pays out moneys under a circumstance that is unlawful or is improper that the government has a right to be reimbursed.based on these conclusions of law,the district court held in favor of the united states with regard to counts iv and v.it noted that the fca allegations remained before the court for retrial.
that same day,the district court entered a judgment indicating that the united states should recover from tuomey on counts iv and v of its complaint in the amount of,plus pre and interest.the judgment further indicated that t his action was tried by a jury,with the district judge presiding,and the jury has rendered a verdict by answering special interrogatories.id.on july,tuomey noticed appeal from the district court order granting final judgment to the united states upon counts iv and v and damages.
on appeal,tuomey makes several arguments.most significantly,tuomey contends that the district court violated its seventh amendment rights by basing its judgment with respect to the claims on the jury interrogatory answer regarding the stark law,even though the district court had already set aside the jury verdict in its entirety for the reasons set forth below,we agree.
we now turn to consideration of tuomey seventh amendment argument,an issue we review de novo.see pandazides.bd.of,cir.if a denial of the right occurred,we must decide whether the denial constituted harmless error.id.we address each question in turn.
the seventh amendment states that in suits at common law the right of trial by jury shall be preserved,and no fact tried by a jury,shall be otherwise in any court of the united states,than according to the rules of the common law.const.amend.vii see also.a the right of trial by jury as declared by the seventh amendment to the constitution is preserved to the parties inviolate.we have held that the seventh amendment right extends to all suits,whether at equitable or arising under federal legislation,where legal rights are involved.pandazides,at.
the seventh amendment demands that facts common to legal and equitable claims be adjudicated by a jury.beacon theatres,westover,d lytle household,d when legal and equitable claims are joined in the same action,the right to jury trial on the legal claim,including all issues common to both claims,remains intact.quotation marks omitted.when equitable claims rest on facts necessary to determination of legal claims,the legal claims involved in the action must be determined prior to any final court determination of the equitable claims.dairy queen,wood,d.in short,beacon theatres and dairy queen teach that a district court may not deprive a litigant of his right to a jury trial by resolving an equitable claim before a jury hears a legal claim raising common issues.lytle,at see also ritter mount mary,cir holding that beacon theatres and dairy queen stand for the proposition that,where legal and equitable claims are contained in the same set of facts,the right to jury trial,which the legal claims permit,should predominate,precluding the prior determination of the factual issues by a court sitting in equity.
we now apply the foregoing principles to this case.as already noted,whether there was a financial relationship between tuomey and the physicians that violated the stark law is a factual predicate to liability on the equitable claims.the fca claim,too,is premised on the existence of such an illegal relationship.as such,the factual issue of whether a financial relationship prohibited by the stark law existed is common to the equitable claims and the fca claim.it follows that the district court was required to submit that issue to the jury before it could resolve the united states equitable claims.
here,the district court failed to do precisely that.although it tried the fca claim to a jury,and the jury returned a verdict on that claim that indicated that tuomey had violated the stark law but had not violated the fca,the district court set that verdict aside when it granted the government motion for a new trial under rule,specifically ordering that the new trial would encompass the whole fca claim,including whether tuomey had violated the stark law as a result,the jury interrogatory answer regarding the stark law is now a legal nullity.in other words,following the order granting the rule motion,a jury had yet to determine the common issue necessary to resolution of both the fca claim and the equitable claims,whether tuomey violated the stark law.in granting judgment to the united states on the equitable claims,the district court impermissibly resolved that common issue before a jury had adjudicated it.it thereby deprived tuomey of its right to a jury trial.
having concluded that the district court denied tuomey seventh amendment right to a jury trial,we must decide whether the denial constituted harmless error.error is harmless only if the district court would have granted judgment as a matter of law to the prevailing party,if the evidence is such,without weighing the credibility of the witnesses,that there is only one conclusion that reasonable jurors could have reached.pandazides,at quoting keller prince george,cir.error is not harmless where both sides introduce sufficient conflicting evidence on the relevant questions such that the district court could not have granted a motion for judgment as a matter of law.id.at.
here,both sides introduced conflicting evidence regarding whether tuomey contracts with the physicians violated the stark law.we find that the record before us is insufficient to assess whether the district court could have granted judgment as a matter of law.notably,as we discuss below in part iii,the jury must determine on remand whether the contracts took into account the volume or value of referrals.if it so finds,the jury must further determine whether tuomey could bear its burden of proof with respect to the indirect compensation arrangement exception.finally,if the jury finds that the contracts created a financial relationship as defined by the stark law between tuomey and the physicians,it must determine the number and value of claims tuomey presented to medicare for payment of facility fees resulting from the facility component referrals made by the physicians,and for which it received payment.
because we are remanding this case,we will briefly address other issues raised on appeal that are likely to recur.with respect to our colleague objection to this cours
