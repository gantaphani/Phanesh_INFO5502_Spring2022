background 
plaintiff became a sworn member of the chicago heights police department department on october,holding the rank of patrol officer.on february,plaintiff was sent by the department to carl wahlstrom,the department own psychiatrist,to determine his fitness for duty.the department referred plaintiff to wahlstrom after plaintiff colleagues had reported to the department of police,carla osantowski,that plaintiff had threatened to commit suicide.during plaintiff session with wahlstrom,plaintiff admitted that he had experienced thoughts of committing suicide and had expressed those thoughts to fellow officers.however,plaintiff told wahlstrom that,at the time of the evaluation,he no longer felt suicidal.wahlstrom concluded that plaintiff was fit to return to duty.
plaintiff was again sent by chief osantowski to wahlstrom for a fitness evaluation on july.chief osantowski questioned plaintiff fitness for duty based upon incidents where plaintiff had exhibited hostility toward others.as part of the evaluation,wahlstrom met with plaintiff for several sessions,and spoke with chief osantowski as well as plaintiff longtime girlfriend,sheila.wahlstrom concluded that plaintiff was suffering from major depression and stress related to work and outside factors.wahlstrom noted that these stressors included several shooting incidents and an fbi investigation of the department.although wahlstrom opined that plaintiff was fit to resume duty,this recommendation was contingent on plaintiff continuing in psychotherapy and taking prescribed psychotropic medications.accordingly,the department arranged for plaintiff to attend biweekly psychotherapy sessions with wahlstrom.plaintiff also began taking three prescription medications trazodone,an antidepressant depakote,a medication and clozapine,an antianxiety medication.
on september,wahlstrom faxed a letter to chief osantowski informing her that plaintiff had made direct physical threats of bodily harm against her,including a statement that plaintiff wanted to knock her out.wahlstrom also warned chief osantowski that plaintiff was unable to exercise reasonable judgment where she was concerned,and that plaintiff stated he was certain that he would harm her if he got within arms length of her.wahlstrom diagnosed plaintiff with major depression along with stress,related both to work and his outside life circumstances,and wrote that plaintiff perceptions relating to his work environment were deteriorating and unstable.wahlstrom found plaintiff to be disabled by this condition and,accordingly,declared plaintiff to be unfit for duty.wahlstrom further stated that he was unable to determine the recovery period for plaintiff condition at this time.based upon wahlstrom report,chief osantowski ordered plaintiff to surrender his credentials.plaintiff complied,and,at that time,he ceased to be on active duty status.for the next year,plaintiff was placed on disability leave and continued to receive his pay.
on april,plaintiff filed with the board an application for disability pension benefits.in correspondence dated april,the board acknowledged plaintiff application and requested that plaintiff provide the board with certain information,including medical documentation and a statement of plaintiff injury.in addition,the letter stated that the board would require plaintiff to be examined by three physicians selected by the board in accordance with section of the pension code ilcs west,and that plaintiff would be notified by separate letter of the date,time and location of the examinations.the board letter further stated that o nce these examinations are complete and the medical reports and physician certificate of disability are received,the pension board will schedule this matter for a hearing.
in a letter dated september,plaintiff counsel responded that he had contacted plaintiff treating psychiatrist,wahlstrom,concerning the cause of plaintiff disability.in addition,plaintiff counsel wrote that it was his own understanding that the multiple shootings plaintiff was involved in while on the job greatly contributed to his disability.plaintiff counsel also requested that a hearing be held as soon as possible.on october,the board counsel wrote a letter to plaintiff counsel,enclosed copies of plaintiff personnel records,and stated that the board could now schedule plaintiff to be examined by three physicians selected by the board.however,counsel for the board also stated that the personnel records did not show any shootings in which plaintiff was allegedly involved.counsel for the board therefore requested plaintiff counsel to forward copies of any documentation regarding plaintiff involvement with any shootings,as the board physicians would undoubtedly want to review those documents as well.the board counsel concluded the correspondence by writing that no hearing can be held until such time as the pension board is in receipt of the reports from its three psychiatrists.
plaintiff provided the board with all requested information by november.the board then scheduled plaintiff to be examined by three psychiatrists and one psychologist,all selected by the board in accordance with section of the pension code.plaintiff psychiatric and psychological evaluations were conducted on june,july,july,november,and december.
on september,the board held its first hearing on plaintiff application.during this proceeding,plaintiff amended his disability application to alternatively request a disability pension in the event that the board denied his request for a disability pension that was.in addition,during this proceeding the board admitted various exhibits into evidence,including plaintiff personnel records and the reports of the three psychiatrists and one psychologist selected by the board to evaluate plaintiff condition.three of these four medical reports concluded that plaintiff was disabled.we briefly overview each of these reports seriatim.
harley rubens filed a physician certificate dated june,stating that he had examined plaintiff and certified plaintiff to be disabled for service within the department.this certificate accompanied a psychiatric evaluation report from rubens,dated july.in the report,rubens stated that he based his opinion upon a hour interview with plaintiff conducted on june,as well as upon the following additional information a review of correspondence from wahlstrom and wahlstrom progress notes pertinent police reports from the department a list of incidents involving plaintiff and correspondence from plaintiff attorney.
according to rubens report,plaintiff stated that he was removed from active duty and referred to wahlstrom for evaluation because the department thought plaintiff was a loaded gun.plaintiff stated that during his nine years of active duty with the department,he was shot at four times.in his report,rubens provided details with respect to two of these incidents.plaintiff described the initial shooting incident to rubens as a situation in which another officer shot at a suspect who was escaping,and that at the time the shot was fired the suspect had been standing between that officer and plaintiff.plaintiff stated that if the officer had missed the suspect,plaintiff would have been shot.when plaintiff told his supervisors about this incident,plaintiff stated that they responded that he would get used to getting shot at.according to rubens,plaintiff expressed disillusion with the department,not only because he felt a lack of support,but also because the department had recently undergone a corruption investigation by the fbi,and plaintiff noted that many of his former supervisors were currently in jail.plaintiff stated that he became very depressed in when fbi agents placed him under surveillance as part of their investigation of the department.according to plaintiff,when the fbi was unable to find that he had done anything wrong,the irs then audited his tax returns.
rubens also noted in his report that during the interview plaintiff expressed a deep hatred for,whom he referred to throughout the session by using a derogatory racist slur.in his report,rubens described a second shooting incident involving plaintiff wherein plaintiff engaged in a chase of a stolen car and the suspects started shooting at him.according to plaintiff,his partner,an older man,slept through the entire incident,and plaintiff greatly resented it.plaintiff told rubens that he was last shot at by a gang member,and that he had called dispatch for help but that the paramedics arrived at the scene before his backup did.plaintiff told rubens that w hat goes on at the job now is different.it used to be i cared about if a n is laying on the street i just drive by.plaintiff related to rubens that he had nightmares several times a month about his being shot at by gang bangers and would awaken from these dreams drenched in sweat.
according to rubens,plaintiff exhibited traits of paranoia where were concerned.rubens stated that this was exemplified by plaintiff statement that my biggest fear is that i might shoot somebody who did do anything if i went back to work as a police officer.plaintiff also stated to rubens that i f i go back now i shoot the.i used to bust my tail to make peace with the gangs and everyone else but no more.plaintiff also told rubens,i would like to be a cop but i know that i ca.yet,rubens also reported that plaintiff told him that although plaintiff did not work the first year after he was removed from full duty and placed on temporary disability,plaintiff felt that he could have worked.
rubens also found it notable that plaintiff judgment seemed intact except in his dramatic descriptions of how he would shoot a n if he had a gun and was on duty and saw one.in rubens view,plaintiff statements seemed to be somewhat dramatized and its doubtful that he would,in fact,do so but it is possible.rubens also wrote in his report that he found it interesting that plaintiff carried a gun to the interview,despite the fears of what he might do.
in addition,rubens also noted that,at the time of the interview,plaintiff was pleased and satisfied with his relationship with his girlfriend,sheila,and her children.according to rubens,plaintiff described to him feeling uplifted and excited every day when he wakes up,and rubens concluded that it was therefore unlikely that there is any form of psychiatric care treatment that would enable plaintiff or motivate him to return to police duties,where he might risk his life.
based upon his interview of plaintiff and review of other pertinent information,rubens diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from the following psychological disorders.major depression by history,resolved.acute stress disorder in the past,resolved.adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression.personality disorder nos.in support of his diagnosis,rubens wrote in his report that plaintiff underwent traumatic situations while working in the chicago heights police department,and that plaintiff was also angered by the fact that nobody listened to him and provided backup support for him.rubens noted that plaintiff has a history of acting impulsively and later regretting it,and if he were to return to police work,plaintiff might do something foolish to prove the point that he is too infirm and too damaged to be a police officer.accordingly,rubens found plaintiff to be disabled for police work as a result of a psychological disability.
the second psychiatrist requested by the board to examine plaintiff was henry conroe.conroe filed a physician certificate dated september,stating that he had examined plaintiff and certified plaintiff to be disabled for service within the department.this certificate accompanied a psychiatric evaluation report from conroe dated september.conroe wrote that he based his opinions upon a examination of plaintiff on july,and also upon the following evidence correspondence from plaintiff attorney and wahlstrom a phone conversation with wahlstrom plaintiff personnel and medical records and police reports of the shooting incidents.
at the time of the interview,plaintiff was working as a car jockey at an automobile dealership.conroe found plaintiff mood to be predominantly angry,much of it directed toward,to whom plaintiff referred to throughout the interview by using a derogatory racist slur.however,according to conroe,plaintiff exhibited little anxiety or sadness during the interview.
plaintiff stated to conroe that his problems started at the time of the first shooting incident.plaintiff then described to conroe four shooting incidents in which plaintiff was involved.according to conroe report,plaintiff described the events occurring during the first two incidents just as they were related by rubens in his report when a fellow officer shot at an offender who was positioned between the other officer and plaintiff and when plaintiff pursued a stolen auto and the offenders began shooting at him while his partner remained asleep.conroe provided additional details in his report with respect to the other two shooting incidents involving plaintiff.plaintiff stated that one incident occurred when suspects were shooting at cars driving toward plaintiff,and the windows of the other cars were shot out.according to plaintiff,the other incident occurred in approximately july,when plaintiff observed two gangs shooting at each other,during which a male positioned near plaintiff was wounded by gunfire.during this incident,plaintiff called for backup,but the paramedics arrived before his fellow officers did.plaintiff stated to conroe that after the last shooting incident he told his superiors that he no longer wanted to be shot at.according to plaintiff,soon thereafter the department referred him to see wahlstrom for a fitness evaluation.
conroe further noted in his report that plaintiff stated that he had previously been sent by the department to wahlstrom for a fitness examination because plaintiff had made comments to his colleagues about committing suicide.plaintiff explained that he made these comments because he had problems at home and was also being followed by the fbi as part of its corruption investigation of the department.however,by the time of the interview with conroe,plaintiff stated that he no longer had ideations of suicide.conroe noted that,nevertheless,plaintiff remained disillusioned with the department and harbored resentment that although he had been honest,he had been treated during the fbi investigation as being dishonest.
at the time conroe interviewed plaintiff,plaintiff stated that he often experienced dreams of being shot at,and that he would awaken from these dreams soaked in sweat.plaintiff also had gained pounds.because of his employment situation,plaintiff was forced to sell his belongings and give up his hobbies.conroe noted that plaintiff was still authorized to carry a weapon and he brought it to the interview.plaintiff stated to conroe that he carried the gun everywhere and trusted no one.according to plaintiff,being shot at changed his mind about,causing him to have great animosity against them.plaintiff stated that he loves his work and would love to return to the force,but his hatred of prevented him from doing so.
conroe also asked plaintiff about his difficulties with chief osantowski.plaintiff responded that he had problems with the police chief because the chief and his girlfriend did not get along.plaintiff believed that his work life and personal life should be kept separate,and it angered him that the chief discussed his home life at work.however,at the time of the interview,conroe wrote that plaintiff praised chief osantowski and stated that he felt that she is doing a fine job.
based upon his interview with plaintiff and other relevant information,conroe diagnosed plaintiff as suffering from a major depressive episode in partial remission,and found that plaintiff was therefore disabled for full unrestricted duties in the department.conroe explained that,in his view,plaintiff lacked the ability to interact safely with the public and plaintiff capacity to respond appropriately to the demands of his job would be severely impaired.conroe was of the opinion that plaintiff disability was to a large degree caused by the unique job duties of a police officer not shared by an ordinary citizen,and that the major stressors were his disillusionment relating to the investigation of prominent chicago heights officials and their convictions for corruption and the shooting incidents while on duty.
the third medical professional who evaluated plaintiff at the request of the board and found plaintiff to be disabled was ronald ganellen,a neuropsychologist.ganellen submitted a psychological evaluation dated december,in which he opined that plaintiff was disabled for service in the department.ganellen,however,did not initially file a certificate of disability with his report.as will be discussed later in this opinion,ganellen filed a certificate in february,stating that plaintiff was disabled for service in the department.
ganellen conducted a psychological evaluation of plaintiff on december.in addition to interviewing plaintiff,ganellen also administered several psychological tests to plaintiff and reviewed wahlstrom notes.ganellen began his report by observing that the department had placed plaintiff on a leave of absence in september,because of his emotional condition,and that plaintiff claimed that he had been unable to handle the responsibilities of his job in a safe manner as the result of stress.
plaintiff stated to ganellen that,earlier in his career,plaintiff had been given a number of plaques and awards for his job performance.however,plaintiff began to experience considerable stress as a result of the fbi investigation of the department and his being placed under surveillance.in addition,plaintiff also informed ganellen that he had encountered undercover fbi agents while on patrol.plaintiff further stated to ganellen that he changed over time in that he developed a temper and became intolerant of,referring to them by a derogatory racist slur.according to plaintiff,his attitudes changed as a result of the crime scenes he observed and the four shooting incidents in which he was involved.these were the same shooting incidents described in the reports submitted by rubens and conroe.
according to ganellen,plaintiff was also upset about the way that he was treated by the department.plaintiff acknowledged that he had stated to a coworker that plaintiff wanted to put a gun in his mouth and blow his brains out,but he then thought about the harm that would befall his family as a result of that action,and he knew he could not do it.plaintiff also told ganellen that he was offended when the department instructed him to see wahlstrom for a fitness evaluation as a result of his talk of suicide.
ganellen also wrote in his report that plaintiff stated that he became embroiled in a conflict with chief osantowski when she made comments about plaintiff relationship with his girlfriend.although plaintiff told the chief to leave his personal business alone,she reportedly continued to make comments,and plaintiff had words with her.thereafter,plaintiff stated that he was once again referred by the department to wahlstrom,and has not returned to work ever since.ganellen noted,however,that at the time of his interview with plaintiff,plaintiff expressed no anger against chief osantowski and held no grudges against her.
when ganellen inquired of plaintiff whether he was ready to return to work as a police officer,plaintiff stated that he could not safely return to work because of his angry reactions to and his tendency to act before thinking.ganellen wrote that plaintiff believes either he would kill someone if he perceived himself as being in danger,or that he might get killed if he hesitated.ganellen noted that plaintiff carried a gun with him and that he slept with it by his side.plaintiff stated to ganellen that he experienced nightmares about the shooting incidents,and would wake up in a sweat.
however,when ganellen asked plaintiff about his mood at the time of the interview,plaintiff responded that he was not depressed.plaintiff was pleased that he had found employment,and ganellen described plaintiff level of energy,interest in activities and ability to enjoy himself as normal.in addition,ganellen noted that plaintiff had not had any difficulties with concentration and was not troubled by thoughts or guilt.
upon completion of his evaluation,ganellen diagnosed plaintiff with paranoid features and wrote that,in his opinion,plaintiff is not able to return to work as a police officer at the present time as he may present a risk to public safety as well as to his own safety.ganellen found that plaintiff psychological functioning revolves to a large extent around efforts to contain anger and resentment,and that plaintiff anger can cloud his judgment to such an extent that he may react to a situation in an unplanned,unpredictable manner to protect himself or to get back at the person he perceives hurt him without first thinking about the possible consequences of his actions.
an opposite conclusion with respect to plaintiff disability was reached by the fourth doctor to which plaintiff was referred by the board for evaluation,richard harris.harris filed a physician certificate dated december,stating that he had examined plaintiff and certified that plaintiff was not disabled for service within the department.this certificate accompanied a psychiatric evaluation authored by harris,dated december.
harris evaluation was based upon two interviews he conducted with plaintiff on july,and november,for a period of nearly four hours.in addition to interviewing plaintiff,harris also relied on wahlstrom notes and letters phone conversations with wahlstrom,chief osantowski,and plaintiff longtime girlfriend,sheila police reports of the shooting incidents and pertinent records from plaintiff personnel files.harris written report was by far the longest of the four reports submitted to the board.
harris wrote that plaintiff began the first interview by stating that he wanted to return to work but that they do want me to return.plaintiff told harris that in february,he was referred to wahlstrom by chief osantowski because of a comment overheard by another officer that plaintiff thought that suicide was better than what he had been going through.after seeing wahlstrom at that time,plaintiff was told that he did not need to return for therapy.plaintiff stated that he was then referred to wahlstrom a second time because of his hatred against,and harris observed that plaintiff referred to throughout the interview by use of a derogatory racist slur.plaintiff told harris that he was eventually removed from active duty in september because i guess they did like my attitude.plaintiff also reported to harris that he had been involved in several shooting incidents,and discussed with him the same four incidents detailed in the reports authored by rubens,conroe and ganellen.
according to harris,plaintiff stated that a conflict arose between him and chief osantowski because she accused plaintiff of not treating his girlfriend well.plaintiff stated to harris that chief osantowski called him once per week at home,and had told privately and in he did not love his girlfriend.plaintiff believed that the chief was too involved in his personal life,and he resented this intrusion.however,at the time of his interview with harris,plaintiff stated that he no longer had animosity toward the former chief,and,in fact,plaintiff believed that she had done good work and that the department had benefitted from her approach to police administration.
harris noted in his report that plaintiff was consistently vague about the reasons he was removed from active duty,and that plaintiff seemed at a loss to explain why his doctor would not release him to return to work as a police officer.at one point,plaintiff told harris that plaintiff was eventually removed from active duty because wahlstrom considered him to be a loaded gun.plaintiff told harris during the second interview that if he returned to active duty he would hurt someone,and that he would pull his gun first and ask questions later.plaintiff also stated to harris that if he returned to the force he would beat up if they gave him any trouble.
harris further reported that plaintiff stated that although the three psychotropic medications prescribed by wahlstrom worked to relax him,they took away neither his anger and hate against nor his nightmares of the shootings.plaintiff stated that in his nightmares he relived the shooting incidents and woke up in a sweat.
harris also interviewed the department former chief of police,carla osantowski.she stated that in february,a colleague of plaintiff came to her office and informed her that plaintiff was depressed and was speaking of shooting himself.as a result,she referred plaintiff to wahlstrom for a fitness evaluation.after wahlstrom cleared plaintiff,he returned to work.however,chief osantowski again referred plaintiff to wahlstrom in july,because plaintiff appeared to be depressed.sometime thereafter,wahlstrom warned her that she may be in danger because plaintiff had very angry feelings toward her.
in addition,as part of the evaluation,harris also interviewed wahlstrom.according to harris,wahlstrom believed plaintiff was having a growing disillusionment with police work and was burned out.further,harris reported that wahlstrom stated that plaintiff had improved enough to return to work,but that wahlstrom did not believe plaintiff was capable of doing police work because of burn out.according to wahlstrom,plaintiff also had difficulty controlling his anger and expressed hatred of.harris found it notable that,according to wahlstrom,plaintiff anger against and his discussion of the shooting incidents came after plaintiff had been in treatment for nearly two years.harris wrote that even wahlstrom found this to be unusual and bizarre,and that there was no clear explanation as to why plaintiff suddenly began to express this hatred.
according to harris,wahlstrom did not believe that plaintiff was capable of doing police work and told harris that he removed plaintiff from active duty because he was concerned about plaintiff potential for violence.wahlstrom also told harris that when he warned chief osantowski about plaintiff threats,it was only the second time in wahlstrom career that he had to warn someone that she was in danger.wahlstrom also told harris that plaintiff had expressed anger on occasion during their sessions.
harris also reported that he had a conversation with plaintiff girlfriend,sheila.sheila stated that plaintiff and chief osantowski had a dispute over her.sheila explained that plaintiff was angry with the chief for getting involved in his personal affairs and resented the chief for telling plaintiff that he did not love sheila.according to harris,sheila first stated that she had no idea why plaintiff had not returned to work,but that it was possible that he did not go back because he might hurt someone.sheila stated,however,that she was not aware of any instances in which plaintiff caused harm to another.sheila recalled that plaintiff personality and attitude began to change in or,and stated that now plaintiff is not as patient as he once was and had started using a derogatory racist slur to refer to.sheila informed harris that plaintiff use of the epithet was getting worse especially because the pension is pending,and she wondered if plaintiff irritability increased because he was not working.
based upon the information he gathered in the course of evaluating plaintiff,harris wrote in his report that he found plaintiff communication to be confusing,in that it was very difficult to get a clear picture of the nature of the problem.from harris perspective,the differences in plaintiff demeanor in the two interviews were notable.harris wrote that during his first interview with plaintiff,although plaintiff expressed animosity for,used racial slurs,and stated he had recurrent dreams of the shooting incidents,plaintiff was not able to clearly communicate the reasons he was taken off duty.in addition,plaintiff presented his story without much emotion.
in the second interview,however,harris noted that plaintiff kept coming back to his hatred for,like a record that was stuck.harris stated that plaintiff kept,in a manner of speaking,coming at me with his hatred.he was unrelenting and it soon began to feel like an assault.harris wrote that plaintiff angry and aggressive behavior was in striking contrast to his manner during a number of phone conversations he had previously had with plaintiff about securing plaintiff medical records and scheduling appointments.harris stated that he told plaintiff directly that i was having difficulty determining the truth of the matter in regards to his disability application,and that i saw my job as a duty to protect the interest of the pension and those applicants deserving of a disability benefit.harris wrote that this frank communication brought about a change in interaction between them,as plaintiff then settled down,and there was no further talk of plaintiff hatred of.plaintiff then became very emotional to the point of indication,in harris view,of more genuine emotion.
according to harris,part of the confusion he experienced in listening to plaintiff was due to brief periods when his thinking was disorganized,and these periods occurred during plaintiff monologues when plaintiff appeared crazy with rage.harris stated,at some point i began to believe that he was making a great effort to manipulate me,that is,my thinking about his disability application.he was going out of his way to demonstrate his impairment.along these lines,harris stated that he had reviewed the police records before the interview and told plaintiff that the police reports did not corroborate his account of the shootings,as the reports demonstrated neither that plaintiff was shot at nor that he was in obvious danger.harris wrote,however,that plaintiff always had an explanation for the discrepancy,including that the department instructed officers not to record in the police reports that shots were fired at them.
harris also attributed his confusion in evaluating plaintiff to his belief that plaintiff story did not fit together due to the many inconsistencies in plaintiff account.harris question ed the overall credibility of plaintiff account,and noted that a close examination of plaintiff case revealed inconsistencies,contradictory information,misrepresentation and information that just does fit.harris wrote that,if he were to take plaintiff story at face value,he could find that plaintiff would be eligible for a disability pension,as plaintiff exhibited overwhelming aggressive feelings that he will not be able to control when performing the normal duties of a police officer,and this aggressiveness would be due to plaintiff having been shot at on numerous occasions and his experiences as a police officer working in a town with a significant population.
however,harris rejected such a conclusion,based upon his interview of plaintiff and the other information he gathered as part of the evaluation process.harris wrote that plaintiff may very well have reactions to various police experiences but there is no objective evidence demonstrating a reaction of such severity as to constitute a psychiatric disorder.harris noted with particular interest that plaintiff anger toward,as well as his references to the shooting incidents,did not surface until almost two years after he began treatment with wahlstrom.according to harris,a review of wahlstrom treatment notes revealed that plaintiff prior references to and the shooting incidents were scant and became a central part of plaintiff discussions only after plaintiff applied for a disability pension.harris wrote that,in his view,plaintiff was too actively trying to convince me and i felt manipulated,and opined that plaintiff was engaging in a conscious attempt to depict himself as barely controlled and a threat to blacks.
harris then developed his own theory of what happened to plaintiff.in harris view,when plaintiff was first referred to wahlstrom in february,he was voicing suicidal thoughts because plaintiff had personal problems and financial worries.when plaintiff was again referred to wahlstrom in july,it was because he had anger against the chief for intrusion into his personal life and blamed her for difficulties in the relationship with his girlfriend.plaintiff was not removed from the force until he made a threatening statement against chief osantowski in september.according to harris,this statement was precipitated by plaintiff belief that the chief was the cause of his breakup with his girlfriend,sheila.harris found that plaintiff relationship with sheila was the most emotionally significant aspect of plaintiff life and that it caused plaintiff some degree of depression,although he believed that the depression was not severe.based upon the evidence he reviewed,harris opined that plaintiff anger at the time of his removal from the department was focused solely against the chief and not related to any other aspects of police work.in fact,harris noted that there were references in the record which show that during that time period plaintiff enjoyed police work.
in addition,harris question ed how dangerous plaintiff was at the time of his removal from the force,especially in light of the fact that although wahlstrom found that plaintiff could not return to active duty due to his potential for violence,the doctor apparently did not seem too concerned about plaintiff carrying a gun during the height of his purported dangerousness.harris wrote that wahlstrom tolerance implicit approval of plaintiff carrying a gun indicated that plaintiff was not suffering from a severe or even moderate psychiatric disturbance characterized in part by barely controlled aggressiveness.harris stated that further evidence for the absence of a specific psychiatric disturbance is that wahlstrom had some question about the benefits of therapy.harris opined that little was accomplished in plaintiff therapy sessions with wahlstrom because,in harris view,there was a specific problem to treat.
accordingly,harris wrote that he questioned the severity of plaintiff past reported psychiatric disorder and,although plaintiff may have experienced a clear psychiatric disturbance warranting time off from work,harris noted that plaintiff had a full year of paid disability leave and opined that plaintiff had sufficient time to recover from the problems he suffered in.harris further wrote that,in his opinion,any psychiatric impairment that resulted in plaintiff taking medical leave from work ended well before the conclusion of plaintiff period of temporary disability payments in october.harris also found it notable that plaintiff no longer harbored anger or resentment toward chief osantowski.
harris concluded his report by opining that although plaintiff may have been burned out in his job as a police officer,burnout is not a psychiatric disorder.harris wrote that he did not believe that plaintiff was a violent and unstable person,and,according to harris,there is no objective evidence that plaintiff suffers from a psychiatric impairment which renders him unable to function as a police officer.harris concluded his report by diagnosing plaintiff as having a major depressive disorder,single episode,in remission.
after admitting these four reports and three certificates into evidence,the board stated that its members would review these documents prior to the next hearing,which was scheduled for october.the board then adjourned.
however,the board next hearing on plaintiff application did not occur until june.at that time,counsel for the board noted that a lot of time has passed since plaintiff application for disability was previously considered by the board,and indicated that the delay was connected to the appointment of new board members.counsel noted that because two of the members are new and have absolutely no knowledge basically of what the claim is,the board decided to hear only the direct testimony of plaintiff and to defer of plaintiff to a later time.
plaintiff testified that he was hired by the department as a patrol officer in october,and he was first sent by the department to see wahlstrom for a fitness evaluation in february.at that time,two officers had informed chief osantowski that plaintiff had made statements that he was thinking of committing suicide.plaintiff stated that after his evaluation with wahlstrom,he was sent back to work without medication or therapy.plaintiff testified,however,that he was referred back to wahlstrom in july by the department because it thought his work was declining and depression was setting in.at that point,wahlstrom prescribed plaintiff three,depakote and returned plaintiff to duty on the condition that he took his medication and continued in biweekly psychotherapy with him.
plaintiff testified,however,that soon thereafter he was removed from duty.plaintiff stated that at that time he did not want to be around other people,he gained a great deal of weight,he gave up his hobbies,and he did not sleep at night.in addition,plaintiff stated that these feelings caused him to have difficulties in his relationship with his girlfriend,sheila,and they separated for two months.
according to plaintiff,when chief osantowski began inquiring into his personal life it made him angry.plaintiff stated that he wanted the chief to mind her own business,and he believed that what went on after work was his business.plaintiff testified that,at that time,he was lashing out at everything and any authority figure that even tried to tell him anything.plaintiff stated that he was aware that his feelings toward,and comments about,chief osantowski led to him being removed from the force,but that now he harbors no ill will or anger toward her.
plaintiff also spoke of the fbi investigation of the department and the negative effect that investigation had on him.plaintiff stated that he was placed under surveillance and that fbi officers routinely sat in cars in front of his home.in addition,plaintiff stated that he encountered undercover fbi agents on three occasions while he was working.plaintiff testified that this situation made him very uncomfortable,as he believed that he was always being watched.subsequently,several officers that plaintiff worked that he described as good friends were indicted and sent to jail.plaintiff stated that the fbi investigation and its outcome negatively affected the way that he viewed police work because he did not know whom to trust.plaintiff also stated that it was his belief that the fbi investigation led the irs to subsequently audit his tax returns.
plaintiff then testified with respect to four shooting incidents.these were the same shooting incidents described in the reports submitted by rubens,conroe,ganellen and harris.plaintiff testified that these incidents bothered him a great deal and he told his supervisors that he was tired of being shot at,to which they responded that plaintiff could speak with a priest.plaintiff testified that he refused to meet with the priest,and stated that he did not seek any other counseling.according to plaintiff,it was after the last shooting incident in july that things became difficult with his girlfriend,and he began having recurrent dreams about the shootings.
plaintiff testified that the shooting incidents came up in the course of his psychotherapy with wahlstrom,but not in the beginning.plaintiff stated that,at the start of therapy,the focus was more on his anger toward the chief and his difficulties with his girlfriend.however,as his therapy continued,plaintiff stated that the trauma he suffered in relation to the shootings began to surface.plaintiff believed that he had made progress in psychotherapy.however,at the time of the hearing,plaintiff testified that he had not had sessions with wahlstrom for the prior six months,as he could no longer afford to pay the costs.in addition,plaintiff stated that he was no longer taking the psychotropic medications that had been prescribed by wahlstrom.plaintiff further testified that at the time of the hearing he would characterize himself as normal,and he stated that he was employed by a car dealership as the head valet and worked with without incident.
the direct examination of plaintiff then concluded.during the june,proceeding,the board also admitted into evidence the deposition testimony of carl wahlstrom,plaintiff treating psychiatrist.wahlstrom testified that the first time he saw plaintiff was on february,when plaintiff was referred to him by the department for a fitness evaluation after he made comments that he wanted to commit suicide.because plaintiff had no prior psychiatric treatment or hospitalizations,and because plaintiff stated that he was not prone to suicidal tendencies at that time,wahlstrom allowed plaintiff to return to active duty.
wahlstrom testified that plaintiff was again referred to him for a fitness examination in july,and he saw plaintiff on several occasions.wahlstrom stated that the police chief had referred plaintiff for evaluation because plaintiff had expressed hostility toward her.according to wahlstrom,the examination disclosed that plaintiff was suffering from a major depression and an anxiety disorder not otherwise specified.wahlstrom stated that plaintiff was experiencing stress caused by the fbi investigation,as well as the several shooting incidents in which he had been involved,and,as a result,plaintiff had lost a great deal of idealism about being a police officer.although wahlstrom did not find that plaintiff was disabled by these conditions,wahlstrom allowed plaintiff to return to duty only on the condition that plaintiff begin taking prescription psychotropic medications and attend biweekly psychotherapy sessions.
by september,however,plaintiff condition had deteriorated and,wahlstrom testified,he contacted chief osantowski because plaintiff was making direct physical threats against her safety.it was only the second time in wahlstrom career that he had to deliver such a warning.wahlstrom stated that plaintiff was very agitated and it was not the kind of situation where he could reason with plaintiff,even though plaintiff was under his care.wahlstrom stated that plaintiff was angry,depressed and consumed with hatred against the chief because he believed that her interference in his personal life was causing the breakup of his relationship with his girlfriend,sheila.wahlstrom testified that plaintiff had become more unstable and that plaintiff perceptions relating to his work environment were deteriorating.upon plaintiff suspension from the department,he continued to undergo psychotherapy with wahlstrom,who opined that plaintiff is unable to return to work as a police officer,and that is secondary to the nature and extent of his mental condition and the fact that he himself,although wishing to return,does not feel that he can do so safely.
after hearing the direct testimony of plaintiff and admitting the deposition of wahlstrom into evidence,the board then moved to generally continue its review of plaintiff application for disability pension and adjourned.no date was set by the board for the next hearing.
the board reconvened and conducted the next hearing on plaintiff application for disability pension on august.on that date,the board called several police officers to testify with respect to the shooting incidents related by plaintiff during his testimony and described in the reports of rubens,conroe,ganellen and harris.detective sergeant bryan howard,retired officer frank cole,and sergeant michael leuser offered testimony that in some respects corroborated plaintiff version of the shooting events,but in other respects contradicted plaintiff testimony.plaintiff was then by members of the board,as well as the board counsel.plaintiff testimony largely mirrored that offered during his direct examination.the board then adjourned the hearing.
the board next hearing occurred on september.plaintiff called corporal robert price of the park forest police department to testify with respect to one of the shooting incidents.price testimony largely corroborated plaintiff testimony.in addition,the board also admitted into evidence several documents which referenced this particular shooting incident and which supported plaintiff version of events.the board then adjourned the hearing.
the board next convened on october.during this proceeding,the board issued its decision denying plaintiff application for disability pension benefits.the board began its written ruling by acknowledging that although plaintiff application had been pending before the board for some time,the delay in hearing plaintiff petition was not the result of any animus of the board for the applicant.rather,the board explained,the delay resulted from a combination of unfortunate factors,including a misunderstanding that the applicant had abandoned his application and the board inability to communicate promptly with its former attorneys.
the board then turned to the merits of plaintiff application.in its decision,the board wrote that plaintiff claim was complicated not only by the fact that the medical practitioners disagreed with respect to whether plaintiff suffered from a psychological disability under the pension code,but also by conflicting testimony which casts doubt upon plaintiff version of key events.
in discussing plaintiff testimony,the board found plaintiff to be a complex person.the board noted that although it was undisputed that plaintiff had said inflammatory things in the past,this did not necessarily mean that plaintiff was unable to perform as a police officer.in addition,the board noted that it was also uncontroverted that plaintiff refused to seek counseling after the shooting incidents,even though he stated that he was distressed by the events.in addition,it was evident that the anger plaintiff had previously held for chief osantowski had dissipated.moreover,the board noted that plaintiff himself stated during his testimony that he was now normal and that he was no longer under psychiatric treatment or taking prescription psychotropic medications.the board wrote that it found this particular testimony compelling,in light of the fact that the most recent subjective appraisal of plaintiff,by plaintiff himself,supports the finding that he is not disturbed.
the board also noted in its decision that plaintiff repeated use of a derogatory racist slur to refer to during his interviews was considerably troubling,especially as the city of chicago heights has a large population.however,the board was suspicious of plaintiff use of this term,and explained its suspicions as follows 
the board must consider why plaintiff would feel free to laden his psychological interviews with the constant use of that word.plaintiff knew that he was being examined to determine if he suffered from a psychological disability.given his in achieving a favorable report,it seems that plaintiff was using it to alarm the examining physicians into believing he suffered from a psychological impairment on the basis that only such a disabled person would use the word so often in a professional setting.
a nother motivation could be to coerce this board into granting a pension so that plaintiff would not be able to subject the city to possible liability,or subject this board to the unfavorable publicity of putting a bigoted officer back on the street.
in addition,the board found that plaintiff testimony with respect to the shooting incidents was inconsistent in several areas or rebutted by other witnesses.the board contrasted plaintiff testimony with that of officers howard,cole and leuser,and wrote that it assign ed significant weight to the extent that th e testimony of the other officers refutes plaintiff versions of the various events.the board wrote that plaintiff credibility was put directly at issue by the testimony of other credible witnesses in this matter.
in its decision,the board also closely examined the medical reports submitted by the four physicians,in addition to wahlstrom deposition testimony.the board found that of the four medical reports,the report by harris is the most lengthy and thorough evaluation of plaintiff,and,therefore,the board determined harris opinion to be the most credible and persuasive evaluation,and assigns it great weight.the board favorably observed that harris in his report had highlighted the contradictions in plaintiff speech and behavior,and that harris sincere assessment of plaintiff inconsistent statements and demeanor was exceedingly persuasive.the board agreed with harris opinion that plaintiff manufactured a blend of behavior and statements in order to obtain a disability pension that he is not entitled to.
in conclusion,the board wrote 
at worst,plaintiff has concocted an aggressively bigoted persona and symptoms of a psychological disorder to convince doctors that he can not perform the duties of a police officer.at best,it seems,plaintiff has some impediments,but medical practitioners simply can not agree if they rise to the level necessary to qualify for a disability award under the pension code.in either case,awarding plaintiff a pension would violate this board fiduciary responsibility to the fund participants.
therefore,the board found that plaintiff had failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he suffered from a disability within the meaning of the pension code which would entitle him to a disability pension.
on november,plaintiff filed in the circuit court of cook county a complaint for administrative review of the board decision administrative review action.plaintiff alleged that his rights to due process had been violated as a result of the board excessive delays in hearing and ruling on his application for disability benefits.in addition,plaintiff alleged that the board decision to deny him disability pension benefits was erroneous because the decision of the board was contrary to the majority of the opinions of the board own physicians finding him to be disabled and because the only medical opinion relied upon by the of not competent due to the excessively long time it took for the doctor to examine plaintiff and render his opinion.
on january,the circuit court entered a written order denying plaintiff petition for administrative review and confirming the decision of the board denying plaintiff a disability pension.the circuit court held that although plaintiff was evaluated by more than three mental health professionals,he failed to submit three certificates of disability as required under section of the pension code ilcs west.because the circuit court confirmed the board decision on the basis of statutory construction,the court declined to address plaintiff additional due process argument.
plaintiff thereafter filed with the circuit court a motion for reconsideration of its ruling in the administrative review action.the circuit court granted plaintiff motion for reconsideration on february,and vacated its january,order.the circuit court remanded plaintiff cause to the board to allow plaintiff to obtain and present certificates of disability from wahlstrom and ganellen.on february,wahlstrom filed a physician certificate with the board certifying that plaintiff is disabled for service in the police department.ganellen filed a similar certificate with the board on february.
on april,the board reconvened to consider plaintiff application in light of the two additional certificates of disability filed by ganellen and wahlstrom.the board then issued an amended decision,which again denied plaintiff application for a disability pension.counsel for the board described the amended decision as exactly the same decision as the board rendered before with the exception that it references now we have the other certificate.
the matter then returned to the circuit court for administrative review of the board amended decision.on may,the circuit court issued a written memorandum and order confirming the board amended decision to deny plaintiff a disability pension.the circuit court agreed with the board that there was competent evidence in the medical and supported the board decision.accordingly,the circuit court held that the board decision was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.
with respect to plaintiff due process claim,the circuit court noted in its written ruling that there were several delays in the hearing process and,despite the board contention to the contrary,no clear explanation for the delays was provided in the original record.nevertheless,the circuit court held that it was not clear that the delays resulted in a deprivation of plaintiff due process rights.the court concluded that plaintiff hearing was still held at a meaningful time despite the delays,and that there was no indication that these delays impacted the board decision.therefore,the circuit court held,the delays did not deprive plaintiff of due process.
plaintiff appealed.the appellate court reversed the circuit court ruling confirming the board decision to deny plaintiff a disability pension.the panel held that plaintiff was entitled to a disability pension retroactive to the time of his application,on the basis that all of the mental health professionals,including harris,agreed that at the time of his removal from active duty plaintiff was suffering from a psychiatric impairment that rendered him unable to function as a police officer.d at.accordingly,the appellate panel held that the board erred in denying plaintiff a disability pension in light of what the panel characterized as the unanimous agreement of the medical evaluators that plaintiff was disabled.the appellate court remanded the cause to the board,however,to determine whether plaintiff should receive a disability pension or a nonduty disability pension.
the appellate court also held,however,that section of the pension code ilcs west is unconstitutional as applied where,as in plaintiff case,one of the three doctors selected by the board to evaluate the pension applicant does not certify the applicant disability.specifically,the appellate court found that plaintiff right to due process was violated by the certification requirement because it fails to provide the applicant with any right to question the board selection of doctors or to set aside unfavorable certificates.according to the appellate panel,where the board doctors do not unanimously certify the applicant disabled,as in the instant cause,whatever meritorious arguments the applicant may raise at a hearing have no bearing on the outcome of the case.in other words,the appellate court concluded that under this scheme the negative outcome of a hearing is predetermined,and,therefore,the applicant has no hearing at all.
we granted the board petition for leave to appeal.rs.as stated,the board appeals only from the appellate court ruling in the administrative review action,including the holding that section of the pension code is unconstitutional as applied to plaintiff.we allowed the illinois municipal league leave to file an amicus brief in support of the board.the illinois public pension advisory committee was also allowed to file an amicus brief in support of plaintiff.

in the instant appeal,the board contends that the appellate court erred in setting aside the board decision denying plaintiff a disability pension.according to the board,plaintiff failed to meet his burden of proof by presenting insufficient evidence to support his claim that he is eligible for a disability pension.the board first notes that plaintiff proffered little evidence to support his claim for disability apart from his own testimony,and that plaintiff testimony was inconsistent and also contradicted by three witnesses with respect to events plaintiff claimed were significant stressors.in addition,the board further observes that,by plaintiff own testimony at the hearings,plaintiff stated that he was normal,and informed the board that he was not currently receiving psychiatric treatment or taking any prescription psychotropic medications.finally,the board notes that there were numerous inconsistencies in the medical testimony,and maintains,in its role as finder of fact,that it properly assigned greater weight to harris evaluation of plaintiff,as it determined harris report to be the most complete,thorough and persuasive of the four medical evaluations.
in response,plaintiff contends that the appellate court correctly set aside the decision of the board and its judgment should be upheld.according to plaintiff,the appellate court correctly interpreted harris report to contain the opinion that plaintiff suffered from a psychiatric impairment at the time he was removed by the department from active service,and that this creates the inference that had harris examined plaintiff closer to the time plaintiff was removed from active service,he would have certified that plaintiff was disabled.plaintiff therefore contends that the appellate court correctly found that there were unanimous medical opinions that plaintiff suffered from a disabling psychiatric impairment at the time of his removal from active duty that rendered him unable to function as a police officer.accordingly,plaintiff asserts,the appellate court correctly set aside the decision of the board denying plaintiff a disability pension.we disagree.
the instant appeal presents the question of whether the evidence of record supports the board denial of plaintiff application for a disability pension.this is a question of fact.the principles which guide our review of this matter are well settled.the administrative review law provides that the findings and conclusions of the administrative agency on questions of fact shall be held to be prima facie true and correct.ilcs west robbins,at.as stated,therefore rulings on questions of fact will be reversed only if against the manifest weight of the evidence.international union of operating engineers,local,at.an administrative agency decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence only if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident.abrahamson illinois department of professional regulation.therefore,the mere fact that an opposite conclusion is reasonable or that the reviewing court might have ruled differently will not justify reversal of the administrative findings.abrahamson,at.we are also mindful that,i n examining an administrative agency factual findings,a reviewing court does not weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of an administrative agency.city of belvidere,at.if the record contains evidence to support the agency decision,that decision should be affirmed.commonwealth edison property tax appeal board.
in the matter before us,plaintiff applied to the board for consideration of an award of either a or nonduty disability pension.section of the pension code provides for a disability pension as follows 
disability of duty.
a if a police officer as the result of sickness,accident or injury incurred in or resulting from the performance of an act of duty,is found to be physically or mentally disabled for service in the police department,so as to render necessary his or her suspension or retirement from the police service,the police officer shall be entitled to a disability retirement pension equal to the greatest of of the salary attached to the rank on the police force held by the officer at the date of suspension of duty or retirement,the retirement pension that the police officer would be eligible to receive if he or she retired but not including any automatic annual increase in that retirement pension,or the pension provided under subsection d,if applicable.
a police officer shall be considered on duty while on any assignment approved by the chief of the police department of the municipality he or she serves,whether the assignment is within or outside the municipality.ilcs a west.
in contrast,section of the pension code provides for a nonduty pension as follows 
disability on duty.a police officer who becomes disabled as a result of any cause other than the performance of an act of duty,and who is found to be physically or mentally disabled so as to render necessary his or her suspension or retirement from police service in the police department,shall be entitled to a disability pension of of the salary attached to the officer rank on the police force at the date of suspension of duty or retirement.ilcs west.
finally,section of the pension code provides that in considering an application for either a or nonduty disability pension,certain procedures must be followed by a pension board.section provides in relevant part 
a disability pension shall not be paid unless there is filed with the board certificates of the police officer disability,subscribed and sworn to by the police officer if not under legal disability,or by a representative if the officer is under legal disability,and by the police surgeon if there be one and practicing physicians selected by the board.the board may require other evidence of disability.ilcs west.
as the applicant for disability pension benefits,plaintiff had the burden of proof to establish his entitlement to either a or nonduty disability pension.after carefully considering the entire record,we hold that the board conclusion that plaintiff failed to satisfy his burden of proof in establishing his eligibility for a disability pension is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.we therefore disagree with the appellate court reversal of the board decision.
central to the appellate court reversal of the board ruling is the appellate panel interpretation of harris report.according to the panel,all of the mental health professionals,including harris,agreed that at the time of his removal from active duty plaintiff was suffering from a psychiatric impairment that rendered him unable to function as a police officer.d at.we disagree not only with the appellate court reading of harris report,but also with the conclusions drawn by the panel from its interpretation of that report.
a fair and accurate reading of harris report reveals that harris had serious questions with respect to whether,and if so,to what extent,plaintiff experienced psychiatric disturbances or disorders at the time of his removal from active duty in september.for example,harris writes in his report that he not only question ed the severity of the past reported psychiatric disorder,but also question ed how dangerous plaintiff was at the time of his removal from the department,especially in light of the fact that although wahlstrom found that plaintiff could not return to active duty due to his potential for violence,the doctor apparently did not seem too concerned about plaintiff carrying a gun during the height of his purported dangerousness.harris further wrote in his report that,in his view,wahlstrom tolerance implicit approval of plaintiff carrying a gun indicated that plaintiff was not suffering from a severe or even moderate psychiatric disturbance characterized in part by barely controlled aggressiveness.the overall tenor of harris lengthy report is that,even at the time plaintiff was removed from duty,it is unlikely that he suffered from a psychiatric disturbance of such severity that it prevented plaintiff from functioning as a police officer.this reading of harris report is confirmed by harris statement that further evidence for the absence of a specific psychiatric disturbance is that wahlstrom had some question about the benefits of therapy.emphasis added.indeed,harris opined in his report that he believed that little was accomplished in plaintiff therapy sessions with wahlstrom because,in harris view,there was a specific problem to treat.
it is with these statements made by harris in mind that we turn to the appellate court opinion below.in its opinion,the appellate panel refers to a passage from harris report,and relies upon this sole statement to support its finding that all of the mental health professionals who evaluated plaintiff agreed that he was disabled by a psychiatric impairment at the time of his removal from the department in september.in this passage,harris writes 
given that plaintiff had a clear psychiatric disturbance warranting time off from work,he had a full year of paid temporary disability.this time off resulted in the reduction of his angry feelings toward the chief.it was the threat to the chief that prompted the medical leave from work.he has had sufficient time to recover from the acute problems he experienced in.he is no longer suffering from a psychiatric disability.
we find that the appellate court overstated the significance of this passage from harris report.first,this statement must be placed in the proper positional context within harris report.this passage immediately follows harris statement opining that not only is there no evidence that plaintiff is suffering from a psychiatric disorder,but also harris question ing of the severity of the past reported psychiatric disorder.second,this statement must also be viewed in light of the broader context of harris entire report,which contains numerous references to his questions about plaintiff past and present mental state.in addition,the passage refers to harris review and discussion of plaintiff treatment with wahlstrom,and it would indeed be a strained reading of this passage to conclude that harris was making a specific finding or giving his opinion that plaintiff actually suffered from a psychiatric disturbance which prevented him from serving as a police officer.because harris report is replete with expressions of doubt with respect to whether plaintiff suffered from a psychological or psychiatric alone whether plaintiff was was improper for the appellate court below to ignore the factual dispute in the medical reports and hold instead,based upon this isolated passage in harris report,that all doctors who examined plaintiff were of the unanimous opinion that plaintiff suffered from a disabling psychiatric impairment at the time he was removed from active service.
the dissenting justice in this matter,however,agrees with the interpretation of harris report made by the appellate panel below,and asserts that we have proceeded on the faulty premise that the appellate court misread the record in this case.at.at,at fitzgerald,dissenting.as an initial matter,we note that the dissent opinion suffers from the identical infirmities as does the appellate court decision below it selects certain phrases from harris report,isolates them from the rest of the report,and uses these isolated phrases to support its preferred interpretation of harris conclusions.as set forth in detail above,harris report contains numerous expressions of doubt with respect to plaintiff mental state from the time plaintiff first visited wahlstrom to the time that plaintiff engaged in interviews with harris.for example,as noted above,harris stated that,at the time plaintiff underwent therapy with includes the time during which plaintiff was removed from active duty further evidence for the absence of a specific psychiatric disturbance is that wahlstrom had some question about the benefits of therapy.emphasis added.in explanation,harris wrote that little was accomplished in plaintiff therapy sessions with wahlstrom because,in harris view,there was a specific problem to treat.the dissent ignores all made by harris which refute its strained interpretation of his report,and fails to address the remainder of harris almost we have painstakingly reviewed and excerpted in great detail undermines the dissent preferred reading.
more fundamentally,we observe that the dissent has lost sight of the fact that,in this action for administrative review,it is the decision of the administrative,the is under review,not the determination of the appellate court.see anderson,d at,board of education of round lake area schools,d at.the dissent appears to be confused with respect to which decision is before us for review.the dissenting justice entire analysis of harris report is misfocused upon his belief that the appellate court interpretation of harris report is correct.again,we emphasize that our role in this administrative review action is to determine whether the evidence of record supports the board denial of plaintiff application for a disability benefit,that this inquiry is a question of fact,and that the board determination on this issue may only be reversed if we determine that it is against the manifest weight of the evidence,abrahamson,at.under this specific analytical framework,it is not our to the position taken by the review whether there is evidence to support the conclusions drawn by the appellate court.
it is our holding that the record in this case reveals a factual dispute as to plaintiff impairment and disability at the time that the board rendered its finding of facts and made its determination as to plaintiff eligibility for a disability pension.the record contains conflicting medical and respect to plaintiff eligibility for a disability pension.faced with this conflict of evidence,it was the board function,as the finder of fact,to assess the credibility of the documentary information and the testimony of the witnesses and to determine the appropriate weight to be given the evidence.as stated,the findings of fact of an administrative as the,by statute,held to be prima facie true and correct ilcs west and may only be reversed if they are against the manifest weight of the very high threshold to surmount.so long as the record contains evidence supporting the agency decision,that decision should be affirmed.commonwealth edison,at.we hold that this is the case here.
the board issued a comprehensive decision setting forth with specificity the reasons for denying plaintiff claim for a disability pension.in its decision,the board stated that not only was it presented with conflicting medical evidence with respect to whether plaintiff suffered from a psychological disability,but also that it heard conflicting testimony which cast doubt upon plaintiff version of key events.the board found it notable that plaintiff refused to seek counseling after each of the shooting incidents,even though he claimed to be distressed by the events that the anger that he previously expressed against chief the direct cause for his removal from active dissipated and that plaintiff described himself as normal,no longer under the care of wahlstrom or taking prescription psychotropic medications.the board also questioned the credibility of plaintiff account,based upon the board view that not only was plaintiff testimony inconsistent,but also that it was rebutted on several key points by other witnesses.the board stated that it had assigned significant weight to the extent that the testimony of the other witnesses refuted plaintiff version of events.
the board also assigned great weight to the report authored by harris and the opinions contained therein.the board explained that harris report was the most lengthy and thorough evaluation of plaintiff and,therefore,determined it to be the most credible and persuasive evaluation.in its decision,the board observed that harris had highlighted the contradictions in plaintiff speech and behavior,and that the board was persuaded by harris sincere assessment of plaintiff inconsistent statements and demeanor.
the board also agreed with harris suspicion that plaintiff repeated use of a derogatory racist slur to refer to during the four medical interviews and plaintiff expressed hatred toward was manufactured in order to obtain a disability pension that plaintiff is not entitled to.we also observe that even rubens,in his report finding plaintiff to be disabled,found it notable that plaintiff judgment seemed intact except in his dramatic descriptions of how he would shoot a n if he had a gun and was on duty and saw one.rubens wrote that he believed plaintiff statements to be somewhat dramatized and it is doubtful that he would,in fact,do so but it is possible.in addition,with interest that plaintiff continued to carry a gun despite his own expressed fears of what he might do as a result of his anger.
in its decision,the board also focused on the observations made by harris in his report that plaintiff anger against and his discussion of the shooting incidents arose only after plaintiff had been in treatment with wahlstrom for nearly two years,at a time which coincided with plaintiff filing and pursuing his application for a disability pension.indeed,according to harris,even wahlstrom found this sudden hostility to be unusual and bizarre,and there was no clear explanation as to why plaintiff suddenly began to express this hatred.we note that in plaintiff own testimony before the board,he confirmed that at the start of his therapy with wahlstrom,the focus was on his anger toward chief osantowski and plaintiff difficulties with his girlfriend,sheila.plaintiff testified that as his therapy continued,he began to discuss the shootings with wahlstrom,but offered no explanation as to why there was a delay in these issues surfacing.we also note that,although plaintiff expressed great hatred and animosity toward in his medical interviews,and that this hostility led rubens,conroe and ganellen to find plaintiff to be disabled and unable to return to active duty,any discussion of and plaintiff hatred toward this group was conspicuously absent from his testimony before the board.
in addition,the board also noted in its decision that although it was undisputed that plaintiff had said inflammatory things in the past,this did not necessarily mean that plaintiff was unable to perform his duties as a police officer.although the board observed that the doctors who evaluated plaintiff found that plaintiff had become disillusioned with the department as a result of the fbi investigation and plaintiff perception that the department was not supportive of him,and that wahlstrom had found plaintiff to be burned out,the board agreed with harris that being disillusioned with one job and being burned out did not constitute a psychiatric disorder.
in light of the above,we hold that the board decision to deny plaintiff a disability pension was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.the record contains sufficient evidence to support the board decision,and we can not say that it is clearly evident that the board should have reached the opposite conclusion and grant plaintiff a disability pension.
in his brief to this court,however,plaintiff notes that under the pension code,he is owed a fiduciary duty by the board,and that this militates in favor of our setting aside the decision of the board denying him a disability pension.we agree with plaintiff that the pension code establishes that a pension board owes a fiduciary duty toward its participants and beneficiaries.board of trustees of the barrington police pension fund village of barrington ethics board,d.section of the pension code provides in relevant part that 
a fiduciary with respect to a retirement system or pension fund established under this code shall discharge his or her duties with respect to the retirement system or pension fund solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and 
a for the exclusive purpose of 
providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and 
defraying reasonable expenses of administering the retirement system or pension fund 
b with the care,skill,prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character with like aims.
d in accordance with the provisions of the article of the pension code governing the retirement system or pension fund.ilcs west.
this fiduciary duty,however,is owed to all participants in the pension fund,not just plaintiff.perhaps the most important function of a pension board is to ensure adequate financial resources to cover the board obligations to pay current and future retirement and disability benefits to those who qualify for such payments.an important part of this responsibility involves the screening of unqualified or fraudulent disability claims,so that funds are not unfairly diverted to undeserving applicants.we believe that here,the board fulfilled its duty to oversee and screen plaintiff pension application as required under the pension code.
we note that plaintiff,in his brief to this court,also presents a short argument alleging that the delay by the board in processing his claim for disability benefits violates his due process rights and serves as a separate ground for reversing the board denial of his disability pension benefits.
the united states supreme court has held that due process requires,inter alia,a hearing at a meaningful time.cleveland board of education loudermill,d.although the record before us reveals lengthy delays in initiating and completing plaintiff hearing,it is not clear plaintiff does not explain delays resulted in a deprivation of plaintiff due process rights.indeed,there is no indication from the record that these delays impacted the board decision.
further,in his brief,plaintiff cites to several cases which he contends support his due process argument.however,plaintiff reliance on lyon department of children family services,d,cavarretta department of children family services,d,and stull department of children family services,d,is misplaced,as these decisions are factually distinguishable from the matter before us.in each of the cited cases,the depar
