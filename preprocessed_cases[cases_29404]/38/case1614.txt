in,appellant robert cassinelli and respondent janice cassinelli were married in,they were divorced.in the meantime,after years of service,robert had retired from the united states air force.in a stipulated judgment,the trial court awarded janice her community property interest in robert military retired pay.
fast forward years.in,it was determined that robert had a disability.as a result,he became eligible to receive both veteran disability benefits and special compensation crsc to do so,however,he had to waive his retired pay.before the waiver,robert received a month and janice received in retired pay taxable.after the waiver,robert received a month in veteran disability benefits and a month in crsc,for a total of janice received zero.as a result,the trial court ordered robert to start paying janice a month in permanent and nonmodifiable spousal support.
robert appeals,contending 
under overriding federal law,the trial court lacked jurisdiction to make any award to janice based on robert receipt of either veteran disability benefits or crsc.
there was insufficient evidence that the parties intended to protect janice against the consequences of a waiver of robert retired pay.
the trial court erred by using spousal support as a remedy for the loss of a community property interest.
because the judgment dividing the community property was final,the trial court could not give janice any remedy for the loss of her community property interest in the retired pay.
the trial court erred by making its award of spousal support permanent and nonmodifiable.
robert income was exempt and janice could not seize it to satisfy her claim.
based on the relevant factors see fam.code,janice was not entitled to spousal support,and the trial court abused its discretion by finding otherwise.
we agree that the trial court erred by using spousal support as a remedy for the loss of a community property interest.however,it could properly order robert to reimburse janice for her lost community property interest doing so would not violate either federal law or finality principles.accordingly,we will reverse and remand with directions to enter an order awarding janice the same amount on a different theory.
factual and procedural background 
janice and robert were married in.at that time,robert was on active duty as a member of the united states air force.after years of service,he retired from the military with the rank of technical sergeant.
in,after years of marriage,the parties separated.janice then filed this marital dissolution proceeding.
in august,pursuant to stipulation,the trial court entered a final judgment.it provided the court finds that janice has a interest in robert united states air force pension,and that she shall receive the sum of two hundred thirty dollars per month,or of said pension,whichever sum is greater.said payments to commence on may,providing that robert shall make said payments to janice until such time as the united states air force is able to process janice claims so that her share of the military pension can be paid directly to her.the judgment reserved jurisdiction over the issue of spousal support.
thereafter,robert held several jobs,primarily as a teacher.he developed ischemic heart disease in,he had a quadruple bypass.in,he took a medical retirement from teaching.his ischemic heart disease was presumed to be due to his exposure to agent orange in viet nam.see.thus,also in,the department of veterans affairs va determined that he had a disability,making him eligible for disability benefits.it was further determined that his disability was,making him eligible for crsc.
in,robert elected to receive crsc.before his election,he was receiving a month of his retired pay and janice was receiving a month of his retired pay.after his election,he received a month in veteran disability benefits and a month in crsc,for a total of a month.these benefits were nontaxable.janice received zero.however,when robert made his election,he was not aware that it would affect janice.
at the time of trial,robert was years old.his monthly income consisted of 
veteran disability benefits crsc state teacher disability benefits social security benefits total 
his total monthly expenses were.
janice was years old.she worked for rite aid.her monthly income consisted of in wages and in social security,for a total of.after paying her monthly expenses,she testified,s ome months i have,some months i have left over.
if and when janice stopped working,she would lose more than half her income,although she could get another a month if i lucky by drawing on in a k account and in an annuity.
in january,janice filed a motion to modify the judgment by ordering robert to pay the amount of her share of his retired pay as spousal support.
in opposition,robert argued the property division in the judgment was final and could not be reopened f ederal law which supersedes state law prohibits the spouse s participation in the member disability combat pay some or all of robert income is protected from attachment and the relevant factors militated against an award of spousal support.
in august,janice filed a motion for attorney fees.
in january,the trial court held a trial on both pending motions.after the trial,at the trial court invitation,both parties filed supplemental declarations.
in april,the trial court issued a written ruling.it acknowledged that,under federal law,it could not treat robert retired pay as community property.however,it ruled that it was not precluded from tak ing equitable action to compensate janice.
it found that robert voluntary election and the resulting termination of janice share of the military retirement was a material change of circumstances.it further found that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow robert,acting unilaterally,to increase his income from taxable to while reducing janice income from to zero.after considering and weighing each of the factors listed in family code section,it concluded that janice was entitled to receive a month in spousal support.
the trial court further found that,when the original judgment was entered,janice had a reasonable belief that her share of robert retired pay was nonmodifiable.it therefore made its award of spousal support nonmodifiable.
finally,it awarded janice in attorney fees against robert.
robert filed a motion for reconsideration.the trial court denied the motion.robert filed a timely notice of appeal 
expert testimony 
at trial,janice called attorney richard muir as an expert on the law regarding the treatment of payments in a divorce.
robert objected to one question to muir as calling for a legal conclusion that objection was sustained.he objected to two other questions as irrelevant those objections were overruled.otherwise,he did not object to muir testimony,nor did he call any expert witness of his own.after trial,in a brief filed in lieu of closing argument,he argued that muir was unqualified,that his opinions lacked foundation,and that he incorrectly stated the law.
in this appeal,robert argues that the trial court erred by adopt ing the fuzzy and mis s tated opinion of a ordinarily,robert would be deemed to have forfeited this argument due to his failure to raise any objection until after trial.evid.code,subd.a.
the problem,however,went beyond the mere admission of evidence.a witness can not testify to a legal conclusion.this is true even if the witness is an attorney.summers gilbert th.i t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is citation powers city of richmond cal th.i t is thoroughly established that experts may not give opinions on matters which are essentially within the province of the court to decide.citations.sheldon appel albert oliker cal d.even if a legal conclusion is admitted,it does not constitute substantial evidence.wri opportunity loans ii,llc cooper th,fn.downer bramet d.
it follows that,regardless of whether muir was correct or incorrect,qualified or unqualified,fuzzy or precise,his testimony was not substantial evidence.if and to the extent that the trial court relied on it,it erred.however,we need not decide whether this occurred.if the trial court did not rely on muir testimony,then the error was harmless.see cal,art.vi,code civ,elsner uveges cal th.if the trial court did rely on muir testimony,but muir was correct about the law,then once again,the error was harmless the trial court came to the right conclusion.and finally,if the trial court relied on muir testimony and muir was incorrect about the law,then we must reverse based on the resulting legal error.
for these reasons,we have not included any of muir testimony in our statement of facts part i,ante.and for the same reasons,we also have not included any of the legal conclusions to which robert testified,purportedly also as an expert,based on his own experience.
federal law prohibiting the division of retired pay as community property in a divorce 
robert contends that,as a matter of federal law,the trial court could not award janice any interest,directly or indirectly,in his veteran disability benefits.
general legal principles.
a member of the armed services who retires based on length of service becomes entitled to retired pay.army,navy,air force.
meanwhile,a veteran who becomes disabled as a result of an injury suffered or a disease contracted in the line of duty becomes entitled to disability benefits.wartime disability,peacetime disability.
in order to prevent double dipping,a military retiree may receive disability benefits only to the extent that he waives a corresponding amount of his military retirement pay.citation.mansell mansell,fn.omitted see.for example,if a military retiree is eligible for a month in retirement pay and a month in disability benefits,he must waive of retirement pay before he can receive any disability benefits.mansell mansell,supra,at,fn.military disability benefits are not taxable.a.thus,normally a retiree is better off by making such a waiver.
under california law,military retired pay that accrues based on service during marriage is community property.in re marriage of barnes cal d,in re marriage of stenquist cal d.however,in,the united states supreme court held that the federal military retirement scheme conflicts with and therefore preempts state law treating military retired pay as community property.mccarty mccarty.
in,congress enacted the federal uniformed services former spouses protection act fusfspa specifically to change the outcome in mccarty.fusfspa allows a state court in a community property jurisdiction to treat disposable retired pay as community property.c.however,its definition of disposable retired pay excludes any retired pay that has been waived in order to receive disability benefits.a b.
accordingly,in,in mansell mansell,supra,the united states supreme court held that fusfspa left mccarty in place with respect to waived retired pay,and therefore federal law prohibits a state court from treating waived retired pay as community property.mansell mansell,supra,at.it acknowledged that its holding may inflict economic harm on many former spouses,but it felt constrained by the plain language of the statute as well as by the statute legislative history.id.at.justice,dissenting,protested that t he harsh reality of this holding is that former spouses can,without their consent,be denied a fair share of their military retirement pay simply because he elects to increase his income by converting a portion of that pay into disability benefits.id.at dis.opn.of,see also id.at same.
b.in re marriage of krempin.
in the wake of mansell,state courts have struggled with whether they have jurisdiction to grant a civilian spouse any remedy whatsoever for a military spouse waiver of retired pay.
in california,the leading case is in re marriage of krempin th there,the trial court entered a judgment,pursuant to a marital settlement agreement,awarding the wife percent of the husband military retired pay.in re marriage of krempin,supra,at.after the husband retired,the wife began receiving a month as her share of his retired pay.thereafter,the husband was determined to be disabled.he waived retired pay and began receiving disability payments of a month,which meant that his retired pay went to zero.the trial court denied the wife motion to reinstate the payments to her.id.at.
the appellate court began by surveying cases.it found that courts in other states have protected the spouse interest through various means.
some courts have found that the waiver of retirement pay and resulting reduction in the pension payment to the nonmilitary spouse were changed circumstances which permitted reassessment of support payments or redistribution of marital property.citations.
in some cases the courts have enforced judgments which provided that the military spouse would take no action to diminish his or her retirement pay,and would indemnify the nonmilitary spouse for any such diminution.citations.because the military spouse is free to satisfy the indemnity obligation with assets other than the disability benefits,there is no division of those benefits in contravention of mansell.citations.this same result has been reached even where there was no express indemnity agreement.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at,italics added.
in sum,then,a majority of state courts,on one theory or another,take equitable action to compensate the former spouse when that spouse share of retirement pay is reduced by the other postjudgment waiver.citation.a review of the precedents confirms that this result is nearly universal.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.
the court then stated if the trial court were to conclude that the parties intended for the wife to continue to receive her original share of the husband retirement pay even if he waived all or a portion of that pay to obtain disability benefits,the mansell case would not prevent the court from giving appellant the benefit of her bargain on a resulting trust theory citation.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at,fn.omitted.thus,it remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.id.at.
as krempin mentioned,there are a number of relevant cases.indeed,we have an advantage over the krempin court,because additional cases have been decided since krempin,affording us almost an embarrassment of riches.
it is the clear majority rule that mansell does not prevent a state court from ordering a military spouse to reimburse a civilian spouse for retired pay that the military spouse has waived in order to receive disability benefits.we count states as so holding in re marriage of howell,pet.for cert.filed,in re marriage of lodeski,blann blann.app.so d,perez perez haw,mchugh mchugh idaho,in re marriage of neilsen d,bandini bandini.app,black black me,dexter dexter,krapf krapf,megee carmine,shelton shelton,cert.den.whitfield whitfield,hadrych hadrych,hillard hillard,hayes hayes,hayward hayward,resare resare,hisgen hisgen,johnson johnson,
in general,the reasoning in such cases has two simple premises.first,the nonmilitary spouse has a vested interest in his or her portion of the retired pay as of the date of the court decree and the vested interest can not thereafter be unilaterally diminished by an act of the military spouse.provencio leding.at,but see ashley ashley.second,because the military spouse is free to satisfy the indemnity obligation with assets other than the disability benefits,there is no division of disability benefits in contravention of mansell.citations.perez perez,supra,at.
a minority of states hold that mansell absolutely prohibits a state court from awarding the civilian spouse any remedy whatsoever for the loss of the retired pay.we count five ex parte billeck so d,in re marriage of pierce d,mallard burkart so d,ex parte burson,youngbluth youngbluth.these courts reason that it is a sort of legal fiction an around mansell to say that the military spouse could make payments out of other assets.mansell must be followed,even when it leads to seemingly unfair results.citation.youngbluth youngbluth,supra,at.
application to this case.
the fact that a majority of other states follow the same rule persuades us to adhere to that rule.moreover,we agree with the reasoning of the majority the military spouse has unilaterally deprived the civilian spouse of a property interest in the retired pay and can be required to reimburse the civilian spouse,albeit not directly out of disability benefits.b asic state policy prevent s a marital partner from depriving the other spouse of a vested community property right by a unilateral decision in re marriage of mastropaolo d.
at the same time,we disagree with the reasoning of the minority,which was that an order for reimbursement is an around mansell.mansell relied narrowly on a literal reading of the statutory language.mansell mansell,supra.it declined to consider the broader purposes behind fusfspa,in part because congress had mixed purposes t he legislative history,read as a whole,indicates that congress intended both to create new benefits for former spouses and to place limits on state courts designed to protect military retirees.id.at.requiring the military spouse to reimburse the civilian spouse for the latter share of the lost retired pay provided the military spouse is not required to make the payments out of disability benefits does not violate the language of fusfspa and thus does not violate mansell.
also,under krempin,the majority rule is already the law of california.robert claims that krempin is distinguishable because it involved active duty military personnel.admittedly,the husband was still on active duty when the judgment was entered.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.nevertheless,the trial court awarded the wife a share of his future retired pay.ibid.after that,the husband retired,and after that,he waived retired pay so he could receive disability benefits.id.at.thus,krempin is on point.we fail to see why the husband active duty status when the judgment was entered is relevant 
we do not necessarily agree with krempin in every respect.in part iv,post,we will disagree somewhat with its conclusions regarding the intent of the parties.and in part v,post,we will disagree somewhat with its choice of remedy.
for now,however,we do agree that a state court can order a military spouse who has waived retired pay to reimburse a civilian spouse for the latter loss of a community property interest in the retired pay without violating mansell.
the intent of the parties 
robert contends that there was insufficient evidence that the parties intended to protect janice against the consequences of a waiver of robert retired pay.
krempin indicated that whether the civilian spouse is entitled to a remedy for the military spouse waiver of retired pay depends on the terms of the judgment and may require the interpretation of those terms.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.it noted five aspects of the judgment before it that had some bearing on this question.
first,the judgment did not include an express indemnity provision.however,while the wife claim would be stronger if the judgment or stipulation included an indemnity provision,the absence of an indemnity agreement is not necessarily fatal to her position.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.
second,the judgment referred to retirement benefits paid by the defense accounting and finance center thus,it implicitly excluded disability benefits paid by the in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.
third,the judgment identified a specific amount that was to be paid to the wife monthly,and it required the husband to make these payments until the defense accounting and finance center took over.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.this suggests an understanding that the husband was ultimately responsible for insuring specific monthly payments.id.at.
fourth,the judgment included a reservation of jurisdiction to make such orders relating to the husband retirement benefits as are necessary to carry out this agreement.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.t he very fact that the parties agreement includes a reservation of jurisdiction on this subject suggests that they may have anticipated future contingencies such as waivers of retirement pay which might call for new arrangements to preserve the original bargain.ibid.
fifth,the marital settlement agreement provided that it was not to be construed in favor of or against either party.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.this language may support the wife contention that the agreement was not strictly limited to retirement payments as opposed to disability benefits,but was intended instead simply to provide her with a certain level of income.ibid.
the court concluded since the provisions of the judgment and stipulation are reasonably susceptible to both sides constructions,the parties may offer extrinsic evidence to support their positions.citations.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.hence,a remand for further proceedings is required.id.at see also id.at.
we agree that the terms of the stipulated judgment are controlling indeed,this is almost a truism.certainly a divorcing couple could choose to provide in their marital settlement agreement that the military spouse has an absolute right to waive his or her retirement pay,without any obligation to reimburse the civilian spouse.however,we believe there should be a presumption against this interpretation.
there is a need for uniformity and predictability in this area,particularly given the federal interests involved.also,as our supreme court has noted,many if not most family law litigants are.elkins superior court cal th.as our research has made us all too aware,the whole subject of spouses rights to military benefits in a divorce is extremely arcane even for lawyers.it would be a mistake to give too much weight to minor differences in wording when that wording was not necessarily chosen with these issues in mind.
in light of these concerns,we begin with a commonsense presumption that the parties intend the civilian spouse property right to the military spouse retired pay to be a secure source of income except,of course,in the event of the military spouse death,which the civilian spouse can insure against.then we turn to the indicia of intent identified in krempin to determine whether they rebut the presumption.
first,here there was no express indemnity.however,krempin held that this is not controlling,and for the reasons just outlined,we agree.second,the judgment referred to robert retired pay and did not mention his disability benefits.however,this is consistent with the law that disability benefits are the military spouse separate property it is also consistent with our presumption that the parties intended janice right to the retired pay to be indefeasible.third,the judgment identified a specific dollar amount that robert was to pay to janice monthly,until the military began paying her directly.fourth,there was no reservation of jurisdiction over robert retired pay.again,however,this seems perfectly consistent with our presumption that janice right to the retired pay was intended to be indefeasible.fifth,unlike in krempin,the judgment did not specifically provide that it was not to be construed against either party.this would simply mean that civil code section would apply it provides that in cases of uncertainty not removed by the preceding rules,the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist.here,janice attorney drafted the judgment.however,in light of our presumption,there is no uncertainty and hence no need to apply a construction against the drafter.
in sum,because there is no evidence that the parties did intend robert to be able to defeat janice property right in his retired pay,we conclude that they did not intend this.
the choice of remedy 
robert contends that,even assuming janice is entitled to some sort of remedy for his waiver of retired pay,an award of spousal support is not an appropriate remedy.
janice urged the trial court to use an award of spousal support as the remedy in this case.this had several advantages for her.first,it avoided any problem with finality see part vi,post,because the judgment expressly reserved jurisdiction over spousal support.second,unlike other money judgments see part ix,post,a support order would be enforceable against robert disability benefits although only up to the amount of his waiver of retired pay a,h a ii v,h b iii united states murray,against his crsc of def.fin.mgmt.reg.r,vol,ch,c fin.mgmt.reg,against his social security benefits a,h a ii i detienne detienne,and against his state teacher disability benefits code civ,subd.c ed.code.
in part iii,ante,we noted that a majority of cases hold that,when a military spouse waives retired pay in order to receive disability benefits,the civilian spouse is entitled to a remedy.of these cases,the vast majority further hold that the appropriate remedy is an order that the military spouse make monthly payments to the civilian spouse in the same amount as the lost retired pay.the result is the same as if,in a marital settlement agreement,the civilian spouse had expressly indemnified the civilian spouse against any reduction in or loss of the retired pay.
a handful of cases,however a minority of the majority hold that the appropriate remedy is increased spousal support.
in in re marriage of perkins,the trial court ordered the military spouse to pay the civilian spouse the same amount as her lost share of his retired pay,as permanent compensatory spousal maintenance id.at,italics omitted.the appellate court held that mansell prohibited any order for reimbursement of the lost retired pay,even if it was labeled maintenance.in re marriage of perkins,supra,at.however,a dissolution court may consider a spouse entitlement to an undivided veterans disability pension as one factor relevant to an award of maintenance,provided of course that it follows the usual rules id.at,fns.omitted.in other words,a trial court may award maintenance after considering all relevant factors,of which a military disability pension may be one.id.at.thus,it remanded for reconsideration of maintenance.ibid.
in longanecker longanecker.app.so d,the trial court ordered as and for lump sum alimony to effectuate an equitable distribution of the husband military retirement pension as a marital asset,the husband shall pay or direct to be paid to the wife the sum equal to from each monthly net disposable retirement payment id.at.the appellate court held that this violated mansell,to the extent that it ordered the military spouse to make the payments directly out of his disability benefits.longanecker longanecker,supra,at.however,it approved of ordering the payments in the form of support.id.at.
california law,however,does not allow a trial court to order reimbursement under the guise of support.permanent spousal support is governed by the statutory scheme set forth in family code sections through.family code s ection authorizes the trial court to order a party to pay spousal support in an amount,and for a period of time,that the court determines is just and reasonable,based on the standard of living established during the marriage,taking into consideration the circumstances set forth in family code section.citations.the statutory factors include the supporting spouse ability to pay the needs of each spouse based on the marital standard of living the obligations and assets of each spouse,including separate property and any other factors pertinent to a just and equitable award.citation.the trial court has broad discretion in balancing the applicable statutory factors and determining the appropriate weight to accord to each,but it may not be arbitrary and must both recognize and apply each applicable factor.citation.in re marriage of blazer th.by contrast,awarding reimbursement does not involve consideration of any of these factors in setting the amount of such reimbursement,the trial court would exercise no discretion.
here,the trial court purported to consider all of the factors listed in family code section it made detailed findings with respect to each of these factors.nevertheless,it came up with a support amount that was identical,down to the dollar,to the amount of retired pay that janice had lost.obviously,the trial court subordinated all of its other findings to the fact that janice had been deprived of in retired pay.this was arbitrary and an abuse of discretion 
thus,we reject a award of support as a remedy.more generally,however,we reject any award of support as a remedy,even when the amount of support is determined in scrupulous accordance with the factors listed in family code section.we recognize that whenever a military spouse waives retired pay in order to obtain disability benefits,the civilian spouse has increased need,and the military spouse has an increased ability to pay.nevertheless,the wrong that is done the wrong that cries out for a remedy is that the civilian spouse has been deprived of a community property right.
i t must be kept in mind that spousal support considerations are separate and distinct from property division concepts.in re marriage of white d.support can not be awarded in lieu of an equal division of community property citation or to compensate for an unequal division.hogoboom king,cal.practice guide family law the rutter group.
the civilian spouse should be entitled to recover the amount lost,regardless of earning capacity,other assets and obligations,or the former marital standard of living.thus,the appropriate remedy is compensation,not a variable amount set in the trial court discretion after weighing a host of factors.see in re marriage of stenquist,supra,cal d at,fn.a djustments in the amount of alimony awarded will not mitigate the hardship caused the wife by the denial of her community interest t he spouse should not be dependent on the discretion of the court to provide her with the equivalent of what should be hers as a matter of absolute right.citation.
in addition,unless otherwise agreed,a support award terminates automatically if the supported spouse remarries.fam.code.however,remarriage should have no effect on a civilian spouse community property rights.
similarly,unless otherwise agreed,a support order may be modified at any time fam.code,subd.a,based on changed circumstances in re marriage of khera and sameer th.by contrast,an award of a share of a military spouse retired pay to a civilian spouse is final and nonmodifiable an award of compensation for the loss of that share should likewise be nonmodifiable.in this case,the trial court attempted to overcome this problem by making its support award unmodifiable.however,as robert points out,this provision was statutorily unauthorized and erroneous.
janice cites in re marriage of olsen th as authority supporting an award of spousal support.there,the trial court awarded the wife a community property share of the husband military retired pay,on the condition that she waive any spousal support,which she did.id.at.thereafter,fusfspa was amended so as to provide that a state court can not treat military retired pay as community property.ibid.in response,the trial court reinstated the wife spousal support.ibid.the appellate court held that,even though the trial court previous order had been final,and even though the trial court had not expressly reserved jurisdiction over spousal support,the trial court had jurisdiction to do so.id.at.
the only aspect of olsen that is even tangentially relevant to the issue before us is the trial court order requiring the wife to waive spousal support in order to receive her community property interest in the husband military retired pay.arguably,this suggests that the two are somehow fungible.however,the parties did not appeal from that order.moreover,in the appeal that they did file,there was no issue with respect to whether that previous order was valid.i t is axiomatic that cases are not authority for propositions not considered.citation.riverside county sheriff stiglitz cal th.
as mentioned earlier,we do not agree with krempin that a resulting trust is an appropriate remedy.krempin reasoned that the military spouse has effectively utilized the civilian spouse interest in the retired pay to acquire disability benefits for him or herself alone.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.the situation presented is a classic one for the imposition of a resulting trust.when one person furnishes the money or other thing of value with which property is acquired and title to the property is taken in the name of another,absent the intention of the one to confer a gift upon the other,the titleholder is a trustee upon a resulting trust of the property for the benefit of the person who furnished the money or other thing of value by which the property was acquired.ibid.
the problem with this is that it gives the civilian spouse an interest in specific property namely,the military spouse disability benefits.but this is precisely what mansell forbids.hence,as far as we have been able to determine,no other court has ever used a resulting trust as a remedy for a civilian spouse lost interest in a military spouse waived retired pay.
we believe it is better to hold that the military spouse has caused the loss or destruction of a property right belonging to the civilian spouse and should therefore be required to pay the civilian spouse money damages.see civ.code,every person who suffers detriment from the unlawful act or omission of another,may recover from the person in fault a compensation therefor in money,which is called damages.
here,the judgment characterized robert retired pay as community property and awarded percent of it to janice.by waiving his retired pay so that he could receive disability benefits,robert effectively transferred percent of his retired pay to the united states government.like the court in krempin,we do not mean to characterize this action as fraudulent,a breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing,contempt of court,or otherwise blameworthy.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.however,it upset the division of property as adjudicated in the judgment.thus,janice became entitled to damages for her lost property right.
although the trial court erred by awarding spousal support,we can remedy this error by directing it to award janice a month,not as spousal support,but as damages.
the finality of judgments 
robert contends that the trial court order violates the finality of judgments 
p ublic policy demands finality of litigation in the area of family law.in re marriage of thomas d.thus,g enerally,once a marital dissolution judgment has become final,the court loses jurisdiction to modify or alter it.citations.m arital property rights and obligations adjudicated by a final judgment can not be upset by subsequent efforts to modify the judgment.in re marriage of thorne and raccina th.
one exception to this general rule is that a judgment may contain an express reservation of jurisdiction authorizing the court to subsequently modify it.citations.in re marriage of thorne and raccina,supra,th at.here,the judgment contained an express reservation of jurisdiction regarding spousal support.thus,the trial court did not violate finality principles by making a new order for spousal support.indeed,the very existence of the reservation of judgment may well have influenced its decision to choose spousal support as a remedy.
krempin did not need to address this issue,because there,the stipulated judgment included a reservation of jurisdiction to make such orders relating to the husband retirement benefits as are necessary to carry out this agreement.in re marriage of krempin,supra,th at.
here,the judgment did not contain any similar express reservation of jurisdiction regarding retirement benefits.we therefore consider robert argument regarding finality of judgments,not as it pertains to an award of spousal support,but rather as it pertains to an award of damages.
once a divorce judgment has been entered,it may be enforced by any other order as the court in its discretion determines from time to time to be necessary.fam.code.to the extent that a judgment of dissolution is not in respect of any division of property therein ordered,the court retains jurisdiction to make such further orders as are appropriate to compel obedience to its judgment.bonner superior court d.
in in re marriage of justice d,the trial court entered a stipulated judgment awarding the wife a specified percentage of the husband future police officer pension.id.at.ultimately,the husband retired on a disability pension rather than a longevity pension he therefore refused to pay the wife anything.ibid.on the wife motion,the trial court ordered the pension administrator to pay the wife her share of what the husband would have received if he had retired on a longevity pension.id.at.
on appeal,the husband argued that because the judgment awarded to the wife of the community interest in his service retirement benefits and did not reserve the court jurisdiction over any disability retirement benefits to which he might have become entitled,the court was without jurisdiction to divide the husband disability pension by postjudgment order.in re marriage of justice,supra,d at.
the appellate court ruled the contention is without merit.a judgment entered in a marital dissolution proceeding may be enforced by the court by such order or orders as the court in its discretion may from time to time deem necessary.civ.code.the postjudgment order enforces the judgment by securing to the wife her share of the community interest in the husband service retirement benefits the order does not by its terms award to the wife any portion of the husband disability pension.in re marriage of justice,supra,d at.
as already noted,decisions hold that a military spouse can be required to compensate a civilian spouse for the loss of waived retired pay,despite mansell.some of these have further held that this is permitted enforcement of the judgment,rather than a prohibited modification.
for example,in janovic janovic.app.so d,the court stated a trial court may not,in the guise of an enforcement proceeding,readdress the distribution of property when the property has been previously distributed,citations,nor may the trial court reallocate property based on an involuntary change in circumstances.a trial court,however,retains jurisdiction to enforce a final dissolution judgment.citation.where a party only seeks to receive what is contemplated by the property settlement agreement incorporated into the final dissolution judgment,the relief sought is enforcement rather than modification.citations.therefore,a trial court may order an equivalent benefit as part of an enforcement action where one spouse takes a voluntary action which defeats the intent of the parties.citation.id.at,fn.omitted.
in whitfield whitfield,supra,the court said it is important to emphasize the procedural posture of this case.the issue is one of enforcement of a prior equitable distribution award,not a present division of assets.wife does not seek to divide her former husband disability benefits in violation of mansell.nor does she seek a greater percentage of her husband military pension than she originally received at the time of his retirement pursuant to court order.moreover,wife does not seek to alter the terms of her retirement plan or to compel the department of defense to make direct payments to her in excess of those permitted by federal law.the remedy she seeks,and that to which she is entitled,is an enforcement of the original order which was in effect before her former husband retired and unilaterally elected the waiver.id.at see also megee carmine,supra,at quoting and agreeing with whitfield.
likewise,hadrych hadrych,supra,stated husband unilateral action significantly reduced benefits to which wife was entitled under the final decree.while we agree that there was no language expressly addressing the change in retirement benefits that would occur if husband were to become disabled,it is also true that the decree awarded to wife of the retirement benefits that had accrued to date of divorce.husband argument that no language prohibited him from electing to waive retirement benefits and convert them to disability benefits is not persuasive.there is no language in the decree permitting him to do so,either.we think it is quite a stretch for him to argue that the trial court could not intervene to address his attempt to significantly reduce the distribution set by the decree.consequently,we hold that the court order constituted enforcement because the order maintained wife benefits at the same level as was establish
