gregory emenaker,a veteran,appeals from a decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court,which denied his request for benefits attributable to a service connected disability stemming from a neurological disorder.emenaker argues that the veterans court misinterpreted the statutory presumption of sound condition accorded to veterans,and the regulation that implements that presumption,b.because we hold that the argument emenaker presents to us has not been properly preserved for appeal,we affirm.
emenaker served on active duty in the united states navy from october to october.medical records reflected that he suffered from slight weakness on the left side of his body.ct imaging conducted during his service revealed subtle changes in the right hemisphere of his brain,which led the examining physician to conclude that emenaker suffered from brain atrophy and weakness of the left upper and lower extremities secondary to a traumatic brain injury that he experienced as a child.
in december,after his retirement,emenaker filed a claim for service connection for several conditions,including atrophy of the right cerebral hemisphere and a resulting weakness on the left side of his body.a regional office of the department of veterans affairs dva granted emenaker claim of service connection for an fracture of his left shoulder,but denied service connection for his brain injury and left side weakness on the ground that the condition originated prior to service and had not been aggravated during service.on appeal,the board of veterans appeals determined that the regional office had improperly relied on its own assessment of the medical evidence and that there had been no professional medical opinion regarding whether the veteran disorder was aggravated by service.the board remanded the case to the regional office in april to determine,among other things,whether there is evidence of aggravation in service beyond natural progress pursuant to b.the regional office arranged for an independent medical examination of emenaker,which was conducted by patrick kilhenny in july.
following that examination,kilhenny prepared a report in which he noted that emenaker weakness had previously been traced to a motor vehicle accident that occurred when emenaker was five years old.emenaker reported that the accident left him in a coma for some time and required speech therapy thereafter.kilhenny concluded that emenaker has had a gradual increasing weakness on the left side of his body for approximately ten years time,and that although he does not have a primary motor neuron disease,he had an old encephalomalacia softening of the brain tissue seen on his mri with resultant left hemiparesis weakening of the left side of the body which i would describe as mild.kilhenny further concluded that emenaker symptoms are secondary to his childhood accident and do not represent evidence of a new neurologic entity.he added that o ccasionally,head injured patients can have a slight worsening of their symptoms with age and this is due to the normal dying off phenomenon of neurons which can bring out a weakness later in life.based on that report,the regional office issued a supplemental statement of the case,again denying emenaker application for benefits.subsequently,and at the request of the regional office,kilhenny provided an addendum to his report,in which he stated 
it is my professional opinion,that it is at least as likely as not,
a that this veteran disorder entrance into the military service.
b the veteran underwent a normal progression,during service age related changes.
c the increase was normal,age related loss not job related.
the regional office then prepared another supplemental statement of the case,again denying emenaker claim.the board of veterans appeals affirmed that decision in january.the board found that while the evidence does establish that there was a permanent increase in severity of the veteran preexisting disability during service,the evidence also clearly and unmistakably establishes that this increase was due to the natural progress of that disability.accordingly,the board concluded that emenaker preexisting disability was not aggravated as a result of his military service.
the veterans court vacated that decision in april.the court focused on the at least as likely as not language in kilhenny supplemental statement and ruled that the board had failed to explain adequately how that statement could satisfy the requirement of clear and unmistakable evidence needed to rebut the presumption of aggravation under and.the court stated that the board must fully and adequately explain whether the opinion rises to the level of evidence despite the use of the seemingly equivocal phrase at least as likely as not.
on remand,the board in a opinion explained that kilhenny statement was responding to questions set forth in the board opinion,in which the board had specifically directed him to provide an opinion as to whether it is at least as likely as not that a the disorder entrance into military service b if so,did it undergo an increase in severity during service c if so,was any such increase beyond the natural progress of the disease.the board in its opinion then added 
we recognize that the rubric at least as likely as not is not,taken alone,strictly equivalent to clear and unmistakable evidence.however,the neurological examiner addendum followed up on his detailed and comprehensive examination report,which described the veteran and history,and his present condition.based upon a careful reading of the examiner initial report and subsequent addendum,the board believes the opinion is unequivocal in concluding that the increase in the veteran symptomatology in service represented an expected and normal progression due to the aging process.
based on that assessment,the board concluded that the record contained clear and unmistakable evidence that the increase in severity of emenaker symptoms was due to the natural progression of a preservice condition.accordingly,the board denied his claim.emenaker appealed that decision to the veterans court.after assessing the board explanation of kilhenny statement,the court concluded that the language he used is not fatal to his opinion.the court then affirmed the board decision denying service connection for emenaker condition,and emenaker appealed to this court.
emenaker legal argument on appeal relates to the statutory presumption that a veteran was in sound condition when enrolled for service,which can be overcome only by clear and unmistakable evidence that the veteran disability was both preexisting and not aggravated by service.see wagner principi.emenaker concedes that his condition originated prior to his entry into military service.as a result,his challenge focuses on whether his condition was aggravated by service.as to that issue,he contends that the statutory presumption of aggravation,which applies whenever a disability increases in severity during service,can not be rebutted by medical judgment alone,and that the presumption should not have been held to be rebutted in his case by a single medical professional opinion.
emenaker relies on the statute that sets forth the presumption of soundness,as well as the statute implementing regulation.emenaker statutory argument depends on a comparison between,which creates the soundness presumption applicable to veterans such as emenaker who served during wartime,and,which creates an analogous presumption applicable to veterans of peacetime service pointing to the difference in language between the two statutes,emenaker argues that congress intentionally removed language stating that the soundness presumption may be rebutted by evidence,or medical judgment from section while retaining that language in section.the purpose of creating that difference between the two statutes,according to emenaker,was to ensure that for veterans covered by section,medical judgment alone could not serve to rebut the soundness presumption.in addition,emenaker relies on the regulation that implements section,which states in pertinent part that determinations as to w
