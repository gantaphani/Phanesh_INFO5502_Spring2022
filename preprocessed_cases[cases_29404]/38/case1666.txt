introduction 
in this case we address the meaning of the term regular compensation in the section of the county employees retirement law of cerl as codified in,et that establishes the effective date of a disability retirement,hereafter section.
donna katosh appeals from the judgment of the sonoma county superior court denying her petition for writ of mandate code civ,by which she sought to compel respondents sonoma county employees retirement association scera and sonoma county employees retirement board board to designate the day following her last day of work,june,as her effective retirement date and to overturn a decision of the board determining the effective date of her retirement to be october,the day after she exhausted her accrued sick leave.the court determined that appellant had failed to show that the board erred in setting her retirement date because she did not exhaust her accrued sick leave until october,and that pursuant to section,her retirement could not be effective until she did so.
appellant contends that the board and the court erred in construing the term regular compensation in section to include sick leave.we shall affirm the judgment.
background 
the basic facts are not in dispute.appellant worked for the sonoma county department of human services as a youth supervisor.she was hired in,and stopped working on june.on march,her county health insurance lapsed on february,appellant filed an application for a disability retirement with scera.while her application was pending and for reasons not explained in the record before us,she returned to in pay status with the county for the period ending december.she did not actually provide services for the county during that period,but received a payment of approximately hours of sick leave previously accrued while she was working.
on july,respondents made a preliminary determination that appellant was not permanently incapacitated.appellant appealed,arguing she was permanently incapacitated and that the delay in filing her disability retirement application was due to the inability to ascertain the permanency of her incapacity pursuant to section.following a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,the alj recommended granting appellant application for a disability retirement.the alj did not address the effective retirement date.on october,appellant requested respondents to set the effective retirement date as the last date she received regular compensation pursuant to the provision of section that deems the disability retirement application to have been filed on the date following the date for which the member last received regular compensation where filing of the member application was delayed by inability to ascertain the permanency of the member incapacity.
in an october,letter to appellant attorney,scera responded to appellant request,explaining that appellant health insurance had lapsed on march,and that i n order for her to be eligible to receive health benefits she must have active health insurance at the time she retires,her retirement date.appellant was in pay status for the pay period ending december,the date upon which she last received regular compensation,but did not have active health insurance at that time.the letter stated that the county would allow her to return to in pay status effective october,and allow her to run out her sick leave and vacation to give her the hours needed to reinstate her health insurance prior to the board making a decision.the letter advised that to do so she must contact her department immediately and request this be done.the letter also advised that this would mean that her retirement date will be in october of and she would not receive any retroactive retirement benefits if she is granted a disability retirement.but,it would increase her highest final monthly compensation calculation,as well as,give her health insurance benefits as a retiree.
appellant counsel notified scera that because health insurance benefits were critical to appellant,she believed she had no choice other than to follow that advice.however,she was neither withdrawing nor waiving her earlier written request that any disability retirement allowance which is granted be made effective on the date following the day for which she last received regular compensation because of the inability to ascertain the permanency of her incapacity until after that date.
appellant returned to the county payroll for a period beginning sometime around october,and ending on october.she used a combination of sick leave and vacation time to achieve the necessary hours to reactivate her health insurance 
on october,the board adopted the hearing officer decision and granted appellant a disability retirement.however,it postponed a decision on the effective date of her retirement presumably to allow appellant to run out her sick leave to reinstate her health benefits.at its meeting of november,the board confirmed its decision that sick leave is regular compensation and set appellant retirement date as the day after her last day on payroll,october.
on january,appellant filed a timely petition for a writ of mandate in the superior court.she argued that the board abused its discretion and acted contrary to law by characterizing the payment of sick leave and vacation compensation as regular compensation as the term is used in section.
following a hearing,the trial court denied the petition for writ of mandamus,agreeing with scera and with the board that sick leave is included in regular compensation and concluding that section requires that a successful disability retirement applicant exhaust her accrued sick leave before a disability retirement can become effective because petitioner did not exhaust her accrued sick leave until october,her retirement could not be effective until after that date.
this timely appeal followed.
discussion 
the parties agree that the question raised here is the interpretation and application of section to the facts.we agree the question whether regular compensation in section includes sick leave is a question of statutory construction.therefore,our review of the trial court ruling is de novo.in re retirement cases th,d.we apply our independent judgment to the trial court determination of questions of law.santa clara valley transportation authority rea th,d macisaac waste management collection recycling,th,d.

although our review is independent,we do not necessarily disregard the agency interpretation of the law.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.citation.considered alone and apart from the context and circumstances that produce them,agency interpretations are not binding or necessarily even authoritative yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.it follows that if application of the settled rules of statutory interpretation does not clearly reveal the legislature intent,the agency interpretation of the statutes in the context of this case may be helpful.santa clara valley transportation authority rea,supra,th at,d.
section provides in its entirety if the proof received,including any medical examination,shows to the satisfaction of the board that the member is permanently incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his duties in the service,it shall retire him effective on the expiration date of any leave of absence with compensation to which he shall become entitled under the provisions of division commencing with section of the labor code or effective on the occasion of the member consent to retirement prior to the expiration of such leave of absence with compensation.his disability retirement allowance shall be effective as of the date such application is filed with the board,but not earlier than the day following the last day for which he received regular compensation.notwithstanding any other provision of this article,the retirement of a member who has been granted or is entitled to sick leave shall not become effective until the expiration of such sick leave with compensation unless the member consents to his retirement at an earlier date.
when it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board that the filing of the member application was delayed by administrative oversight or by inability to ascertain the permanency of the member incapacity until after the date following the day for which the member last received regular compensation,such date will be deemed to be the date the application was filed,italics and bolding added.
appellant contends that regular compensation as used in the statute does not include sick leave or vacation pay and that her last day of receiving regular compensation was her last day of actual work,june.she argues that because her delay in filing her application was due to an inability to ascertain the permanency of her incapacity,her effective retirement date should be the date following her last day of actual work as so defined.however,it is conceded that neither the board nor the court addressed appellant claim that she came within the second paragraph of the statute because the filing of her application was delayed by the inability to ascertain the permanency of her incapacity.it was unnecessary to do so,given the determination that regular compensation includes sick leave and vacation and therefore,that the last day for which she received regular compensation was october.consequently,the issue of inability to ascertain permanency does not come into play unless we determine that appellant has established that regular compensation does not include sick leave or vacation.if such were the case,remand for determination of the factual issue of whether appellant carried her burden of demonstrating the delay was caused by an inability to determine permanency would be required.we address only the issue of whether sick leave and vacation are included in the term regular compensation in this statute.
plain meaning 
respondents contend that the plain meaning of the term regular compensation includes wages and salary paid for sick leave and vacation.appellant argues,to the contrary,that the language of the statute and its legislative history indicate that sick leave is not included in regular compensation.
the term regular compensation is not defined,either statutorily or judicially.puckett orange county bd.of retirement d.puckett.after puckett,both the california supreme court and this court have addressed issues that assist in determining the question here.see ventura,supra,cal th at,d,in re retirement cases,supra,th at,d.nevertheless,we can not say that the plain meaning of the statute either includes or excludes sick leave from the term regular compensation.we begin with the words of the statute.
webster new third new international dictionary defines the term regular as a steady or uniform in course,practice,or occurrence not subject to unexplained or irrational variation steadily pursued orderly,methodical habits b returning,recurring,or received at stated,fixed,or uniform intervals,at.
we are not persuaded that the use of the term regular to modify compensation suggests that the term should be equated with actually working,as appellant contends.both sick leave and vacation are accrued on a regular basis and when taken as time off,the employee receives regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services.ventura,supra,cal th at,d.compensation is defined in government code section as the remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds,plus any amount deducted from a member wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan but does not include the monetary value of board,lodging,fuel,laundry,or other advantages furnished to a member.ventura,at,d.regular compensation would necessarily be a subset of the broader term compensation.
appellant acknowledges that the first sentence of section refers to certain temporary disability benefits under the workers compensation law that are not at issue here.that sentence makes a disability retirement effective on the expiration date of any leave of absence with compensation under division of the labor code,or effective on the occasion of the member consent to retirement prior to the expiration of such leave of absence with compensation.
the second sentence in section provides that a disability retirement allowance shall be effective as of the date such application is filed with the board,but not earlier than the day following the last day for which he received regular compensation.it is the term regular compensation as used here that is at issue.
the third sentence of section provides notwithstanding any other provision of this article,the retirement of a member who has been granted or is entitled to sick leave shall not become effective until the expiration of such sick leave with compensation unless the member consents to his retirement at an earlier date.appellant argues that this sentence expressly distinguishes sick leave from regular compensation as used in the second sentence and that there would be no reason for the legislature to include this third sentence if sick leave were regular compensation.we disagree.
the reference to regular compensation in the second sentence sets the retirement allowance date as the later of the date of application or the day following the last day the employee receives regular compensation.this provision ensures against retirees receiving regular compensation at the same time they receive retirement benefits,protects the taxpayer funds,and simplifies administration by providing a clear command to the retirement system.see puckett,supra,d at.the third sentence regarding exhaustion of sick leave protects the disabled employee from being retired before having an opportunity to receive wages for accrued sick leave.it ensures that a member who is granted a disability retirement,but has not yet exhausted his or her sick leave,is provided the option of delaying the effective date of retirement so that the member can obtain the advantages of the sick leave benefits to which he or she is entitled.advantages of doing so include the employee continues to receive service credit during the period of sick leave while the disability retirement benefit is only a percentage of the employee salary,during sick leave the employee receives full wages and a retirement allowance is calculated at a higher rate if the employee salary is increased during the period of sick leave.moreover,as in this case,the option of reinstating lapsed county health insurance is available during the sick leave period,so the employee may retain the insurance as a retiree.
legislative history 
the legislative history of this provision confirms that in amending the statute to add the third sentence,the legislature intended to allow a member to use all accumulated sick leave prior to disability retirement.assem.com.on retirement,analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.july,see historical note west ann.ed.foll.as the bill analysis of the assembly committee on retirement states under present county act law,the practice of permitting members to use accrued sick leave prior to disability retirement varies from county to county.ab would provide that a member could not be retired for disability until after the expiration of his accrued sick leave,without the member consent.ibid.the analysis continued sick leave benefits vary greatly from county to county.some counties provide cash payments for accrued sick leave upon separation or upon retirement,while other counties have quite modest sick leave programs.ab would not affect the type of sick leave program offered by a county,but would provide that an employee is entitled to any benefits accrued at the time of retirement for disability.ibid.
appellant contends the board and the trial court erred in finding that section requires a disabled employee to exhaust accrued sick leave before a disability retirement can become effective.in its statement of decision,the court stated the statute requires that a successful disability retirement applicant exhaust her accrued sick leave before a disability retirement can become effective because appellant did not exhaust her accrued sick leave until october,her retirement could not be effective until after that date.as a general statement of the law that a member is required to exhaust sick leave before a disability retirement can become effective,the statement is patently erroneous.it would read out of the third sentence,the phrase unless the member consents to his retirement at an earlier date.
this provision of section permits a disability retirement to become effective at the employee option,before exhaustion of accrued leave in counties,such as sonoma,that allow employees separated from county service by retirement for disability to opt for payment at such employee base hourly rate for all unused sick leave remaining to such employee credit as of the time of separation memorandum of understanding between the county and the sonoma county law enforcement association mou,italics added.in re retirement cases,supra,th,d,describes such payment of accrued but unused sick leave and vacation as termination pay.as we have discussed,the legislative history of section recognizes that some counties provide cash payments for accrued sick leave upon separation or retirement,while others do not.the amendment of section was not intended to interfere with those practices,but to require that all counties allow the disability retiree to use accumulated sick leave prior to retirement and to prevent counties from retiring a member for disability before expiration of accrued sick leave,without the member consent.
nevertheless,our recognition that the court statement was erroneous does not resolve the issue presented here as to whether the court and the board correctly determined that regular compensation includes sick leave.in sonoma county a disabled member covered by the mou may consent to retirement before using accumulated sick leave and still recover the lump sum payment of accrued sick leave and vacation upon retirement however,this does not mean that a member can use the sick leave and then consent to a retirement date before the sick leave was taken.such is prohibited.puckett,supra,d at.
in ventura,supra,cal th,d,the california supreme court addressed the question whether various payments by the county over and above the basic salary paid to all employees in the same job classification are compensation within the meaning of the statute which defines compensation,and,if so,whether those payments are also compensation earnable,and thus part of a retiring employee final compensation,or for purposes of calculating the amount of a pension.ventura,at,d.after considering the language and legislative history of the relevant provisions,the court concluded that the legislature did not intend to require that a county include its contributions to an employee deferred compensation plan in compensation as defined in cerl.id.at,d.however,the court also concluded that the other disputed payments,including pay in lieu of annual leave accrual and holiday pay were included in final compensation.id.at,d,fns.omitted.with the exception of pay,items of compensation paid in cash,even if not earned by all employees in the same grade or class,must be included in the compensation earnable and final compensation on which an employee pension is based.id.at,d.
in reaching its determination,the supreme court relied upon the statutory definitions of compensation,and compensation earnable.ventura,supra,cal th at,d.
the ventura court discussion of annual leave compensation is relevant here.the supreme court agreed with the court of appeal that a longevity bonus and accrued vacation are remuneration under government code section and,since neither is an excluded advantage,under the statute both are compensation.ventura,supra,cal th at,d.
plaintiffs concede that when annual leave is received as time off,it does not meet the statutory definitions of compensation or compensation earnable.when annual leave is taken as time off,the employee simply continues to receive regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services.receipt of that pay is part of the employee remuneration for past services and is compensation.when an employee elects to receive cash in lieu of accrued vacation and the wages or salary the employee would receive during the vacation period,the cash,like the vacation pay the employee would otherwise receive,is part of the employee remuneration for past services.the same analysis applies to the county longevity incentive since that item simply grants additional vacation hours to be accrued or cashed out to those employees with five years or more service who are covered by the resolution.payment to longtime employees,whether in salary for vacation days on which no work is performed or in additional cash,is equivalent to increased pay that often accompanies seniority.it,too,is remuneration and compensation.ventura,supra,cal th at,d,italics and bolding added,fn.omitted.
although the supreme court was not analyzing the term regular compensation as used in section,its analysis of the character of annual leave,leave offered participating employees in lieu of sick leave and vacation taken by the employee before retirement,provides strong support for an interpretation of regular compensation as including annual leave,sick leave and vacation when taken as time off during the period of employment.as recognized by the supreme court,when annual leave is taken as time off,the employee continues to receive regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services.receipt of that pay is part of the employee remuneration for past services and is compensation.ventura,supra,cal th at,d.
in in re retirement cases,supra,th,d,this court determined the holding of ventura,supra,cal th,d,could be applied retroactively.in re retirement cases,at,d.we also held,among other things,that certain items of remuneration that did not involve cash payments to an employee before his or her retirement should not be included in calculations of final compensation.included in this category were by employees of unused leave upon separation from service termination pay.id.at,d.the plan members argued that termination pay should be included in the final calculation of their benefits.by termination pay,they are referring to the cash payments made to plan members upon retirement for accrued but unused compensatory time,sick leave time,and vacation or holiday time.id.at,d.we rejected the members argument that there was no significant difference between annual cash payments,which ventura held to be included in pension computations,and termination payments.ibid.we agreed with the trial court that where an employee can not or does not elect to receive cash in lieu of the accrued time off prior to retirement,the benefit remains one of time rather than cash.the right to a termination pay arises only upon retirement,that is separated from service the right does not arise prior to retirement or during service.in re retirement cases,at,d,fn.omitted.
respondents also point to the discussion of vacation pay in suastez plastic cal d,in which the supreme court recognized v acation pay is not a gratuity or gift,but is,in effect,additional wages for services performed.id.at.
it thus appears that the meaning of the term regular compensation,in the context of the analyses of ventura and in re retirement cases,would include the regular salary or wages ventura,supra,cal th at,d,that the employee receives when taking sick leave or vacation during the period of employment however,termination pay consisting of cash payments made to plan members upon retirement for accrued but unused compensatory time,sick leave time,and vacation or holiday time in re retirement cases,supra,th at,d would not constitute regular compensation.
appellant used her sick leave and vacation 
in this regard,it becomes important to determine the character of the payments made to appellant in december,and again in october.the parties views of what happened on those two occasions differ markedly.
respondents contend that on those two occasions,appellant was on the payroll as an employee and was using her accrued sick leave in december and accrued sick leave and vacation time in october.consequently,respondents contend the pay appellant received on those occasions was regular compensation as recognized in ventura,supra,cal th at page,d,an employee taking annual leave during employment simply continues to receive regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services.receipt of that pay is part of the employee remuneration for past services and is compensation.appellant views the money she received on those two occasions as in the nature of the lump sum payout provided in sections and of the mou governing the terms and conditions of her employment and guaranteeing her the full value of her unused sick leave in a lump sum because of her disability.respondents characterization of these payments is consistent with the record here appellant is not.moreover,to the extent the question requires a factual determination,we defer to the trial court and to the board.
the trial court specifically found that appellant requested and received the payment of accrued sick leave on or about october,and at that time was placed back in pay status appellant does not dispute that the money she was paid in december and october was for sick leave and vacation she accrued before she stopped working in june.although appellant likens the payments to the lump sum payments of accrued sick leave and vacation pay the mou allows a member retired for disability to take upon retirement,the december payment was not a complete lump sum or of her sick leave.had it been so,she would not have been able to use sick leave she had accrued while actually working to return to in pay status in october for purposes of reinstating her health insurance.appellant argues that the distinction between a lump sum termination payment,and being returned to in pay status to allow her to use her sick leave,is a distinction without a difference.we believe this distinction makes real difference here and that it is important to determine whether appellant received regular pay when she used her sick leave before her retirement or,having retired,was provided termination pay pursuant to the mou.the record supports the trial court determination that appellant was in pay status for the periods during which appellant received the sick leave payments.
appellant points out that she was returned to the county payroll on october,but that she did not request to do so until after october.appellant argues that this was a flaw in respondents argument,but does not assert such retroactive action was improper,nor does she provide any authority that such action was inconsistent with respondents assertion that appellant received regular pay during this period.certainly,it does not undermine respondents assertion that she was on payroll when she used sick leave in december.
other statutes 
in trying to ascertain legislative intent,we may look to similar laws that employ the same language.balasubramanian san diego community college dist.th,d we must construe identical words in different parts of the same act or in different statutes relating to the same subject matter as having the same meaning.citation.in re bittaker th,d.respondents look to the phrase regular compensation in other statutes,not part of cerl,to support their argument that one may receive regular compensation without actually working.
respondents point first to code of civil procedure section regarding jury service,and to government code section regarding employee leave credit donations.code of civil procedure section provides that a public employee may not be paid juror fees if he or she receives regular compensation and benefits from his or her employer while performing jury service.respondents contend that the employee is not actually working in his or her employment capacity when he or she is performing jury service,yet the employee is receiving regular compensation from the public employer.similarly,government code section provides that state employees may donate leave credits to fellow employees who suffer a catastrophic injury.however,the amount of credits may not exceed an amount sufficient to ensure the continuance of regular compensation,subd.e.the state employee is out on sick leave donated by fellow employees,but is receiving regular compensation from the employer.respondents also refer to california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b,providing that certain state university employees who serve an extra quarter without compensation shall be entitled to a compensatory quarter off at a later date with regular compensation and benefits applicable at that time.respondents assert that in these situations the employee is not providing services to the employer,but the compensation the employee is earning is described as regular compensation.
appellant counters that jury service is fairly construed as a regular duty of a public employee when regular compensation is paid while performing that duty and that inclusion of the word benefits indicates that sick leave and vacation are included as benefits received in addition to the employee regular compensation during this service.we disagree.while jury service may be a duty of citizens,it is not a regular one.moreover,respondents point is that the statute describes an employee as receiving regular compensation from the employer,although not actually working in his or her employment capacity.
appellant also argues that use of the phrase regular compensation in government code section is not inconsistent with appellant understanding of section,because the phrase refers to the value received by public employees and not the compensation they earn while performing regular duties.we fail to see the distinction.fellow employees donate leave credits to allow the recipient employee to continue to receive regular compensation and the donated sums may not exceed the amount necessary to assure the continuance of that regular compensation 
policy considerations 
appellant and respondents both make policy arguments in support of their differing constructions of the statute.
appellant contends the intent of cerl is to allow disabled employees to be replaced without inflicting a hardship upon the employees removed,and the purpose of section is to assure that employees receive payment of disability benefits for the entire period of disability,including the full value of their accrued sick leave.see weber board of retirement th,d.she reminds us that pension legislation must be liberally construed and applied to the end that the beneficent results of such legislation may be achieved citations.bowen board of retirement cal d,see puckett,supra,d at.
nevertheless,the determination whether sick leave is included as part of regular compensation is a question of law.here it is in appellant interest to exclude sick leave from the definition of regular compensation.it may be that there are circumstances in which such interpretation is adverse to the interests of the member.the interpretation of the statute should not vary by the particular circumstance of the disability retirement applicant.
respondents argue that defining regular compensation to include sick leave and vacation serves the important policies of avoiding by the retiree and establishing a bright line test rather than fostering confusion.they point out that there is a strong public policy against pension payments that into taxpayer funds.see city of los angeles industrial acc.com.cal d,puckett,supra,d at.moreover,t he rule that pension laws should be construed to carry out their beneficent purposes is not designed to encourage a construction which would cause an employer to become doubly liable for the same disability.city of workmen.bd.engler d.respondents argue that the legislature must have intended wages received for vacation and sick leave to be included in regular compensation,because t his is the only interpretation that carries out the l egislature intent of avoiding without creating confusion and unfairness in the administration of the system.they assert that appellant interpretation of regular compensation as compensation received for actually working could result in large employee windfalls,although they acknowledge appellant has received wages for only to hours of service during the period for which she seeks retirement benefits.under that scenario,an employee could stop working for the county,apply for disability retirement and then run out weeks of vacation time,sick leave,and compensatory time,receiving regular wages for many weeks or months.when granted a disability retirement,the employee would be entitled to a retirement allowance from the date of application or sooner under the last paragraph of section even though the employee had received large amounts of compensation from the county during the same period.
respondents further argue that inequity will result if regular compensation is limited to compensation received for actually working,because employees who do not attempt to return to work following their disability will be treated more favorably than those who unsuccessfully attempt to return to work.respondents posit that under appellant interpretation an employee who unsuccessfully tries to return to work several months after being injured,but who can work only a few days,would be denied retroactive benefits,because he or she received salary or wages for that trial period.in contrast,a person making no attempt to return to work,but using sick leave after several months,would receive benefits retroactive to the last day of actual work.in appellant case,she would receive a retirement allowance retroactive to june,her last day of actual work assuming the delay in filing her application is determined to be due to an inability to ascertain permanency.however,if she had actually tried to return to work for two weeks in december,she would not be entitled to a retirement allowance before that date.a primary purpose of a pension program is to encourage continued public service.citation.puckett,supra,d.adoption of appellant interpretation of the statute would treat the employee who tried to return to work some time after disability less favorably than the employee who does not make the attempt,but used sick leave for the same time period.
such a consideration influenced the determination of the court in puckett,supra,d.there,the court determined that regular compensation in section did not include the disabled member compensation in another,lower paying position to which he was assigned while waiting for the board to act upon his disability retirement application from his fire apparatus engineer position.puckett argued that the term regular compensation referred to his compensation at the position from which he was retiring.his regular compensation was thus discontinued when he retired from his position as a fire apparatus engineer.id.at.the board had concluded that puckett could not receive disability retirement while working in any paid capacity for the county.ibid.consequently,the board contended that regular compensation meant regular,ordinary compensation for services rendered as an employee,as opposed to sick leave or workers compensation benefits,or similar benefit payments which are made in lieu of salary when an employee is unable to work.ibid.therefore,the board argued puckett salary at the lower position was regular compensation within the meaning of the statute.the appellate court began with the precept that pension statutes are to be liberally construed in an applicant favor to effectuate the purpose of providing benefits to an employee and his family.citation.citation.id.at.it therefore resolved the ambiguity in the statute in puckett favor,explaining that to do otherwise would penalize him for accepting an alternate county job in order to sustain himself during the period of over a year that his application was pending.the court resolution of the ambiguity in favor of the employee also recognized the primary purpose of the law as encouraging continued public service and removing a motivation for county employees to terminate their county employment immediately upon filing a disability application.ibid.puckett also resolved the problem of resulting from the trial court ruling that puckett was entitled to full disability retirement payments on top of his compensation at the second job.the appellate court held that puckett should receive no more than an employee who continues in alternate county employment pursuant to government code section,the difference between his compensation at his second county job and the higher salary at his former position.id.at.
the puckett court found authority for an offset in section,which allows alternate county employment in lieu of disability retirement,and in such cases allows the county to pay the member the difference in such compensation until the compensation of the new position equals or exceeds the compensation of the former position,but not exceeding the amount to which the employee would otherwise be entitled to receive as a disability retirement allowance.respondents assert that unlike the situation in puckett,there is no authority in cerl for a county retirement system to set an early retirement date and then offset the retirement allowance by an amount equal to any compensation received from the county after that date.
appellant challenges respondents policy concerns as myths.she argues that she had earned the sick leave and vacation she received before she stopped working and that under the mou,she was entitled to receive payment of the full value of these items of compensation upon retirement for disability,whether or not her retirement was made retroactive.consequently,she contends that to the extent she has already received wages for the period of her sick leave she was entitled to receive virtually the same payments anyway as a lump sum termination payment under the mou.appellant points out the legislative history of section confirms that the purpose of the amendment to that section was to allow members the option of using accrued sick leave before retiring in an attempt to protect employees who,unlike appellant,work in counties that do not make a lump sum payment of accrued sick leave upon retirement.the legislative intent,appellant asserts,was not to prevent,but to assure that employees obtain the full value of their accrued sick leave.
appellant also challenges respondents equity argument,asserting that the unfairness is hypothetical and that respondents interpretation of regular compensation to include sick leave and vacation results in denial of retroactive benefits to both groups of who unsuccessfully try to return to work and those who use sick leave.she contends that respondents do not explain how denial of retroactivity to both groups of employees would encourage
