the department of transportation dot removed jones from his position as a criminal investigator in the dot office of the assistant inspector general for investigations.the removal charge was for physical inability to perform the functions of his position.at the time he was removed,jones was permanently unable to perform his position due to a severe physical incapacity,but jones had a positive balance of leave voluntarily transferred to him from other federal employees.specifically,jones received approximately seven years of donated leave.at the time it removed jones,the dot had approved his use of nearly five years of the donated leave,allowing jones to retain his employee status from his incapacity in through.jones appealed his removal to the merit systems protection board the board,conceding that the elements of the removal charge were met,but arguing that he had an affirmative defense the agency could not remove him as long as he had a positive transferred leave balance.notwithstanding this alleged defense,the board upheld the dot action.jones dep t of,no,opinion of administrative judge aj initial decision,recons.denied,no.at mspb may,opinion of full board denying reconsideration,resulting in the aj decision becoming the final board decision final decision.jones then appealed the board decision to this court,raising on appeal only the issue of whether his affirmative defense prohibits the agency from terminating him.we conclude that the voluntary leave transfer program the program,see,does not prohibit the removal of an employee,even if an employing agency has approved an employee participation in the program and the employee has a positive transferred leave balance.therefore,the board did not abuse its discretion or otherwise act contrary to law in upholding the dot action of terminating jones employment,and,accordingly,we affirm.
background 
jones appeal involves examining first,the legal attributes of the program,second,the circumstances surrounding jones physical incapacity and his use of the program,and,third,the board decision reviewing the dot removal of jones.
a.the voluntary leave transfer program 
pursuant to the authority congress granted to the office of personnel management opm via the federal employees leave sharing act of felsa,opm created the program to serve as a means by which a federal employee can transfer certain unused portions of his or her accrued annual leave to the leave account of an employee experiencing a medical emergency.
the statute defines the term medical emergency as follows 
a medical condition of an employee or a family member of such employee that is likely to require the prolonged absence of such employee from duty and to result in a substantial loss of income to such employee because of the unavailability of paid leave disregarding any advanced leave.
the statute also specifies the conditions under which a medical emergency no longer exists 
the medical emergency affecting a leave recipient shall be considered to have terminated on the date as of which 
the leave recipient notifies the employing agency of such leave recipient,in writing,that the medical emergency no longer exists 
the employing agency of such leave recipient determines,after written notice and opportunity for the leave recipient or,if appropriate,another person acting on behalf of the leave recipient to answer orally or in writing,that the medical emergency no longer exists or 
the leave recipient is separated from service.
when requesting participation in the program,an employee includes in the application information the anticipated duration of the medical emergency,and,if it is a recurring one,the approximate frequency of the medical emergency involved.id.a b ii.a participant in the program may use donated leave in the same manner and for the same purposes as if such leave were accrued by the employee as regular earned annual leave.id.b,specifying accrual authority and rates for earned annual leave see also id.d noting that annual leave may be granted at any time during the year as the head of the agency concerned may prescribe.finally,a program participant may not use donated leave after the medical emergency terminates if the participant does not use the donated leave,the leave must be restored on a basis back to the original donors.id.b.
b.jones incapacity and participation in the program 
jones was employed by the dot as a criminal investigator when he suffered an incapacitating,brain aneurysm on may,while attending a memorial day picnic.this left jones permanently unable to perform the physical duties of a criminal investigator.
after becoming incapacitated,jones applied on october,to receive leave donations from other federal employees through the program later that year,on november,the dot office of inspector general oig notified jones of its approval of his application to receive donations of annual leave through the program.
over the next few months the federal employee community,in particular the federal law enforcement employee community,responded generously and donated,in aggregate,a substantial amount of leave to jones.by a letter dated april,the notified jones that as of march,employees from various federal departments and agencies had donated hours,or about seven years worth of,to jones transferred leave account through the program this generous response from the federal employee community necessitated additional action by and jones to determine how to proceed.
feedback from the gao and opm 
given the aggregate quantity of donated leave,in a letter dated march,the requested input from the comptroller general of the general accounting office gao.the noted that jones spouse had advised the on february,that jones was completely paralyzed on his right side and had only recently spoken his first word in nine months.the stated that it had approved participation in the leave donation program based on the medical certification provided by jones,which cited significant improvement and the need to provide the employee with as much opportunity as possible to recover.in addition,the dot noted that jones and his spouse now had an expectation that jones would stay on leave status up to the date of his retirement eligibility and beyond.the further documented for the gao that jones was currently unable to perform his duties and that permitting jones to remain on leave status for several years would create a hardship for the office where jones had worked.the sought input from the gao as to whether the program allowed or prohibited leave status supported by donated leave,whether any limits on donated leave existed,and what actions could take under the statutory and regulatory provisions defining a medical emergency.
the gao rendered an opinion to,dated july,but,recognizing that opm had primary statutory and regulatory authority for the program,also forwarded a copy of the request to the opm.the opm responded separately to the request for guidance.both the gao and the opm agreed that i the statute and implementing regulations did not limit the amount of leave that may be donated to an employee but that ii employing agencies have discretion to approve or disapprove both an employee participation in the program and have discretion to approve or deny an employee requests to use donated leave after the employee has been approved as a leave recipient.
decision to keep jones in the program until he qualified for full retirement 
from january through may,requested an additional medical evaluation of jones and preliminarily determined to terminate jones participation in the program effective june.suggested to jones that he apply for disability retirement after his participation in the program terminated.however,in june,reconsidered its approach to the situation and committed to keep jones in the program for several more years 
by letter dated june,the assure d jones that he would remain in his leave status until and unless the gao comptroller general advises that we have no discretion to continue him in the program.there is no indication that the gao comptroller general ever so advised.however,the qualified its position as it only committed to keep jones in the program so long as his medical emergency continues or until he is first eligible for full law enforcement retirement benefits which understand s to be october.
removal of jones 
by letter to jones dated november,the proposed to remove jones from his position due to his physical inability to perform his job.enclosed with the letter were separate applications for a disability retirement and for a full law enforcement retirement.jones had become eligible for the latter on october.
counsel for jones responded to the proposal by letter dated january.jones contended,as he does on appeal,that under applicable law the dot was without authority to terminate his employment so long as he had a balance of donated annual leave in his leave account.apparently in response to an opm request,counsel for jones sent another letter,dated february,in further support of this contention.
by letter to jones dated february,dot issued a final decision removing him from his position,to take effect february.however,dot subsequently offered to keep jones in paid leave status through march,if he filed for retirement as of that date and prior to the effective date of his removal.jones chose not to do so but remained in paid leave status until he was removed from his position on february.jones timely appealed his removal to the board.
c.the board decision to uphold the dot removal of jones 
the aj noted that an agency must establish three elements before it can take an adverse action against an employee,such as its removal of jones for physical inability to perform the functions of his position.initial decision at.it must prove i that the charged conduct occurred,ii a nexus with the efficiency of the service,and iii that the penalty imposed was reasonable.id.jones stipulated that these three elements were met,but raised an affirmative the dot was precluded by law from removing him because he had over two years of donated leave yet to be used.id.at.
jones argued before the aj that although an agency has discretion to approve or disapprove of an employee receipt of leave donations,the agency could not,after approving an employee participation in the program,terminate an employee while he or she had a positive balance of leave donations received.initial decision at.the aj rejected this argument,reasoning that the case upon which jones relied in making his argument,joyner dep t of the navy,did not distinguish between approval to enter the program and approval of the subsequent use of donated leave,but instead only recognized an agency discretion to decide whether to approve leave usage.initial decision at.
the aj went on to hold that because the granting of annual leave is normally within the discretion of the employing agency,see d,and because the fesla establishes that an employee may use donated leave in the same manner as annual leave,see id.b,an agency has the same discretion over whether to approve donated leave use as it does over annual leave use.initial decision at citing additional support in the preamble to the final rule on the program.the aj thus found nothing in the law which divests an agency of the authority to remove an employee simply because they were in the program,and accordingly upheld the dot removal of jones.id.at.
jones petitioned the board to reconsider the aj decision.final decision at.the board concluded that the petition presented no new,previously unavailable evidence,and that the aj had made no error of law or regulation that would affect the outcome of jones appeal.see.the board therefore denied the petition for review,thereby rending the aj decision final.final decision at.jones appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.

iii.discussion 
because it is supported by both the language and the legislative history of the statute under which the program was established,the board interpretation of the program statute was not in error and its resolution of jones case was not arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise in error.
it is undisputed that jones suffered a medical emergency within the meaning of.the only issue before this court is whether the board properly rejected jones argument that some interpretation of some provision within completely prohibited the dot from removing him from his position before he had exhausted the leave transferred to him under the program.to consider jones argument,we must construe the program statute.
construction of the statute establishing the program 
it is axiomatic that statutory construction begins with the language of the statute itself.see miller dep t of the army.if the language is clear on its face,there is usually no need to resort to the legislative history underlying the statute.reid dep t of commerce.all statutes must be construed in the light of their purpose.haggar helvering.to discern congress intent we examine the explicit statutory language and the structure and purpose of the statute.mcclendon,d.thus,we must find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and with the general purposes that congress manifested.nlrb lion oil,d.w e look not only to the particular statutory language,but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.crandon united states,d.
within the provisions implementing the program,we are primarily concerned with i,the definition of the term medical emergency ii,specifying the conditions under which a program participant may receive and use donated leave and iii a,specifying how a medical emergency terminates.before turning to each section,we note that we find no text in that directly supports jones argument.his assertions before the board and on appeal are based on inferences he contends arise from the three provisions to which we turn.
the definition of medical emergency in 
jones argues that because a medical emergency is defined as a medical condition likely to require the prolonged absence of an employee,the use of the word prolonged signals congress intent that under any condition an employee should be able to use all donated leave before being removed.emphasis added.we do not view the word prolonged as carrying such import.even if we were to credit jones asserted inference,another structural aspect of the definition of medical emergency refutes jones assertion.the definition specifies that the medical condition can be of an employee or family member of such employee.id.emphasis added.the program allows an employee to take leave when a family member has the medical condition,but the employee is healthy.if such an employee was on leave because a family member had a medical condition,but was validly removed by the employing agency during such time,nothing in the program statute prohibits removal of the employee.
while jones roots his arguments in certain provisions of the program statute,in part he paints a picture of alleged unfairness if the law allows an employee experiencing a medical emergency to receive donated leave yet does not allow such employee to take advantage of all of the donated leave.certainly the tragedy in jones situation called forth a strong response and desire to help,as evidenced by the generous leave donations.however,the example of an employee who is on leave,but not herself experiencing the medical condition,and who is otherwise validly removed by the employing agency,serves to show that jones legal proposition can not be true in all cases as he asserts.further,jones does not challenge,and therefore the issue is not before us,whether the dot acted reasonably in dealing with jones.however,it would be difficult to argue that the dot was completely unreasonable when it approved jones use of nearly five years of the seven years of donated leave.
our construction of the statutory term medical emergency is consistent with the legislative history of the felsa because it is clear from that history that congress intended the program to be a stopgap measure to help an employee until she is able to take advantage of disability retirement.see,at hereinafter senate report,reprinted in,a medical emergency affecting a leave recipient shall be considered to have terminated when the employment of the leave recipient terminates.
prior to the creation of the program,any seriously ill federal employee who had exhausted his or her annual and sick leave,and any advanced leave granted by the employing agency,had essentially three choices to request leave without pay,to resign his or her position,or to take a disability retirement,if eligible to do so.senate report at at.choosing between such limited options had the potential to be difficult or even devastating.at.similarly situated employees in the private sector might be covered by disability insurance,which typically replaced between fifty and seventy percent of an employee lost earnings for a period of up to weeks.at.leave sharing programs were first established in state and local governments to rectify the absence of a similar option for government employees.at.it was to such models that congress looked when fashioning the precepts of the program.see at.
thus,similarly,the purpose of the program was to close a gap in the federal worker current disability insurance coverage for personal medical emergencies.it also can be used to allow employees to attend to seriously or terminally ill spouses and dependents.see id.at at.and while the felsa defines a medical emergency as a medical condition likely to require the prolonged absence of such employee from duty,the program was not meant to be a substitute for disability retirement.id.at at emphasis added.
in sum,jones arguments based on his asserted definition of the term medical emergency do not support his legal assertion that the dot was prohibited from removing him from his position before he had exhausted the leave donated to him under the program.
the conditions under which a program participant may receive and use donated leave 
jones argues that c supports his proposition because it states first that donated leave may accumulate without regard to any limitation imposed on the accrual of annual earned leave,c emphasis added,and,second,may be substituted retroactively for any period of leave without pay,id.c emphasis added.we disagree with jones argument.in both clauses,the word any simply means that there is no limit on the donated leave an employee can accumulate for potential use upon the employing agency approval.thus,we agree with the aj interpretation and with the interpretation offered to by opm and the gao while leave can accumulate without limit,the employing agency still has discretion to approve or disapprove use of such accumulated leave under the same parameters and law governing an employee use of annual earned leave.section b explicitly provides as such.
under b,an employee may use donated leave in the same manner and for the same purposes as accrued annual leave.b.this indicates a clear intent by congress that while an employee is on medical emergency status,use of accumulated donated leave is still subject to whatever agency approval s are required for use of annual earned leave and for use of leave generally.see,campana dep t of the navy,holding that the authorization of leave without pay is generally a matter of administrative discretion,but that denial of leave without pay must be reasonable under the circumstances.
a specifying how a medical emergency terminates 
under the last statutory provision bearing on the issue,jones argues that a becomes nonsensical under the aj interpretation of a.the aj concluded that a signals congress intent to allow for separation of the employee from the service of the employing agency regardless of the status of the medical emergency.jones argues that if an agency is allowed to terminate an employee before the employee has used all of its leave,this writes subsections a out of a.again,we disagree with jones argument because the plain language of the phrase is separated from service in a refers to either voluntary or involuntary separation.moreover,interpreting a to include involuntary separation still leaves a role for a in the statutory scheme.the medical condition underlying the medical emergency may diminish or end before either voluntary or involuntary removal,necessitating use of either subsection to notify the respective employee and employing agency that the medical emergency is over.
application of our interpretation to jones situation 
reviewing the facts of the instant case,we note first that the dot allowed jones to remain on paid leave from the onset of his medical emergency in may until his removal in february span of close to five years.again,while the reasonableness of the dot actions are not before us,this response by the dot seems obliging to jones in light of the senate report suggestion that agencies should encourage employees to apply for disability retirement if circumstances warrant it.id.at at.
jones argues that the aj interpretation,that separated from service in a allows for voluntary or involuntary separation,is contrary to interpretations rendered by opm and the gao.jones correctly points out that a interpretation given a statute by the agency charged with administering it should be deferred to unless it is unreasonable.money office of pers,see also chevron,natural res.def.council,d if the statute being interpreted is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.however,neither the opm,the gao,or the dot for that matter,have adopted an interpretation of a dissonant from that adopted by the aj,the board,and now this court.the opposite is in fact true both opm and the gao interpretation precisely track the aj interpretation.
furthermore,contrary to jones assertions,opm opinion letters to dot regarding jones case made only four essential points and did not opine that the dot was without discretion to remove jones.first,opm noted that the statute does not limit the amount of leave that could be transferred to jones under the program.second,opm stated that the facts here did not warrant an disability retirement.third,opm reasoned that leave transferred to jones could not be used toward full retirement eligibility if he were to retire before such rights vested under the applicable regulations.fourth,opm opined that agencies have discretion both to approve or deny an employee application to participate in the program and to approve or deny requests to use transferred leave.opm never opined that dot was forbidden from removing jones from his position before he had exhausted the leave transferred to him under the program.opm has thus made no interpretation of the provisions in the statute at issue to be given deference over the board interpretation of it 
also undercutting jones argument is the fact that the language of a is paralleled in the regulations opm promulgated to administer the program.see a the medical emergency affecting a leave recipient shall terminate when the leave recipient federal service is terminated.another regulation also supports the proper interpretation,specifying that the approval and use of transferred annual leave is subject to the conditions and requirements imposed for annual earned leave.id.c emphasis added.
in his reply brief,jones implicitly acknowledges the fourth main point in opm opinion letters approval for the use of donated leave takes place via a process.the first step is the agency approval or disapproval of the employee participation in the program.see
