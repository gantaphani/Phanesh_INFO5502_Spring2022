dale buchanan represented five individuals in successful claims for back benefits before the commissioner of social security.when he sought approval of the attorney fees specified in the contracts with his clients,however,the commissioner determined that buchanan was limited to receiving sums equal to exactly percent of the claimants back benefits,rather than the alternate minimum fees agreed upon with his clients.buchanan challenged,on statutory and constitutional grounds,the method used by the commissioner to determine those fees,arguing that the commissioner was improperly placing a flat cap on fee awards.the district court concluded that it had no jurisdiction to review buchanan claims.for the reasons set forth below,we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
background 
three of the five clients in question christine anderson,samuel hall,and wanda roach entered into contingency fee contracts with buchanan regarding their claims for supplemental security income ssi and disability insurance benefits.under these contracts,buchanan was to receive either percent of the claimants back benefits or,whichever was greater,contingent on receiving favorable disability determinations from the social security administration ssa.he was to receive no fee if the claims were denied.
all three cases were successful,and the claimants were awarded the benefits that they sought,including back benefits.because percent of the back benefits in each case was less than,buchanan subsequently submitted fee petitions to the commissioner to request approval of the in legal fees.the commissioner denied these petitions.instead,the commissioner reduced the authorized fees to sums equal to exactly percent of the claimants back benefits.when buchanan appealed the fee reductions,the regional chief administrative law judge alj affirmed the commissioner decisions.
the other two clients marjorie collins and jean skelf were also represented by buchanan before the commissioner.both clients had signed contingency fee contracts similar to those described above,with collins agreeing to a minimum fee of and skelf to a minimum fee of.these two cases,like the others,were successful,but buchanan fees were again limited to exactly percent of the claimants back benefits.
before the administrative appeals on the fee awards for the collins and skelf cases were finalized,buchanan sued the commissioner in the district court concerning all five awards.the alj amended the attorney fees awarded for the collins and skelf cases after buchanan filed his complaint.these amended fee awards were slightly higher than the initial percent figures,but still well below the amounts specified in buchanan contracts.in fact,even after the alj adjustments,buchanan effective hourly rate in the five cases ranged from a low of per hour to a high of per hour.
buchanan then sought judicial review of the determinations.he challenged,on statutory and constitutional grounds,the method used by the commissioner to determine those fees.the crux of his complaint was that the commissioner was limiting all awards to exactly percent of the back pay awarded to the claimants,and that this flat limitation constituted a denial of due process of law,as well as a violation of the applicable federal statute and ssa regulations.buchanan pointed out that there is no fixed limit on the fee that an attorney may charge under a,and that ssa regulation b and disability insurance regulation b require the commissioner to weigh certain specified factors in calculating awards.these factors include the complexity of the case,the amount of time the attorney spent on the case,and the fee amount agreed upon between the attorney and the client.buchanan also addressed the fee awards for collins and skelf,arguing that the alj changed the fee awards in these two cases by only a token amount in response to his initial complaint.
on february,the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation,concluding that although the district court had no jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of the attorney fees,it did have jurisdiction to hear buchanan statutory and constitutional claims concerning the commissioner method of determining those fees.the magistrate judge also concluded that the district court had jurisdiction over this case under the federal mandamus statute.
these conclusions,however,were rejected by the district court,which granted the commissioner motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.see buchanan apfel,d.the district court specifically held that buchanan had failed to present a constitutional claim because he was not entitled to anything more than the fees determined to be reasonable by the commissioner.alternatively,the court held that even if buchanan had presented a colorable constitutional challenge,the applicable federal statute precluded judicial review of attorney fees awarded by the commissioner for work completed at the administrative level.finally,the district court held that mandamus jurisdiction was not available to buchanan because the commissioner had no clear,nondiscretionary duty to weigh certain factors before arriving at the fee awards.
buchanan motion to reconsider and amend the judgment,filed pursuant to rule e of the federal rules of civil procedure,was denied on november.he timely filed his notice of appeal,challenging the district court determination that it had no jurisdiction over his claim.
