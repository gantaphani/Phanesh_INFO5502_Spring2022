background 
appellant was born in march.in,at the age of,he became a client of the westside regional center wrc.because wrc could not find a placement for him among its available facilities,it placed appellant out of state in a special education school in texas.during appellant placement,his regional center file was inactivated.
while in texas,appellant sought to reactivate his file.wrc reassessed him in december,and in january,an interdisciplinary team determined that he was ineligible for regional center services.appellant did not appeal that decision but instead submitted additional information to wrc in november.in december,wrc again found him ineligible.
appellant appealed the december decision finding him ineligible for regional center services and was granted an evidentiary hearing.in a march written decision of the office of administrative hearings,an administrative law judge alj made detailed factual findings regarding appellant condition.the alj found that appellant was not autistic or mentally retarded,and that he did not suffer from cerebral palsy or a seizure disorder.the alj further found that shortly after a head injury appellant sustained in february,appellant began exhibiting provocative,schizophrenic,oppositional,and destructive behaviors,including acts of violence towards family and others,property destruction,verbal threats,and attempted suicide,paranoia,depression,lethargy,disorientation,and olfactory hallucinations.the alj determined that appellant condition was not similar to or closely related to mental retardation and did not require treatment similar to that required by persons with mental retardation the evidence,under careful review,describes claimant difficulties as behavioral and impulse control.he requires a highly structured residential brain injury rehabilitation treatment.this is not similar to treatment provided to individuals with mental retardation.
appellant filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus,seeking to overturn the alj march decision finding him ineligible for regional center benefits.in a statement of decision and judgment entered on january,the superior court found that the weight of the evidence supported the alj findings,including the finding that appellant did not have an eligible condition for regional center services.appellant did not appeal the january judgment.
administrative decision 
appellant did nothing further until early,when he again applied for regional center benefits.after an informal hearing,wrc denied benefits to appellant.appellant again appealed the denial of benefits.a evidentiary hearing was held between september,and may.during the course of the hearing,the alj continued the matter in order to allow wrc to have appellant tested for temporal lobe epilepsy at ucla.the testing resulted in a diagnosis of epilepsy however,the alj found that the results failed to establish that appellant suffered from a substantially handicapping seizure disorder before he reached the age of.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the alj found that appellant petition was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the alj also found,based on the additional evidence presented at the hearing,that appellant factually did not qualify for regional center services even if the doctrine of res judicata had not served as a complete bar to this action,claimant still would not have sustained his burden of proof with respect to eligibility for regional center services.based on the evidence reviewed by the alj in the proceeding,claimant failed to meet the eligibility requirements.his experts opinions and reports in the instant matter only served as cumulative evidence and,if anything,were less credible than they would otherwise have been,had the experts testing been performed at the time claimant was under the age of,and therefore within the chronological window for eligibility.appellant claim for benefits was again denied on july.appellant did not appeal the alj decision.
on september,appellant again applied for regional center benefits,this time with the north los angeles county regional center nlacrc.nlacrc denied his application,and appellant requested administrative review of the nlacrc decision.
nlacrc moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that appellant eligibility for regional center services had already been litigated in two prior proceedings and that collateral estoppel barred him from relitigating the issue.appellant opposed the motion to dismiss,arguing that the court decision in samantha effected an intervening change in the law or a doctrinal change that precluded application of collateral estoppel.appellant argued that the samantha court interpretation of the term treatment in section,subdivision a of the lanterman act constituted a doctrinal change.nlacrc in turn submitted a subsequent administrative decision,in re terry,oah terry that criticized samantha as support for its argument that samantha did not effect a change in the law or a doctrinal change that would preclude collateral estoppel.the alj ordered supplemental briefing on samantha and terry and their impact on appellant claim.
at the conclusion of the hearing,the alj issued a decision dated december,denying appellant claim for benefits as barred by the doctrine of res judicata.the alj concluded that appellant had not established that samantha effected a doctrinal change,as there was no indication that the court interpretation of the statutory language in that case had caused any shift in the legal landscape.
appellant filed a petition for writ of administrative mandamus appealing alj december decision.after hearing argument from the parties,the trial court affirmed the denial of regional center benefits on the ground that appellant claim was barred by the doctrine of res judicata.judgment was entered against appellant on august.this appeal followed.
discussion 
standard of review and general legal principles 
the instant case involves applicability of the doctrine of res judicata,as well as interpretation and application of the lanterman act,legal issues that we review de novo.jenkins county of riverside th.
with regard to issues of statutory interpretation,our analysis begins by ascertaining the legislative intent underlying the statute so that we may adopt the construction that best effectuates the purpose of the law.citation.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,hassan.we first examine the words of the statute as the best indication of legislative intent.brinker restaurant superior court cal th.those words are given their ordinary and usual meaning and are construed in their statutory context.hassan,supra,at.judicial construction that renders any part of the statute meaningless or inoperative should be avoided.ibid.
if the language of the statute is clear,it is applied without further inquiry.aleman airtouch cellular th.if the language can be interpreted to have more than one reasonable meaning,a court may consider a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.id.at.
ii.res judicata 
overview and purpose 
the doctrine of res judicata bars relitigation of a cause of action resolved,or that could have been resolved in a prior adjudicatory proceeding.medical center douglas th.
the threshold elements for res judicata are a claim or issue raised in the present action is identical to a claim or issue litigated in a prior proceeding the prior proceeding resulted in a final judgment on the merits and the party against whom the doctrine is being asserted was a party or in privity with a party to the prior proceeding.citations.citation.boeken philip morris usa,cal th.
effect of changes in law 
res judicata does not apply when the proceeding in which the doctrine is invoked involves different substantive law than the previous proceeding.california hosp.th.the law defines the issue in the first action thus,when the current claim of issue preclusion involves different substantive law the second action does not present the same issue as the first.citations.see also huber jackson th,collateral estoppel did not bar second action after new statute enacted and new case law addressing subject powers florsheim d,collateral estoppel inapplicable when statute under which defendants were prosecuted was changed.
policy considerations 
whether res judicata applies in a given case may also depend on whether application of the doctrine is consistent with underlying public policies.lucido superior court cal d.t he public policies underlying collateral estoppel preservation of the integrity of the judicial system,promotion of judicial economy,and protection of litigants from harassment by vexatious litigation strongly influence whether its application in a particular circumstance would be fair to the parties and constitutes sound judicial policy.citation.id.at.
iii.lanterman act 
overview and purpose 
the lanterman act is a comprehensive statutory scheme to provide treatment,services,and supports for persons with developmental disabilities.the term s ervices and supports for persons with developmental disabilities is broadly defined in section,subdivision b to include diagnosis,evaluation,treatment,care,special living arrangements,physical,occupational,and speech therapy,training,education,employment,and mental health services.the lanterman act also accords persons with qualifying developmental disabilities the right to receive treatment and services at state expense.
the department of developmental services dds,a state agency,is charged with implementing the statutory scheme.the dds,in turn,contracts with private nonprofit corporations to establish and operate a network of regional centers that are responsible for determining eligibility,assessing needs,and providing services to the developmentally disabled.association for retarded citizens department of developmental services cal.
developmental disability and fifth category eligibility 
to be eligible for services and treatment under the lanterman act,a person must have a developmental disability,defined in section as a disability that originates before an individual attains years of age continues,or can be expected to continue,indefinitely and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual,subd.a.the statute identifies five categories of disabling conditions that are eligible for services intellectual disability cerebral palsy,epilepsy,autism,and disabling conditions found to be closely related to intellectual disability or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with intellectual disability,but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature.ibid.
under the fifth category of disabling conditions specified in section,subdivision a,a person may qualify for services in two ways by having a disabling condition found to be closely related to intellectual disability or mental retardation or by having a disabling condition that requires treatment similar to that required by persons with intellectual disability or mental retardation,subd.a samantha,supra,th at.courts have observed that the statutory terms closely related to and treatment similar to are general and somewhat imprecise.samantha,at mason office of admin.hearings th,mason.however w here the language of a statute fails to provide an objective standard by which conduct can be judged,the required specificity may nonetheless be provided by the common knowledge and understanding of the members of the particular vocation or profession to which the statute applies.t he lanterman act and implementing regulations clearly defer to the expertise of the dds and regional center professionals and their determination as to whether an individual is developmentally disabled.general,as well as specific guidelines are provided in the lanterman act and regulations to assist such regional center professionals in making this difficult,complex determination.citation.samantha,supra,at,quoting mason,supra,at.
to be eligible for services under section,subdivision a,a person must not only have a qualifying developmental disability,that disability must also constitute a substantial disability for that individual,subd.a.the term substantial disability is defined in subdivision l of section,which was added by a amendment to the statute.subdivision l of section defines substantial disability as the existence of significant functional limitations in three or more of the following areas of major life activity,as determined by a regional center,and as appropriate to the age of the person a self care.b receptive and expressive language.c learning.d mobility.e.f capacity for independent living.g economic.
in addition to having a condition that meets the foregoing statutory requirements,a claimant seeking fifth category eligibility under section,can not have a handicapping condition that is solely physical in nature,subd.a.implementing regulations promulgated by the dds define in greater detail the conditions that come within this exclusion.as relevant here,the california code of regulations states that t hese conditions include congenital anomalies or conditions acquired through disease,accident,or faulty development which are not associated with a neurological impairment that results in a need for treatment similar to that required for mental retardation.cal.code,tit,subd.c.
appellant contends res judicata does not bar the instant action because the amendment defining the term substantial disability in section,subdivision l and the court decision in samantha constitute changes in the law or doctrinal changes subsequent to the and the adjudications that found him ineligible for regional center services.as we discuss,neither the samantha decision nor the amendment to section bars application of res judicata in this case.
iv.samantha 
samantha involved a claimant who was born two and months premature with a hypoxic birth injury causing cognitive disabilities and adaptive functioning deficits.samantha,supra,th at.she was found ineligible for regional center services because she did not require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation id.at.the appellate court reversed,finding the claimant eligible for services under the fifth category of section,subdivision a,based on evidence that persons with mental retardation and persons with fifth category eligibility both need many of the same kinds of treatment,such as services providing help with cooking,public transportation,money management,rehabilitative and vocational training,independent living skills training,specialized teaching and skill development approaches,and supported employment services.id.at,italics added.
appellant contends the court decision in samantha constitutes a change in the law that precludes application of res judicata in this case.specifically,appellant claims the samantha court interpretation of the term treatment for purposes of fifth category eligibility determinations under section,subdivision a is a doctrinal change that makes his current eligibility determination materially different than in the prior proceedings.we disagree with appellant characterization of samantha as a doctrinal change that would preclude application of res judicata.we also conclude that the samantha court interpretation of the term treatme
