donald stacy appeals the denial of his social security benefits,contending that the alj violated the law of the case doctrine and the rule of mandate by revisiting his ability to do his past work on remand.stacy also argues the alj erred by characterizing his past work according to the least demanding aspect of his former job as a stationary engineer supervisor.we have jurisdiction under,and hold in this case of first impression that the law of the case doctrine and the rule of mandate apply to social security administrative remands from federal court in the same way they would apply to any other case.but,in this case,we hold no violation of either doctrine occurred.we also hold that the alj properly categorized stacy past work and correctly found that he was still able to perform that work as it is generally performed in the national economy.we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.
stacy originally filed for social security benefits in july.since then,his case has been reviewed by two different administrative law judges,a magistrate judge,and two district judges.stacy claims that his fatigue,gout,chest pains,heart,and vision problems rendered him disabled as of june.prior to that date,stacy worked for seventeen years as a stationary engineer for the oregon department of corrections,supervising other engineers operating the boiler room of the oregon state penitentiary in salem.
stacy application has gone through a seemingly endless cycle of appeals and remands.after stacy application for benefits was denied initially and upon reconsideration,his first hearing in front of an alj occurred in september.at that hearing,a vocational expert ve testified that stacy was a working supervisor who performed heavy work,and therefore he could not perform his past relevant work as a stationary engineer.the ve went on to testify that stacy could perform medium work,including that of a dispatcher of maintenance services and supervisor of janitorial services.the alj agreed with the ve and found stacy not disabled at step because he retained the capacity to do other work in the national economy.the appeals council denied review,and stacy sought relief in federal court.
by stipulation of the parties,the case was remanded.magistrate judge john jelderks issued the following remand order which reopened the record 
the alj will recontact plaintiff treating physicians regarding his visual acuity for the period at issue,and will further evaluate plaintiff subjective complaints.the alj will obtain additional evidence from medical and vocational experts,as needed.the alj will further evaluate and document plaintiff work activity after the alleged onset date.the alj will take any other actions necessary to develop the record and issue a new decision.plaintiff will be afforded the opportunity to submit additional evidence and argument.
on remand,a second hearing was held in front of the same alj.no ve testified.after the hearing,the alj again denied benefits,and stacy again appealed.district judge michael mosman reversed,holding that the alj omitted certain lifting restrictions from stacy residual functional capacity rfc determination,and that the ve testimony conflicted with information in the dictionary of occupational titles dot.judge mosman remanded the case for the second time with instructions to formulate a correct rfc,further evaluate step five of the disability analysis,and otherwise comply with judge jelderks remand order.
on remand,a different alj held a third evidentiary hearing where stacy and a new ve testified.stacy testified that probably to percent of his work at the department of corrections was supervisory.the alj seemed surprised by this information,noting my estimation of how quickly this can be resolved has just changed based on the claimant testimony about his supervisory functions.based on this new evidence,the alj asked the ve if stacy could perform his past relevant work.the ve replied as he performed the stationary engineer,no.as a stationary engineer supervisor,yes.the alj then denied stacy benefits at step,holding that stacy could perform his past relevant work of stationary engineer supervisor as that job is generally performed in the national economy.
stacy again appealed.the case was assigned to district judge anna brown who held that the alj step finding was correct and found that neither the law of the case doctrine nor the rule of mandate were violated.the denial of benefits was affirmed.this timely third appeal followed.
stacy first argues that the alj violated both the law of the case doctrine and the rule of mandate in the third administrative hearing by reevaluating his ability to do his past relevant work.we disagree.as a matter of first impression,we hold that both the law of the case doctrine and the rule of mandate apply in the social security context.but we also hold that neither was violated in this case.we discuss each principle in turn.
the law of the case doctrine generally prohibits a court from considering an issue that has already been decided by that same court or a higher court in the same case.hall city of los angeles,cir.the doctrine is concerned primarily with efficiency,and should not be applied when the evidence on remand is substantially different,when the controlling law has changed,or when applying the doctrine would be unjust.see merritt mackey,cir.a district court discretionary decision to apply the law of the case doctrine is reviewed for abuse of discretion.hall,at.
here,there were two prior step findings by aljs that stacy could not perform his past work.although these findings were never affirmed by the district court on review,this is typically the type of determination that should not be reconsidered under the law of the case doctrine.
but this is not the typical case.on remand,the second alj was surprised to hear new evidence that stacy mostly performed supervisory tasks in his past job.this new testimony led a ve to conclude,for the first time,that stacy could still perform the job of stationary engineer supervisor as that job is generally performed.the alj properly considered this new,highly probative testimony about stacy ability to perform his past work and made a new finding supported by that testimony.given the new evidence on remand,the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to apply the law of the case doctrine.
the rule of mandate is similar to,but broader than,the law of the case doctrine.united states cote,cir.the rule provides that any district court that has received the mandate of an appellate court can not vary or examine that mandate for any purpose other than executing it.hall,at.the district court may,however,decide anything not foreclosed by the mandate.id.but the district court commits jurisdictional error if it takes actions that contradict the mandate.see id.whether an alj has obeyed the remand order of an appellate court is a question of law that we review de novo.see sullivan hudson.
we have previously allowed district courts to reexamine any issue on remand that is not inconsistent with the mandate.see odima westin tucson hotel,cir.to illustrate,in odima we remanded with instructions to make specific findings concerning an employer reasons for not promoting the plaintiff.id.on remand,the district court did as we directed but also reevaluated and expanded upon the remedies available to the plaintiff.id.we held the district court was free to revisit the issue of remedies on remand because any issue not expressly or impliedly disposed of on appeal is available for consideration by the trial court on remand.id.quoting firth united states,cir.
given the expansive remand orders in this case,the alj did not violate the rule of mandate.judge mosman remand order did not preclude the alj from taking new evidence relevant to the step determination.while that order focused on step of the process,it also held that the alj used an incorrect rfc,a determination that is made before reaching step and which significantly affects the analysis at steps and.see evaluation of disability in general,e f.a correct rfc is necessary to understand the claimant abilit
