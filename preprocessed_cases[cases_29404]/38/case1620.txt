plaintiff united educators of san francisco,afl cio,uesf petitioned the superior court for a writ of administrative mandate on behalf of certain of its members who were employed by the san francisco unified school district district.uesf contended that these members all of whom had been provided reasonable assurance of continued employment in the fall of were improperly denied unemployment benefits during the summer of.the petition was successfully opposed below by the district.in a companion appeal,the california unemployment insurance appeals board cuiab challenges a separate ruling in favor of the district invalidating a precedent benefit decision that would have permitted public school employees to receive unemployment benefits during summer months provided certain conditions are met.we affirm the lower court as to both rulings.
factual background and procedural history 
background and administrative rulings 
the parties have stipulated to the following facts.uesf is a union that is the exclusive representative of the district certificated employees and classified paraprofessional employees.in the academic year,the district employed uesf member aryeh bernabei and others as substitute teachers who worked on an or basis the district also employed uesf member celina calvillo and others as paraprofessional classified employees paraprofessional classified employees are not paid during summer months unless they are retained for a summer session or perform special tasks,such as custodial services.each of the employees received a letter during the spring of the school year advising that they had a reasonable assurance of employment for the following school year.
the last date district schools operated during the regular session of the school year was may.the first day of instruction for the school year was august.the district operated a summer school session that began on june,and ended on july,for elementary school students and ended on july,for middle and high school students.the district did not offer any instruction between may,and june,or between july,and august.
the uesf members described above filed claims for unemployment benefits for the period of time between may,and august.the employment development department edd denied benefits to each named claimant.the claimants appealed to a cuiab administrative law judge alj who reversed the edd and held that each claimant was entitled to benefits covering all the weeks for which they had applied.
the cuiab reversed the alj decisions as to each of the claimants,either in whole or in part the cuiab held that the entire summer session was a recess period as defined in unemployment insurance code section,subdivision b,a provision that restricts public school employees eligibility for unemployment benefits if they have been given reasonable assurance of continued employment it also held,however,that if an individual claimant had been employed during the summer session,he or she had a reasonable expectation of employment during the summer session.based on this reasoning,the cuiab held that unemployment benefits could be paid to such employees for days not worked during the summer school session,but not for the days when school was not actually in session 
ii.trial court proceedings 
on september,uesf filed a first amended petition for writ of administrative mandamus against the cuiab as respondent and the district as real party in interest.uesf asserted the summer school session was an academic term under section,contending all claimants were eligible for benefits between may,and august,because the district had not provided reasonable assurance of employment for the summer session,instead providing such assurance for the academic year that started august.
on october,the district filed a seeking declaratory relief against both the cuiab and uesf.the district asserted the cuiab erroneously determined that employees who receive notices of reasonable assurance of employment for the next academic year or term are nonetheless eligible for summer unemployment benefits by virtue of either having worked during the prior summer school session,or having an availability or expectation of procuring work during the current summer session.
on december,the cuiab adopted its decision in alicia brady ontario montclair school district cuiab precedent benefit decision no.p b brady as a precedent benefit decision in brady,the cuiab held that substitute teachers who are qualified and eligible for work during a school district summer school session are not on recess for purposes of section and are eligible for unemployment benefits.
on january,the district filed a first amended in response to the brady decision.in addition to maintaining its challenge to the uesf members claims by seeking declaratory relief,the district alleged that bradywas wrongly decided and requested the trial court declare the decision invalid under section 
on august,the trial court filed its judgment denying uesf petition.the court incorporated its statement of decision into the judgment and made an express finding as follows this court finds that section means that unemployment benefits,so long as an employee has the contract or reasonable assurance required by section,are not payable to any individual with respect to any week between the end of one academic year and the beginning of the next whether that week or those weeks is called summer recess,summer vacation,summer vacation period,summer school,summer session,or anything else,whether that individual is any type of employee of any educational institution,be she or he any permanent teacher,any substitute teacher,any employee,or any other job classification covered by section,and whether or not any employee in any job classification covered by section is eligible or qualified for work,is on a list,has a reasonable expectation of work during the summer,is available for work during the summer,or worked during the prior summer.after so finding,the court reversed the cuiab decisions and remanded them with instructions to find the claimants not eligible for the unemployment benefits requested.the court also invalidated brady to the extent it is inconsistent with the court decision.that ruling is the subject of the cuiab appeal,which has been consolidated with uesf appeal.
discussion 
standard of review 
interpretation and applicability of a statute or ordinance is clearly a question of law.citation.it is the duty of an appellate court to make the final determination from the undisputed facts and the applicable principles of law.sutco construction modesto high school dist.d.here,the facts are undisputed and the issues on appeal center on the interpretation of section.we therefore apply the de novo standard.
ii.the unemployment insurance program 
california unemployment insurance program,as promulgated by the unemployment insurance code,is part of a national system of reserves designed to provide insurance for workers unemployed through no fault of their own,and to reduce involuntary unemployment and the suffering caused thereby to a minimum.citation.under the unemployment insurance code,the state participates in a cooperative unemployment insurance program with the federal government,codified as the federal unemployment tax act.american federation of labor unemployment ins.appeals bd.cal th.
as currently codified,the federal unemployment tax act futa requires that a state unemployment law must contain a provision similar to united states code section a a i which prohibits employees of educational institutions from collecting unemployment benefits between and within academic terms the futa was substantially amended by public law,which was enacted by the congress in.citation.public law amended section a of the futa to extend eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits to certain employees of state and local governments within the several states.citation.it also amended section a of the futa to include the corresponding provisions of state law to be exacted of conforming states upon review by the secretary of labor.subsection a of section a was thus amended to provide in effect that public school employees might be eligible for benefits except in certain instances involving their unemployment during periods of summer recess at the employing schools.subparagraph i of the amended subsection requires in effect that a conforming state must deny eligibility for summertime benefits to a professional school employee such as a teacher,at any grade level,if there is a contract providing for his or her reemployment in the fall or reasonable assurance of such reemployment.subparagraph ii of the amended subsection provides in effect that a conforming state may deny eligibility for summertime benefits to a nonprofessional school employee at a subcollegiate grade level if there is reasonable assurance only of his or her reemployment in the fall.russ unemployment ins.appeals bd.d,italics added russ.
the california legislature responded to the amendment to the futa by amending section in the enactment which amended section,the california legislature expressly declared that it was necessary to implement public law citation,that it was necessary to keep the unemployment compensation program of this state in conformity with the futa as amended in.consistent with this purpose,the legislature amended subdivisions a and b of the statute to incorporate the successively mandatory provisions of the first paragraph of subparagraph i of subsection a of section a of the amended futa and amended subdivision c of the statute to incorporate an optional provision authorized by subparagraph ii of the subsection russ,supra,d at.
iii.the superior court decision and ruling 
preliminarily,the appealing parties note the trial court did not render its decision in a vacuum.on october,uesf filed a request for the court to take judicial notice of a superior court ruling,san francisco unified school district california unemployment insurance appeals board super.city and county,no.cpf,rendered by judge james warren.it appears that the court granted the request for judicial notice because it explicitly declined to give the prior ruling res judicata effect.the case differs from the instant case in that the claimants in the prior case sought unemployment benefits for the period when summer school was in session only,whereas the claimants in the instant case seek benefits that would cover the entire period between the conclusion of the regular school term of and the beginning of the regular school term in.
in the case,judge warren considered whether to grant a petition for writ of mandate filed by the district against the cuiab.the cuiab had found substitute teachers eligible for unemployment insurance benefits after they were unable to obtain work during the summer school term in.in the course of denying the district petition,judge warren agreed with the cuiab that the teachers period of unemployment did not occur between two successive academic years or terms under section,subdivision b because in california,there is no gap between successive academic years.
judge warren noted the legislature did not define the academic year in section.he then observed,year,of course,has a common sense meaning of days.consistent with this common sense meaning,the legislature has defined a school year as running from july to june the legislature has stated that academic year and school year are synonymous in at least some contexts by contrast,petitioner has not identified any potentially applicable california legislation that defines academic year as something less than a year.in light of these authorities,considering the underlying purposes of the unemployment insurance code as a whole and b in particular,and giving appropriate deference to the cuiab interpretation,the court holds that the cuiab interpretation of academic year is correct.judge warren found the teachers period of unemployment did not begin between two consecutive academic terms,concluding that the district summer school session was an academic term for purposes of section because educational instruction was provided to students and at least some teachers were employed to provide that instruction 
uesf and the cuiab contend principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel make judge warren opinion binding on the district.although the doctrine of collateral estoppel and the concept of res judicata have distinct meanings see union pacific railroad santa fe pacific pipelines,th,union pacific both require a strict identity of the issues being litigated.kilroy state of california th.we note the issues in the case and the present case are not precisely identical.in the case,the question was whether the summer session constituted an academic term.in the present case,the eligibility question is broader in that it includes the weeks before and after the summer session 
uesf also contends judge warren decision is in line with the legislative public policy of protecting the unemployed.it also faults the court below for failing to account for the temporary status of substitute teachers and temporary employees,who,unlike regular,permanent and probationary certificated and classified employees,do not have tenure or contracts guaranteeing their return in the fall semester.we conclude the trial court properly declined to give judge warren ruling res judicata effect.notably,the opinion makes no reference to relevant federal law.federal law,however,is essential to understanding section because,as noted above,this statute was substantially amended in response to the futa legislation.
a prior determination is not conclusive where the issue is purely a question of law if injustice would result or if the public interest requires relitigation of the issue.arcadia unified school dist.state of education cal th.as our supreme court has explained,in city of sacramento state of california cal d,we allowed the state to relitigate the issue of whether extension of the state unemployment insurance law to include state and local governments constituted a reimbursable state mandate.we noted that the state was the losing party in the earlier litigation and that it was the only entity legally affected by the earlier judgment.thus,strict application of collateral estoppel would foreclose any reexamination of the holding of that case.the state would remain bound,and no other person would have occasion to challenge the precedent.citation.we observed,however,that when the issue is a question of law rather than of fact,the prior determination is not conclusive either if injustice would result or if the public interest requires that relitigation not be foreclosed.kopp fair pol.practices com.cal th.
applying this rule to the facts,in city of sacramento state of california,supra,cal d,the supreme court concluded t he consequences of any error transcend those which would apply to mere private parties.if the result of the earlier litigation is wrong but unimpeachable,taxpayers statewide will suffer unjustly the consequences of the state continuing obligation to fund the state mandate.on the other hand,if the state fails to appropriate the funds to meet this obligation,and the law extending unemployment insurance requirements to local governments can not be enforced citations,the resulting failure to comply with federal law could cost california employers millions.id.at pp.
similarly,here the issue to be relitigated involves public funding.an inaccurate interpretation of section might award unemployment benefits to employees who actually fall within the statute exclusion.the potential impact of an erroneous statutory interpretation extends beyond san francisco.all school districts in this state offering summer school programs are potentially affected.a correct reading of section is therefore critical to prevent the misdirection of public funds.
iv.interpretation of section 
consistent with the futa,section provides that unemployment benefits are not payable to credentialed public school personnel for any week which begins during the period between two successive academic years or terms if the individual performs services in the first of the academic years or terms and if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services for any educational institution in the second of the academic years or terms,subd.b,italics added.the companion provision applicable to nonprofessional employees is essentially identical,stating that unemployment benefits are not payable for any week which commences during a period between two successive academic years or terms if the individual performs the service in the first of the academic years or terms and there is a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform the service in the second of the academic years or terms,subd.c,italics added.
the parties dispute the meaning of academic years or terms.the trial court here concluded that the statutory language unambiguously provides that public school employees who are employed in the spring term,and have received reasonable assurance of reemployment for the following fall term,are not eligible to receive unemployment insurance benefits during the intervening summer,regardless of whether their school district offers a summer session.as we discuss below,we agree.
the principles of statutory interpretation are well settled pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.citations.where uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation.citation.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.dyna med,fair employment housing com.cal d.if the words of the statute are clear,the court should not add to or alter them to accomplish a purpose that does not appear on the face of the statute or from its legislative history.people knowles cal d.
as uesf acknowledges,the thesis of its appeal is that the summer session that was conducted by the district in june and july of constituted an academic term for purposes of section.since its members were not given reasonable assurance of employment in the summer session,the letters that they did receive were not sufficient for the purpose of denying them unemployment benefits during their unemployment in the summer.uesf maintains that none of its members were ever on summer vacation,but instead were simply unemployed and hoping to return to their jobs.it claims the cuiab took inconsistent positions in the cases,asserting the cuiab should have acknowledged that the summer session is an academic term for all employees,not merely for employees who had worked in the previous summer session.
the cuiab took a more nuanced approach,finding that if an individual was not called to work during the summers of and,the entire summer period was a normal recess period as to that individual and they were not entitled to benefits.and even if a claimant had a reasonable expectation of summer work,such as by virtue of having worked during the prior summer,he or she was not eligible for benefits during the weeks between the end of the summer session and the beginning of the fall term,which the cuiab deemed a recess period.however,the cuiab did allow benefits during summer school sessions for those teachers in whom the district had created an expectation of employment.
observing neither congress nor the legislature makes reference to summer school in the relevant statutes,uesf submits they neither intended that summer school be considered an academic term nor that summer session was not an academic term.uesf asserts it is our task to determine how summer session must be treated under the existing statutory structure.we decline this invitation the role of the courts is not to legislate or to rewrite the law,but to interpret what is before them.fair fountain valley school dist.d.in our view,neither uesf nor the cuiab positions are consistent with the language and purpose of section.
we conclude summer school is not an academic term within the meaning of section reference to academic years or terms.both uesf and the cuiab interpretations of section are contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.the cuiab asserts that because academic year is not defined in the statute,it must be given its ordinary and usual meaning.it is true that while the term school year is defined in the education code as a day period see,the school year begins on the first day of july and ends on the last day of june,there is no corresponding definition of academic year.however,ordinary meaning in this context is best derived from the education code.
as the district notes,the education code establishes a mandatory period of instruction of no fewer than days.the term academic year is used in a provision relating to the calendaring for schools the teaching sessions and vacation periods established pursuant to section shall be established without reference to the school year as defined in section.the schools and classes shall be conducted for a total of no fewer than days during the academic year,italics added.
as pointed out by amicus curaie the california school boards association education legal alliance ela,the california department of education cde the regulatory body charged with interpreting and enforcing the education code treats the traditional academic calendar to mean the period when school is regularly in session for all students,and does not include summer or summer school further,during the academic year,the legislature has provided for compulsory education laws that mandate public schools to provide instruction,and that allow certificated employees to receive credit toward permanent status.see.in contrast,historically,offering summer school has been permissive,attendance voluntary,and permanent employment status has not accrued.former.additionally,as the trial court noted in its statement of decision,when the futa was enacted,summer school sessions held between academic years were already a common feature.if congress had intended to allow for the recovery of benefits during the summer,it could have explicitly so indicated.
treating an intervening summer session as an academic term also renders the reasonable assurance language in section meaningless and inoperable.the term academic year can not reasonably be read to mean calendar year or otherwise include the summer period between mandatory academic terms.as the trial court noted,if the academic year truly ran the entire calendar year,a period between two successive academic years could never exist.because such a reading would render the phrase period between two successive academic years meaningless,it is to be disfavored.in sum,we conclude summer sessions are not academic terms and instead fall between academic years or terms under section.the trial court thus correctly ruled that none of the claimants here were eligible for benefits.
v.the majority of other jurisdictions are in accord 
other jurisdictions considering virtually identical statutory provisions have reached the same conclusion as we do here.as our courts have recognized,where state unemployment insurance codes mirror the federal law and each other,the interpretation placed on that language by federal and other courts is unusually persuasive board of education of the long beach unified school dist.unemployment ins.appeals bd.d,long beach.
in in re claim of lintz,lintz,the new york supreme court appellate division addressed our same issue the unemployment insurance board holding that because claimant chose to teach two days a week during a summer session she was not between academic terms and,therefore,eligible,is both irrational and unreasonable and thwarts
