in this case,plaintiffs challenge certain restrictions the state medicaid program places on abortion funding.the program provides medically necessary services for which federal matching funds are available.before,those services included abortions that were determined to be medically necessary.but after the united states congress passed the hyde amendment in,federal funds could no longer be used for medically necessary abortions unless the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or placed the woman in danger of death.when federal matching funds became unavailable,the state stopped funding medically necessary abortions that did not comply with the hyde amendment.plaintiffs claim that this funding restriction violates the texas constitution equal rights amendment and equal protection clause,and their constitutional right to privacy,because the state applies a higher standard of medical necessity for treatments that involve abortion than it applies to all other medical services.
we hold that the funding restrictions do not discriminate on the basis of sex and are rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose thus,they do not violate the equal rights amendment.we further hold that the restrictions violate neither the constitutional right to privacy nor the equal protection clause.accordingly,we reverse the court of appeals judgment and render judgment for the defendants.
backgrounda.statutory framework 
since,the federal government medicaid program has offered matching funds to states that provide health services to the indigent.social security amendments of,title xix,stat.now codified at.if a state implements a program that meets certain minimum standards,the federal government will contribute a percentage of the cost of providing indigent health services in the state.harris mcrae,d.a participating state may choose,at its own expense,to provide indigent health services in addition to those which the federal government reimburses,although texas has chosen not to do so.see harris,at.hum.e.all states participate in the medicaid program.
every year since,congress has adopted the hyde amendment,a rider to the federal medicaid statute that limits the availability of federal matching funds for abortions.the amendment language has changed over the years,but the version at issue in this case provides 
a none of the funds appropriated under this act,and none of the funds in any trust fund to which funds are appropriated under this act,shall be expended for any abortion.
a the limitations established in the preceding section shall not apply to an abortion 
if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest or 
in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder,physical injury,or physical illness,including a physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself,that would,as certified by a physician,place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed.
consolidated appropriations act,a enacting,stat,appendix a,tit.v.
texas has participated in medicaid since through the texas medical assistance program tmap.see medical assistance act of,ch.laws now codified at.hum.the act implementing tmap expressly provides that tmap may not authorize the provision of any service to any person under the program unless federal matching funds are available to pay the cost of the service.see id.at.laws.hum.e.as a result,the hyde amendment applies to prohibit tmap funding for abortions unless the pregnancy results from rape or incest,or places the woman in danger of death 
b.the present litigation 
three physicians and three clinics that provide abortions filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and their patients against the texas board of health,the texas department of health,and charles bell,the texas commissioner of health the state plaintiffs claim that certain medical conditions may be caused or aggravated by pregnancy,such as premature ruptured membrane,preeclampsia,eclampsia,hypertension,diabetes,congenital heart disease,renal failure,sickle cell anemia,asthma,epilepsy,and cancer.some of these conditions can not be treated while a woman is pregnant.and some of these conditions can,if the pregnancy is not terminated,cause a woman to suffer strokes,severe bleeding disorders,eye disease,heart failure,renal function deterioration,seizures,and accelerated growth of breast cancer tumors.plaintiffs claim that the state abortion funding restrictions cause indigent women to delay or forego medically necessary abortions,causing them to either risk or experience harm to their health.
plaintiffs filed this suit seeking a judgment declaring that tmap abortion funding restrictions violate indigent women right to privacy,and their rights under the equal rights amendment and equal protection clause of the texas constitution.they also sought to permanently enjoin the state from enforcing the restrictions.after stipulating that there were no disputed material fact issues,each side moved for summary judgment.the trial court granted the state motion,and plaintiffs appealed.the court of appeals reversed,holding that tmap funding restrictions violate the texas constitution equal rights amendment.the court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs,and remanded their claim for attorneys fees to the trial court for further proceedings.id.we granted the defendants petition for review to consider the plaintiffs constitutional challenges.
equal rights amendmenta.discriminatory intent 
texas passed the equal rights amendment to the texas constitution in.the equal rights amendment was designed expressly to provide protection which supplements the federal guarantees of equal treatment.texas legislative council,proposed constitutional amendments analyzed for,at.it provides that e quality under the law shall not be denied or abridged because of sex,race,color,creed,or national origin.const.art.i.plaintiffs contend that the abortion funding restrictions discriminate on the basis of sex because the state funds virtually all medically necessary services for men,while refusing to fund abortions that are medically necessary.they further maintain that the restrictions serve no compelling state interest and thus are constitutionally infirm.
in in re mclean,a plurality of this court described a process for evaluating alleged equal rights amendment violations,plurality opinion.that process is consistent with the equal rights amendment language and purposes,and the parties agree that we should apply it here.in doing so,we first decide whether equality under the law has been denied.if it has,the equal rights amendment language compels us to determine whether equality was denied because of a person membership in a protected class of sex,race,color,creed,or national origin.id.if we conclude that equality was denied because of a person membership in a protected class,the challenged action can not stand unless it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.see id.at.
in the present case,it is undisputed that the state provides virtually all medically necessary services to indigent men,yet it denies funding for abortions that are determined to be medically necessary.because the state treats indigent women seeking abortions differently from all others,the plaintiffs have established the first prong of the mclean analysis,that is,that equality under the law has been denied.the question we must decide is whether equality has been denied because of sex.the state contends that this disparity is not sex based because the funding restriction,section e of the human resources code,is facially neutral and merely prohibits funding any services that are not federally reimbursable.plaintiffs,on the other hand,look solely to the hyde amendment terms and argue that,because only women can become pregnant,funding is necessarily denied because of sex.we believe the question is not as straightforward as either party suggests.in mclean,we considered a statutory scheme that treated unmarried fathers differently from unmarried mothers.there,a biological father challenged,under the equal rights amendment,a statute that required an unmarried father who wished to exercise his parental rights over a child to either obtain the mother consent,or to establish that legitimation was in the child best interest.unmarried mothers,on the other hand,could exercise their parental rights automatically and were never subjected to such a requirement.mclean,at.because only men were required to obtain consent or satisfy the test to establish parental rights,the statute expressly created a distinction,that is,it treated fathers differently because they are male.id.
in the present case,it is true that the funding restrictions affect only women,but that is because only women can become pregnant.if the state were to deny funding of all medically necessary services,the classification might be comparable to the overt distinction in mclean.but while the tmap,through the hyde amendment,denies funding for medically necessary abortions unless certain conditions are met,it does fund all other medically necessary services.thus,to say that the state funding restriction discriminates on the basis of pregnancy,which in turn is gender based,misses the mark.the classification here is not so much directed at women as a class as it is abortion as a medical treatment,which,because it involves a potential life,has no parallel as a treatment method.see harris,at.a bortion is inherently different from other medical procedures,because no other procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life.we simply can not say that the classification is,by its terms,because of sex as it was in mclean.but that does not end our inquiry.if the tmap funding scheme is merely a pretext designed to prefer males over females in the provision of health care,then discrimination because of sex is established and the funding restrictions must withstand strict scrutiny to pass constitutional muster.see pers.adm r of feeney,d noting that discrimination that is overtly or covertly designed to prefer males over females would require an exceedingly persuasive justification.
in determining whether the tmap classification is impermissibly sex based,plaintiffs would have us examine only the hyde amendment,while the state urges us to consider only section e.but we believe the proper focus is the tmap funding scheme as a whole.that scheme is based upon the interplay between section e,a facially neutral statute,and a federal funding restriction that places indigent women seeking medically necessary abortions in a distinct class.as far as we can tell,no other state appeals court that has considered the issue had before it a statute similarly authorizing the provision of services only to the extent federal matching funds are available 
in mclean,the plurality concluded that the statute denied equal treatment because of sex because the statute,by its terms,treated men differently from women based solely on gender,but did not discuss how courts should decide the issue when the classification is not so overtly gender based and arises at least in part from a facially neutral law.while the plurality decline d to give the equal rights amendment an interpretation identical to that given state and federal due process and equal protection guarantees,mclean,at,we find helpful guidance on this particular issue in federal authorities.
under federal law,unless an action challenged on equal protection grounds explicitly creates a suspect classification,a litigant must establish that the action stems from a discriminatory purpose in order to subject the action to strict scrutiny.see hunt cromartie,d.when a federal equal protection challenge rests upon disparate impact,rather than explicit classification,the federal courts apply the analytical framework the united states supreme court first described in village of arlington heights metropolitan housing development corporation,d.see reno bossier parish sch,d noting that arlington heights set forth a framework for analyzing whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor in a government body that federal courts employ under both the equal protection clause and section of the voting rights act of.we recognize that the funding restrictions in this case impact only women,and for that reason,this is not strictly a disparate impact case.but we find the analysis provided in those cases helpful in determining whether tmap discriminates because of sex.
in arlington heights,the united states supreme court considered an challenge to a zoning decision that resulted in the exclusion of housing designed to serve minorities from the village of arlington heights.the court stated that 
official action will not be held unconstitutional solely because it results in a racially disproportionate impact.disproportionate impact is not irrelevant,but it is not the sole touchstone of an invidious racial discrimination.citation omitted.proof of racially discriminatory intent or purpose is required to show a violation of the equal protection clause.
at.according to arlington heights,determining whether the requisite discriminatory purpose exists demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.arlington heights,at.disproportionate impact is one piece of evidence.id.other factors the court identified include the historical background providing the context for the challenged action,the specific sequence of events leading up to it,departures from the normal procedural and substantive course,and legislative or administrative history.id.at.our consideration of these factors in the present case leads us to conclude that the tmap funding restrictions are not based on sex.
as we have noted,the state funds virtually all medically necessary procedures for men.likewise,except for medically necessary abortions,the state funds all medically necessary procedures for women,including those that are.obviously,the denial of funding for medically necessary abortions affects only women,at least directly but,as the pennsylvania supreme court noted in considering a challenge to similar abortion funding restrictions,
t he mere fact that only women are affected by the restriction does not necessarily mean that women are being discriminated against on the basis of sex.in this world there are certain immutable facts of life which no amount of legislation may change.as a consequence there are certain laws which necessarily will only affect one sex.
fischer dep t of pub.welfare.that the restriction affects only women might be evidence to weigh in deciding whether it is intended to discriminate against women,but it is not the sole touchstone.arlington heights,at.quoting washington davis,d.and other factors identified in arlington heights indicate that the differential treatment in this case is not because of sex.
first,the history of tmap reveals that the texas legislature intended to create a program that conformed to the federal program contours.the medical assistance act of provided 
it is the intent of the legislature to make statutory provision which will enable the state of texas to provide medical assistance on behalf of needy individuals of this state and to enable the state to obtain all benefits provided by the federal social security act as it now reads or as it may hereafter be amended,or by any other federal act now in effect or which may hereafter be enacted within the limits of funds available for such purposes 
medical assistance act of,ch.laws,emphasis added.consistent with that purpose,the act further provided that no medical services may be included for which federal matching funds are not available.laws.furthermore,our constitution has long reflected a strong interest in maximizing federal matching funds for medical assistance to the needy.see.const.art.iii,c authorizing the legislature to alter constitutional limits on spending for medical care for the indigent in order that federal matching money will be available.
section of the act is now codified as section e of the human resources code,which expressly prohibits the department from authorizing any services unless federal matching funds are available.hum.e.this provision was plainly not directed at abortion funding,as abortion was illegal in texas at the time it was enacted.see act of,ch.laws,superseded by.digest,ch,at oldham white.the record contains no evidence that the state has ever deviated from adhering to the requirement in administering its medicaid program.furthermore,it is undisputed that texas has consistently funded abortions through tmap to the extent that federal matching funds have been available.from the time that the supreme court struck down texas abortion law in roe wade,d,until congress passed the hyde amendment,tmap funded all medically necessary abortions.the historical background of the state creation and administration of tmap supports the conclusion that the funding restrictions do not discriminate because of sex.
finally,we consider the hyde amendment terms and effect.the state contends that we need look no further than the united states supreme court decision in harris mcrae,d.there,the plaintiffs contended that the hyde amendment impinged upon their fundamental right to privacy under the united states constitution by hindering indigent women ability to obtain abortions.they also claimed that the hyde amendment violated the equal protection component of the fifth amendment due process clause by restricting abortion funding while paying the costs associated with childbirth.the court rejected both arguments.in assessing the plaintiffs privacy challenge,the court differentiated between laws that place obstacles in the path of a woman exercise of her freedom,and the government obligation to remove obstacles such as poverty that it did not create,concluding that it simply does not follow that a woman freedom of choice carries with it a constitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself of the full range of protected choices.id.at.the court also determined that the hyde amendment classification is based on financial need,and a n indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases.id.at.quoting maher roe,d.applying review,the court determined that the hyde amendment restrictions were rationally related to the government interest in protecting potential life and encouraging childbirth.id.at.
while we find harris mcrae instructive,it does not control our decision for at least three reasons.first,the texas equal rights amendment,under which plaintiffs bring their challenge,has no federal constitutional counterpart.our equal rights amendment was passed many years after the equal protection and due process clauses of both the united states and texas constitutions,and it expressly prohibits gender discrimination.rules of constitutional interpretation dictate that all clauses must be given effect.mclean,at citing hanson jordan.unless the equal rights amendment grants additional protection against classifications than had been found in the federal and state constitutions at the time it was passed,the amendment was futile.id.at see also richards league of united latin am.citizens.as we have noted,the amendment legislative history indicates that it was intended to enlarge upon the federal equal protection guarantees.texas legislative council,proposed constitutional amendments analyzed for,at.it does so by elevating sex to a suspect class and subjecting classifications to heightened review.see mclean,at.
second,while the supreme court in harris mcrae determined that the hyde amendment classified based on financial need,it did not specifically consider whether the hyde amendment discriminated on the basis of sex.instead,the challenge the court considered was like the one it addressed in maher roe,where the court considered whether the constitution requires a participating state to pay for nontherapeutic abortions when it pays for childbirth.maher,at.in both decisions,the court concluded that the plaintiffs indigency did not place them in a suspect class.harris mcrae,at.t he principal impact of the hyde amendment falls on the indigent.but that fact does not itself render the funding restriction constitutionally invalid,for this court has held repeatedly that poverty,standing alone,is not a suspect classification.maher,at.an indigent woman desiring an abortion does not come within the limited category of disadvantaged classes so recognized by our cases.nor does the fact that the impact of the regulation falls upon those who can not pay lead to a different conclusion.while both decisions concluded that the hyde amendment did not violate federal equal protection guarantees,neither expressly considered a gender discrimination claim.
we note that the united states supreme court has suggested that harris mcrae established that the disfavoring of abortion is not ipso facto sex discrimination.bray alexandria women health clinic,d.this conclusion is based on the fact that the court applied a test to the alleged discrimination in harris mcrae,rather than the heightened scrutiny that classifications have invoked in other gender discrimination cases.id.but given the analysis the court employed in harris mcrae and the lack of any discussion of gender discrimination,we feel compelled to perform our own analysis.
finally,the court in harris mcrae considered only the hyde amendment,while the tmap funding scheme we consider involves the interplay between the amendment and section e.for these reasons,we must conduct our own analysis to determine whether the tmap funding scheme,as a whole,discriminates because of sex.in doing so,we note that the texas equal rights amendment affords greater protection through review once discrimination is found,but it does not affect the initial determination of whether the classification is impermissibly sex based.
plaintiffs claim that texas abortion funding restriction should be considered suspect because states have historically used women childbearing capacity as a basis for denying women equality.we do question that women ability to become pregnant has historically been at the root of the discriminatory practices which keep women in and jobs,at,reprinted in.clearly,the equal rights amendment is directed at just such purposeful discrimination.but we do not believe the discouragement of abortion through funding restrictions can,by itself,be considered purposeful discrimination against women as a class.as the united states supreme court said in bray alexandria women health clinic 
o pposition to voluntary abortion can not possibly be considered such an irrational surrogate for opposition to or paternalism towards women.whatever one thinks of abortion,it can not be denied that there are common and respectable reasons for opposing it,other than hatred of,or condescension toward or indeed any view at all concerning,women as a class 
at.the biological truism that abortions can only be performed on women does not necessarily mean that governmental action restricting abortion funding discriminates on the basis of gender.as we have said,that might be true if the state refused to fund medically necessary services.but,other than abortion,the tmap does fund all medically necessary care.
the state contends that,even if we ignore section e facial neutrality and look only at the hyde amendment abortion funding restrictions,those restrictions implement a legitimate governmental purpose to favor childbirth over abortion.we agree.while the federal constitution prevents the state from placing undue burdens upon a woman freedom to terminate a pregnancy,the state retains the authority to make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion,and to implement that judgment by the allocation of public funds.maher,at.in the absence of any other evidence of discriminatory intent,we believe that the hyde amendment was intended to implement such a value judgment.
we acknowledge that the adverse consequences of tmap abortion funding restrictions upon women could give rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.but an inference is a working tool,not a synonym for proof.feeney,at.when the impact is essentially an unavoidable consequence of a legislative policy that has in itself always been deemed to be legitimate,and when the statutory history and all of the available evidence
