plaintiffs,coal operators the operators,appeal the district court denial of their motion for summary judgment and its grant of summary judgment to defendants,fund trustees trustees.the operators claim that the trustees improperly assessed premiums against the operators in response to the supreme court decision in eastern enterprises apfel,d.the united states appears as amicus curiae in favor of the trustees.for the reasons stated below,we affirm.
a.the establishment of the combined benefit fund 
in,a national bituminous coal wage agreement nbcwa between coal companies and the united mine workers of america umwa established a benefit fund to provide pension and medical benefits to miners and their dependents.the fund relied on proceeds from a royalty on coal production,and did not specify particular benefits to which miners were entitled instead,the nbcwa provided for trustees to determine and alter benefits as the proceeds from this royalty fluctuated.successive and benefit funds expanded traditional coverage by providing for the payment of health care benefits to retired mine workers and their dependents.this change in coverage and other decline in coal production,the retirement of a generation of miners,and a rapid acceleration in healthcare led to financial trouble for the and funds.a nbcwa intended to address these problems led to further insolvency.
congress then passed the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act or the act,which merged the and funds into a new plan called the umwa combined benefit fund the combined fund.the combined fund provides benefits essentially equivalent to those provided under the and funds,and is financed by annual premiums assessed against coal companies that signed any nbcwa or other agreement that obligated them to contribute to the or funds.under the act,the commissioner of social security assigns retirees to signatory coal companies according to this formula first,to the most recent signatory to the or a subsequent nbcwa to employ the retiree in the coal industry for at least two years second,to the most recent signatory to the or a subsequent nbcwa to employ the retiree in the coal industry for any period of time and third,to the signatory company that employed the retiree in the coal industry for the longest period of time prior to the effective date of the nbcwa.retirees that can not be assigned under any of these three tiers are placed in a pool of unassigned beneficiaries.
the annual obligation assessed to each company by the trustees of the combined fund the trustees consists of three parts a health benefit premium,a death benefit premium,and an unassigned beneficiary premium.see a.the health benefit premium is a set amount multiplied by the total number of beneficiaries assigned to that operator.the death benefit premium is determined by dividing an estimated total death benefit by the number of assigned retirees,and then billing each company a share for each retiree assigned to it.the unassigned beneficiary premium assumes a set amount is paid for each unassigned beneficiary,and then divides the total among signatory companies based on the number of retirees assigned to them.
in order to reduce the premium obligations of signatory companies,the coal act provides for a transfer of monies to the combined fund from two sources.the first source is the fund.the coal act directed the fund to transfer million to the combined fund in three yearly payments of million.see a.the coal act required that the first million transfer,made on february,be used to reduce coal operators health benefit,death benefit,and unassigned beneficiary premium obligations for the plan year.see a,a a.following the act,the trustees applied the payment first to premiums for unassigned beneficiaries million and then death benefit premiums million,leaving million to be applied to reduce unassigned beneficiary health benefit premiums from per retiree to.
the remaining two transfers were applied to plan years and.following the coal act,these payments were applied first to unassigned beneficiary premiums and then to death benefit premiums they could not be applied to assigned beneficiary premiums.the remainder from the second and third transfers was set aside for use against death benefit premiums in future plan years.
after these payments,a second source of funds was introduced to offset premiums the abandoned mine land reclamation fund the aml fund,managed by the department of the interior.beginning with plan year,of the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra provides for an annual transfer of interest earned on the corpus of the aml fund to cover expenditures made from the combined fund for unassigned beneficiaries in that plan year.see h see also b.interest from the aml fund entirely covered premiums for unassigned beneficiaries in plan years.
b.the eastern decision 
in june,the supreme court considered the claims of coal company eastern enterprises eastern,which exited the industry in and argued that the social security administration ssa retroactive assessment of premiums against it under the third tier of the coal act allocation scheme constituted a taking and violated the fifth amendment.see entrprs.apfel,d.the court agreed with eastern and declared this third tier invalid as applied to it.see id.at.
in september,the ssa voided all beneficiary assignments previously made to eastern and more than companies.this resulted in beneficiaries,who had been assigned at the start of the plan year and in past plan years,being redesignated as unassigned beneficiaries for all plan years.
upon receiving notice of this change,the trustees refunded all of the premiums that companies excused by eastern had paid over the years.they then retroactively recalculated the premiums of the remaining companies from,the first plan year,to the present,as though the former eastern beneficiaries had been considered unassigned beneficiaries from the outset.as part of this recalculation,the trustees reapplied the past payments from the fund and the aml fund to these new premium assessments.under this method,more of the fund payments were used to cover unassigned beneficiary premiums,and less money could be set aside to cover death benefit premiums in plan years.the trustees therefore assigned,for the first time,a death benefit premium for plan year and retroactive death benefit premiums for plan years and.in total,these recalculations resulted in an additional million in premium liability for the remaining operators.
the operators,all coal companies still subject to the coal act,then filed this action in district court against the trustees.they filed a motion for summary judgment challenging the trustees retroactive recalculation of premium assessments against them.the secretary of the interior filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the trustees.the district court denied the operators motion for summary judgment and granted summary judgment to the trustees.the operators appeal that decision to this court.this court reviews a district court grant of summary judgment de novo.see clark coats clark,cir.
the parties agree that the trustees acted properly in refunding the payments made based on assignments the supreme court found invalid in eastern.the sole issue is whether the trustees acted properly in retroactively recalculating operators premiums in response to eastern.in truth,this is a fight about the extent to which the aml fund may be used to compensate the combined fund for losses resulting from the eastern refund.the trustees,applying their retroactive recalculation method,asked the aml fund to compensate only some of this refund the operators want the fund to reimburse the entire refund amount and rely on a different accounting method.accordingly,they contend that the trustees retroactive reassessment of premiums in response to eastern was improper.
section h of the smcra governs when aml fund monies may be used to reimburse expenditures from the combined fund.section h requires that a yearly transfer be made from the aml fund to the combined fund equivalent to the interest earned on the fund in that year or million,
