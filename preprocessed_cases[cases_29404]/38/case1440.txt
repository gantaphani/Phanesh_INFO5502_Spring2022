the department of veterans affairs the dva appeals from the decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court reversing in part,vacating in part,and remanding the decision of the board of veterans appeals the board,holding,inter alia,that b and,dc require the assignment of dual ratings for bilateral tinnitus.smith dva.because the veterans court erred in not deferring to the dva interpretation of its own regulations,we reverse and remand that portion of the court decision.no other aspect of the court decision is on appeal.
background 
smith served on active duty in the army from march to march.a report from an april va audiological examination revealed that smith had tinnitus.in october,a va regional office ro found that smith tinnitus was service connected.however,the ro assigned a noncompensable disability rating to smith tinnitus because the evidence did not demonstrate that the tinnitus was persistent as required by,dc.in april,the ro issued a supplemental statement of the case reaffirming that smith tinnitus was not persistent.prior to june,dc hereinafter dc provided for a disability rating for a veteran with tinnitus if the evidence demonstrated that the tinnitus was persistent as a symptom of head injury,concussion,or acoustic trauma.on june,dc hereinafter dc was amended to provide a disability rating for tinnitus if the evidence demonstrated that the tinnitus was recurrent,dc the requirement that tinnitus must be a symptom of head injury,concussion,or acoustic trauma was deleted.consequently,smith appealed the ro decision,asserting that his tinnitus should be evaluated under the dc,which requires that his tinnitus be recurrent,rather than persistent.
in a december decision,the board considered smith claim under both the dc and the dc regulations.with regard to dc,the board affirmed the ro decision that smith tinnitus was not persistent,which the board defined as insistently repetitive,or continuous,tenacious,or enduring.thus,the board determined that smith was not entitled to a disability rating prior to june.with regard to dc,the board determined that smith tinnitus was recurrent and granted him a disability rating,effective june.smith appealed from the board decision,alleging that the evidence demonstrated that his tinnitus was persistent under dc and that the board misinterpreted both and dc by failing to award a separate disability rating for tinnitus in each ear.
on june,the veterans court reversed in part,vacated in part and remanded the board decision.smith principi.first,the court reversed the board conclusion that smith tinnitus was not persistent as required by dc,concluding that the board decision was arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion,and remanded for assignment of a disability rating and determination of an appropriate effective date.second,the court vacated the portion of the board decision that denied two disability ratings for smith tinnitus,one for each ear,and remanded for the board to consider whether a single rating is appropriate for bilateral tinnitus under b,which provides that disabilities arising from a single disease entity are to be rated separately.id.
the dva moved without opposition to vacate the veterans court decision and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this court recent decision in wanner principi.in wanner,we had reversed a veterans court decision,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the content of a rating schedule.because the veterans court in this case relied heavily on its decision in wanner,we reversed the court determination that it had jurisdiction in this case and remanded for further proceedings consistent with our decision in wanner.smith principi.
on remand,the veterans court first held that it had jurisdiction to review both the board interpretation of the term persistent in dc and whether b permits dual ratings for tinnitus.the veterans court reasoned that its review of regulations dc and b did not involve evaluating the content of a rating schedule,but rather an interpretation of language in the regulations,subject matter over which the veterans court has jurisdiction.the veterans court then vacated the board decision with regard to the term persistent under dc and remanded to the board for an explanation of its interpretation of the term persistent.with regard to the question whether and dc permit dual ratings for tinnitus,the court reversed the board decision that dc did not authorize the assignment of two ratings for bilateral tinnitus and determined that regulations b and dc required such dual ratings for bilateral tinnitus.the veterans court observed that the dva interpretation of its regulations,dc and b,conflicted with their plain meaning.the veterans court noted that dc lists tinnitus as a disease of the ear and that b provides for a separate rating for each disability arising from a single disease,unless otherwise provided.thus,the veterans court determined that a plain reading of those regulations taken together results in a rating of for each ear affected by a single case of tinnitus.smith dva.at.the veterans court then remanded for the board to consider whether smith had bilateral tinnitus,and,if so,for assignment of a dual rating.
the dva timely appealed the veterans court decision regarding whether the regulations permit a dual rating for bilateral tinnitus,and,as we explain below,we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
the scope of our review of a veterans court decision is limited by statute.under a,we may review a decision by the veterans court with respect to the validity of any statute or regulation of any interpretation thereof other than a determination as to a factual matter that was relied on by the veterans court in making the decision.this appeal involves the veterans court interpretation of certain dva regulations,and therefore we normally would have jurisdiction to consider that interpretation under a.we review interpretation of regulations by the veterans court de novo and may set aside any regulation or interpretation of a regulation that we find to be arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law contrary to a constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or without observation of a procedure required by law.d wanner,at.
as an initial matter,however,we must consider whether we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal at this time.we conclude that we do and agree with the dva that,even though the veterans court remanded the case to the board,we have jurisdiction over this appeal under the principles set forth in williams principi,generally,we do not have jurisdiction to review judgments.adams principi.we have determined that a remand order from the veterans court is not considered a final judgment and hence is usually not appealable.id.in williams,however,we set forth an exception to the general rule that decisions are not reviewable.as we explained in williams 
we will depart from the strict rule of finality when the court of appeals for veterans claims has remanded for further proceedings only if three conditions are satisfied there must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that a is separate from the remand proceedings,b will directly govern the remand proceedings or,c if reversed by this court,would render the remand proceedings unnecessary the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review and,there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand,that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.

with regard to the first condition,the veterans court interpreted regulations b and dc,concluding that they require a dual rating for bilateral tinnitus,and remanding to determine if smith has bilateral tinnitus.thus,a clear final decision was rendered on a legal interpretation of the that interpretation will directly govern the remand proceedings.in addition,our reversal of that interpretation would render the remand order unnecessary because,
