the psoba provides a cash payment to survivors of public safety officers who die in the line of duty.in relevant part,a provides that i n any case in which the bureau of justice assistance determines that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,the bureau shall pay a benefit a.for a survivor or survivors to be entitled to payment,the public safety officer must have suffered a personal injury within the meaning of the act,the injury must have been suffered in the line of duty,and the death must have been the direct and proximate result of the personal injury.see also yanco united states.
a public safety officer was statutorily defined in the version of the act,applicable here,as an individual serving a public agency in an official capacity,with or without compensation,as a law enforcement officer,as a firefighter,or as a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.a.a law enforcement officer,in turn,was defined as an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction,or enforcement of the laws,including,but not limited to,police,corrections,probation,parole,and judicial officers.emphasis added.the act,however,does not define line of duty.
the bja is authorized under a to establish such rules,regulations,and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the psoba.a.pursuant to this authority,the bja promulgated the regulations set forth in part of title of the code of federal regulations et.section c defined line of duty as 
any action which an officer whose primary function is crime control or reduction,enforcement of the criminal law,or suppression of fires is obligated or authorized by rule,regulation,condition of employment or service,or law to perform,including those social,ceremonial,or athletic functions to which the officer is assigned,or for which he is compensated,by the public agency he serves.for other officers,line of duty means any action the officer is so obligated or authorized to perform in the course of controlling or reducing crime,enforcing the criminal law,or suppressing fires 
c emphases added.in m,the statutory definition of law enforcement officer was clarified to mean an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction,or enforcement of the criminal law m emphasis added.
plaintiff is the surviving husband of the late mildred cassella.cassella was employed by the wpd for seven years as a sszpo.cassella held her position as a sszpo pursuant to west virginia statute,which provides 
every municipality shall have plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for the appointment of special school zone police officers,who shall have the duty of controlling and directing traffic upon designated parts of the streets,avenues,roads,alleys or ways at or near schools,and who,in the performance of such duty,shall be vested with all the powers of local police officers.such special school zone police officers shall be in uniform,shall display a badge or other sign of authority,shall serve at the will and pleasure of the appointing authority,and shall not come within the civil service provisions of this article or the policemen pension and relief fund provisions 
emphasis added.
at approximately on april,cassella was on duty at the intersection of west virginia pennsylvania avenue and california avenue in weirton.cassella entered the eastbound lane of pennsylvania avenue from california avenue to stop traffic so that a school bus could pull away from the curb.she was wearing her orange vest and carrying a whistle and stop sign.while standing in the eastbound traffic lane,cassella was fatally struck from the side by a sport utility vehicle traveling eastward.cassella was taken by ambulance to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead by reason of blunt force traumatic injury at.the individual who was driving the vehicle that struck and killed cassella was charged and convicted of two traffic violations.
following cassella death,plaintiff filed a psoba death benefit claim with the bja on july.the bja reviewed the claim and issued a decision in may that plaintiff was not entitled to receive the death benefit authorized to be paid under the act.the bja concluded that cassella was not a public safety officer within the meaning of the act,because as a sszpo,cassella did not meet the definition of law enforcement officer,the only type of public safety officer applicable here,because she did not have the duty to control or reduce crime and juvenile delinquency or to enforce criminal law.
plaintiff appealed the decision within the department of justice,and in accordance with bja regulations,an appeal hearing was held on february,before an independent hearing officer.michael gordon,weirton chief of police at the time of cassella death,provided detailed testimony as to cassella duties and responsibilities as a sszpo for the wpd.
chief gordon testified at the hearing that cassella was responsible for directing and controlling traffic at a particular street intersection in weirton during the times of the day when school buses and children were entering and leaving school.chief gordon testified that cassella also had an implied responsibility to be watchful for the welfare of children at her crossing and could intervene and report to the police any problems such as suspected child abuse and bullying between children.
chief gordon further testified that cassella was neither a sworn officer nor a law enforcement officer and that she did not attend a police academy or undergo any formal police training.rather,chief gordon stated,cassella was trained for her position as a sszpo by going through an informal with another sszpo.as a sszpo,cassella was outfitted with an orange vest,whistle,and stop sign,but did not carry a communications device or a firearm or other type of weapon.
chief gordon testified that cassella was the face of the police and a figure of authority during the specific time that she was instructed to be on duty,but,unlike other officers who had attended the police academy,she did not have the power to make an arrest or stop a crime in progress.rather,chief gordon asserted,cassella had indirect arrest power in that she could gather information regarding an offense and then report it to other police officers within the department who would proceed against the violators.although chief gordon testified that cassella was a law enforcement officer in that she was responsible for the enforcement of traffic laws,she would actually report any traffic violations she observed to regular officers of the wpd.further,when asked if she was vested with all the powers of local police,chief gordon stated,for her job description as a special school zone officer,yes.
the hearing officer issued a determination on april,affirming the bja prior denial of benefits.the hearing officer first concluded that cassella was not a law enforcement officer because she did not possess the requisite law enforcement authority,nor was her primary function that of crime control or reduction.the hearing officer noted that,under west virginia law,a law enforcement officer is defined as a duly authorized member of a agency who is authorized to maintain public peace and order,prevent and detect crime,make arrests and enforce the laws of the state or any county or municipality thereof,and that,with a few exceptions not relevant here,no person may be employed as a officer unless the person is certified.the hearing officer concluded that cassella position did not meet this definition,since she was neither certified by the state nor authorized to make arrests.
the hearing officer also found that cassella did not die in the line of duty as defined in the psoba because for a public safety officer whose primary function is not crime control death in the line of duty must have resulted from activities directly related to reducing crime or enforcing the criminal law.the hearing officer concluded that cassella was directing traffic at the time of her death,rather than reducing crime or enforcing the criminal law,and therefore did not die in the line of duty.
on october,plaintiff filed a complaint with the united states court of federal claims seeking review of the hearing officer determination.the court stayed proceedings so that plaintiff could first submit his claim to the bja director for a final agency determination.plaintiff appealed the hearing officer determination to the bja director pursuant to on february.on april,the bja director issued the agency final determination upholding the determinations of the hearing officer.the director agreed with the bja and the hearing officer that cassella was not a public safety officer because she lacked requisite legal and actual authority as a law enforcement officer to control or reduce crime or enforce the criminal law.the director also determined that even if cassella actually had authority and duties,she did not sustain a fatal injury in the line of duty as required by the psoba.in this regard,the director stated that plaintiff failed to show that cassella was in fact enforcing criminal laws at the time of her death,such as pulling over and detaining a drunk driver.the evidence showed that cassella was simply controlling traffic in an intersection at the time of her death.
the court of federal claims reinstated its proceedings on may.the united states filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record on june,and plaintiff filed a for judgment on the administrative record on july.the court issued a decision on october,denying the united states motion for judgment,granting plaintiff for judgment,and entering a final judgment in favor of plaintiff in the statutory amount of.cassella.at.
both plaintiff and the government briefed arguments before the trial court with regard to whether cassella duties involved the enforcement of criminal law.the trial judge,however,relying heavily on an earlier decision by another judge of the court of federal claims in hawkins united states,concluded that these arguments were ultimately irrelevant.rather,following the earlier decision that a law enforcement officer encompasses an individual who solely enforces civil law,the court determined that the issue on appeal was whether cassella responsibilities as a sszpo included enforcement of the laws,criminal or otherwise.cassella.at.the court proceeded to find that cassella responsibilities included enforcement of laws,traffic laws and the welfare of children in her crossing zone.id.thus,the court concluded that cassella was a law enforcement officer for purposes of the psoba.id.
the court of federal claims further invalidated m,the regulation in which the bja defined a law enforcement officer as an individual involved in crime and juvenile delinquency control or reduction,or enforcement of the criminal law,as an invalid restriction of the statute.id.at.the court stated that does not limit a law enforcement officer to those who enforce the criminal law,but rather encompasses an individual involved in enforcement of the laws,whether criminal or otherwise.cassella.at.
finally,the trial court held that cassella died in the line of duty as defined by the psoba.id.at.the court found that since cassella was enforcing the traffic laws at the time of her death,she was killed in the line of duty.id.for these reasons,the court held that plaintiff was entitled to the death benefit under the act.id.
this appeal followed.this court has subject matter jurisdiction under a because the appeal is from a final judgment of the court of federal claims.
ii.discussion 
in reviewing an administrative denial of a benefit under the psoba,the court of federal claims is limited to deciding whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action by the government officials involved and whether substantial evidence supports the agency decision.chacon united states.on appeal,we review the judgment of the court of federal claims de novo,applying the same deferential standards anew.greeley united states,in psoba case,finding that bja factual finding that traumatic injury was not a substantial factor in fire chief death was supported by substantial evidence,and reversing court of federal claims judgment to the contrary.
the government argues on appeal that the bja regulatory interpretation of the term law enforcement officer is entitled to deference under chevron natural resources defense council,d.according to the government,the court of federal claims erred in concluding that law enforcement officer in constitutes the unambiguously expressed intent of congress to cover not only individuals who enforce criminal law,but also individuals who enforce only civil law.the government asserts that the cited statutory phrase enforcement of the laws in is actually ambiguous,since the term laws may encompass many different types of law or only criminal law.given this ambiguity,the government asserts that the bja interpretation of the psoba as requiring that law enforcement officer s be involved in the enforcement of criminal rather than purely civil law warrants chevron deference because it is consistent with the intent of congress to benefit the families of those involved in crime control and reduction.the government asserts that congress intent is demonstrated here in the plain meaning of the phrase contextual language,the act legislative history,and clarification in a recent statutory amendment.in contrast,plaintiff argues that the court of federal claims correctly determined that the death benefit under the psoba is available to survivors of law enforcement officers who enforce criminal civil laws.
this court recently resolved this very issue on appeal in hawkins united states,wl.in hawkins,we confronted the question of whether a law enforcement officer involved in enforcement of the laws as defined in the psoba includes officers who are involved in only civil law enforcement or is limited to officers who are involved in criminal law enforcement.id.at.taking into consideration the literal text of the statute defining law enforcement officer and the act legislative history,we concluded that congress intended law enforcement officer to cover individuals who enforce criminal law rather than merely civil law.id.at.since we found the definition of law enforcement officer unambiguous after employing these traditional tools of statutory construction,we declined to reach the government argument that deference to its regulatory interpretation of law enforcement officer was due under chevron.id.at.
nevertheless,we observed that to the extent the phrase enforcement of the laws could be viewed as ambiguous as to the type of laws congress intended to encompass in the statute,the bja interpretation thereof to exclude an officer who only enforces civil law was reasonable.id.as noted above,law enforcement officer was defined by statute in as an individual involved in enforcement of the laws,emphasis added,but defined by regulation in m as an individual involved in enforcement of the criminal law.m emphasis added.thus,the bja,by regulation,excluded individual
