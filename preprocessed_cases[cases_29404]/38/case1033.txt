peggy bowman appeals from an order of the district court affirming the social security commissioner denial of her application for supplemental security income ssi benefits under title xvi of the social security act.bowman argues that a remand to the commissioner is necessary because the administrative law judge alj erred,as a matter of law,in failing to perform a proper analysis at step four of the sequential evaluation process for determining whether a social security claimant is disabled,see barnhart,cir describing five steps the alj erred,as a matter of law,in failing to properly evaluate the opinion of bowman primary medical provider,linda hancik,a registered nurse and family nurse practitioner and the alj findings that bowman was capable of performing both light work and her past relevant work are not supported by substantial evidence.
we agree with bowman that a remand is required with regard to the first issue.as part of the remand proceedings,we also direct the commissioner to reconsider nurse hancik opinion in accordance with the instructions set forth herein.in light of our disposition of the first two issues,we do not need to address the third issue.exercising jurisdiction under g and,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
bowman was years old when the alj denied her application for ssi benefits.she obtained a high school general equivalency degree and attended one year of college.she has prior work experience as a housekeeper,food preparation worker,cashier,fast food worker,and hostess.bowman alleges that she has been unable to work since october,due to limitations imposed by asthma,arthritic lower back pain,limited use of her left wrist and hand status post surgery,tuberculosis,allergic rhinitis,anxiety,and depression.aplt.br.at.
in june,james metcalf examined bowman and performed a physical consultative examination on behalf of the commissioner.metcalf clinical impression was that bowman suffered from chronic lower back pain without radiculopathy,bronchial asthma,and surgical procedure on the left wrist with limited range of motion,vol.ii at.metcalf also reported that bowman was unable to effectively grasp tools such as a hammer with her left hand.id.at.
after bowman application for ssi benefits was denied initially and on reconsideration,a de novo hearing was held before the alj in january.at the hearing,a vocational expert ve testified that bowman prior jobs are classified as light in exertion in the department of labor dictionary of occupational titles ed.id.at.the ve also identified the dot code for each of bowman prior jobs.id.at.
in february,the alj issued a written decision denying bowman application for ssi benefits.although the alj found at step two of the sequential evaluation process that bowman suffered from severe impairments in the form of disorders of the back,discogenic and degenerative and asthma,id.at,the alj concluded at step four that she could still perform her past relevant work as performed in the national economy and was therefore not disabled.id.at.specifically,the alj found that bowman retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work with limited use of her left hand and occasional stooping,and bowman past relevant work as a cashier,housekeeper,food preparer,fast food worker and hostess,did not require the performance of activities precluded by her residual functional capacity,id.
in october,the appeals council denied bowman request for review of the alj decision.bowman then filed a complaint in the district court.in october,the magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation,recommending that the district court affirm the alj denial of bowman application for ssi benefits.the district court adopted the magistrate judge recommendation and affirmed the alj decision.this appeal followed.
because the appeals council denied review,the alj decision is the commissioner final decision for purposes of this appeal.see doyal barnhart,cir.in reviewing the alj decision,we neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our judgment for that of the agency.casias sec y of health human,cir.instead,we review the alj decision only to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.doyal,at.
a.the alj analysis.
step four of the sequential analysis is comprised of three phases.winfrey chater,cir.
in the first phase,the alj must evaluate a claimant physical and mental residual functional capacity rfc,and in the second phase,he must determine the physical and mental demands of the claimant past relevant work in the final phase,the alj determines whether the claimant has the ability to meet the job demands found in phase two despite the mental physical limitations found in phase one henrie united states dep t of health human,cir.at each of these phases,the alj must make specific findings.see henrie,at.
as set forth above,the alj evaluated and made specific findings regarding bowman physical residual functional capacity as required at phase one of the analysis,and concluded that bowman retained the residual functional capacity to perform light work with limited use of her left hand and occasional stooping,vol.ii at.after noting,for purposes of phase two,that the ve testified that the claimant past work as a housekeeper,food preparation worker,cashier,fast food worker and hostess are classified in the dictionary of occupational titles as light work activity,the alj then found at phase three that bowman past relevant work did not require the performance of activities precluded by her residual functional capacity id.
we agree with bowman that the alj analysis was legally deficient.as bowman explains in her opening brief 
here,the alj found bowman to have limited use of her left hand as part of her rfc.ii.at.the alj also found that bowman could perform her past relevant work as a cashier,housekeeper,food preparer,fast food worker,and hostess.id.however,not only did he fail to address the impact of this relatively vague restriction on bowman ability to perform her past relevant work with the ve ii,but the alj also failed to make any findings regarding the handling demands of such work in his decision.ii.at.
further,because he failed to make the necessary findings at phase two,the alj was unable and failed to make the necessary function by function comparison between bowman limited use of her left hand and the demands of her past work as required at phase three.ii.at.due to these failures,the record lacks the necessary documentation concerning the impact bowman limited use of her left hand would have on her ability to perform her past relevant work which all require frequent to constant handling of objects or any evidence supporting the alj finding that bowman could perform such work despite that limitation.
aplt.br.at see also winfrey,at having failed to complete phase two appropriately,the alj was unable to make the necessary findings at phase three about plaintiff ability to meet the demands of his past relevant work despite his impairments.
as noted by bowman,all of her past jobs require frequent or constant handling,which is defined as s eizing,holding,grasping,turning,or otherwise working with hand or hands,and,at the very least,this means that she must be able to perform such handling activities from to of the time during a normal workday.see employment training,dep t of labor,selected characteristics of occupations defined in the revised dictionary of occupational titles see also id.at food assembler,kitchen and codes and,cashier code,code,and code this job requires handling constantly or more of the time after the ve identified the appropriate dot codes for bowman prior jobs,the alj could have taken administrative notice of this job information,and then asked the ve to give an opinion concerning whether bowman limited use of her left hand would affect her ability to perform the required handling activities.see winfrey,at.the alj did not pursue such an inquiry,however,and did not otherwise make the necessary findings at phases two and three of the analysis.as a result,we must remand this case to the c
