john viegas appeals the final judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court affirming a decision of the board of veterans appeals board that denied his claim for disability compensation under.see viegas shinseki.vet.claims lexis,veterans court decision.because we conclude that the veterans court misinterpreted the causation requirement set forth in section a,we reverse and remand.
background 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.viegas served in the united states army from november to november.after he left the service,he was injured in a diving accident.as a result,viegas now suffers from incomplete quadriplegia.
in may,viegas participated in a prescribed aquatic therapy session at a department of veterans affairs va medical center in palo alto,california.afterward,he stopped to use a restroom located in the va facility.while he was in the restroom,the grab bar he was using to lift himself into his wheelchair came loose from the wall and he fell to the ground.as a result of the fall,viegas sustained injuries to both his upper and lower extremities.viegas medical condition deteriorated after his fall.prior to his fall,viegas could sometimes walk with a walker,but since the accident he can only stand with assistance.
in july,viegas filed a claim for section benefits.he asserted that as a result of the fall in the va restroom he had incurred severe injury to his shoulder and neck resulting in loss of use of his lower extremities and impairment of his upper extremities.a va regional office denied viegas claim,concluding that he was not entitled to benefits under section because he was not in direct va care at the time of his fall.on appeal,the board affirmed,stating that benefits are available under section only if a veteran additional disability is the result of injury that was part of the natural sequence of cause and effect flowing directly from the actual provision of hospital care,medical or surgical treatment,or examination furnished by the va and such additional disability was directly caused by that va activity.
viegas then appealed to the veterans court.the court held that although viegas injury occurred in a va facility,it was not caused directly by hospital care,medical or surgical treatment,or examination furnished by the veterans court decision.vet.claims lexis,at citations and internal quotation marks omitted.in the court view,while viegas might potentially be able to seek compensation for his injuries under the federal tort claims act,b,the additional disability incurred as a result of his fall was simply not covered by section.veterans court decision.vet.claims lexis,at.viegas then filed a timely notice of appeal with this court.
ii.discussion 
we have jurisdiction over appeals from the veterans court under.questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law,subject to de novo review.chandler shinseki,boggs peake.
pursuant to section,a veteran who sustains a qualifying additional disability as a result of va medical treatment or hospital care is entitled to benefits in the same manner as if such additional disability were.a see roberson shinseki.in relevant part,section provides 
a compensation under this chapter and dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter of this title shall be awarded for a qualifying additional disability or a qualifying death of a veteran in the same manner as if such additional disability or death were serviceconnected.for purposes of this section,a disability or death is a qualifying additional disability or qualifying death if the disability or death was not the result of the veteran willful misconduct and 
the disability or death was caused by hospital care,medical or surgical treatment,or examination furnished the veteran under any law administered by the secretary,either by a department employee or in a department facility as defined in section a of this title,and the proximate cause of the disability or death was 
a carelessness,negligence,lack of proper skill,error in judgment,or similar instance of fault on the part of the department in furnishing the hospital care,medical or surgical treatment,or examination or 
b an event not reasonably foreseeable.
emphasis added.
section delineates three prerequisites for obtaining disability compensation.first,a putative claimant must incur a qualifying additional disability that was not the result of his own willful misconduct.id.a second,that disability must have been caused by hospital care,medical or surgical treatment,or examination furnished the veteran by the va or in a va facility.id.a.finally,the proximate cause of the veteran disability must be carelessness,negligence,lack of proper skill,error in judgment,or similar instance of fault on the part of the va,or an event not reasonably foreseeable.id.a a,a b.
section thus contains two causation veteran disability must not only be caused by the hospital care or medical treatment he received from the va,but also must be proximate ly cause d by the va fault or an unforeseen event.id.a.there is no question that viegas injury meets section second causation element since it was proximately caused by the va failure to properly install and maintain the grab bar in a restroom at its palo alto medical center.the sole issue presented on appeal is whether his injury was caused by the medical treatment or hospital care he received from the.
the government argues that viegas injury falls outside the ambit of section because the statute encompasses only those injuries that are directly caused by the provision of medical care.in the government view,section applies to disabilities that are caused by actual care or treatment,rather than injuries that coincidentally occur in va facilities.viegas disagrees.he asserts that his injury was caused by the hospital care he received at the va palo alto medical center because it occurred while he was receiving care and treatment at the facility.according to viegas,section causation requirement is satisfied whenever a veteran comes to a va facility for medical treatment and,as a result of the va negligence,sustains an injury while on va premises.
we do not find either the government or viegas interpretation of the phrase caused by in section a wholly satisfactory.contrary to the government assertions,nothing in the statutory text requires that a veteran injury must be directly caused by the actual medical care provided by va personnel.on the other hand,however,section does not extend to the remote consequences of va medical treatment,brown gardner,d gardner,and a veteran is not entitled to obtain section disability benefits simply because he was in a va medical facility at the time he sustained an injury.
a.the statutory text 
as is true in every case involving the construction of a statute,our starting point must be the language employed by congress.reiter sonotone,d.nothing in the plain language of section requires that a veteran injury must be directly caused by the actual provision of medical care by va personnel.to the contrary,the statute is framed disjunctively,stating that a disability must be caused by hospital care or medical treatment that is provided to a veteran either by a va employee or in a va facility.a emphases added.in other words,the causation element is satisfied not only when an injury is directly caused by the actions of va employees,but also when that injury occurs in a va facility as a result of the va negligence.by use of the disjunctive,congress intended to encompass not simply the actual care provided by va medical personnel,but also treatmentrelated incidents that occur in the physical premises controlled and maintained by the.see reiter,at eschewing a strained construction of a statute that would ignore the disjunctive or contained in the statutory text fed.commc comm pacifica,d explaining that where terms are written in the disjunctive,it impl ies that each has a separate meaning.
here,viegas came to the va palo alto medical center to participate in a aquatic therapy session that was designed to help him manage his incomplete quadriplegia.he was injured because the va failed to properly insta
