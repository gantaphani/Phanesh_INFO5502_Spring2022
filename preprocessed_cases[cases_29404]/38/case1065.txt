because spouses typically possess assets and income jointly and bear financial responsibility for each other,medicaid eligibility determinations for married applicants have resisted simple solutions.wisconsin dep t of health family servs.blumer,d.prior to,when a spouse was institutionalized,the married couple assets were combined and that total was considered in determining either spouse medicaid eligibility.thus,the spouse remaining at home community spouse had to spend virtually all of the marital assets to trigger the institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility.ii,at,reprinted in.as a result,some community spouses became prematurely institutionalized themselves due to a lack of financial.id.conversely,any assets that were held solely by either spouse were only considered in determining that spouse medicaid eligibility.id.at.therefore,when a pension check was issued to the husband,all of that income was considered his for the purpose of determining his eligibility if he entered a nursing home.id.at.however,if the wife entered a nursing home,none of the husband pension income was considered in determining the wife eligibility and federal law did not obligate him to contribute toward the cost of her care.id.as a result,a wealthy community spouse was able to shelter income and resources from inclusion in the calculation of the institutionalized spouse eligibility.
in,congress sought to eliminate some of the undesired consequences of the existing eligibility provisions by amending the mcca provisions of the federal medicaid act to include the spousal impoverishment provisions.these amendments resulted in a complex methodology for separately calculating each spouse resources and income and then using those calculations to determine the institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility.income allocation is governed by b and d.these sections exclude the community spouse individual income when determining whether the institutionalized spouse qualifies for medicaid.sections c and f address the allocation of resources.under those provisions,the couple resources are added together when institutionalization begins and of the total is allocated to each spouse as the spousal share.c a.after the spousal share is determined,the community spouse is permitted to retain a specified maximum amount indexed to inflation,which is referred to as the community spouse resource allowance csra.c b,f a,g.any and all resources above the csra must be spent before the institutionalized spouse will be eligible for medicaid.c.under the mcca,a couple may obtain a fair hearing to challenge the state determination of an institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility,including the computation of the csra.e.

in the fall of,colorado revised the eligibility guidelines used to calculate a married couple resources when a spouse enters a nursing home and changed the way it classified retirement accounts such as iras,k s,or b prior to that revision,colorado did not classify retirement accounts held by the community spouse as resources available to support the institutionalized spouse.as a result,retirement accounts were not included as resources in calculating the csra and did not affect the institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility.on september,however,colorado began including retirement accounts held by a community spouse as countable resources for the purpose of determining an institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility.see reg,colorado has applied this new rule both to initial applications for medicaid benefits and,as is the case here,to annual eligibility redeterminations.
the sellers have been married since.on august,sellers was admitted to elms haven care center and she applied for medicaid benefits.on november,the adams county department of social services approved her application because the sellers total countable resources of fell below the eligibility cap.pursuant to the guidelines in place at that time,the colorado medicaid agency did not include any of sellers retirement funds when determining sellers medicaid eligibility in.

the sellers raise three issues on appeal.first,they contend the district court erred in determining,as a matter of law,that the mcca permits the classification of retirement plans held by community spouses as resources available to the institutionalized spouse.second,the sellers contend the court decision,as applied to them,violated c of the mcca,which bars states from taking resources from the community spouse for the institutionalized spouse benefit at any time following the month in which eligibility is first determined.third,they contend retirement plans held by the community spouse should be considered income rather than resources as long as periodic payments are being made from those plans

does colorado new rule violate the mcca 
we first consider whether the new colorado rule,requiring that retirement accounts held by a community spouse be classified as resources,violates the mcca.this is an issue of first impression in the federal courts in resolving this issue,we must explore the relationship between the mcca and the remainder of the federal medicaid act,as well as congress purpose in enacting the mcca and whether colorado new rule is contrary to that purpose.
our starting point for determining sellers medicaid eligibility under the mcca is a which states 
in determining the eligibility for medical assistance of an institutionalized spouse as defined in subsection h of this section,the provisions of the mcca supercede any other provision of this subchapter including sections a and f of this title which is inconsistent with them.
to determine whether the mcca and the medicaid act treat retirement accounts inconsistently for purposes of determining medicaid eligibility,we begin with the mcca definition of resources.the mcca defines resources through two provisions.first,we note section a,which states 
except as this section specifically provides,this section does not apply to 
a the determination of what constitutes income or resources,or 
b the methodology and standards for determining and evaluating income and resources.
section a can thus be said to require states to follow the medicaid act rules for determining eligibility,except states must follow the mcca supplemental requirements.second,for our purposes,we also note the relevant supplemental requirements found in c 
in this section,the term resources does not include 
a resources excluded under subsection a or d of section,and 
b resources that would be excluded under section a a of this title but for the limitation on total value described in such section.
notably,a excluding,among other things,a home,household goods,personal effects,and an automobile,d excluding burial expenses,and a a elaborating on exclusions under a,do not explicitly exclude retirement accounts from the calculation of a married couple total joint resources.
the district court concluded that,because the mcca did not include retirement accounts in the list of assets that were not resources,congress implicitly classified retirement accounts as resources.therefore,the court determined,under the mcca,colorado could include retirement accounts when determining an institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility.see also mistrick div.of med.assistance,relying on maxim inclusio unius est exclusio alterius to find congress did not intend to exclude retirement accounts under martin ohio dep t of human,ohio app d,same but see keip wisconsin dep t of health family,finding the mcca ambiguous and holding the mcca requires exclusion of retirement accounts from resources calculation.because this outcome arguably was inconsistent with the federal medicaid act,the court determined the mcca treatment of resources superceded the medicaid act.the sellers contend the mcca does not clearly address the status of retirement accounts and is therefore ambiguous.as a result,the sellers argue we should apply the canons of statutory construction and conclude congress did not intend that retirement accounts be included in medicaid eligibility determinations.
our analysis of whether the mcca conflicts with the medicaid act begins with the mcca text,barnhart sigmon coal,d,the plainness or ambiguity of which is determined by reference to the language itself,the specific context in which the language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.robinson shell oil,d.as a general rule of statutory construction,a statute is ambiguous if it is capable of being understood in two or more possible senses or ways.chickasaw nation united states,d see also allen geneva steel,cir noting ambiguity exists when a statute is capable of being understood by reasonably persons in two or more different senses.
the parties have offered reasonable interpretations of the mcca that are supported by colorado past and present practices.on the one hand,as colorado argues and as the district court concluded,the mcca reasonably can be read as incorporating c arguably finite list of assets that are excluded from the calculation of resources and,since retirement accounts are not excluded,they can be considered as resources.in reviewing the approach taken by several states in this circuit,new mexico and oklahoma appear to agree with that interpretation and classify the community spouse retirement accounts as resources available to the institutionalized spouse.see admin.code tit.viii.admin.code d a.conversely,the approach in kansas and wyoming suggests the mcca can also be interpreted as merely listing some items that are not countable as resources,but not setting forth an exclusive list of excludable assets.see.admin.regs.d.regs.ch,a.perhaps most tellingly,colorado has interpreted this statute both ways.initially,the department of health policy required that retirement accounts be excluded from the institutionalized spouse eligibility calculation.not until did colorado,in the absence of any changes to the mcca or other applicable federal law,revise its policy and promulgate several regulations explicitly including retirement accounts in its calculation of resources.see reg,c.in light of these differing yet reasonable interpretations,we conclude the mcca is ambiguous and does not address clearly how retirement accounts should factor into medicaid eligibility.
in interpreting the mcca,our primary task is to determine congressional intent,using traditional tools of statutory construction.nlrb united food commercial workers union,d quoting ins,d.in so doing,we will assume that congress intent is expressed correctly in the ordinary meaning of the words it employs.charles inv.comm r,cir.
a statute is to be considered in all its parts when construing any one of them.lexecon milberg weiss bershad hynes lerach,d.to this end,the sellers claim that since the mcca is part of the medicaid act,the court should look at the medicaid act eligibility requirements.specifically,they argue that under r of the medicaid act,the states that elect to participate in medicaid must establish reasonable standards for determining an applicant eligibility which are no more restrictive than the eligibility requirements under the supplemental security income ssi act.r a.according to the sellers,the commissioner of social security practice has been to exempt retirement funds belonging to the ineligible spouse.as evidence of this practice,they cite a,where the ssi guidelines state 
in the case of an individual who is living with a person not eligible under this part and who is considered to be the husband or wife of such individual under the criteria in through of this part,such individual resources shall be deemed to include any resources,not otherwise excluded under this subpart,of such spouse whether or not such resources are available to such individual.in addition to the exclusions listed in,pension funds which the ineligible spouse may have are also excluded.pension funds are defined as funds held in individual retirement accounts ira,as described by the internal revenue code,or in pension plans including such plans for individuals,sometimes referred to as keogh plans.
emphasis added.the sellers cite united states mead,d,as authority for their view that the court must accord these guidelines some deference.as such,they claim the mcca mandates that retirement accounts be excluded and that the colorado rule therefore violates federal law.
like the district court,we are unpersuaded by this argument.we agree that the medicaid act eligibility requirements and therefore the mcca eligibility requirements unless otherwise explicitly noted must be no more restrictive than the ssi eligibility requirements,but the ssi provides no guidance on the issue raised here.notably,a applies only when an ssi applicant is living with his or her spouse.by definition,an institutionalized spouse and a community spouse in the medicaid context do not live together.we therefore conclude that neither the ssi,nor its corresponding guidelines,address the eligibility requirements where one spouse is institutionalized.
we are equally unpersuaded by colorado contention that reading the mcca as a whole mandates including retirement accounts in the calculation of a married couple resources.although colorado focuses on the mcca enumerated list of items that are excluded from the definition of resources,its analysis ignores a,which states that,with the exception of specific statements in the mcca,the mcca does not apply to a the determination of what constitutes resources,or b the methodology and standards for determining and evaluating resources.read together,these two provisions create the rule that,unless an asset is specifically mentioned by the mcca,the classification of that asset for eligibility purposes depends on the federal medicaid act treatment of that asset.applying this rule to retirement accounts,we conclude that congress did not explicitly exclude retirement accounts when defining resources.rather,we conclude that congress neither foreclosed nor mandated a particular classification for retirement accounts.
next,we consider the mcca legislative history.see allen,at if a statute is ambiguous a court may seek guidance from congress intent,a task aided by reviewing the legislative history.the legislative history attending the mcca enactment unequivocally suggests that congress sought to strike a balance between the need to limit the pauperization of the community spouse and the need to prevent wealthy couples from benefitting from medicaid coverage.as the supreme court recently explained 
as congress found when it enacted the mcca in,the existing practices for determining a married applicant income and resources produced unintended consequences.many community spouses were left destitute by the drain on the couple assets necessary to qualify the institutionalized spouse for medicaid and by the diminution of the couple income posteligibility to reduce the amount payable by medicaid for institutional care.conversely,couples with ample means could qualify for assistance when their assets were held solely in the community spouse name.
in the mcca,congress sought to protect community spouses from pauperization while preventing financially secure couples from obtaining medicaid assistance.to achieve this aim,congress installed a set of intricate and interlocking requirements with which states must comply in allocating a couple income and resources.
blumer,at.internal citations omitted see also cong.rec.
in consideration of the mcca legislative history,we agree with the sellers that there will be instances where a rule requiring that retirement accounts be included in assessing a couple resources has unintended consequences at odds with mcca purpose.here,after inclusion of sellers ira resulted in his wife becoming ineligible for medicaid,he was forced to end his retirement and return to work in order to have enough income to sustain himself.in such a case,consistent with congressional intent,one could say that excluding the ira is necessary to prevent the pauperization of the community spouse.conversely,one could envision a situation where a married couple has very few resources,except a substantial ira,and sheltering the ira from the medicaid eligibility calculation would unfairly allow a spouse to receive medicaid benefits.in sum,the legislative history does not suggest that congress envisioned a steadfast rule,but rather intended to address a wide range of possibilities through a general framework that delegated authority to the states.
we find it particularly noteworthy that the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,the administrative agency to which congress has delegated its medicaid rulemaking power,similarly has not promulgated any rules or issued any agency opinions addressing the classification of retirement accounts under the mcca.further,the agency practice reveals no clear policy preference.as colorado points out,cyndi gillaspie,the agency regional health insurance specialist,sent a letter to colorado on december,stating the mcca superceded all other provisions of the medicaid act,and pension funds owned by the ineligible spouse should be included when calculating the spousal share at the time a spouse becomes institutionalized.aple.at.contrary to this letter,cms has approved a wide range of state medicaid plans,some of which include retirement accounts in an institutionalized spouse eligibility determination and others that do not.to the extent the agency practices are accorded limited deference under skidmore swift,given the specialized experience and broader investigations and information available to the agency,mead,at.quoting skidmore,at,that limited deference is of minimal guidance here except to the extent that its actions again suggest the mcca text does not require a uniform practice.
finally,we view the supreme court recent discussion of the mcca in blumer particularly informative.in blumer,the court considered significant mcca failure to clearly articulate how income should be calculated for the purpose of determining an institutionalized spouse medicaid eligibility.the court noted the mcca legislative history and the practice by state and federal agencies conclusively suggested that when congress enacted the medicaid statute,in which the mcca is implanted,congress intended to advance cooperative federalism.blumer,at.the court explained 
when interpreting other statutes so structured,we have not been reluctant to leave a range of permissible choices to the states,at least where the superintending federal agency has concluded that such latitude is consistent with the statute aims.in batterton francis,d,for example,we upheld a regulation promulgated by the secretary of health,education,and welfare affording the states discretion in the implementation of the aid to families with dependent children afdc unemployed parent program.the challenged regulation allowed states to cover or exclude from coverage persons whose unemployment resulted from participation in a labor dispute or whose conduct would disqualify them for benefits under the state compensation law.noting that the afdc program involved the concept of cooperative federalism,id.at,we concluded that the secretary had the authority to recognize some local options in determining eligibility,id.at.similarly,in lukhard reed,d,a plurality of this court concluded that virginia policy of treating personal injury awards as income rather than resources under the afdc program was reasonable and consistent with federal law,see,at.the superintending federal agency,the plurality pointed out,had for many years permitted virginia choice while allowing other states to treat such awards as resources.id.at.
at.emphasis added.the court held that because the mcca did not specifically address how a couple income should be calculated,wisconsin methodology,although not explicitly prohibited or permitted by the mcca,was a permissible means of implementin
