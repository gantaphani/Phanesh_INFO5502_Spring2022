this is a somewhat unusual social security appeal.after an administrative law judge alj rejected nelson taylor application for disability benefits under title ii of the social security act,he appealed and persuaded the district court to remand the case for an award of benefits.the commissioner of the social security administration is thus the appellant before us she argues that the district court erred in its conclusion that the alj decision rejecting taylor application was not supported by substantial evidence.we conclude that the record permits neither rejection of taylor claim nor an immediate award of benefits,and we thus remand the case to the agency.
taylor who has since passed away and is now represented by kathleen briscoe,his sister applied for supplemental social security income ssi benefits under title xvi of the social security act ssa on may.he was awarded benefits effective the date of his application.on december,at the age of,he filed an application for disability insurance benefits dib under title ii of the ssa,claiming disability as a result of poor circulation in the legs and alleging an onset date of march,the date he was last employed.he claimed that he had a fifth grade education,he did not read or write well,and he could not understand a lot of words when attempting to read a newspaper.he worked as a forklift and machine operator for a steel mill for ten years until,then as a forklift operator for the leaf brand company.he stopped working on march,claiming that the repetitive foot movement required in driving a forklift caused him significant leg pain.
taylor application was denied initially and upon reconsideration,prompting him to request a hearing before an alj.on march,alj carlton bailey,held a hearing at which taylor and a medical expert,david abramson,testified.because taylor was already receiving ssi benefits and his insured status for title ii disability benefits expired on march,the alj acknowledged that the only issue to be resolved was when taylor became onset date.in order to be entitled to dib,an individual must establish that the disability arose while he or she was insured for benefits.see a a,c stevenson chater,cir.
at the hearing,taylor testified that by early,his impairments were so severe that he was only able to walk approximately block before his legs would cramp,forcing him to rest and massage them.he also testified that the pain prevented him from helping with household chores,visiting friends,or taking part in his favorite pastimes.in late or early after the expiration of his insured status,taylor developed a leg ulcer that did not heal.by,he was able to walk only ten or twelve steps without having to sit down.after undergoing femoral bypass surgery in to remove a blockage in a main artery,the pain in his legs lessened somewhat and he was able to walk about two blocks.shortly thereafter,he underwent another operation,this time to alleviate stomach pain.following this procedure,his doctor instructed him to refrain from lifting more than twenty pounds.
the evidence submitted with taylor claim included medical records covering the period prior to the expiration of his insured status.between and,taylor visited the chicago hamblin medical center on several occasions.on december,he complained of nausea and dizziness and was referred for testing to rule out the possibility of an tumor.his treatment notes on december,although mostly illegible,indicated that taylor was to be released to return to work on january.notes taken on january,reported rectal bleeding,weight loss,and dizziness.taylor next saw a doctor on january,for bilateral leg cramps after walking a block or so.the doctor prescribed trental to treat his leg pain.february,medical notes indicated that taylor again complained of leg pain on this visit.the doctor did not conduct any tests to explore what was causing this condition he simply instructed taylor to continue treatment at home.
taylor had continual health problems from forward.he went to the doctor on may,after the expiration of his insured status,complaining of back pain and pain in both legs and the inability to walk more than a block without resting his weight had also dropped pounds.on a january,visit,taylor reported pain in the left leg,and the doctor notes recorded poor peripheral pulses.a few days later,on january,he returned to the medical center.notes from that visit report a history of alcoholism and peripheral neuropathy.taylor was hospitalized for the ulcer in the left leg,abdominal aorta occlusion,obstructive chronic bronchitis,and cellulitis of the leg from june to july.a june,consultation report for vascular surgery indicated a of claudication pain in the lower extremities,with severe hip pain lasting six to seven months,and a ulcer in the left leg.on june,his angiograms revealed a complete occlusion in an artery for which he underwent bypass surgery to remove the blockage and to repair blood vessels on june.
the medical expert,abramson,opined that taylor had disabling conditions as of,including severe arteriosclerosis obliterans,a block in the abdominal aorta,and intermittent claudication,which causes pain when the muscles are being exercised.the doctor was unsure,however,how long the conditions had existed.he explained that these are slowly progressing ailments,in some cases taking three years or longer to develop and in others a shorter period of time,depending on an individual rate of cholesterol metabolism.abramson believed that the only way to establish an onset date would be to review the objective data from treatment tests conducted during the qualifying time period that is,from the claimant alleged onset date until the last date insured for references to the absence or reduction of pulses or whether signs of arteriosclerosis were present in the lower extremities.he suggested that the ssi application file might provide some of this information.
after the hearing,the alj found that taylor did not have a severe impairment on or before march,when his insured status expired and thus he was not entitled to dib.the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner on july,when the appeals council denied taylor request for review.
taylor subsequently filed a complaint in district court seeking review of the agency denial of benefits pursuant to g.on september,magistrate judge arlander keys reversed the alj decision and remanded the case for further proceedings.see taylor massanari,c,wl,at.judge keys found that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence because it failed to apply social security ruling ssr when it rejected taylor alleged onset date without determining whether that date was consistent with the available medical evidence.he explained that under ssr,the alj can not reject the claimant testimony solely on the basis that there was no objective proof of his alleged onset date.judge keys also found that the alj did not fully develop the record,because he neither consulted taylor ssi application file nor explained his reasons for proceeding without it.
taylor died on june,apparently of lung cancer,but applications under title ii do not automatically expire upon the death of a claimant if a party in interest including a beneficiary is able to maintain the integrity of the application.see.on remand,alj bailey held a supplemental hearing on november,to receive the testimony of lola,taylor domestic partner of seventeen years,ashok jilhewar,a medical expert,and richard hamersma,a vocational expert.
testified that taylor stopped working in because he could no longer perform his job as a forklift operator and that he used to come home and complain about leg cramps.he had cramps in his leg about every both day and night,and he woke up frequently during the night because of the pain.by her account,the cramps grew worse in august,and as a result taylor ceased driving.
jilhewar opined that taylor had disabling conditions on january,based on the pulse measurements taken that day,but he was unsure how long these conditions existed.he stated that he did not know whether the earlier records indication of normal extremities were based on pulse measures or purely subjective observations.he also agreed with abramson determination that taylor had longstanding claudication of the lower extremities,and that although it was possible that this condition had existed in,he could not tell from the record whether taylor had this condition prior to january.jilhewar also admitted that the drug the doctor prescribed to taylor on january,trental,was strong evidence that the doctor was thinking of a peripheral vascular disease but again,he could not offer an opinion about the severity of the condition without pulse measurements.finally,jilhewar was unable to comment on how much of a physical limitation taylor had after january,although he did draw the inference from the data that taylor was affected by that time.
on january,the alj issued his decision,repeating his previous conclusion that the evidence did not show that taylor was disabled prior to january.he found that although taylor impairments were severe enough to prevent him from performing any of his past relevant work prior to march,as of that date taylor still had the residual functional capacity rfc to perform a significant range of light work in the national economy.he therefore concluded that taylor was ineligible for dib.
briscoe,taylor sister and a party in interest,sought judicial review of the alj decision and the case was assigned to magistrate judge morton denlow.for ease of reference,we continue to refer to taylor as the plaintiff throughout this opinion.judge denlow reversed the alj denial of benefits,finding that it was not supported by substantial evidence.at the outset,he noted that the alj had failed to follow judge keys instructions to apply ssr,or to discuss the ssi file or to explain why the alj proceeded without the file.in addition,the alj decision was reversible on a number of other grounds.the alj failed to apply the analysis mandated by ssr to determine the onset date of disability.he also failed to fulfill his obligation to build a full record,because he did not discuss the ssi file or explain why he proceeded without the file.nor did he consider taylor testimony from the hearing or explain why he rejected that testimony.judge denlow also found that the alj should not have rejected testimony.as a remedy,the court remanded the case for an award of benefits.
the commissioner appeals,arguing that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence.in the alternative,she argues that the district court erred in awarding taylor disability benefits rather than issuing a remand for further proceedings.
the standard of review in disability cases limits this court as well as the district court to determining whether the final decision of the commissioner is both supported by substantial evidence and based on the proper legal criteria.scheck barnhart,cir quotation marks omitted.the court will conduct a critical review of the evidence,considering both the evidence that supports,as well as the evidence that detracts from,the commissioner decision,and the decision can not stand if it lacks evidentiary support or an adequate discussion of the issues.lopez ex rel.lopez barnhart,cir quotation marks omitted.in addition to relying on substantial evidence,the alj must also explain his analysis of the evidence with enough detail and clarity to permit meaningful appellate review.see herron shalala,cir.
in order to qualify for disability benefits,a claimant must be found disabled,under the ssa.a e.the act defines disability as the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.id.at d a.the social security regulations prescribe a sequential test for determining whether a claimant is disabled.the alj must consider whether the claimant is presently employed the claimant has a severe impairment or combination of impairments the claimant impairment meets or equals any impairment listed in the regulations as being so severe as to preclude substantial gainful activity the claimant residual functional capacity leaves him unable to perform his past relevant work and the claimant is unable to perform any other work existing in significant numbers in the national economy.a finding of disability requires an affirmative answer at either step three or step five.the claimant bears the burden of proof at steps one through four,after which at step five the burden shifts to the commissioner.see young barnhart,cir.
the alj found that taylor impairments met regulation listings on january,and that taylor was disabled as of that date.unfortunately,that date is well beyond the expiration of his insured status,and thus this finding did not in itself resolve the case.the alj therefore properly turned to the question whether taylor impairments rendered him disabled prior to march.where,as here,a claimant is found disabled but it is necessary to decide whether the disability arose at an earlier date,the alj is required to apply the analytical framework outlined in ssr to determine the onset date of disability.see perkins chater,cir lichter bowen,cir.
ssr defines the onset date of disability as the first day an individual is disabled as defined in the act and the regulations.ssr at.in the case of slowly progressive impairments,ssr does not require an impairment to have reached the severity of an impairment listed in the regulations,as required under step three,but t he onset date should be set on the date when it is most reasonable to conclude from the evidence that the impairment was sufficiently severe to prevent the individual from engaging in sga or gainful activity for a continuous period of at least months or result in death.ssr at see armstrong comm r,cir stating that the onset date is determined by the date when the impairment became disabling and not just present blankenship bowen,cir same.
the alj did not refer to ssr specifically in his decision,but this omission by itself is not reversible error.see pugh bowen,cir.we must determine whether the alj nevertheless properly applied the requisite analysis.our review of the decision leads us to conclude that he did not.
after finding that taylor was disabled as of january,the alj proceeded to consider what taylor could do before that date.he concluded that taylor retained the residual functional capacity to 
pounds frequently and pounds occasionally,pounds frequently and pounds occasionally,sit hours in an day,walk hours in an day,stand hours in an day,avoid all exposure to temperature extremes,avoid concentrated exposure to,and no commercial driving.
contrary to ssr,however,the alj did not explain how he arrived at these conclusions this omission in itself is sufficient to warrant reversal of the alj decision.see ssr at rfc assessment must include a narrative discussion describing how the evidence supports each conclusion,citing specific medical facts.
worse than that,the record contains no evidence that would support the alj description of taylor rfc.jilhewar disclaimed the ability to infer the limits of taylor residual functional capacity prior to january.in fact,he stated that t here was no establishment of any restrictions,or any e ffect on the residual functional capacity,until,and then after,there was a limitation,but how much,i do not know the answer.
in opining that taylor impairments first met regulation listing severity on january,jilhewar relied solely on the first recording of poor peripheral pulses in the medical records.but he also stated that he was unable to infer from the record how long taylor had met listing severity because the earlier records did not contain objective evidence of the progression of taylor impairments.if the alj based his rfc determination on this first date of diagnosis,it is contrary to ssr which holds that in the case of slowly progressive impairments,it is not necessary for an impairment to have reached listing severity be decided on medical grounds alone before onset can be established.ssr at see lichter,at holding that under ssr,the alj may not rely on
