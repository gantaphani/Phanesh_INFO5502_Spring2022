the panel held that the issue before the district court on the original merits appeal of the alj denial of benefits was not whether there was other evidence that could support a denial of benefits to plaintiff,or whether the commissioner denial of benefits might ultimately be sustained,but rather whether the actual decision that was made by the alj could be affirmed at that time by the district court in light on the new evidence in the record.the panel further held that it should have been plain that the alj decision could not have been affirmed,because the alj failed to provide a reason that was still viable for giving the treating doctor opinion little weight.the panel held that the treating doctor final report,if credited,would have undermined the alj original finding that plaintiff was not disabled.the panel concluded that the commissioner did not have a legitimate basis to oppose remand and to argue that the district court should affirm the existing alj opinion and the district court,by applying the wrong legal standard to evaluate the commissioner litigation position,abused its discretion.
nguyen,circuit judge 
kimberley gardner appeals the district court denial of her application for attorney fees pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja,d a.we reverse and remand.
after losing her claim for social security disability benefits before the administrative law judge alj,gardner presented new evidence a final report by her treating doctor,rory richardson to the appeals council.in light of this new evidence in the administrative record before the appeals council,the district court remanded for further consideration.the commissioner did not appeal this decision.but the district court denied gardner request for attorney fees,concluding that the commissioner was substantially justified in arguing that the new evidence did not undermine the alj denial of benefits.implicit in the commissioner litigation position,however,was an assumption that the alj on remand either would reject or give little weight to the treating doctor opinion.there is simply no support for this assumption.the alj had not previously considered the merits of richardson opinion and,if credited,that opinion would undoubtedly bolster gardner claim that she is disabled.on this record,the commissioner was not substantially justified in arguing otherwise.
gardner applied for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income based on her adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd and anxiety.the commissioner denied her claims initially and upon reconsideration.
at the next level of review,the alj considered evidence including gardner testimony regarding her symptoms and inability to work the interim opinion of physician rory richardson that gardner had depressive disorder with concomitant disorder and adhd that was likely to prevent her from being able to maintain attention span,complete tasks,and function in a gainful employment setting despite medications and treatment the opinion of examining physician james bryan that gardner exaggerated her symptoms and suffered from no condition that would significantly impede her employability and the opinion of nonexamining psychological consultant paul rethinger that gardner mental impairments limit her to work involving simple,unrushed tasks and requiring little social interaction,but that gardner limitations did not render her disabled.
the alj,performing the social security administration usual evaluation process concluded that gardner was not disabled.he found at steps two and three that she had severe impairments of adhd,somatoform disorder,borderline personality features,and chondromalacia patella,but that these conditions did not meet or equal a listed impairment.the alj found at steps four and five that gardner was able to perform both her past relevant work as a personal attendant and other jobs that exist in the national economy such as marker and garment sorter.
in reaching these findings,the alj found gardner credible to the extent she suffers from some type of impairment but found that her statements concerning the intensity,persistence,and limiting effects of these symptoms were not credible.he found that her treatment records demonstrate these symptoms are well maintained when she takes her medications as directed by her treatment providers.the alj gave little weight to richardson interim report,explaining that it is only an interim report and richardson has not completed a full assessment,indicating a degree of speculation in reaching his conclusions.the alj found bryan assessment persuasive and gave it significant weight.the alj assigned rethinger opinion great weight because he concluded that it was generally consistent with the record.
gardner sought review of the alj decision by the appeals council.when subsequent reports by physician richardson collectively,the final report became available after he had treated her on several occasions,gardner submitted them to the appeals council for consideration.as before,richardson concluded that d espite medications and treatment,she continues to have impairment of function which is likely to prevent her from being able to maintain attention span,complete tasks,and function in a gainful employment setting.this time,however,richardson did not qualify his opinion as interim.he also opined that gardner is plagued by obsessive compulsive patterns which severely delay her ability to leave the house and frequently is unable to do so without the assistance of her partner.the appeals council included richardson final report in the administrative record but denied review.
gardner then filed this action in the district court.she argued that the case should be remanded to the alj for an award of benefits because substantial evidence supported her disability in light of richardson final report.the commissioner argued that even with this additional evidence in the record,the alj decision remained supported by substantial evidence and should be affirmed.
in findings and recommendations adopted in whole by the district court,the magistrate judge opined that the alj properly rejected richardson opinion based on the record as it stood at the time of the alj decision,the interim report.the magistrate judge reasoned that richardson was at the time of the interim report only an examining physician and the alj provided a specific and legitimate reason for rejecting his opinion its preliminary nature that was supported by the record.
the magistrate judge concluded that the commissioner decision should be reversed,however,because further administrative proceedings are generally appropriate if the alj has not had the opportunity to consider significant additional evidence.pointing to richardson opinion in the final report that gardner impairments would likely prevent her from functioning in a competitive employment setting,the magistrate judge had little doubt that a finding of disability would be required if richardson opinion were fully credited.
the district court entered judgment remanding the case to the alj to address richardson final report as gardner treating physician.the commissioner did not appeal the decision.gardner moved for attorney fees pursuant to eaja,which the commissioner oppos
