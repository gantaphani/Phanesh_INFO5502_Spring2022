background 
in march,mansfield underwent gallbladder surgery at a department of veterans affairs medical facility.his bowel was perforated during the surgery,which resulted in various postoperative complications and procedures,including a permanent colostomy.mansfield subsequently elected to pursue a claim for negligence under the ftca.see b.on january,he submitted to the va a standard form,seeking in compensation for his injuries mansfield wife also submitted an,claiming for her loss of services and consortium.when the mansfields claims were not resolved administratively,they initiated suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of michigan,seeking a combined total recovery of under the ftca.the mansfields eventually settled their claims for a total of for the mansfields and for their attorney.accordingly,the district court dismissed the case with prejudice on february.
upon settlement,mansfield va claims file was transferred to the va central office located in washington,on june,gary hickman,the va director of compensation and pension services,sent a letter to the va regional office in detroit,michigan.the letter explained that mansfield negligence claim had been settled and that,pursuant to a,any award of va benefits based on the same disability was subject to offset by the amount of the settlement.the letter further stated 
review of the claims folder reveals a claim for benefits has been filed which meets the requirements of cfr.accordingly,development should be undertaken upon completion of the required development,the material received,together with the claims folder,should be referred to the rating board for a decision as to entitlement to benefits under 
the record does not reflect that the va regional office took any action with respect to this letter.
on october,mansfield submitted a form statement in support of claim to the.on that form,he claimed entitlement to va benefits for the permanent colostomy he endured as a result of his march surgery.the va granted mansfield request for benefits pursuant to.in general terms,section provides that veterans disabled as a result of negligent treatment at va medical facilities shall be compensated as if their disabilities are.see a the va assigned an effective date of october,for mansfield disability,which corresponded to the date mansfield form was received in addition,however,the va notified mansfield that his monthly checks would be withheld until an amount equaling his ftca settlement had been recovered.see b a 
mansfield subsequently appealed to the board,arguing for an earlier effective date.among other things,he contended that his january,submission constituted an informal claim for section benefits.in order to determine whether mansfield constituted a claim for section benefits,the board turned to the governing va regulation,which provided 
a formal claim for pension,compensation,dependency and indemnity compensation or any statement in a communication showing an intent to file a claim for disability or for death benefits resulting from the pursuit of a course of vocational rehabilitation,hospitalization,medical or surgical treatment,or examination under department of veterans affairs laws may be accepted as a claim.
emphasis added under this standard,the board concluded that mansfield submission did not constitute a claim for section benefits.that was because his did not contain an expression of intent to apply for such benefits.rather,the merely indicated mansfield intent to file a claim for tort damages,which,the board reasoned,was quite different from a claim for va benefits.
notwithstanding its conclusion with respect to the,the board determined that mansfield was entitled to an effective date earlier than october,effective date that had been assigned by the.the basis for that earlier effective date was the director june,letter.the board was unable to reconcile its conclusion that there was no document in the record satisfying the requirements of with the director contrary statement,recited above,that r eview of the claims folder reveals a claim for benefits has been filed which meets the requirements of cfr.the board stated in the absence of any means for reconciling the conflict,the board must find that the evidence of record with respect to the question of whether a claim was in fact of record in june is in relative equipoise and that the benefit of the doubt must be resolved in favor of the veteran.the board therefore held that mansfield claim for section benefits was entitled to an effective date of june.
after initially remanding the case to the board for additional explanation,the veterans court affirmed.the court agreed with the board conclusion that mansfield did not constitute a claim for section benefits and that he was therefore not entitled to an effective date of january.mansfield,wl,at.the court disagreed,however,with the board determination that mansfield was entitled to an effective date of june,based upon the director letter.id.at.the court stated that the proper effective date for mansfield award of va benefits is october,since no document in the record could constitute a claim for va benefits until that date.id.nevertheless,the court explained that it would not disturb the effective date assigned by the board because the error resulted in a benefit to mansfield.id.this appeal followed.we have jurisdiction over the appeal pursuant to.
discussion 
on appeal,mansfield presents two arguments.he first contends that the board and veterans court erred in denying an effective date of january.he argues that,under a correct interpretation of the relevant va regulations,the submission of an notifying the va of a negligence claim under the ftca constitutes an informal claim for section benefits.second,mansfield argues that the va delay with respect to developing his claim for section benefits,despite the director instruction to do so,amounted to a denial of due process.
our authority to review decisions of the veterans court is governed by statute.pursuant to c,we have exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under this section,and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.however,e xcept to the extent that an appeal under this chapter presents a constitutional issue,we may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.d.mansfield arguments plainly invoke our jurisdiction under section.his first contention relates to the interpretation of va regulations his second presents a constitutional issue.we address each of these,in turn.
we first address mansfield argument that,under va regulations,the submission of an constitutes an informal claim for section benefits.he specifically argues that,in concluding to the contrary,the veterans court failed to apply c,which provides when disability or death is due to department of veterans affairs hospital treatment,training,medical or surgical treatment,or examination,a specific application for benefits will not be initiated emphasis added according to mansfield,the import of this regulation is that claims for disability benefits as a result of va hospital care do not require the submission of any specific application.he argues that his ftca submission put the va on notice of his core contention that he was entitled to compensation for the injuries he sustained as a result of his gallbladder surgery.in rejecting his as an informal claim for section benefits,
