christopher kangas was a apprentice firefighter with the brookhaven fire department.messick.at.the brookhaven fire department authorized fourteen and old apprentice firefighters to participate in training activities to provide first aid care to victims at emergency scenes to engage in canteen food service activities to participate in a support capacity in connection with search and rescue operations,wild fires,hazardous materials incidents,and water supply operations and to assist with activities,such as rolling hoses,putting away portable tools,and removing debris outside of fire buildings and collapse zones.christopher,who had been an apprentice firefighter since may,was issued official firefighting equipment and had completed hours of training in a variety of areas related to firefighting.id.
on may,an automobile struck christopher at an intersection.at the time of the accident,christopher was riding his bicycle from his house to the brookhaven fire station in response to a fire alarm.id.at.as a result of the accident,christopher sustained serious injuries and died.id.at.according to the november,report of the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh,christopher was not wearing a helmet and crossed the intersection without stopping at the stop sign.
on may,filed a claim with bja for psoba death benefits.id.at.on september,bja issued an initial determination denying the claim.id.bja determined that christopher was a trainee but did not possess authority to act as an official firefighter and thus was not a public safety officer pursuant to psoba.id.bja noted that christopher was only permitted to participate in training activities,to provide first aid care,to assist with activities,to support canteen activities,and to participate in a support capacity for operations such as searches and rescues.bja also noted that christopher was not permitted to operate equipment or assist with fire suppression at fire scenes or enter hazardous atmospheres.id.
on march,sought reconsideration of the initial denial of benefits.id.in accordance with bja regulations,the matter was referred to a hearing officer,who received evidence and held a hearing in his april,decision,the hearing officer sustained the initial denial of benefits based on his conclusion that christopher was not a firefighter under psoba.id.at.the hearing officer acknowledged that psoba did not define firefighter as one engaged in the suppression of fires,but concluded that congress intended the term firefighter to mean an individual authorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires.id.the hearing officer based his conclusion on the plain meaning of the term firefighter as well as his interpretation of legislative intent id.additionally,the hearing officer cited to the definition of line of duty in bja implementing regulations to support his conclusion that one must be authorized to fight or suppress fires to be a firefighter under the statute.id.the hearing officer also noted that under pennsylvania law fourteen and old junior firefighters are prohibited from being directly involved in the suppression of fires.id.
on june,in accordance with i i,requested that bja reconsider the hearing officer denial of death benefits.see i a claimant determined ineligible by a hearing officer may,within days after notification of the hearing officer determination i request the bja director to review the record and the hearing officer determination current version at.on april,the director of bja,in the final agency decision,affirmed the hearing officer denial of benefits based on the conclusion that christopher was not a firefighter or public safety officer within the meaning of psoba.id.at.the director additionally concluded that e ven if christopher were a firefighter within the meaning of the psob act which he was not,his tragic death did not occur in the line of duty,as defined in the psob regulations,because pennsylvania law did not obligate or authorize him to engage in or activity.id.
on june,filed a complaint in the court of federal claims to challenge bja denial of her claim under psoba as noted above,the parties,in due course,for judgment based upon the administrative record.the court concluded that bja denial of death benefits was arbitrary and capricious and founded on an unreasonably restrictive reading of the words of psoba and implementing regulations.id.at.the court found that christopher was a firefighter who died in the line of duty because christopher primary function was to be a part of the team that engaged in the suppression of fires.id.the court therefore granted motion for judgment on the administrative record and denied the government.id.at.
the united states timely appealed the judgment of the court of federal claims to this court on may.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
our review of bja denial of a claim for death benefits is limited to three inquiries whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action on the part of the government officials involved and whether substantial evidence supports the decision denying the claim.yanco,at chacon united states.we review the judgment of the court of federal claims de novo,applying this deferential standard anew.greeley united states.
the government argues on appeal that we should defer to bja permissible construction of firefighter in line with chevron natural resources defense council,d.the government contends that because the term firefighter is ambiguous with respect to whether it covers a minor apprentice firefighter,we must inquire,under step two of the chevron analysis,whether bja conclusion that christopher was not a firefighter because he was not authorized to fight fires was reasonable.according to the government,bja interpretation of firefighter was permissible in light of pennsylvania state law the ordinary,common meaning of the term and the legislative history of psoba.
additionally,the government makes two alternative arguments.first,the government argues that even if christopher was a firefighter pursuant to psoba,bja interpretation of line of duty is reasonable and therefore we should uphold its determination that christopher did not die in the line of duty.second,the government contends that even if christopher was a firefighter who died in the line of duty,the government is entitled to a remand of the case for a determination by bja as to whether the circumstances of christopher failure to wear a helmet and to stop before entering the intentional misconduct or gross negligence so as to preclude the payment of a benefit under the statute.see.
in response to the government arguments,argues that psoba is clear and unambiguous in its broad definition of firefighter.further,she contends that even if the term firefighter is ambiguous,bja interpretation of the term is arbitrary and capricious,given that the statute and regulations are easily understood without adding limitations.also directs our attention to the fact that she received benefits under the pennsylvania emergency law enforcement personnel death benefits act.stat.ann,as support for her argument that she should have received benefits under psoba.specifically,argues that requires bja to give substantial weight to state and local agencies findings.
with respect to the government line of duty alternative argument,contends that because christopher primary function was to be a part of a team that engaged in the suppression of fires,christopher died in the line of duty.finally,urges that there are three reasons why we should reject the government request for a remand.first,she notes that,under a the lower court decision whether to remand is discretionary.second,she contends that the record contains insufficient evidence to support a determination of intentional misconduct or gross negligence,given that the niosh report is the only item in the record that mentions christopher failure to wear a helmet and to stop at the stop sign.third,argues that the failure to wear a helmet and to stop at the stop sign does not rise to the level of intentional misconduct or gross negligence.
we hold that the court of federal claims erred in granting judgment on the administrative record in favor of and in denying judgment on the administrative record in favor of the united states.we agree with the government argument that bja construction of the term firefighter is permissible.
in united states mead,the supreme court explained that 
a dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.
d.the supreme court further noted,we have recognized a very good indicator of delegation meriting chevron treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.id.at.here,because congress expressly authorized bja to issue regulations interpreting psoba and to make determinations as to eligibility for benefits,we conclude that congress intended for a bja pronouncement to have the force of law.see the bureau is authorized to establish such rules,regulations,and procedures as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.we therefore will defer to bja interpretation of firefighter,so long as it is reasonable in accordance with chevron.
when chevron deference applies,the court must undertake a inquiry.first,the court must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.if,however,the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
here,the precise question at issue is whether the term firefighter in covers a minor prohibited by law from engaging in certain firefighting activities.in that regard,we are not persuaded by argument that psoba is clear and unambiguous in its broad definition of firefighter.argues that neither the statute nor the regulations supply age or duty requirements or add other limitations to the definition of firefighter.we think,however,that this argument indicates congress has not directly spoken to the precise question of whether the term firefighter covers a minor apprentice firefighter.we also think argument that the drafters of psoba chose to use includes rather than means or is defined in the definition of firefighter,because they intended for psoba to have a broader interpretation fails.in our view,congress used the word includes in order to ensure that the act covered volunteer firefighters as well as professional firefighters,at the bill defines firemen to include volunteer as well as professional firemen.if congress had defined firefighter to mean an individual serving as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized volunteer fire department,professional firefighters would have been excluded from statutory coverage.accordingly,we conclude that congress has not directly spoken to the question of whether the term firefighter in covers a minor apprentice firefighter prohibited by law from engaging in certain firefighting activities.
under the second prong of the chevron analysis,we must determine whether bja decision to exclude from the definition of firefighter a minor apprentice firefighter not authorized to fight fires represents a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.we conclude that bja interpretation of firefighter as one who is authorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires is permissible based on the ordinary meaning of the term firefighter as well as the legislative history of the act.
the ordinary,common meaning of the term firefighter as a person who fights fires is consistent with bja interpretation of firefighter.see collegiate dictionary ed see also the new shorter oxford english dictionary a person whose task is to extinguish fires webster third new int l dictionary one who fights fires.we agree with the government argument that there is no indication in the act itself of any legislative intent to depart from this ordinary meaning.the legislative history,moreover,supports bja interpretation of the term firefighter in accordance with its ordinary meaning.the house judiciary committee report contains the following statement since fire fighting has been determined to be one of the most hazardous professions,the committee is of the opinion that coverage should extend to all activities performed by firemen when they are actually and directly engaged in fighting fires,at.we thus conclude that bja interpretation of the term firefighter as one who is authorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires is a permissible construction of the statute,and is not,as argued by,arbitrary and capricious.
based on our conclusion that bja interpretation of firefighter is permissible,the only remaining question is whether bja decision that christopher is not authorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires and therefore not a firefighter pursuant to psoba is reasonable.according to pennsylvania state law,as a minor under sixteen years of age,christopher activities were expressly limited to training,first aid,and providing coffee wagon and food services.stat.c.the authorization to engage in these limited activities does not equate to the authorization to actively engage in the suppression of fires.further,given that pennsylvania state law prohibits minors under the age of sixteen from operating high pressure hose lines except during training,from ascending ladders except during training,from entering a burning structure.stat.c,and from riding an official vehicle to the scene of a fire and participating in any fire fighting activities,a,we conclude that bja decision that christopher was not authorized to engage in the suppression of fires was reasonable.
additionally,we find unpersuasive contention that the fact she received benefits under the pennsylvania emergency law enforcement personnel death benefits act supports her claim under psoba.bja implementing regulation,only applies to findings of fact and does not apply to the ultimate conclusion of whether a claimant is entitled to a benefit see demutiis united states.bja was not required to give substantial weight to the state agency legal conclusion that was entitled to receive death benefits under state law.
in sum,we hold that bja interpretation of the term firefighter as one who is authorized to actively engage in the suppression of fires is permissible in light of the ordinary,common meaning of the term firefighter and the legislative history of psoba.we also hold that bja did not err in its determination that christopher was not a firefighter under psoba,given that pennsylvania state law does not authorize him to participate in firefighting activities and,instead,expressly limits his activities to activities.
finally,in view of our disposition of the appeal based upon our holding that christopher was not a firefighter pursuant to psoba,we do not need to reach the government two alternative arguments noted above.
conclusion 
for the foregoing reasons,the judgment of the court of federal claims in favor of is reversed.the case is remanded to the court of federal claims,which is instructed to enter judgment in favor of the united states and to dismiss the complaint.
each party shall bear its own costs.
reversed and remanded.
christopher kangas,age,was an apprentice firefighter,also called a junior firefighter,at brookhaven fire department.he was killed in an accident on his bicycle while responding to a fire call.his family requested the statutory compensation that is granted,in accordance with the public safety officers benefits act psoba,to families of firefighters and other public safety officers who die in the line of duty.the family also sought to recognize his memory by inscription on the national fallen firefighters foundation honor roll of firefighters who die in service this recognition was denied after the government denied firefighter benefits under the psoba.
the psoba definition states firefighter includes an individual serving as an officially recognized or designated member of a legally organized fire department.volunteer firefighters,serving as needed and without compensation,are included.id.at a a public safety officer means an individual serving a public agency in an official capacity,with or without compensation,as a law enforcement officer,as a firefighter,as a chaplain,or as a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew.
the psoba is administered by the department of justice through its bureau of justice assistance bja.the bja held that kangas was not a firefighter because as a junior firefighter under the age of he could not,in accordance with pennsylvania law,engage in certain firefighting activities.firefighters under the age of sixteen are prohibited,in pennsylvania,from entering burning buildings and from climbing ladders or operating hose lines other than during training.
the court of federal claims,reviewing the testimony of pennsylvania firefighting officials,agreed with these officials that kangas was part of the firefighting team.at the hearing before the bja,the brookhaven fire chief,rob montella,testified as follows 
the junior firefighter is part of the team.they are just as much a part of being a firefighter as anybody else out there.they do all the jobs that they need to do.they help out.the jobs that they do are very important.if they not there,somebody else has to do the job.if you do have the manpower them jobs are getting done.they getting done by them other guys that are doing different jobs that they allowed to do.so the junior firefighter is a vital part of the fire department.
the pennsylvania state fire commissioner also testified,stating that the pennsylvania death benefits statute makes no distinction between firefighters and other firefighters who die in the line of duty,and that kangas had been so recognized and placed on the state honor roll of fallen firefighters.the fire commissioner testified that the state death benefits statute makes no distinction among junior,apprentice,or other firefighters and that age or service capacity are not barriers to state death benefits.
the court of federal claims observed that the federal statute does not exclude apprentice firefighters who die under conditions in which a would be recognized the testimony of the brookhaven fire chief and pennsylvania fire commissioner was clear that the duties performed by the apprentice firefighters freed the senior firefighters for other tasks,and that the apprentices tasks are a necessary and integral part of the team effort in fighting fires.
the court of federal claims summarized the evidence as follows 
christopher had been issued official firefighter equipment.he had completed hours of training and had trained in different areas related to firefighting,including rescue operations,the functions of an air pack,electronics,carbon monoxide detection and hose rolling.christopher also was certified in cpr and had responded to house drills.the brookhaven fire department had authorized christopher to be part of the firefighting team by participating at the scene of a fire,including bringing out portable equipment and fire hoses,providing food,drink and first aid to the other firefighters,and cleaning up after fires that were under control.after christopher death,the brookhaven,pennsylvania,volunteer fire department added his name to the honor roll of its deceased members.christopher was the only person on the honor roll to have died in what the department determined was the line of duty.
at.the court concluded that kangas service was within the scope of the psoba,whose purpose was to encourage and recognize persons who formally participate in public safety activities.
on appeal by the united states,my colleagues now endorse the federal government position that christopher kangas
