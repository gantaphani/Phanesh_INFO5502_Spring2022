the secretary of veterans affairs appeals from a decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court directing that specially adapted housing benefits be awarded to dee kilpatrick,a disabled veteran.because we agree with the veterans court that kilpatrick is entitled to the housing benefits at issue,we affirm.
kilpatrick served on active duty in the united states army from to.his military service entitled him to medical treatment from the department of veterans affairs dva.in the early,kilpatrick sought treatment at a dva medical center for back pain,a condition not related to his military service.the medical personnel at the dva medical center determined that a ruptured disc in kilpatrick spine was the source of his pain,and they attempted to repair the injury surgically on april.
the surgery resulted in severe complications.the record indicates that before the surgery kilpatrick had the use of both of his legs and control of his bladder and bowel functions.after the surgery,kilpatrick could not walk or use his legs and had lost bowel and bladder control.the dva determined that the disabilities that afflicted kilpatrick following the surgery were not the natural consequence of the procedure and rated him as percent disabled as the result of the medical treatment he had received at the dva medical center.
kilpatrick applied for disability compensation under title,chapter.chapter compensation is normally reserved for veterans with disabilities.see.however,section of title provides compensation for veterans like kilpatrick who are disabled as a result of va medical or surgical treatment.at the time of kilpatrick claims,section provided as follows,in pertinent part 
where any veteran shall have suffered an injury,or an aggravation of an injury,as the result of hospitalization,medical or surgical treatment,awarded under any of the laws administered by the secretary,or as a result of having submitted to an examination under any such law,and not the result of such veteran own willful misconduct,and such injury or aggravation results in additional disability to or the death of such veteran,disability or death compensation under this chapter and dependency and indemnity compensation under chapter of this title shall be awarded in the same manner as if such disability,aggravation,or death were.
section has been substantially revised,see,but not in a way that affects the issue presented in this case.
in accordance with section,the dva awarded kilpatrick special monthly compensation under chapter for loss of use of both legs and loss of bowel and bladder control.in august of,kilpatrick applied for additional benefits to assist him in dealing with his disability the specially adapted housing benefits provided under,and the automobile and adaptive equipment benefits provided under.a regional office of the dva denied his request for those benefits,and he appealed the denial to the board of veterans appeals.while his appeal before the board was pending,the dva office of general counsel issued a precedential opinion in another case in which the general counsel office concluded that section beneficiaries were not eligible for the special housing and automobile benefits under and.when reviewing kilpatrick case,the board treated the general counsel opinion as binding and characterized it as follows 
t he general counsel opinion determined that a veteran with a disability that resulted from va hospitalization or medical or surgical treatment who has been determined eligible for compensation as if such injury were pursuant to section is not eligible for either a special housing adaptation grant or a grant for acquiring an automobile and adaptive equipment as a result of the disability caused by va medical care.essentially,the benefits currently sought by the veteran,as provided under chapters and,are beyond the scope of the grant of benefits provided under.
because the board is bound by precedential opinions of the dva general counsel,see,and because kilpatrick claims for chapter and chapter benefits were based on disabilities resulting from va medical care and not from military service,the board concluded that kilpatrick was not entitled to those benefits.
kilpatrick appealed the board decision to the veterans court.as to the housing benefits claim,the court reversed the board decision.the court found section a to be plain on its face.that section authorizes the dva 
to assist any veteran who is entitled to compensation under chapter of this title for permanent and total disability due to the loss,or loss of use,of both lower extremities in acquiring a suitable housing unit with special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary by the nature of the veteran disability,and necessary land therefor.
a.the veterans court reasoned that kilpatrick was eligible for housing assistance because,under section,he was entitled to the same chapter compensation that is due to a veteran who had suffered a permanent and total disability.accordingly,the court held that the dva regulation governing housing benefits,is invalid to the extent that it is interpreted to exclude beneficiaries by requiring that a listed disability be incurred or aggravated as the result of active service.the court likewise held that the general counsel opinion addressing the eligibility of section beneficiaries is invalid in purporting to bar a beneficiary from eligibility.the court noted that although section a could be read to establish a discretionary program,the secretary discretion would be only as to whether to implement or not the program for the beneficiaries prescribed by congress.there is no reason to believe that congress gave him leave to pick and choose from the classes to which congress granted eligibility.
with respect to kilpatrick claim for automobile benefits,the court ruled that the board decision on that issue was deficient in terms of an adequate statement of reasons or bases.the court therefore remanded the automobile benefits issue for further consideration in light of the language and legislative history of chapter.
the government appeals from the veterans court award of the housing benefit.we have jurisdiction over the appeal as to the housing claim,notwithstanding the veterans court remand of the automobile claim,because the two are not parts of the same claim,but are distinct claims having separate legal sources and therefore may be appealed separately.see smith gober,elkins gober.
the parties agree that kilpatrick disability is not because the injury he suffered as a consequence of his surgery did not occur while he was on active duty.the parties further agree that kilpatrick is entitled under section to the same compensation under chapter of title that a person with an actual disability is entitled to receive.the dispute is over whether kilpatrick is entitled to the same housing benefits under chapter of title that would be available to a veteran with a disability.that question turns on the interpretation of section a,which provides that chapter benefits may be extended to any veteran who is entitled to compensation under chapter of this title for permanent and total disability.according to the government,section a means that chapter benefits are available only to that subset of all chapter beneficiaries who receive compensation for a permanent and total disability.according to kilpatrick,section a means that chapter benefits are available to all persons who are compensated under chapter in the same manner as veterans with permanent and total disabilities.the difference,of course,is that kilpatrick qualifies under the second interpretation of the statutory language,but not under the first.
the government argues that this is a plain language case and that the text of section a is dispositive in its favor.the government reads section a as containing two requirements the veteran must have a disability that qualifies for compensation under chapter and the veteran disability must be.because kilpatrick does not satisfy the second requirement,the government contends that is the end of the matter,and the judgment of the veterans court granting him benefits must be reversed.
the veterans court agreed that section a has a plain meaning,but the plain meaning that it discerned is quite different from the plain meaning that the government advocates.under the court interpretation,section a merely requires that the veteran be entitled to compensation under chapter,and that the compensation be that which is awarded for permanent and total disability.in this case,as the veterans court explained,kilpatrick was entitled to compensation under chapter,and the chapter compensation to which he was entitled,pursuant to section,was the same as that awarded to veterans with permanent and total disabilities.accordingly,under the court plain meaning analysis,kilpatrick was entitled to the housing benefits he sought,and the regulation and general counsel opinion to the contrary were invalid as contrary to statutory mandate.
although the parties offer us two competing,and contrary,plain meanings,we conclude that the statutory language alone does not compel either proposed interpretation.after examining the statutory context and background,however,we are satisfied that the interpretation adopted by the veterans court and espoused by kilpatrick is the correct one.
the predecessor to section was first enacted as section of the world war veterans act of,stat.it provided that the benefits of title ii of the act,which provided compensation to disabled veterans of world war i,would be awarded to those veterans who were injured or whose existing injuries were aggravated as the result of training,hospitalization,or medical or surgical treatment.id.the benefits of title ii were to be provided to section veterans in the same manner as though such disability,aggravation,or death was the result of military service during the world war.id.
section of the act was repealed in and replaced in by a similar statute that applied to veterans generally,and not simply to veterans of world war see,stat.the new statute provided that specified compensation benefits would be awarded to persons who suffered an injury or aggravation of an existing injury as the result of training,hospitalization,or medical or surgical treatment provided pursuant to the veterans benefit laws in the same manner as if such disability,aggravation,or death were service connected within the meaning of such laws.id.that provision was codified as section of title.
in,congress enacted the statute that created the specially adapted housing benefit at issue in this case.see,stat.the new statute,which was codified as subsection g of section of title,provided 
any person who served in the active military or naval service of the united states who is entitled to compensation for permanent and total disability due to disease or injury with paralysis of the legs and lower part of the body shall be entitled to assistance in acquiring a suitable housing unit with special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary by the nature of the person disability,and necessary land therefor 
g supp.ii.both before and after section g was enacted,section of title the predecessor to the current section included the benefits of section of title among the benefits provided to persons suffering a disability because of medical or surgical treatment by the.see supp.ii.accordingly,when subsection g was added to section in,the benefits available to persons disabled as a result of va medical treatment clearly included assistance in acquiring a suitable housing unit with special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary by the nature of the person disability.
the government argues that the legislative history of the specially adapted housing statute,section g,supports its construction of the version of that statute,section a.the government points in particular to a senate report that comments that section g extended adapted housing assistance to any person who served in the active military or naval service who is entitled to compensation for a permanent and total wartime or peacetime disability,at,reprinted in.but that report merely rehearses the text of section g.it does not address section,which extended all section benefits,including the benefits conferred by section g,to persons in kilpatrick position.the government discussion of the legislation,and various subsequent statutes through,follows the same on the requirement of the specially adapted housing statute,while ignoring the statute that extended adapted housing benefits to persons injured by va hospitalization,surgery,or medical procedures.contrary to the government suggestion,it is inescapably clear that as of a veteran in kilpatrick position would have been entitled to specially adapted housing benefits.the question that may fairly be posed to the government is when,if ever,congress withdrew that benefit from persons such as kilpatrick.
although minor changes were made in the scope of the benefits provided,the relationship between section and section g remained unchanged until.in that year,congress enacted the veterans benefits act of,stat,which recodified the veterans benefit statutes.the purpose of the new statute was to consolidate into one act,and to simplify and make more uniform,the laws administered by the veterans administration relating to compensation,pension,hospitalization,and burial benefits,at,reprinted in.
the act replaced section with the following language,found in section of the new act,which was codified at supp.v 
when any veteran shall have suffered an injury,or an aggravation of an injury,as the result of hospitalization,or medical or surgical treatment,awarded him under any of the laws administered by the veterans administration and such injury or aggravation results in additional disability to or death of such veteran,disability compensation under this title and dependency and indemnity compensation under the servicemen and veterans survivor benefits act shall be awarded in the same manner as if such disability,aggravation,or death were 
stat.section of the new act was found in a title labeled compensation for disability or death.a separate title,labeled specially adapted housing for disabled veterans,contained section,codified at supp.v,which replaced former section g.see,stat.the new section stated 
the administrator is authorized,under such regulations as he may prescribe,to assist any veteran,who is entitled to compensation under title iii of this act,for permanent and total disability due to the loss,or loss of use of both lower extremities,in acquiring a suitable housing unit with special fixtures or movable facilities made necessary by the nature of the veteran disability,and necessary land therefor.
because section of the act was not included in the same title as section of the act,and because section specified disability compensation under this title,the effect was that the specially adapted housing benefit was no longer included among those benefits expressly extended to veterans who were disabled as a result of va medical and surgical procedures.nonetheless,the legislative history of the act makes it quite clear that congress did not intend to exclude such veterans from receiving specially adapted housing benefits.the house and senate reports accompanying the bill that became the act,which are largely identical,stated that the act was intended to consolidate into one act,and to simplify and make more uniform,the veterans benefit laws,at,reprinted in,at,reprinted in.the act was not intended to make significant changes in the law,but merely to 
incorporate into a single act the subject matter of the extensive body of existing legislation authorizing and governing the payment of compensation for disability or death to persons who served in the military,naval,or air force of the united states during a period of war,armed conflict,or peacetime service,and to their widows,children,and dependent parents.it would provide the same sort of consolidation of the laws relating to pension,hospitalization,medical and domiciliary care,and burial benefits.
at,at,at,at.
pointedly,the two congressional reports did not stop with merely characterizing the act generally as preserving current benefit provisions inst
