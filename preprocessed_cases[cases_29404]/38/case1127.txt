introduction 
the question presented by this appeal is whether or not a public housing authority may evict ignorant tenants,pursuant to a congressional mandate,when the tenant,any member of the tenant household,or any guest or other person under the tenant control engages in criminal activity on or near the public housing premises.the district court answered in the affirmative.we agree and affirm.
ii.factual and procedural history 
the facts giving rise to this case,as limited in this appeal,involve the appellant,connie burton,a single mother of three who has lived in tampa housing authority tha property for approximately sixteen years.burton has resided at her current apartment in robels park for the past five years.on october,burton added her adult son,narada burton,to her lease as a household member.this was a prerequisite to enable him to secure employment with the tha new beginnings program.this program was designed to employ ten offenders with the tha department of operations however,six months later,on april,narada burton was arrested for allegedly participating in a drug transaction on tha grounds it is undisputed that the transaction did not occur in burton apartment,nor that she was not aware of the criminal activity at the time.
pursuant to its one strike or zero tolerance policy,as authorized by l the tha commenced an action to evict burton for breach of the terms of her dwelling lease agreement.embodied within this agreement is the understanding that it is the resident obligation to ensure that no member of the resident household,guest,or other person under the resident control shall engage in any criminal activity on tha premises burton now appeals the district court denial of her motion for summary judgment,and the granting of summary judgment for tha.
iii.issues raised on appeal 
in appealing the district court denial of her motion for summary judgment,and the granting of summary judgment for tha,burton raises three points of alleged error concerning the district court interpretation of l.her first ground for appeal is whether the district court erred in ruling that a local public housing authority has the right to terminate the property rights of ignorant public housing tenants when a household member engages in criminal activity on public housing authority property.burton advocates that an innocent party defense should be read into the statute,while the district court held that no such defense exists.burton second argument is that the district court erred in holding that her due process rights were not violated by the tha.she claims that the automatic deprivation of a tenant property is,when the property was not used in the commission of a crime and when the tenant did not know of the illegal the due process clause.finally,burton alleges that the district court erred in holding that her freedom of association rights under the first amendment were not violated.she claims that because of the policy,tenants are forced to restrict or eliminate their association with others who may potentially find themselves accused of illegal wrongdoing.
iv.standard of review 
we review de novo the district court grant of summary judgment,applying the same standard as the district court.see bivens gardens office,barnett banks of,cir.we view all evidence and factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the party.see korman hbc,cir.summary judgment is appropriate when there are no genuine issues of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.mccaleb smith,cir citing.c.if the record presents factual issues,the court must not decide them it must deny the motion and proceed to trial.clemons dougherty county,cir.a grant of summary judgment may be upheld on any basis supported by the record.see fitzpatrick city of atlanta,cir.
discussion 
in discussing this case we wish to acknowledge that we are following the lead of judge joseph sneed,as set forth in his comprehensive dissent in rucker davis,cir en banc,cert.granted,d,d consolidated.judge sneed dissenting opinion develops the arguments,analyzes the relevant cases,and sets forth the line of reasoning we find most persuasive.
in the late the drug epidemic had become corrosive in many aspects of our society.public housing areas suffered along with many other segments of our society during the drug war.in,in response to the deteriorating safety and overall quality of life due to crime and violence in public housing,congress granted to local public housing authorities phas a new tool in striking a balance between providing affordable low income housing which was also safe to live in.id.l was this tool,and it mandated that every lease entered into by a pha include a provision permitting termination of tenancy when a public housing tenant,any member of the tenant household,or any guest or other person under the tenant control engaged in criminal activity on or near public housing premises.
we believe the statutory language contained within the statute is unmistakably clear,and was based on reasonable findings that such legislation was necessary to eradicate the unsavory element that had infiltrated the public housing complexes.in assessing the validity of this statute,we find nothing in the constitution which prohibits the government from entering into reasonable lease provisions necessary to maintain the safety and structural soundness of its property.id.the increase in crime not only leads to murders,muggings,and other forms of violence against tenants,but also to a deterioration of the physical environment that requires substantial government expenditures.the government,given its status as a landlord,must be given the authority to maintain its property at a habitable and safe standard for all of its tenants.
in answering the question of whether an ignorant tenant may be evicted based on a household members or guests drug use,the department of housing and urban development,hud offers guidance.hud,the agency charged with administering public housing,concluded that the statute did authorize the eviction of these ignorant tenants.l b public housing lease and grievance procedures,october.if this interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute,then this court may not substitute its own judgment for that of hud.chevron,natural res.def.council,d.because we find the statute to be clear on its face,hud interpretation is the only permissible construction of the statute.the cardinal principle of statutory construction is that w here there is no ambiguity in the words,there is no room for construction.united states gonzales,d quoting united states wiltberger,wheat.in the instant case,the statute authorizes eviction when a public housing tenant,any member of the tenant household,or any guest or other person under the tenant control engages in any drug related criminal activity.there is nothing ambiguous in this language.
under l,there are four categories of individuals whose criminal activity on or near public housing property will result in the tenant eviction.a tenant can be terminated for his or her own criminal drug activity,a household member a guest or activity by any other person under the tenant control.the structure of the statute suggests that all of these individuals are per se under the tenant control,and,therefore,the drug related criminal activity of anyone in one of these categories is cause for eviction.rucker,at sneed,dissenting.in this case,the plain meaning of the statute is obvious.the eviction of ignorant tenants due to the conduct of those associated with them is supported by a reasonable rationale based on sound public policy.id.at.
our interpretation and reading of the statute in question is reinforced by two related statutory provisions.the first is c a this statute,as it stood through,mandated that pha fulfill three independent duties.under subsection i,pha were required to allocate available housing units based on congressionally determined preferences.these preferences were given to those in need,such as the homeless,or those using more than of their income to pay rent.under subsection iii,an individual or family otherwise eligible for preferential placement in available housing was disqualified from receiving a preference for a period of three years if evicted from public housing because of criminal activity.and finally,under the final clause of subsection iii,pha were specifically required to waive the three year disqualification period for those individuals who clearly did not participate in and had no knowledge of such criminal activity.
these provisions served three functions established preferential tenant selection criteria disqualified those evicted because of drug activity from the established preferences for a period of three years and exempted from disqualification those evicted who clearly did not participate in and had no knowledge of the criminal activity.thus under the statutory mandate of c a,pha were required to differentiate between two classes of tenants evicted from public housing for criminal activity.the first class was disqualified from preferential placement for three years if they participated in or had knowledge of the criminal activity.the second class consisted of those individuals who were evicted for criminal activity,but did not participate in or have knowledge of that activity.these individuals were eligible to receive preferential treatment if they fit within one of the other criteria listed in c a i.
when congress created a distinction between tenants evicted for participating in or having knowledge of the wrongdoing,and those who did not have such knowledge,clearly it did so with the understanding that an ignorant tenant could be evicted for the criminal activity of another.while ignorant tenants were granted some reprieve by the receipt of preferential treatment in the waiver of the three year prohibition,they nevertheless were still subject to eviction proceedings.were that not so,there would have been no need for congress to write a statute specifically waiving the applicability of the prohibition period to the ignorant tenant.rucker,at sneed,dissenting.
additionally,a lends support to the plain language interpretation of l it is a civil forfeiture statute that makes leasehold interests subject to forfeiture when used to commit crimes.it was amended concurrently with the passage of l as part of the abuse act of.section a specifically includes a knowledge requirement.under it,no property otherwise subject to forfeiture may be seized if the owner establishes that the property was used in criminal activity without the knowledge or consent of that owner.
abiding by another canon of statutory construction,w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d quoting united states wong kim bo,cir united states koonce,cir.in creating a provision allowing an innocent owner to rebut the presumption of his or her participation or knowledge,congress clearly perceived that forfeitures of leaseholds under a were to function differently from evictions under l and legislated different regimes to govern the two.rucker,at sneed,dissenting.because a did not provide for procedural protection to the owner,as seizure was authorized once a violation occurred,congress recognized that additional substantive protections were needed to prevent forfeiture against unknowing parties.
similarly,in a emergency supplemental appropriation measure,congress directed the secretary of hud to issue waivers of certain administrative procedures as long as evictions of a household member involved in criminal activity shall not affect the right of any other household member who is not involved in such activity to continue tenancy.dire emergency supplemental appropriations and transfers,stat.much like the forfeiture statute,this measure permits the taking of property without any procedural protection.therefore,congress included a substantive protection for innocent tenants.however,a similar substantive right was not afforded to tenants who received the full procedural protections offered by hud and local phas.
thus the innocent owner exception in both a and.reflected distinctly different congressional judgments about the proper tradeoff between procedural and substantive protections.rucker,at sneed,dissenting.owners were given substantive protections,while tenants were not.while congress concluded that the forfeiture statute should not be applied to owners who did not know of or consent to the illegal use of their property,it did not afford innocent tenants the same protection.in so doing,congress granted broader authority to local phas in evicting its tenants than federal agents had to seize property of innocent owners in criminal activity.
after further inspection into the congressional treatment of l,it is apparent to us that congress specifically considered the ramifications of the statute,and intended precisely what the plain reading of the statute entails.in a congressional hearing,for example,the associate director of the american civil liberties union aclu argued that phas should not be allowed to evict a tenant unless they could prove that a tenant had knowledge and actual control of the wrongdoer.see drugs in federally assisted housing hearings on before the subcomm.on housing and urban affairs of the senate comm.on banking,housing,and urban affairs,doc,at.in that hearing,the aclu pointed to several instances where ignorant tenants were subjected to eviction proceedings.doc,at davidson,public housing aides push to evict drug users,sometimes violating the rights of other tenants,wall,jul,at.yet after consideration,and even after amending the eviction provision,congress did not include an innocent owner exception.national affordable housing act,stat.substituting provisions relating to criminal activity threatening health,safety or peaceful enjoyment of other tenants for provisions relating to criminal activity generally.following the lead in this decision was hud subsequent interpretation of l,who,contrary to the urging of legal aid at hud notice and comment hearings before implementing the statute,nevertheless interpreted the statute to grant discretion to phas to evict ignorant tenants.see.at.
subsequently,congress again amended the eviction statute,and again failed to include an innocent owner exemption.in fact the amendment to l actually expanded the liability of ignorant tenants.tenants could now be evicted for criminal activity on or off public premises,as opposed to on or near the premises as the legislation had previously read.a,stat.we place great significance on congress failure to include an innocent owner exemption.we should not be quick to conclude that congress either neglected to consider an issue related to its enactments or decided to avoid the issue and leave its resolution to the courts instead we should search the statutory language and structure with the assumption that congress knew what it was doing when it enacted the statute at issue.snapp unlimited concepts,cir in re griffith,cir congress is presumed to be aware of existing law when it passes legislation.
likewise,in this instance,congress was aware that the administrative agency charged with implementing the eviction provision construed it to permit eviction of ignorant tenants.this interpretation had been challenged in both policy and constitutional grounds before congress and in hud notice and comment procedures.congress itself has shown its concern for ignorant tenants by protecting them with specific language in other legislative enactments.see supra.congress,however,did not provide an exemption for ignorant tenants when it amended l in.this court does not have the power to amend the statute.congress clearly intended hud interpretation of the eviction to prevail.
rucker,at sneed,dissenting.
lending further credence to our holding is the rather comprehensive scheme of legislative initiatives aimed at the public housing drug crisis with which l is intertwined.see abuse act of,dire emergency supplemental appropriations and transfers,c a.important to this analysis is the fact that l does not mandate eviction for all tenants whose household members or guests engage in criminal activity,but rather it permits their eviction,granting discretion to the phas to make this determination on a basis this was a reasonable decision on the part of congress.rucker.at sneed,dissenting.
in the passage of l,congress was confronted with two overriding concerns in permitting the eviction of innocent tenants.conditions in the public housing complexes had deteriorated to such deplorable conditions due to the rampant drug use,that many of them were rendered unsafe,and in some instances,unlivable.drug dealers are increasingly imposing a reign of terror on public and other federally assisted low income housing tenants.yet,tenants were not cooperating with the efforts of local phas to address the drug problem,particularly because many of the tenants were part of the problem.w hen suspected drug dealers were notified that eviction proceedings against them had been started,they sought to punish tenants who might have identified them.cong.rec.extended remarks of rangel,june,quoting emmanuel popolizio,at long last,a victory over drug dealers,may.as judge sneed points out,it was a rare factual situation to discover the tenant seated with the drug using guest.absent this situation,the housing authority would be forced to rely on speculative evidence at best,such as hearsay,gossip and rumor.see rucker,at sneed,dissenting.therefore,giving the housing authority the power to evict an ignorant tenant not only acts as a credible deterrent against criminal activity,it eliminates the need to happen upon the rare occurrence of joint wrongdoing,and diminishes the drug pusher power of intimidation.
similar to the factual situation in rucker,burton son engaged in criminal activity outside of her apartment.as judge sneed points out,it is not likely that the tenant or the wrongdoer will admit to the fact that the tenant was aware of the criminal activity,especially since tenants and household members are often immediate family members.hence,the only reliable source would be other residents.however,congress concluded that other residents were equally unlikely to present the necessary testimony.tenants are frightened.they are scared for themselves and their children.they are afraid to report drug incidents to the pha management and to the police because usually nothing is done by either agency.the drug problem and public housing hearings before the house select comm.on narcotics abuse and control,at summary of testimony of nancy brown,chairperson,state of connecticut task force on public housing and drugs the fear of retaliation makes it almost impossible to provide normal police protection,at summary of testimony of vincent lane,chairman,chicago housing authority.
hence,in an effort to gain the cooperation of public housing tenants,congress fashioned l as a reasonable response to the legitimate housing objective of restoring these complexes to both livable and safe places of residence.in reaching this objective,congress was aware,such as through the aforementioned testimony,that success could only be reached by ridding these public housing units of the criminal activity,and giving the lawabiding tenants control over their living situations.with the statute passage,congress addressed a very critical need,and clearly expressed concerns similar to those of mayor james moran of alexandria,virginia,who,arguing before a senate subcommittee,stated that the eviction provision was critical to giv ing a sense of control back to the tenant leadership within communities.drugs in federally assisted housing hearings on before the subcomm.on housing and urban affairs of the senate comm.on banking,housing and urban affairs,doc,at.
furthermore,a provision permitting the eviction of unknowing tenants because of the wrongdoing of their household members or guests is a common and enforceable provision in leases between private owners of property and their tenants.rucker,at sneed,dissenting citing shepard dye.at the ability of pha or other landlord to enforce covenants relating to acts of unit residents is a normal and ordinary incident of tenancy.the fact that these provisions are regularly used and enforced by private parties is a testament to their reasonableness.
solely because one of the parties to this particular lease was a government agency does not render an otherwise prudent provision unreasonable.rucker,at sneed,dissenting there are many examples of when governments impose liability of individuals without requiring that the individual have actual knowledge of the wrongdoing.see.imposing tort liability on ignorant parents for actions of their children property owner liable for environmental cleanup when waste was illegally by a previous owner without current owner knowledge or consent.thus,it is established that congressional imposition of liability without fault on individuals is not,per se,unreasonable.congress was well within reason in enacting l to combat the deteriorating livability of the public housing complexes.housing lease and grievance procedures.at congress has determined that drug crime and criminal threats by public housing household members are a special danger to the security and general benefit of public housing residents warranting special mention in the law.therefore,congress determination was wholly reasonable.
we now consider burton constitutional claims specifically,that the district court erred in ruling that l does not violate her due process or freedom of association rights.we adopt the well reasoned analysis of judge sneed 
government plays many parts.when it acts in one of its many proprietary roles employer,purchaser,or landlord,to name a few,it must be able to enforce reasonable and germane conditions.national endowment for the arts finley,d t he government may allocate competitive funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation or a criminal penalty at stake.a government employer,for example,may impose restraints on employee speech that would violate the first amendment if imposed on an ordinary citizen.pickering bd.of educ.of township high school dist,will county,illinois,d applying intermediate rather than strict scrutiny to dismissal of public school teacher for exercising first amendment rights.likewise,when the government acts to subsidize a purchase of certain services but not others,there may be no constitutional implications.maher roe,d subsidizing childbirth,but not abortion does not interfere with a fundamental right,but merely encourages childbirth.
when managing a public housing complex,the government role is not unlike that of an employer or purchaser.the constitution does not require the government to provide decent and safe housing to its citizens.lindsey,at,d there is no constitutional guarantee of access to dwellings of a particular quality.the rights provided in the housing act of and its subsequent amendments arise from congressional notions of sound policy not constitutional necessity.in furtherance of such policy,congress should be accorded considerable flexibility in fixing the necessary rules with which beneficiaries must comply.
in this case,congress has limited the right to reside in public housing to those individuals who agree to accept responsibility for the criminal activity of their household members and guests.it has granted to phas the authority to withdraw this benefit from those who will not or can not prevent their guests from engaging in such activity.so long as this condition is relevant to the government underlying interest as a landlord,it is constitutionally permissible.nollan cal.coastal comm n,d if governmental purpose is sufficient to justify outright refusal of benefit,it is sufficient to justify conditions on that benefit.see also dandridge williams,d.
