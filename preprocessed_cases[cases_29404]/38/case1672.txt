plaintiffs and appellants,a proposed class of individuals representing developmentally disabled foster children and their foster families throughout california,appeal from a judgment entered following the trial court order sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend filed by defendants and respondents the california department of social services and its director john wagner collectively the dss.appellants sought reimbursement of additional foster care benefits allegedly available for the children.the trial court ruled that appellants failed to state a claim,as the additional rates are available only to facilities that have been vendorized,or approved to provide the services and supports a developmentally disabled child has been assessed to need,and appellants failed to allege they could meet this requirement.
we affirm.the language of the statutory and regulatory scheme governing developmentally disabled foster children and the policy considerations underlying that scheme require that the facilities into which developmentally disabled foster children are placed be vendorized in order to receive the additional rates referenced in welfare and institutions code sections and

the statutory scheme.
appellants allegations are premised on the applicable statutory and regulatory scheme governing the public benefits provided to foster children with developmental disabilities.california provides foster care benefits to eligible children under a program funded by the state and federal governments.title of the social security act,title united states code section et,authorizes the aid to families and dependent care program.see generally state of cal.of social servs.thompson cir.the federal government contribution of funds is dependent on the state implementation of and compliance with a state plan that meets the requirements of federal law,et.
one requisite element of the state plan is the designation of a single state agency with authority to administer or supervise the administration of the plan.a i see also p.the designated single state agency must have authority to make rules and regulations governing the administration of the plan and may not delegate its authority to exercise discretion in the administration and supervision of the plan.a ii b.though other state and local agencies may perform services for the single state agency,they do not have authority to review,change,or disapprove any administrative decision of the single state agency,or otherwise substitute their judgment for that of the agency as to the application of policies,rules,and regulations promulgated by the state agency.b.
having elected to participate in the program,california has submitted a state plan and enacted a statutory scheme designed to comply with the federal requirements.see et see also county of alameda carleson cal d.under the state plan,the dss is designated as the single state agency with full power to supervise every phase of the administration of public social services.such services include the provision of foster care.scott county of los angeles th,d.accordingly,the dss is also charged with the authority to make rules and regulations for the proper maintenance and care of needy children and for the administration of aid to families with dependent children.
the legislature has determined that the provision of public social services,including foster care,is a county function and responsibility subject to any applicable state and federal statutes and regulations.counties are responsible for a public system of statewide child welfare services,which includes providing for the investigation of possible abuse or neglect of a child warranting removal from parental custody.et et a child removed from his or her home pursuant to the dependency statutes and placed in foster care becomes eligible to receive benefits,subd.a.according to section,subdivision a,a child is not eligible for unless responsibility for placement and care of the child is with the county welfare department eligibility for is also dependent on the agency with the responsibility for the child placement and care developing a case plan for the child,defined in pertinent part as a written document that,at a minimum,specifies the type of home in which the child shall be placed,the safety of that home,and the appropriateness of that home to meet the child needs.it shall also include the agency plan for ensuring that the child receive proper care and protection in a safe environment,and shall set forth the appropriate services to be provided to the child,the child family,and the foster parents,in order to meet the child needs while in foster care,and to reunify the child with the child family,subd.b,subd.b.

the california department of developmental services dds is responsible for the execution of laws and the establishment of rules and regulations relating to the care,custody and treatment of developmentally disabled persons.the lanterman developmental disabilities act lanterman act,section et,contains provisions affording assistance to developmentally disabled individuals such services are governed by a separate state plan.for purposes of the lanterman act,a developmental disability is one that originates before an individual is years old,continues or can be expected to continue indefinitely,constitutes a substantial disability and includes mental retardation,cerebral palsy,epilepsy,and autism.this term shall also include disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation,but shall not include other handicapping conditions that are solely physical in nature,subd.a see also,tit,subds.a b.
a county social worker may refer a foster child believed to have developmental disabilities to a regional center for evaluation.established by the lanterman act,regional centers are private,nonprofit corporations that contract with the dds to help the state carry out its responsibilities to developmentally disabled persons and their families.to be eligible for regional center services,an individual must have a developmental disability that falls within the definition provided by section,subdivision a,subd.b,tit,subd.b.regional centers develop individual program plans for eligible individuals that are designed to address identified goals and objectives through the provision of specified services and supports.
as directed by statute,the dds has adopt ed regulations that specify rates for community care facilities serving persons with developmental disabilities,subd.a.according to the regulations,a f acility means a licensed community care facility as defined in health and safety code section a,or which has been vendorized as a residential facility by a regional center,tit,subd.a see also,tit,subd.a.vendorization is the process for identification,selection,and utilization of service vendors or contractors,based on the qualifications and other requirements necessary in order to provide the service,subd.a a see also,tit,subd.a vendorization means the process used to a verify that an applicant meets all of the requirements and standards pursuant to section b of these regulations prior to the provision of services to consumers and b assign vendor identification numbers,service codes and subcodes,for the purpose of identifying vendor expenditures.

in turn,prior to its amendment in,section addressed the rates for dual agency children,stating notwithstanding any other provision of law,the state department of social services shall use the residential facility rates established by the state department of developmental services to determine rates to be paid for nonmedical care and supervision of children who are both regional center clients pursuant to section and recipients under the provisions of this chapter and placed in licensed community care facilities.any services authorized by a regional center for recipients that are not allowable under state or federal program requirements shall be paid pursuant to section.
the trial court proceedings.
appellants are an uncertified class comprised of current and former foster children and their foster families who contend that they were entitled to receive additional benefits in the form of payment of the arm rates because of the children developmental disabilities.appellants fall into one of three subclasses dual agency children under age who at any time since were placed in licensed community care facilities that did not receive the arm rates dual agency children over age who were placed in licensed community care facilities that did not receive the arm rates at any point within the applicable limitations period and persons who were foster parents of the children identified within the foregoing groups at any point within the applicable limitations period.
in,appellants filed approximately ten identical class action lawsuits in various counties throughout california,alleging an underpayment of foster care benefits to dual agency children.they contended the statutory scheme did not require a licensed community care facility into which a dual agency child had been placed to be vendorized by a regional center in order to receive the arm rates.the judicial council of california coordinated the actions pursuant to california rules of court,rule,assigning a single judge,the caption social services payment cases and case number jccp.in march,the trial court sustained a demurrer with leave to amend brought by nine california counties counties in the coordinated action.the trial court directed appellants to combine the coordinated actions into a single complaint and to plead more specifically the applicable statutory and regulatory schemes.
in april,appellants filed their master complaint against the dss and its director,and the counties including los angeles county county.they alleged causes of action for underpayment of social services,declaratory relief,injunctive relief and writ of mandate on the ground that dss had improperly denied payment of the arm rates to licensed community care facilities providing nonmedical care and supervision for dual agency children.the dss demurred,as did the counties.the county also filed a supplemental demurrer in which several other counties joined.they argued that the applicable statutes and regulations,when read together,demonstrated vendorization was a prerequisite for a licensed community care facility receipt of the arm rates and that,therefore,facilities were ineligible to receive the arm rates.
appellants opposed,asserting that no statute or regulation required that the arm rates be paid only to a vendorized provider and that imposing such a requirement improperly delegated placement authority to the regional centers in violation of the single state agency rule.
following an august hearing,the trial court filed an order on november,which sustained the demurrers with leave to amend as to the dss and without leave to amend as to the counties.it ruled just as foster parents and foster homes must be licensed in order to receive benefits,state regulations require foster parents and foster homes to be vendorized in order to receive the additional benefits for care of developmentally disabled children authorized by welfare and institutions code sections and.these regulations are not contrary to statute and must be given deference by the court.finding ambiguity in the statutory scheme as to whether a licensed community care facility,including an individual foster home,must be vendorized in order to qualify for receipt of the arm rates,the trial court turned to agency regulations for guidance and reasoned that the applicable regulations supported a vendorization requirement.it further found that its interpretation of the statutory scheme did not violate the single state agency rule,as the vendorization requirement did not interfere with a county placement decisions.with respect to the counties,the trial court concluded they were not proper parties to the litigation because their administration of foster care benefits depended on a delegation from the dss and they were not permitted to act independently of or contrary to the dss instructions.with respect to the dss,the trial court granted appellants leave to amend to allow claims to be brought by dual agency children who have been placed in vendorized licensed community care facilities.
thereafter,in january appellants filed a first amended master complaint famc.appellants did not comply with the trial court prior order by alleging more limited claims or alleging claims on behalf of a more limited group of caregivers.rather,they continued to challenge the vendorization requirement through allegations such as interpreting sections and of the welfare and institutions code to mean that a regional center must approve a county placement decision before a given rate of funding can be paid to a dual agency child would be inconsistent with the legislature intent to comply with federal funding requirements r equiring regional centers to approve or disapprove foster care providers or the eligibility for benefits through vendorization would be inconsistent with the requirement that a single state agency be in charge of foster care and n o california statute or regulation expressly states that a licensed community care facility in which a dual agency child has been placed must be vendorized before the foster care rate specified in welfare and institutions code section can be paid on behalf of the child.their only new allegation was that the dss had acted inconsistently with its current interpretation of the vendorization requirement by placing hundreds of dual agency children in placements,paying the arm rates to numerous dual agency children in those placements and failing to notify other dual agency children in those placements of the availability of the arm rates.appellants sought payment of rates equal to the arm rates for care and supervision provided by licensed community care facilities to dual agency children since july.
the dss again demurred.it asserted that appellants were not entitled to any relief as a matter of law because they failed to allege they were placed in or operated a licensed community care facility that was vendorized by or contracted with a regional center.for the most part,its arguments mirrored the bases for the trial court previous order sustaining the demurrer.in support of its demurrer,the dss requested the trial court to take judicial notice of two all county letters,as well as the memorandum of points and authorities filed by the counties in support of the previous demurrer.the dss issued all county letter acl on april,to provide further information and instructions to counties regarding the implementation of ab chapter,statutes of.under the heading eligible population and eligible facilities,acl provided all recipients who are also receiving services as regional center clients shall be eligible for the rate of payment established by sdds for nonmedical care and supervision.the majority of regional center placements are made into facilities of the small family home category,however,regional center placements may also be made into licensed foster family homes and group homes.the provisions of this statute apply to children placed in any of these facilities having a vendorized or contractual relationship with the regional centers.the dss issued all county letter acl over ten years later,superseding acl.the purpose of acl was to inform counties of federal and state requirements regarding funding for foster children who are regional center clients.it discussed the rate system that had been implemented since the issuance of acl,explaining effective january,the cdds implemented the alternative residential model arm for setting rates to cover the cost of care and supervision for regional center clients,including dual agency children.the arm rates are based on the level of services provided by a facility.the regional center vendorizes each licensed facility and approves a facility service level,which then corresponds to an established facility rate.acl further reiterated that t he provisions of wic section apply to children placed in any of these facilities having a vendorized or contractual relationship with the regional centers.the dss argued that its interpretation of the applicable statutes promulgated in the all county letters should control over any anecdotal conduct to the contrary.
this time,the trial court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.to the extent the famc reiterated the allegations in the master complaint that were previously found to be deficient,the trial court adopted the reasoning of its prior order sustaining the dss demurrer.assuming the truth of the new allegations that the dss had previously not enforced the vendorization requirement,the trial court found that those allegations did not undermine the dss reliance on its policy requiring vendorization nor did they create any basis for an estoppel to deny the policy.
the trial court thereafter entered judgment in favor of the dss and this appeal followed 
discussion 
appellants maintain that the trial court erred in sustaining the dss demurrer without leave to amend,asserting that the trial court reasoning finds no support in the statutory scheme.they contend that the imposition of a vendorization requirement violates the single state agency rule by improperly delegating authority to the regional centers,that the provisions of the lanterman act have no application to dual agency children and that the trial court improperly relied on the all county letters to interpret the relevant statutes.alternatively,they assert the dss is estopped to deny payment of the arm rates to licensed community care facilities.

ii.the trial court properly sustained the demurrer without leave to amend.
the trial court order sustaining the dss demurrer without leave to amend incorporated the reasoning of its prior order sustaining the demurrer with leave to amend.in the prior order,the trial court found the language of section ambiguous to the extent the statute did not include an express vendorization requirement.in view of this ambiguity,the trial court examined the statutory scheme as a whole,regulations enacted by the dds relating to the establishment of arm rates and the dss and the dds past practices to determine that licensed community care facilities must be vendorized by a regional center to be eligible to receive the arm rates established by the dds.we see no basis to disturb the trial court interpretation of section.
statutory interpretation principles.
the objective of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.hughes board of architectural examiners cal th,d.the first step in determining legislative intent is to analyze the statutory language,giving the words of the statute a plain and common sense meaning.ibid.if the statutory language is unambiguous,a court must presume that the legislature meant what it said,and the plain meaning of the statute governs.lennane franchise tax bd.cal th,d.nonetheless,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose or whether such a construction of one provision is consistent with other provisions of the statute.the meaning of a statute may not be determined from a single word or sentence the words must be construed in context,and provisions relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized to the extent possible.citation.lungren deukmejian cal d.
when the plain meaning of the statutory text is insufficient to resolve the question of its interpretation,the courts may turn to rules or maxims of construction which serve as aids in the sense that they express familiar insights about conventional language usage.citation.mejia reed cal th,d.accordingly,when the statutory language is ambiguous and susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation,we look to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.nolan city of anaheim cal th,d.forrest department of corporations th,d.the court may also consider the impact of an interpretation on public policy,for w here uncertainty exists consideration should be given to the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation,fair employment housing com.cal d.
b.the statutory scheme governing dual agency children must be construed to require vendorization for a licensed community care facility to receive the arm rates.
separate parts of the welfare and institutions code address services for the developmentally disabled et and the provision of et.one statute in each of those sections intersects with and the other to address payment for services provided to developmentally disabled foster children.former section provided that the cost of providing nonmedical care and supervision in licensed community care facilities shall be funded by the aid to families with dependent care program pursuant to section,for children who are both recipients and regional center clients.former section required that the state department of social services shall use the residential facility rates established by the state department of developmental services to determine rates to be paid for nonmedical care and supervision of children who are both regional center clients pursuant to section and recipients under the provisions of this chapter and placed in licensed community care facilities.to the extent that a regional center authorizes services for a dual agency child that are not payable by,the regional centers are responsible to pay the cost of those services.both provisions apply n otwithstanding any other provision of law.
the question before us is whether a licensed community care facility receipt of the arm rates specified in section is contingent upon a regional center vendorizing the facility,notwithstanding that payment for care and supervision is funded through the program as opposed to the regional centers.to answer this question,we are guided by devita county of napa cal th,d,where the court declared when two statutes touch upon a common subject,they are to be construed in reference to each other,so as to harmonize the two in such a way that no part of either becomes surplusage.citations.two codes must be read together and so construed as to give effect,when possible,to all the provisions thereof.citation.accord,mejia reed,supra,cal th at,d.harmonizing the text of section and section so that each word has significance,we must conclude that in order for the dss to use the residential facility rates established by the dds to determine the rates to be paid for the care of dual agency children placed in licensed community care facilities,the dss must take into account the statutory and regulatory conditions which are critical components of the arm rates.
dual agency children fall within the lanterman act they are defined as regional center clients,which means they have been determined to suffer from a developmental disability that makes them eligible for regional center services,subd.b,tit,subd.a,subd.b.under the lanterman act,the state has accepted responsibility for these individuals,declaring that it has an obligation to provide an array of services and supports to meet the needs and choices of the developmentally disabled.to fulfill the state obligation,the legislature has directed the regional centers to conduct a number of specified activities for the developmentally among those is s ecuring needed services and supports,subd.a.in order to secure services and supports that meet the needs of the consumer,as determined in the consumer individual program plan,a regional center may purchase services pursuant to vendorization or a contract,subds.a see also morohoshi pacific home cal th,d,holding that regional centers have no obligation to provide services themselves,noting that the only choice facing regional centers,except in emergencies,is which vendor to hire,not whether to hire a vendor at all.as outlined in section,subdivision a a,v endorization or contracting is the process for identification,selection,and utilization of service vendors or contractors,based on the qualifications and other requirements necessary in order to provide the service.
with respect to payment for services and supports provided to individuals in placements,the legislature expressed goal was to develop a payment system consistent with its obligation to meet the needs of the developmentally disabled in order to assure the availability of a continuum of community living facilities of good quality for persons with developmental disabilities,and to ensure that persons placed out of home are in the most appropriate,least restrictive living arrangement,the department shall establish and maintain an equitable system of payment to providers of such services.the system of payment shall include provision for a rate to ensure that the provider can meet the special needs of persons with developmental disabilities and provide quality programs required by this article.see also,subd.a.
by statute,rates for licensed community care facilities serving persons with a developmental arm calculated on the basis of a cost model designed by the dds which ensures that aggregate facility payments support the provision of services to each person in accordance with his or her individual program plan and applicable program requirements,subd.a.the cost model is designed to reflect a number of elements including,but not limited to,basic living needs,direct care,special services,indirect costs and property costs,subds.a c.also by statute,the legislature directed the dds to prepare regulations to implement the community care facility rates in accordance with the cost model,subd.e.
the regulations unambiguously make vendorization an inextricable element of the cost model.california code of regulations,title,section et describes the facility service levels and approval process for a licensed community care facility to provide services at the specified through levels.according to california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision b service level through facilities shall be vendorized by a regional center pursuant to the requirements of title,california code of regulations,chapter,subchapter.see also,tit,use of the word shall denotes mandatory conduct.the regulations provide a f acility means a licensed community care facility as defined in health and safety code section a,or which has been vendorized as a residential facility by a regional center pursuant to the requirements of title,california code of regulations,division,chapter,subchapter,tit,subd.a.likewise,a r esidential service provider is defined as an individual or entity which has been licensed by the department of social services as a community care facility pursuant to health and safety code section a,or has completed the vendorization process pursuant to title,california code of regulations,division,subchapter and has been assigned a vendor identification number beginning with the letter h pursuant to title,california code of regulations,section a,tit,subd.a.only a residential service provider is eligible to receive the arm rates developed by the dds pursuant to california code of regulations,title,section et,tit.
we adhere to the principle that contemporaneous administrative construction of a statute by the agency charged with its enforcement and interpretation,while not necessarily controlling,is of great weight and courts will not depart from such construction unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.citation.state compensation ins.fund workers comp.appeals bd.th,d.as directed by the lanterman act,the dds adopted regulations that require a licensed community care facility to be vendorized by a regional center in order to receive the arm rates.in view of the statutory and regulatory scheme,we construe the phrase use the residential facility rates established by the state department of developmental services in former section to require the dss to use not only the monetary component of the rate but also the framework governing the setting and payment of the arm rates.this construction harmonizes section and section so that no part of either statute is surplusage and establishes a compatible interplay between the statutes.mar sakti internat.th,d code of civil procedure provision that permitted right of intervention under provision of law upon timely application deemed to incorporate the time limits of the labor code provision governing right of intervention.
public policy considerations further warrant construing the reference in section to the residential facility rate to incorporate a vendorization requirement.see behan alexis d.courts should interpret statutes to accomplish their legislative objective while accommodating important statutory and policy considerations.the legislature developed an equitable system of payments for developmentally disabled persons in facilities and directed that the rate of payment ensure that the provider can meet the special needs of persons with developmental disabilities and provide quality programs required by this article.the arm rates take into account multiple components of a developmentally disabled individual care,including basic living needs,direct supervision,and special latter of which encompasses specialized training,treatment,supervision,or other services which the individual program plan of each person requires to be provided by the residential facility in addition to the direct supervision provided pursuant to the person individual program plan in subdivision b.former,subd.b.
the applicable regulations specify the program design and staffing ratios that service level through facilities must possess in order to be approved to provide direct supervision and special services at a specified level.regs,tit,subds.a.the arm rates paid to these facilities are calculated on the basis of multiple factors relating to the services provided by and the service level of the facility.regs,tit.service level through facilities must be vendorized by a regional center.regs,tit,subd.b.one purpose of the vendor application is to confirm that the facility is capable of providing,and certified or licensed to perform the services it seeks to provide.regs,tit.a regional center review of the vendor application,approval or denial of the application and subsequent quality assurance monitoring and evaluation of the vendor serve as safeguards to help assure that the developmentally disabled are receiving appropriate services and supports from qualified vendors.regs,tit.dispensing with the vendorization requirement would eliminate these safeguards,to the detriment of developmentally disabled individuals for whom the state is responsible.
construing section to incorporate the requirements necessary for a licensed community care facility to receive the arm rates does not violate any principle of law or policy.did the trial appellants argument that regional center vendorization contravenes the federal requirement that a single state agency administer the foster care program.see a ii b.appellants argue that requiring a regional center to vendorize a facility before it will receive a particular rate payable through is an improper delegation of the dss responsibility for the placement and care of foster children.see,subd.a.to contrast the regional center role,they cite arizona of pub.department of health,cir,where the court observed that the establishment of a advisory committee did not violate the single state agency rule,as w ith or without the advisory committee,the responsibility for making the actual administrative decisions and for implementing them rests in a single set of of the state agency.
appellants authority,however,serves only to highlight that the vendorization requirement does nothing to usurp the dss role as the single state agency responsible for administering foster care.vendorization does not interfere with the dss placement decisions.as the trial court noted in its prior order sustaining the dss demurrer with leave to amend,county welfare departments retain discretion to place a dual agency child in a licensed community care facility that has not been vendorized the consequence of doing so is not that the child is removed but simply that the facility does not receive the arm rates.indeed,nothing about the vendorization requirement precludes a county social worker from developing a case plan that specifies a placement for a dual agency child.see,subd.b.correspondingly,nothing precludes a licensed community care facility where a dual agency child is placed from seeking vendorization.see,tit,subd.a regional center is mandated to provide periodic residential services orientations for all persons who wish to become vendorized to provide services pursuant to subchapter.
moreover,the dss continues to be the department designated the single organizational unit whose duty it shall be to administer a state system for establishing rates in the program,subd.a.foster care rates are designed to cover the care and supervision of a foster child,which includes food,clothing,shelter,daily supervision,school supplies,a child personal incidentals,liability insurance with respect to a child,and reasonable travel to the child home for visitation,subd.b.the arm rates,on the other hand,are designed to compensate licensed community care facilities for the provision of direct supervision and specialized services tailored to meet the objectives of an individual program plan.a regional center vendorization of a licensed community care facility provides assurance that the facility can provide such services above and beyond care and supervision.see,tit.it constitutes an integral part of the rates established by the dds that are incorporated as foster care rates pursuant to section.
indeed,the single state agency requirement does not prohibit various state agencies from working in tandem and utilizing each other expertise.for example,in giles horn th,d,the court determined that a county contracting out certain case management work under the calworks program did not violate the single state agency rule.relevant here,the court discussed the legislative history of code of federal regulations part contained in federal register,which states in part the single state agency principle does not preclude the purchase of services from other state agencies,nor is it designed to set aside the cooperative relationships that are normal and proper within a state.purchase of services and working cooperatively with other agencies are,however,different from delegating administrative responsibility for performance of functions required under state and federal laws to other agencies or individuals.the state may make use of the expertise of other agencies as long as the state agency does not delegate administrative authority.giles horn,supra,at,d see also rcj medical services,bontá th,d department of health service delegating audit authority to state controller office did not violate federal medicaid act single state agency requirement.the dss requiring vendorization for facilities seeking payment of the arm rates under section is not a delegation of its authority,but rather,constitutes part of the cooperative relationship between the dss and dds that is necessary to meet the needs of dual agency children.see former regional centers shall accept referrals for evaluation of eligible children and assist county welfare and probation departments in identifying appropriate placement resources for children who are eligible for regional center services.
we likewise reject appellants related contention that the trial court improperly relied on provisions of the lanterman act to require vendorization of facilities seeking the arm rates pursuant to section.appellants contend that because section addresses foster care rates,use of the arm rates is limited only to the considerations governing foster care rates set forth in sections and.we can not read section in a vacuum,moore panish cal d,every statute should be construed with reference to the whole system of law of which it is a part,so that all may be harmonized and have effect hicks legg associates th,d a statute is not to be read in isolation it must be construed with related statutes and considered in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.in enacting the lanterman act,the legislature recognized that the needs of the developmentally disabled should be paramount,stating t he complexities of providing services and supports to persons with developmental disabilities requires the coordination of services of many state departments and community agencies to ensure that no gaps occur in communication or provision of services and supports.the plain language of section refers directly to the lanterman act,providing that the dual agency children covered by that statute are regional center clients,which means they have been assessed to have a developmental disability that renders them eligible for regional center services.see,tit,subd.b.it is only because those children are eligible for regional center services under the lanterman act that the issue of the arm rates arises in the first instance,tit,subd.a.construing section to incorporate the use of the arm rates but not the balance of the statutory and regulatory scheme governing them would eviscerate the purpose of the arm rates to assure that a dual agency child will in fact receive needed services and supports.
finally,the trial court reliance on the all county letters affords no basis for reversal of the order sustaining the demurrer.in taking judicial notice of acl and acl,the trial court concluded they were relevant because they disclosed a consistent,practice by the dss to require that licensed community care facilities be vendorized to receive the arm rates.it expressly ruled that the letters were not independently entitled to judicial deference because they were not rendered in accordance with the administrative procedure act,government code section et.see tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d.but the trial court properly exercised its discretion in taking judicial notice of the all county letters.see salazar upland police th,d judicial notice ruling reviewed for abuse of discretion washington county of contra costa th,d same.as official acts of the state executive department,alc and acl were proper subjects of judicial notice,subd.c california advocates for nursing home reform bontá th,fn,d judicial notice of all county letters.
moreover,the trial court was entitled to accord great weight and respect to the dss interpretation of sections and,as the dss possessed expertise in dealing with the needs of dual agency children and the all county letters indicated that senior officials had carefully considered how responsibility for addressing those needs should be handled by the county welfare departments in coordination with the regional centers.sharon superior court cal th,d,court deferred to the dss interpretation of adoption law expressed in an all county letters see also megrabian saenz th,d evidence of dss policy entitled to deference.
in any event,the trial court reliance on the all county letters was unnecessary to its conclusion that the statutory scheme governing dual agency children requires that the licensed community care facilities into which those children are placed by the dss through the county welfare departments must be vendorized by a regional center to receive the arm rates created by the lanterman act.the all county letters merely confirmed that the dss has acted in conformity with the applicable statutory and regulatory scheme.
appellant allegations failed to establish that the dss was estopped to rely on the statutory scheme.
in the famc,appellants sought to establish that the dss was estopped to deny payment of the arm rates.they alleged that,despite the dss asserted policy and practice of requiring vendorization for receipt of the arm rates,over the years the dss had placed hundreds of dual agency children in licensed community care facilities it had paid the arm rates on behalf of dual agency children placed in nonvendorized licensed community care facilities and it had failed to notify other facilities of the availability of the arm rates or how to obtain them.the trial court summarily rejected appellants contenion that these facts formed the basis for an argument that the dss was estopped to deny payment of the arm rates to facilities.the trial court ruled plaintiffs estoppel argument really is nothing more than a restatement of their contention that,when a county welfare department decides to place a dual agency child in a foster family home,dss is required to pay the additional section rates automatically because the placement has been determined to be appropriate.this argument is contrary to the statutory and regulatory scheme,as explained at length in this court prior opinion and order.we find no error.
while the doctrine of equitable estoppel may be applied against the government where justice and right require,it will not be applied if doing so would effectively nullify a strong rule of policy,adopted for the benefit of the public.city of long beach mansell cal d.to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine,four elements must be present the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel had a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.id.at.if those elements are established against the government,the court must then balance the burden on the party asserting estoppel if the doctrine is not applied against the public policy that would be affected by the estoppel.lentz mcmahon cal d.
appellants allegations satisfied none of the requisite elements.with respect to the dss knowledge of the facts,appellants alleged that the dss placed dual agency children into facilities.but the vendorization requirement dictates whether the licensed community care facility is eligible to receive the arm rates,not whether the dss may place a dual agency child in the facility.second,appellants did not allege how the dss intended for any conduct in which it engaged to be acted upon by them.third,appellants failed to allege they were ignorant of the arm rates or of the vendorization requirement.finally,appellants failed to allege that they relied on any action or inaction on the part of the dss in accepting placement of dual agency children.appellants allegations stand in sharp contrast to the undisputed facts in canfield prod d,in which the court found the estoppel elements satisfied where the plaintiff,who was subject to a tax lien and faced losing her home,was unaware of her obligation to pay social security taxes and her entitlement to receive additional benefits because of that obligation,and the public agency was aware of such requirements and failed to fulfill its responsibility to notify her of her rights.
even if there were some manner in which we could construe appellants allegations to satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel,we would conclude the trial court properly declined to apply the doctrine to save the famc because its application would thwart the public policy considerations served by requiring vendorization.lentz mcmahon,supra,cal d at pages,to does not compel a different result.there,the court concluded that estoppel may be appropriate against a public welfare agency where it negligently or intentionally caused a claimant to fail to comply with a procedural precondition to eligibility,and the failure to apply estoppel would therefore constitute a significant hardship to the claimant.notably,the lentz court expressly distinguished the type of estoppel appellants seek to invoke here,observing that a more difficult question is posed,however,when estoppel is asserted against the government to defeat substantive limitations on eligibility for public benefits.to bar recoupment of benefits from a person whose circumstances did not qualify him for such benefits under applicable substantive eligibility rules might amount to a bestowal of benefits not contemplated by the legislature.id.at.
