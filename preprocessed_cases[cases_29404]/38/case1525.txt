martha myore myore appeals the order of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims remanding to the board of veterans appeals the board her claim for dependency and indemnity compensation.myore principi,wl,slip op.at.july.because the remand order of the veterans court is not an appealable final order,we dismiss the appeal.
background 
this case has a long history.the opinions of the veterans court in this matter provide a full description of that history.myore brown.myore i myore principi,wl.july,myore ii.we simply summarize here the relevant facts.
myore is the widow of deceased veteran kenneth myore the veteran,who served in the united states marine corps from may until his death on may.myore i.at.according to the board findings of fact of january,the veteran death was the result of a gunshot wound to the head incurred while the veteran was playing russian roulette.in re myore,slip op.at.
in july,myore filed a claim with the department of veterans affairs the dva for dependency and indemnity compensation under.myore i.at.that statute provides 
when any veteran dies after december,from a or compensable disability,the secretary shall pay dependency and indemnity compensation to such veteran surviving spouse,children,and parents.the standards and criteria for determining whether or not a disability is shall be those applicable under chapter of this title.
a.chapter provides the standards for determining whether a disability is.relevant to this appeal is,which requires that no compensation shall be paid if the disability is a result of the veteran own willful misconduct.in june,the dva regional office determined that the veteran death was not because it was attributable to the veteran own willful misconduct,and denied myore claim.myore i.at.
in april,myore appealed the regional office decision to the board.id.at.in december,the board found that the veteran death was due to a gunshot wound to the head while playing russian roulette,and that the veteran was not insane at the time of his death.id.the board found that the veteran death was,therefore,the result of willful misconduct and affirmed the regional office denial of disability and indemnity compensation.id.
myore appealed the board decision to the veterans court.on october,the court vacated and remanded the board decision.id.at.the court held that the board decision failed to indicate whether the board accorded weight to the statutory presumption afforded by a that an injury or disease incurred during active military service was incurred in the line of duty,and did not specifically find willful misconduct by a preponderance of the evidence.id.at.the court further held that the board did not base its conclusion of willful misconduct on a specific finding that the veteran engaged in an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action or in deliberate or intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences,as required by n.id the court also held that the board had failed adequately to consider whether the veteran committed suicide,and if so,whether the veteran was of unsound mind.id.at.according to the court,under,a finding of unsound mind would have negated the finding of willful misconduct.id.finally,the court held that pursuant to the government statutory duty to assist,on remand the board must seek to obtain two documents that myore had requested from the government.id.at.
on remand,the board specifically found that t he veteran died as the result of a gunshot wound to the head while he was playing russian roulette,and that t he veteran death was not the result of suicide.in re myore,no,slip op.at.the board concluded that the veteran actions constituted willful misconduct under n,and,therefore,the veteran death was not.id.at.consequently,the board denied myore claim for dependency and indemnity compensation.
once again,myore appealed to the veterans court.myore urged reversal of the board decision,arguing that a does not require that a surviving family member be denied dependency and indemnity compensation as a result of the deceased veteran willful misconduct.myore ii,slip op.at.in the alternative,myore argued that a second remand was required,because the board failed to follow the court previous instructions on remand,and because the government failed to fulfill its duty to assist in the development of myore claim.id.at.in response,the government asked that the board decision be vacated and remanded to the board for readjudication in light of the enactment of the veterans claims assistance act of,stat vcaa,which amended entitled notice to claimants of required information and evidence and added entitled duty to assist claimants.id.
on july,the court vacated and remanded the board decision of january.the court held that the board should readjudicate the case in light of the newly enacted vcaa.id.at.the court noted that all provisions of the vcaa are potentially applicable to claims pending on the date of the vcaa enactment.id.quoting holliday principi.the court therefore held 
i n view of the absence of va implementing regulations,and in view of concerns of fundamental fairness and fair process,the court must avoid cutting off an appellant rights under the vcaa by prematurely injecting itself into the va adjudication process and making determinations on issues that were not addressed by va in the first instance and that,therefore,at least at this time this court may not determine in the first instance the applicability of the vcaa to an appellant claims.
id.quoting holliday.at ellipses in original.
despite vacating and remanding to the board,the court addressed myore argument that a can not be interpreted to deny her dependency and indemnity compensation because of misconduct committed by the veteran.id.at.the court held that section a provides for benefits only where the veteran death results from a disability as defined under chapter of title.id.at.under,the court held,can not be found where the disability is the result of the veteran own willful misconduct.id.the court noted,however,that it continue d to be concerned about whether va regulations provide an objective standard or principled basis for distinguishing willful misconduct from suicide in a russian roulette situation.id.at.the court required that on remand the board issue a readjudicated decision supported by an adequate statement of reasons or bases.id.the court refrained from reviewing myore other arguments in view of the readjudication that will be ordered in light of the enactment of the vcaa.id.at.the court specified that myore will be free to raise any such arguments on remand.id.at.
myore timely appealed the veterans court interpretation of section a to this court.
discussion 
the government contends that this appeal should be dismissed,because myore has not appealed from a final order.we agree.
the statute granting this court jurisdiction over appeals from the veterans court provides 
after a decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims is entered in a case,any party to the case may obtain a review of the decision with respect to the validity of a decision of the court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation other than a refusal to review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title or any interpretation thereof other than a determination as to a factual matter that was relied on by the court in making the decision.such a review shall be obtained by filing a notice of appeal with the court of appeals for veterans claims within the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to united states courts of appeals from united states district courts.
a,as amended by veterans benefits act of,stat.although this provision does not include an express requirement of finality,we have generally declined to review orders of the veterans court.williams principi,quoting adams principi.of specific relevance to this appeal,t his court typically will not review remand orders by the court of appeals for veterans claims because they are not final judgments.williams,at quoting winn brown,see also ad
