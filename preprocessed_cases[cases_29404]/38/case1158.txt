the appellants,the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america phrma and two organizations,the national alliance for the mentally ill of michigan nami and the national urban indian coalition nuic referred to jointly as appeal the district court summary judgment rejecting their challenge to the michigan best practices initiative initiative,a state prescription drug coverage beneficiaries of medicaid and of two state health was designed by the state of michigan and approved by the secretary of the united states department of health and human services secretary,hhs.under the initiative,if a drug manufacturer does not sign each of two specified rebate agreements with to provide rebates for drugs the state purchases for medicaid recipients and the other to provide identical rebates for drugs the state purchases for the two state health drug will be covered under the programs subject to prior authorization.the appellants argue,as they did below,that the initiative violates the formulary provision of the medicaid outpatient drug payment statute,d,because it excludes from its drug formulary those drugs for which prior authorization is required the general statutory mandate that medicaid services be provided in a manner consistent with the best interests of the recipients,a and the commerce clause of the united states constitution because it requires manufacturers to charge the same prices both within and without michigan.because the district court correctly rejected each of these arguments,we affirm the summary judgment 
the medicaid program,jointly funded by the federal government and the states,pays for medical services to persons pursuant to state plans approved by the secretary.see a b.the statutory rebate provisions require that,in order for a state to receive medicaid payments for a covered outpatient drug,the drug manufacturer must have entered into an agreement to rebate a specified portion of the drug price pursuant to a state plan approved by the secretary.a.in recent years,some states have gone beyond the required medicaid rebate agreement and have enacted supplemental rebate programs to achieve additional cost savings on medicaid purchases as well as for purchases made by other needy citizens.phrma walsh,d.the initiative is one such supplemental program.
the initiative began in october when michigan governor convened the pharmacy therapeutics committee committee,made up of physicians and pharmacists,with instructions to review the michigan pharmaceutical product list mppl,a listing of all drugs covered by any program operated by michigan department of community health dch,including those requiring prior authorization.the committee studied therapeutic drug classes and in each class designated two or more as therapeutically advantageous,that is,as having a clinical advantage over other drugs in the class without regard to cost.declaration of david viele,deputy director of dch viele decl.these best in class drugs were designated as preferred drugs and were included on the mppl for automatic reimbursement under the initiative.the drug available at the lowest cost anywhere in the united states taking into account the mandatory medicaid rebate was designated as the reference drug and all drugs in the class priced comparably with it were also listed on the mppl as preferred drugs for automatic reimbursement.id.all remaining drugs were labeled drugs and were listed on the mppl with an asterisk signifying required prior authorization for the manufacturer signed both a supplemental agreement medicaid agreement requiring the manufacturer to rebate to the state the difference between the price of the drug and the price of the reference drug for medicaid purchases and a state funded rebate agreement agreement,extending the additional rebate to michigan state prescription drug programs.id.
in fall dch submitted to the secretary a proposed state plan amendment to michigan state medicaid plan incorporating the initiative provisions for approval pursuant to.the secretary approved use of the medicaid agreement in a letter dated january,and of the additional agreement in a letter dated december,approval letter.the secretary limited approval of the rebate program,however,to only two of the four michigan health programs for which it was proposed the elder prescription insurance company program epic,which provides prescription drug coverage to seniors,and the maternity outpatient medical service moms,which provides care,including drug coverage,to,adolescent and incarcerated females and to medicaid beneficiaries eligible for emergency services only.
on june,phrma filed this action challenging the secretary approval of the prior authorization provisions in both the medicaid agreement and the agreement.dch intervened on the side of the secretary and the intervened in support of phrma.in a decision dated march,the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the secretary and dch.phrma and the filed timely appeals.
after the district court entered judgment,the united states supreme court issued its decision in phrma walsh,d,which affirmed the first circuit vacatur of a preliminary injunction preventing implementation of maine outpatient drug program which,like michigan,requires prior authorization for a medicaid drug if its manufacturer has not agreed to provide rebates both for medicaid and for state prescription drug programs in walsh the supreme court expressly rejected phrma challenges to maine program based on medicaid best interests requirement,albeit without a majority opinion,and,by a majority,on the commerce clause.the analyses in walsh enlighten ours here.
we review the district court grant of summary judgment de novo pursuant to the administrative procedure act and therefore will uphold the secretary decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law,a.see arizona thompson,citing indep.petroleum ass of am.dewitt,ftc.there is some question,however,what level of deference the court should accord the secretary interpretation of the medicaid drug payment statute.ordinarily we review an agency interpretation of a statute it is charged with implementing under the familiar and deferential framework of chevron natural resources defense council,d.the appellants assert,however,that the secretary decisions approving the initiative are due only minimal deference,if any,under a line of supreme court decisions beginning with skidmore swift,and culminating in united states mead,d.phrma thompson,finding it unnecessary to decide whether secretary approval of vermont medicaid plan is entitled to chevron deference.we disagree and conclude the secretary decisions are entitled to chevron deference.accord texas hhs,cir georgia shalala,cir.
the appellants contend that the secretary decisions do not qualify for chevron deference because they do not carry the force of law.in particular,the appellants assert the secretary statutory interpretations here are not the result of a formal administrative process,do not involve agency expertise,are inconsistent with previous hhs interpretations and were developed solely in response to this lawsuit.thus,the appellants argue,the secretary interpretations are akin to interpretations contained in policy statements,agency manuals,and enforcement guidelines,which are beyond the chevron pale.mead,at.at quoting christensen harris county,d.this argument overlooks the nature of the secretary authority.this is not a case of implicit delegation of authority through the grant of general implementation authority.in the case of the medicaid payment statute,the congress expressly conferred on the secretary authority to review and approve state medicaid plans as a condition to disbursing federal medicaid payments.see the sums made available under this section shall be used for making payments to states which have submitted,and had approved by the secretary,state plans for medical assistance.in carrying out this duty,the secretary is charged with ensuring that each state plan complies with a vast network of specific statutory requirements,see generally,including the prescription rebate agreement provision in section.through this express delegation of specific interpretive authority,mead,at.at,the congress manifested its intent that the secretary determinations,based on interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions,should have the force of law.the secretary interpretations of the medicaid act are therefore entitled to chevron deference.see mead,at.at when congress has explicitly left a gap for an agency to fill,there is an express delegation of authority to the agency to elucidate a specific provision of the statute by regulation,and any ensuing regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.quoting chevron,at.at accordingly,we now review the appellants substantive challenges under chevron.
a.the statutory formulary provision 
first,the appellants assert the initiative prior authorization requirement violates section d,which governs formularies.we conclude the secretary approval of the initiative prior authorization requirement rests on a permissible construction of the statute under chevron.
the medicaid rebate provisions,enacted in,expressly authorize a state to subject to prior authorization any covered outpatient drug so long as the state provides response by telephone or other telecommunication device within hours of a request for prior authorization and provides for the dispensing of at least supply of a covered outpatient prescription drug in an emergency situation.d a,a b in the congress added the formulary provision which authorizes a state to create a drug formulary of covered drugs that is developed by a committee consisting of physicians,pharmacists,and other appropriate individuals appointed by the governor of the state.id.d a.the provision further directs that each formulary must include the covered outpatient drugs of any manufacturer which has entered into and complies with a rebate agreement under section a and permits a covered outpatient drug to be excluded with respect to the treatment of a specific disease or condition for an identified population if any only if the excluded drug does not have a significant,clinically meaningful therapeutic advantage in terms of safety,effectiveness,or clinical outcome of such treatment for such population over other drugs included in the formulary and there is a written explanation available to the public of the basis for the exclusion.d b c.in addition,the state is required to permit coverage of a drug excluded from the formulary pursuant to a prior authorization program that is consistent with section d.id.d d.
the appellants contend that the initiative prior authorization requirement violates the formulary provision because it excludes the asterisked from the mppl based on their price rather than their therapeutic value and because the secretary has not provided the requisite written explanation for the exclusion.the secretary does not dispute that the mppl is a formulary,see fed.appellees br.at,but,relying on the supreme court opinion in walsh,asserts that the initiative prior authorization program was implemented pursuant to the general prior authorization authority conferred by section d a and is expressly exempted from the formulary restrictions in section d b c by the final sentence of section d a prior authorization program established under section d is not a formulary subject to the requirements of section d.the appellants respond that the secretary construction permits a state to gut the restriction on formulary exclusion in section d c by simply attaching the label prior authorization program to what is really a formulary drug exclusion.they point out that,under the secretary interpretation,the formulary provision serves no purpose because its end availability restricted by prior be more easily achieved,that is,without running the gauntlet of subsection d c,if a state simply invokes prior authorization authority up front under section d a.
under the chevron framework,i f congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,we must give effect to congress unambiguously expressed intent but i f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,we ask whether the agency position rests on a permissible construction of the statute.beverly health rehab.servs.labor relations,quoting chevron,at.at additional quotations omitted.applying this standard we conclude that the secretary position,at least as applied to the circumstances here,reflects a permissible construction of the statutory provisions under chevron.
we acknowledge that there is tension,if not actual inconsistency,between the broad prior authorization power granted under subsection d a,buttressed by the final exempting sentence of subsection d,and the apparent intent of the formulary provision to broaden drug availability.the appellants are correct that under the secretary construction the formulary provision simply gives the states an alternate,and more cumbersome,means of subjecting drugs to prior authorization.nonetheless,the tension is a necessary consequence of the language the congress drafted.the secretary construction permits all of the language to be given its plain meaning,albeit with a somewhat anomalous result.the appellants construction,on the other hand,would require a crabbed reading of subsection d a and of the final sentence of subsection d and yet would not produce a coherent statutory scheme.given these entirely believe the secretary reasonably chose an interpretation consistent with the literal meaning of the statutory language.we note the eleventh circuit approved the same construction in phrma meadows,cir,cert.denied,d 
b.the best interests of medicaid recipients 
next,the appellants argue,as in walsh,that the medicaid agreement violates the general statutory requirement that a state medicaid plan provide such safeguards as may be necessary to assure that eligibility for care and services under the plan will be determined,and such care and services will be provided,in a manner consistent with simplicity of administration and the best interests of the recipients.a emphasis added.specifically,they argue that,by making a drug available to medicaid beneficiaries without prior authorization only if the drug manufacturer has signed the agreement,the initiative benefits epic and moms participants at the expense of medicaid beneficiaries and therefore is not in the best interests of medicaid recipients.we reject this argument as well.
we first consider whether the secretary interpretation of section a is permissible under chevron and find that it is.the secretary construes the best interests requirement to allow a state to establish a medicaid prior authorization program in order to secure rebates on drugs for populations if a state demonstrates through appropriate evidence that the prior authorization program will further the goals and objectives of the medicaid program.fed.appellant br.at quoting hhs letter to state medicaid directors at.specifically,the secretary concluded that by making prescription drugs accessible to the epic and moms populations,which are closely related to medicaid populations in terms of financial and medical need,it is reasonable to conclude that these populations and in the case of the moms program,their children will maintain or improve their health status and be less likely to become medicaid eligible.approval letter at.conversely,in the secretary view,the failure to implement the agreement could require cuts in the two programs that will necessarily result in some individuals enrolling in medicaid,and for others,lead to a decline in their health status and resources that will result in medicaid eligibility or increased medicaid expenses and the i ncreased medicaid enrollments and expenditures for newly qualified medicaid recipients will strain already scarce medicaid resources in a time of state budgetary shortfalls.id.at.the secretary conclusion that a prior authorization program that serves medicaid goals in this way can be consistent with medicaid recipients best interests,as required by section a,is reasonable on it
