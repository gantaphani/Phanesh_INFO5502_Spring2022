richard haynes applied for social security disability benefits and supplemental security income.following a hearing in,an administrative law judge alj found that haynes was disabled from june,until june,but not thereafter,because haynes was capable of performing a significant number of jobs.the appeals council denied haynes request for review,and the district court affirmed the decision.on appeal,haynes argues that the medical vocational guidelines mandate a finding of disability outside the limited period determined by the alj.haynes also argues that the alj improperly disregarded medical testimony that he claims mandated a finding of disability.we affirm.
background 
richard haynes was years old at the time of his hearing before the alj.haynes has a college degree in mathematics and science and has even earned some graduate school credits.although haynes served in the air force for about three years,the bulk of haynes work experience is in the field of carpentry.since september,haynes has earned no more than doing carpentry on a basis.
haynes medical history 
since at least december,when he smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes each day,haynes has suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.in march,haynes underwent pulmonary function testing,which indicated that he suffered from severe airway perhaps unsurprising result,given that haynes by then had increased his cigarette consumption to about two packs a day.at any rate,haynes received bronchodilator treatment for his condition,and this course of treatment was apparently successful.despite his ongoing smoking habit,haynes exhibited only scattered wheezes with good air exchange by december.the record does not disclose further medical treatment for any pulmonary problems since then,despite the fact that haynes continued to smoke more than a pack a day through january.
this was not the end of haynes medical problems,however.on june,while working a construction job,haynes suffered a fractured right comminuted displaced right calcaneus fracture,in medical jargon.haynes underwent surgical debridement,reduction,and splinting for this injury.after surgery,haynes undertook a regimen of whirlpool and wound debridement treatment,to which he responded well.medical treatment notes from several months after the injury indicated that haynes surgical site was healing extremely well,although haynes indicated that he still suffered some discomfort when attempting to move about on his fractured heel.
in september,indicated that haynes fracture was showing improvement,but there was significant soft tissue swelling of the affected area.on the advice of daniel lochmann,haynes treating orthopedic surgeon,haynes underwent physical therapy.haynes experienced some success with this therapy,which apparently reduced pain and brought great improvements to haynes range of motion and strength.in november,however,haynes reported continued difficulty with the range of motion of his right ankle.lochmann instructed haynes to stay the course with his physical therapy and to remain off work until june,the anniversary of his injury.
in january,haynes reported significant difficulty standing longer than to minutes at a time.in addition,haynes reported some weakness and pain in his foot and had difficulty bearing weight on it.lochmann examined haynes and discovered that his right ankle had a limited range of motion.lochmann expressed doubt that haynes could return to his previous work and activity level,although haynes indicated that several prescription drugs helped to reduce the severity of the pain to a more moderate and bearable level.haynes sought no further medical followup or treatment for his heel pain after january.
in a march report,lochmann recorded that haynes was unable to stand or walk longer than minutes at a time,nor could he walk for more than three hours in an workday.the surgeon also noted,however,that haynes could perform work in which he occasionally lifted pounds or frequently lifted pounds.in addition,lochmann determined that haynes could do work that involved unrestricted sitting,occasional climbing and balancing,and no exposure to heights.
over a year later,in september,nina gilberg conducted a consultative examination of haynes heel and reported that the calcaneus fracture had healed for the most part.haynes right foot remained tender and swollen,but haynes showed some range of motion and could bear his full weight on the foot,although he had a slight limp.haynes could also rise from a chair and could get on and off an examination table without difficulty.
gilberg concluded that haynes could not perform any work requiring significant standing,walking,or carrying.nevertheless,she concluded that haynes could perform tasks while seated,if permitted to adjust his position while doing so.gilberg also opined that haynes could perform work requiring occasional lifting and carrying of between and pounds.in addition,gilberg believed that haynes could stand and walk a total of three to four hours a workday for five to ten minutes at a time and could sit for most of the workday with position changes every to minutes.she specified,however,that any such work should require no use of ladders,balancing,stooping,or crouching.moreover,haynes work should entail no more than occasional kneeling or crawling,limited pushing and pulling,limited work at heights,and limited exposure to moving machinery if balance is involved,temperature extremes,or vibration.
unfortunately,haynes medical problems were not confined to the physical ailments described above.as documented in the record,haynes also has a long history of chronic alcohol abuse.he has been arrested repeatedly for driving while intoxicated,and has been fired or otherwise disciplined for problems arising from his alcohol dependence.haynes has been committed to detoxification programs on multiple occasions.although he has benefitted from periods of remission,haynes has engaged in repeated episodes of binge drinking on and off through late.over the years,haynes was prescribed various medications for his alcohol dependency,but he only took these medications erratically.
haynes has also been diagnosed with a mild form of depression and bipolar disorder.he received ongoing therapy and took prozac and other prescription drugs for these disorders.as of december,haynes depression was in marked remission,and his bipolar disorder was in full remission as of october.
hearing and decision 
the maladies gave rise to a series of applications,beginning in,that haynes filed seeking social security disability benefits and supplemental security income.most of these applications and resulting administrative appeals were denied in full,and their disposition is not relevant to this case.the appeal before us relates specifically to a partially favorable decision issued by an alj on march.
the hearing that preceded the alj decision took place in january.at this hearing,haynes testified that he still suffered pain in his heel and wore athletic shoes rather than the prescribed orthopedic boots.haynes also testified about his bipolar disorder and depression,and the medication and therapy he received.he stated that he still smoked about a pack and a half per day and suffered from obstructive pulmonary disease,for which he took inhalant medications.haynes indicated his belief that his physical and mental ailments precluded him from working a full day.
regarding his limitations,haynes stated that he could lift or carry up to pounds,and could lift but not carry up to pounds.haynes also indicated that he could walk three to four hours a day,with breaks after five to ten minutes.he claimed that in a work setting,he needed breaks every minutes.
haynes testified that he lived with his girlfriend.his daily activities entailed helping out around the dishes,dusting,and making his bed,for example.haynes maintained his driver license and drove on occasion.in addition,he continued to do small carpentry jobs and even participated in a vocational rehabilitation program that would enable him to run a small woodworking business for hours a week.
in addition to haynes testimony concerning the range of his physical activities,the record included several documents in which haynes provided additional detail regarding his daily activities.for example,haynes filed a disability report with the social security administration in january.in that report,haynes indicated that he had been fired six times in the previous three years due to his chronic alcohol abuse.he also indicated that,at the time,he carried out a number of daily activities,including washing dishes,cooking,cleaning,shopping for groceries,driving,doing laundry,and visiting with family members.in addition,haynes fished sometimes twice a day,hunted,and frequented casinos.
similarly,in january,haynes filed a completed questionnaire with the wisconsin department of health family services,in which he indicated that he cleaned the house,washed dishes,drove daily,checked on his mother at her home,took walks,shopped for groceries,cooked his own meals,did laundry,performed some yard work and home maintenance tasks,attended sporting events and church activities,and volunteered at a nonprofit organization five hours each week.
the alj also heard other pertinent testimony and opinions at the hearing.robert mulhausen,a physician in internal medicine,testified at the hearing after reviewing the record and listening to haynes testify.mulhausen identified a number of impairments haynes suffered the healed fracture and post surgery complications,history of ethanol dependency in remission with occasional relapse,depression,bipolar disorder,stress disorder,tobacco abuse,and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
mulhausen testified that haynes did not have any impairment or combination thereof that met or was the medical equivalent of any listed impairment.mulhausen offered no opinion regarding haynes limitations prior to june.he opined,however,that haynes was able to perform at a level less than the sedentary exertional level for the year after he injured his june,to june.but mulhausen concluded that,after june,haynes could perform tasks that entailed standing or walking for three to four hours a day,for five to ten minutes at a time lifting up to pounds occasionally and pounds frequently sitting with the ability to change position every to minutes and with reasonable arm and hand use no climbing of ramps,ropes,or scaffolds no balancing and no exposure to humidity,fumes,or temperature extremes.in addition,mulhausen stated that haynes should avoid work that required balancing,hazards,machinery,or heights.finally,mulhausen opined that haynes would miss no more than three days of work per month due to his heel pain and pulmonary problems.
edward utities,a vocational expert,also testified after having reviewed the record.the alj asked utities a hypothetical question whether jobs existed that a person of haynes age range to,education,and vocational background could perform if he could lift pounds occasionally and pounds frequently stand and walk three to four hours in a workday for only five to ten minutes at a time and sit for most of the workday if permitted to change position every to minutes.the alj hypothetical further assumed that such an individual could perform work in the unskilled to lower range only occasionally kneel,crawl,push,or pull not use ladders,balance,stoop,or crouch and not be exposed to humidity,dust,fumes,unprotected heights,dangerous moving machinery if balance is involved,temperature extremes,or vibrations.
taking into account these various limitations,utities opined that such a hypothetical person could,in the regional economy,perform assembly jobs of which there were about statewide or packing jobs statewide.
based on the record and evidence adduced at the hearing,the alj undertook the required analysis,see,and rendered a partially favorable decision on march.the alj found that haynes had not been engaged in substantial gainful activity since september,step one.he also found that haynes suffered from severe medical impairment step two namely,chronic obstructive pulmonary disease a comminuted displaced right calcaneus fracture with multiple fragmentation and depressive,bipolar,and substance addiction disorders.the alj concluded,however,that those impairments did not meet or equal the level of severity required by the listings step three.pt,subpt.p,app.accordingly,the alj found that 
from june,to june,haynes would have had the residual functional capacity rfc for less than full time sedentary level work on a sustained basis,due to his right calcaneal fracture,and necessary recuperation period.however,the undersigned finds that haynes otherwise had the rfc at least for work requiring lifting pounds occasionally and pounds frequently,to hours in an hour work day,and to minutes at a time,sitting up to hours in an hour work day,and to minutes at a time,no climbing,balancing,stooping,or crawling,only occasional kneeling or crouching,limited pushing or pulling,no work around unprotected heights or dangerous moving machinery,no work around temperature or humidity extremes,dust,or fumes,and no more than unskilled or lower level work.the undersigned finds no substantial support in the record as a whole for further reduction in this rfc.
the alj then considered whether haynes could return to any of his past relevant work as a carpenter.the alj found that at all times relevant to the adjudication,haynes had a history of work with no work skills transferable to his rfc,so haynes was unable to return to that work step four.based on utities testimony,the alj found that haynes could perform a significant number of jobs then existing in the national bench assembler and to haynes rfc,age,education,and work experience step five.
in sum,the alj determined that haynes was disabled from june,to june,because he could not perform even sedentary work during that period.outside that period,however,haynes was capable of performing more than the full range of sedentary work,but less than a full range of light work,due to standing and walking restrictions.the appeals council denied haynes request for review of this determination,so the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner of social security.haynes then sought judicial review in the district court,which affirmed the commissioner decision.
ii.discussion 
when the appeals council denies review,we review the alj decision as the administration final decision.eads sec y of health human,cir.we review the alj legal conclusions de novo.see fast barnhart,cir citation omitted.we deferentially review the alj factual determinations,however,and will affirm a decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.g jens barnhart,cir see also richardson perales,d substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.internal quotation marks omitted.we review the record as a whole,but we are not to reweigh the evidence or substitute our own judgment for that of the alj.see jens,at estok apfel,cir.in rendering a decision,the alj must build a logical bridge from the evidence to his conclusion.see steele barnhart,cir.the alj need not,however,provide a complete written evaluation of every piece of testimony and evidence.diaz chater,cir.
haynes alleges two errors on the alj part.first,haynes argues that,based on the alj rfc determination,the medical vocational guidelines the grids required a finding of disabled for the period after june.second,haynes claims that the alj erred by ignoring testimony from mulhausen and substituting his own layman opinion.we take these arguments in turn.
a.the grids 
as noted,the alj found that for the period outside june,to june,haynes had an rfc subject to various limitations.specifically,the alj determined that haynes could stand and walk less than what is required of the full range of light work but could lift more than the weight required of sedentary work the alj also determined that haynes was subject to various nonexertional restrictions that limited climbing,balancing,stooping,or crawling.accordingly,the alj concluded that haynes could perform a significant number of assembly or packing jobs available in the local economy,consistent with the vocational
