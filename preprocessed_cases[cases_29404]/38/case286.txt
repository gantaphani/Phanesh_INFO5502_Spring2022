this litigation concerns a home located in metairie,louisiana that was severely damaged in by hurricane katrina.state farm insurance company issued a flood insurance policy to tara and brandon monistere pursuant to the national flood insurance program.the monisteres were unsatisfied with the amount paid under the policy and filed suit.the district court entered judgment in favor of the homeowners for the full policy amount after applying a legal theory occasionally used to determine coverage under certain private insurance policies.that theory is inapplicable to this federal program.we reverse and render judgment in favor of state farm.
facts and procedural background 
the monisteres maintained a flood policy on their home.state farm issued them a standard flood insurance policy in which coverage is provided by the federal government.on august,hurricane katrina caused substantial damage to their home.what is at issue is the appropriate amount to be paid under the policy.
the state farm policy contained four separate coverages on the home,only two of which are relevant in this appeal building coverage coverage a,which has a limit and increased cost of compliance coverage coverage d,which has a limit under the policy.
in the aftermath of hurricane katrina,state farm sent an adjuster,michael boudreaux,to inspect the property.boudreaux initial estimate was.state farm asserts this figure was simply the value of the home one week later,boudreaux issued an estimate of.state farm paid the monisteres that amount,less a deductible.
after receipt of payment,the monisteres provided state farm with estimates of their own.the monisteres submitted an estimate from whites whites redevelopment corporation,dated november,which determined that repairs would cost.in january,whites whites revised its estimate,which was now.state farm never the premises nor paid out any additional amount under coverage 
in january,the department of emergency management for jefferson parish,louisiana,where this property is located,issued a substantial damage determination letter on the home.under federal emergency management agency requirements,such a determination meant the home would have to be rebuilt to a new height before future flood insurance could be obtained.state farm paid the full amount of the compliance coverage provided under the policy.compliance costs were far more than that.
it was determined that the damaged structure could not feasibly be raised.as a result,the monisteres obtained an estimate from highland homes for demolishing the old home and building a new one that would comply with elevation requirements.the estimate was for.a demand was made for the remainder of the amount of coverage a under the policy,which compensated for physical losses to the premises.state farm refused,notifying the monisteres that nothing more was owed under that coverage.an entirely new home was eventually built at a cost of about.
in august,the monisteres brought suit in united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana.a bench trial was held in november.both of the monisteres testified.also testifying were jefferson parish building permit manager and the parish flood plain rating system coordinator.the undisputed testimony was that the monisteres were forced to demolish and rebuild their home in order to comply with fema regulations.two state farm adjusters assigned to the monisteres case,michael boudreaux and david andras,testified.their testimony discussed the costs required to repair the damaged portions of the monisteres home.
the district court,after hearing all of the testimony,entered judgment in favor of the monisteres.there was no written opinion in the case.instead,oral reasons were announced from the bench.an award was made of the remainder of the amount available under coverage a,or.legal interest from the date of judgment was to be paid.state farm timely appealed.
ii.discussion 
as we noted previously,the monisteres standard flood insurance policy was purchased under the national flood insurance program.the program is controlled by federal regulations.see.a standard policy appears in the regulations.id.at pt,app.a.we will refer to the regulations and the policy somewhat interchangeably,but it is critical in our analysis that the source for these obligations and restrictions is federal law.our review of a district court interpretation of a statute or regulation is de novo.teemac henderson,cir.
a.the district court mode of analysis 
the district court concluded that the monisteres were entitled to an award of.this was the amount available under coverage a of the monisteres policy after deducting what state farm already paid.we review the method by which that amount was calculated.
article vii v of the monisteres policy establishes the means of calculating compensable damages in the event of flood loss 
a.we will pay to repair or replace the damaged dwelling after application of the deductible and without deduction for appreciation,but not more than the least of the following amounts 
the building limit of liability shown on your declarations page 
the replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged,with materials of like kind and quality and for like use or 
the necessary amount actually spent to repair or replace the damaged part of the dwelling for like use.
the monisteres building limit of liability,also known as coverage a,was capped at for direct physical loss.see pt,app.a,art.iii a.direct physical loss is defined under the policy as l oss or damage to insured property,directly caused by a flood.there must be evidence of physical changes to the property.id.at art.ii a.
in determining the monisteres direct physical loss,the district court utilized the judicially created constructive total loss doctrine.see greer owners ins,d.in greer,it was said that a constructive total loss occurs when a building,although still standing,is damaged to the extent that ordinances or regulations in effect at the time of the damage actually prohibit or prevent the building repair,such that the building has to be demolished.id applying this definition,the district court awarded the monisteres their building coverage limits,holding that the home was rendered a constructive total loss by the flood damage,because the court was convinced that requiring them to elevate the home,plus the cost to repair it,could have clearly and easily exceeded the market value of the home.the court justified this conclusion based on the evidence,on logic,and on common sense.
the district court common sense view did not give sufficient meaning to the regulations that control us.certainly,the monisteres were required to re build at a higher elevation.the very real costs associated with that requirement are covered only to the extent permitted by policy and regulatory language.we have already quoted the relevant policy language.payment for direct physical coverage under which the additional amounts were awarded made for the lesser of the coverage limit,the replacement cost of that part of the dwelling damaged depends on adequately documented proof of loss,the largest timely submitted being about,and the evidence to support that amount,or the amount actually spent to repair building an entirely new home cost.article vii v of the policy pt,app.a j,art.ii a.by utilizing the constructive total loss doctrine,the district court overrode these requirements 
the home was effectively a total loss,but that was due to the costs that regulatory authorities imposed for rebuilding.such costs were specifically addressed in coverage d of the monisteres policy,capped at.the monisteres concede that they were paid the full amount of compliance coverage.the district court was without authority to balance did that ahead of time and determined the maximum amount that would be paid.see thomas standard fire ins,d finding that increased cost of compliance under coverage d should not be considered in determining what constitutes a direct physical loss under coverage a.
our analysis is channeled by the requirement that a policy of insurance issued pursuant to a federal program must be strictly construed and enf
