kathleen sebelius,secretary of the united states department of health and human services hhs,has appealed from the district court judgment holding the secretary medicare regulation to be arbitrary and capricious,as well as a violation of the equal protection clause.the dispute centers around certain medicare reimbursement adjustments to appellees,two pennsylvania hospitals.the district court found there was no rational basis to exclude from such reimbursements patients covered by pennsylvania general assistance ga plan,while at the same time including patients covered under a federal statutory waiver program.for the reasons that follow,we will reverse the judgment of the district court.
background 
medicare and medicaid 
medicare,the federal health insurance program for older and disabled individuals,reimburses hospitals for specified inpatient services based upon a prospective system.under this system,payments are predicated upon prevailing rates for given services,rather than retrospectively based on a hospital actual costs.id.at d.the statute provides for certain adjustments to prospective reimbursement rates,such as for different wage levels,hospitals with medical education,and sole community hospitals.id.at d d.
another adjustment provided for by the statute is for disproportionate share hospitals dsh,hospitals that serve high numbers of patients.whether a hospital is eligible for a medicare dsh adjustment depends in part on the number of days during which the hospital treats certain patients,also known as patient days.the relevant language of the subsection concerning calculation of medicare dsh adjustments is as follows 
ii the number of the hospital patient days for such period which consist of patients who for such days were eligible for medical assistance under a state plan approved under subchapter xix of this chapter medicaid 
in determining under subclause ii the number of the hospital patient days for such period which consist of patients who for such days were eligible for medical assistance under a state plan approved under subchapter xix of this chapter,the secretary may,to the extent and for the period the secretary determines appropriate,include patient days of patients not so eligible but who are regarded as such because they receive benefits under a demonstration project approved under subchapter xi of this chapter.
d f vi ii emphasis added.in plain english,the medicare dsh formula takes into account the number of patient days for those patients eligible for medicaid,and may also include patient days for those patients ineligible for medicaid,but who received benefits under a medicaid demonstration project.
pursuant to the medicaid act,individual states submit a medical assistance plan which provides coverage to certain classes of indigent individuals,which we will call a state plan.a.a state plan must conform to certain statutory eligibility requirements,but the law also provides states flexibility regarding some of the categories of individuals to be covered,and the medical care and services that they can receive.see cooper.hosp.sebelius,d,aff,cir.once a plan is approved by the secretary,the state can receive certain reimbursements from the federal government based on amounts expended as medical assistance under the state plan,that is,those amounts expended covering individuals eligible for medicaid.see of.med.ctr.sebelius,cir.
as noted above in the medicare dsh provision cited,the secretary is empowered to waive statutory requirements pertaining to federal entitlement programs such as medicaid and regard patients as eligible for medicaid if they are treated under an experimental,pilot or demonstration project under.thus,medicare dsh adjustments take into account both the patient days that a hospital has treated patients eligible for medicaid,and days for those patients ineligible for medicaid but who receive benefits pursuant to a medicaid demonstration project.to authorize such a project,known as a section waiver project the secretary must conclude that the proposal is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of medicaid.a.in addition,the secretary has discretion to choose which medicaid requirements will be waived,how long the waiver lasts,and whether the costs of the project will be considered expenditures.id.at a a.the secretary must also conclude that the project will be.id.at e.waivers are not inherently provided for in state plans rather,states must submit specific applications for section waiver projects.
evolution of the medicare dsh formula 
initially,for purposes of calculating dsh adjustments,the medicare statute counted simply the number of the hospital patient days of service for which patients were eligible for medicaid but not entitled to medicare part a b.patients were considered eligible for medicaid if they were eligible for inpatient hospital services under an approved state medicaid plan.although the secretary administers dsh payments,it is a fiscal intermediary,typically a health insurance company authorized to act on the secretary behalf,who reviews the hospital cost reports.phoenix mem l hosp.sebelius,cir.the medicare dsh formula was regarded by intermediaries,at least in some states,as including days covered under state ga and charity care programs.in brief,ga programs generally provide reimbursement to hospitals for care of individuals who are as defined by a given state,but not eligible for medicaid.id.it seems that through the,intermediaries in pennsylvania included ga patient days in the medicare dsh formula.appellees br.at.
however,i n light of discrepancies between the practices of fiscal intermediaries in the various states,in december the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms clarified that the medicare dsh formula only permitted the inclusion of patient days wherein the patients were eligible for medicaid,excluding state general assistance and charity plan patient days going forward.see adventist health sunbelt,sebelius,cir app.in january,the secretary issued a final interim rule,stating that hospitals may include all days attributable to populations eligible for title xix matching payments through a waiver approved under section of the social security act.b ii.thus,while ga patient days remained excluded,hospitals could now count patient days for individuals covered under a section waiver project toward their medicare dsh adjustment.
during the subsequent notice and comment period,several comments were submitted to the secretary claiming that the inclusion of days under a section waiver was unfair to those hospitals that did not operate under such a waiver,but rather treated patients eligible only under state ga plans.the secretary agreed that while the regulation does advantage states that have a section expansion waiver in place,these days are considered to be title xix days by medicaid standards.medicare program changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems and fiscal year rates,fr.the secretary went further 
general assistance days are days for patients covered under a or general assistance program,whether or not any payment is available for health care services under the program.charity care days are those days that are utilized by patients who can not afford to pay and whose care is not covered or paid by any health insurance program.while we recognize that these days may be included in the calculation of a state medicaid dsh payments,these patients are not under the state plan and are not considered title xix beneficiaries.therefore,pennsylvania,and other states that have erroneously included these days in the medicare disproportionate share adjustment calculation in the past,will be precluded from including such days in the future.
app.as such,the final rule,issued in august,stated that section waiver patient days could be included in medicare dsh calculations,while ga patient days remained excluded.
subsequently,congress passed the deficit reduction act of dra.that law amended the statutory medicare dsh provision to state explicitly that patient days would be counted for those patients eligible for medicaid,and the secretary may include patient days of patients not so eligible but who are regarded as such because they receive benefits under a demonstration project approved under subchapter xi of this chapter medicaid.d f vi ii.in addition,the dra ratified,effective as of the date of their respective promulgations,certain regulations which provide for the treatment of individuals eligible for medical assistance under a demonstration project,b.specifically listed as one of the ratified regulations was the january interim final rule,which stated that section waiver patient days were to be included in medicare dsh calculations.id.
state general assistance plan 
after the promulgation of the final rule,but before the enactment of the dra,appellees nazareth hospital and agnes medical center,both pennsylvania hospitals,included ga patient days in their medicare cost reports under protest.appellees br.at app.notably,pennsylvania has not applied for a section waiver,and instead provides reimbursements to certain hospitals as a component of the state ga program.that ga program reimburses hospitals and provides cash assistance for patients who are ineligible for medicaid,but are nonetheless classified as or otherwise needy by the state.app.appellees note that,while ostensibly,the ga program was described in pennsylvania state medicaid plan,specifically in amendment spa,as a part of the state proposal to distribute certain payments,known as medicaid dsh payments.
such payments,which are distinguished from medicare dsh adjustments that are the subject of this appeal,can be distributed at the state discretion,so long as they are distributed to institutions that provide care to individuals,as defined by the state itself.of.med,at describing the different payment mechanisms.states often describe in their state medicaid plan relevant state charity or general assistance plans,so that hospitals which treat patients under such plans can receive medicaid dsh payments.see adena reg l med.ctr.leavitt,
accordingly,pennsylvania amended its state medicaid plan via amendment spa to provide 
additional payments to meet the needs of those facilities which serve a large number of medicaid and medical assistance eligible,low income patients these payments are available to hospitals on behalf of certain persons who are described below and are made in addition to,and not as a substitute for,disproportionate share payments described in other portions of this state plan.
app.amendment spa further stated that those persons were those who were covered under the state ga program.app.as such,spa established that medicaid dsh payments were to be used by pennsylvania,in part,to reimburse hospitals for care of ga patients.
procedural history 
following appellees protest inclusion of ga patient days on their medicare cost reports,the intermediary excluded those days from the hospitals medicare dsh calculations.that decision was affirmed by both the appellate provider reimbursement review board and the cms administrator.the hospitals appealed the ruling of the administrator to the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,on the grounds that excluding ga days was an impermissible construction of the medicare statute by the secretary,excluding ga patient days while including section waiver days was arbitrary and capricious under the administrative procedure act,and such disparate treatment constituted an equal protection violation.
the case was initially held in suspense pending the appeal in cooper university hospital sebelius,d.that case concerned whether patient days covered under the new jersey charity care program should be included in medicare dsh calculations.id.at.the district court held that while the statute was ambiguous,the secretary permissibly construed the law to exclude charity care patient days from the medicare dsh formula.id.at.we agreed with this reasoning and affirmed in a precedential opinion,substantially for the reasons set forth by the district court,noting that w e could not do it better cooper.hosp.sebelius,cir.
following that ruling,the parties in this case filed for summary judgment in the district court,with the appellees limiting their arguments to whether the disparate treatment of ga and section patient days constituted arbitrary and capricious action under the apa,or a violation of equal protection.the district court initially remanded the case to the agency to make a more complete record regarding the distinction between ga patient days and section days.the agency responded at length,answering inquiries posed by the district court,such as that regarding the similarity between hospital patient populations covered under the ga plan and those in other states covered under section demonstration projects.in one relevant passage,the secretary noted 
the eligibility criteria for the individual state section populations are federally approved and set forth in the terms and conditions of the section waiver project.reviewed and approved by the federal government as likely to assist in promoting the objectives of medicaid.no such federal determination has been made with respect to a program.in addition,the expenditures under the section waiver must be budget neutral.the medicaid expenditures under the waiver can not exceed the expenditures that would have otherwise been spent under the medicaid state plan.the state only funded program has no such restrictions.
app.the secretary concluded,in essence,that she had acted rationally in including patient days for those patients eligible for traditional medicaid,as well as those days,related to the federally approved and authorized section waiver populations for whom expenditures for care is considered to be an approved expenditure under title xix.app.as such,the secretary held,because pennsylvania ga patients did not fall under either category,it was reasonable to exclude them from medicare dsh calculations.
the district court disagreed.it held that there was no rational distinction between the state ga program and several section waiver projects,in terms of eligibility requirements and services covered.the court further determined that,just as in approving a section waiver,cms determined that the objectives of the medicaid statute were promoted by authorizing spa.app.the district court concluded that the secretary disparate treatment could not stand under both the apa and the equal protection clause.as a consequence,the court ordered the secretary to remit certain medicare dsh adjustments to plaintiffs,including patient days under the state ga program.
ii.standard of review 
we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.we apply de novo review to a district court grant of summary judgment in a case brought under the apa,and in turn apply the applicable standard of review to the underlying agency decision.pennsylvania,dep t of pub.welfare sebelius,cir internal quotations omitted.pursuant to the apa,courts must set aside agency action which is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law,or which is conducted,without observance of procedure required by law a d.
under what we have called this narrow standard of review,we insist that an agency examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for its action.fox television stations,d quoting motor vehicle mfrs.ass of united states,state farm mut.automobile ins,d.agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency offers insufficient reasons for treating similar situations differently.if an agency makes an exception in one case,then it must either make an exception in a similar case or point to a relevant distinction between the two cases.muwekma ohlone tribe salazar,internal quotations and citations omitted.
review of an equal protection claim in the context of agency action is similar to that under the apa.that is,an agency decision must be upheld if under the equal protection clause,it can show a rational basis for its decision.beach commc ns,d.as such,the equal protection argument can be folded into the apa argument,since no suspect class is involved and the only question is whether the treatment of appellees was rational,not arbitrary and capricious.ursack sierra interagency black bear,cir.taken together,we need only consider whether the secretary set forth a satisfactory,rational explanation for her actions here.see new jersey hosp.ass waldman,cir finding that arbitrary and capricious review also governed by whether state can show rational basis.
iii.discussion 
our review of the record establishes that the secretary set forth multiple rational bases upon which to distinguish patient days covered under pennsylvania ga program,from days covered under a section waiver project.we first explain that the secretary has the statutory authority to treat those two categories of patient days differently from each other.further,we conclude that,given the different purposes of the programs,and the extent of federal control over them,it was neither arbitrary nor capricious to do so.
statutory distinction 
appellees did not claim below,and do not now contend,that the secretary lacked statutory authority to either include section patient days,or exclude state ga days from medicare dsh calculations.while the language of the relevant statutory provision obviously does not determine whether the secretary acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner,we think it a relevant starting point in our analysis,as the statute is at the root of the distinction between the two types of patient days at issue.
the statutory subsection,d f vi ii,mandates that medicare dsh adjustments are keyed to the number of patient days,adding that the secretary may also choose to include days for patients eligible under a section project.appellees point out that the latter subsection,providing discretion to include section patient days,was passed as part of the dra in,whereas the regulation at issue was finalized in.therefore,appellees claim,the statute must be evaluated as it stood in,lacking any mention of section waiver projects.
we note,however,that the dra explicitly ratified,effective as of the date of its promulgation,the january interim final rule,as it pertained to section waiver projects.b,b a,b.it follows that there is no problem of retroactivity.the deficit reduction act did not retroactively alter settled law it simply clarified an ambiguity in the existing legislation.cookeville reg l med.ctr.leavitt.accordingly,there can be no dispute that,at the very least,the secretary had discretion to include section patient days in the medicare dsh adjustment,as of the date of the interim final rule in january.
in addition,circuit courts have held that it is a permissible,or even necessary,construction of the statute to exclude state charity or ga plan patient days from medicare dsh calculations.in adena regional medical center leavitt,the circuit held that ohio charity care patient days could not be included in the medicare dsh calculation,on the view that the medicare statute specifically excluded such patient days.similarly,in university of washington medical center,the ninth circuit found that the statute required the secretary to exclude from medicare dsh calculations days for those patients who were not eligible for medicaid but nonetheless covered under washington state plan.see also phoenix mem l hosp.sebelius,at finding that exclusion from medicare dsh formula of patient populations not covered by arizona section waiver was not contrary to law,arbitrary or capricious,or unsupported by substantial evidence.
in cooper,we affirmed that it was permissible for the secretary to exclude new jersey charity patient days from medicare dsh adjustments.the district court correctly noted that the dra suggest ed congress intent to narrowly apply the medicaid proxy fraction,in ratifying the discretionary inclusion only of section waiver patient days.cooper,d at 
in sum,the secretary had discretion to include section patient days in medicare dsh adjustments,pursuant to congressional ratification,and could exclude state charity or general assistance days.the government must now establish that,in taking both such actions,the secretary articulated a rational basis for doing so.
distinction in purpose 
the government argues that the very purpose of a section waiver project rationally distinguishes it from pennsylvania ga plan.br.at.that is,a section waiver project is an experimental,demonstration or pilot project which is only approved if the secretary concludes that it is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of medicaid.a.as cms explained on remand 
the purpose of these section demonstrations,which give states additional flexibility to design and improve their programs,is to demonstrate and evaluate policy approaches such as expanding eligibility to individuals who are not otherwise medicaid or chip eligible providing services not typically covered by medicaid using innovative service delivery systems that improve care,increase efficiency,and reduce costs.
app.in fact,a section waiver project can be vacated if a court finds that the secretary could not have rationally found the program likely to advance the objectives of medicaid.see newton nations betlach,cir vacating medicaid waiver due to insufficient evidence that the secretary consider ed the impact of the state project on the persons the medicaid act was enacted to protect quoting beno shalala,cir new jersey dep t of health human,cir reviewing similar waiver project under aid to families with dependent children program.by contrast,rather than a demonstration project,the pennsylvania ga plan constitutes the permanent state medical assistance program,and requires no federal judgment that it is likely to assist in promoting the goals of medicaid.
however,the district court and appellees reject this distinction.the district court found,and appellees urge here,that the secretary approves a section waiver project just as she does pennsylvania ga program specifically amendment spa which is included as part of the state medicaid plan.this finding was in error.
while the secretary must find that a section waiver project is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of medicaid,she reviewed spa for an entirely different reason.under the medicaid dsh statute,state medicaid plans require dsh payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs.a.that provision requires a state to submit an amendment to its medicaid plan that specifically defines eligibility for medicaid dsh payments,and provides for an appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment for such services provided by such hospitals id.at a a b.in addition,states are required to submit a description of the methodology used by the state to identify and to make payments to disproportionate share hospitals on the basis of the proportion of and m edicaid patients id.at a d.
thus,the secretary did not determine that the objectives of the medicaid statute were promoted by authorizing spa,as the district court held.app.rather,the secretary reviewed spa simply to ascertain how pennsylvania intended to disburse medicaid dsh payments.see adena,at federal law obliged ohio to submit the amendment to its state medicaid plan to the secretary for approval because the mechanism for providing a dsh adjustment under medicaid is part of ohio medicaid plan,and the secretary must approve that plan.a section waiver is therefore distinct from spa,in that it serves a different purpose,and provides the secretary greater control and oversight.
importantly,cms noted this precise distinction upon remand,stating that,u nlike the state general assistance program,the section waiver has been reviewed and approved by the federal government as likely to assist in promoting the objectives of medicaid.no such federal determination has been made with respect to a program.app see also app noting that delaware section waiver project was required to be approved by cms as consistent with the objectives of medicaid in order to be treated as medicaid expenditures for the costs of individual care.that process did not occur under a section waiver approval for the general assistance state days involved in this case.
we agree with the govern
