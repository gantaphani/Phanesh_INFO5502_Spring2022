introduction 
both the workers compensation judge wcj and the workers compensation appeals board board determined that carlos medrano medrano,who suffered an industrial injury,was entitled to vocational rehabilitation services,including continuing payment of vocational rehabilitation maintenance allowance vrma,retroactive to the last temporary disability payment.the board determined,however,that state compensation insurance fund state fund,the employer insurer,was allowed a credit against vrma for wages medrano earned at employment subsequent to the employment at which he was injured.applying the reasoning in gamble workers comp.appeals bd.th,d gamble,we hold that vrma is not a wage replacement benefit,and therefore there should be no credit against the worker vrma payments for wages earned during the same period the worker was awarded vrma payments.
factual and procedural background 
while employed on may,by aquabrew,aquabrew,medrano sustained an injury.state fund accepted liability and paid temporary disability indemnity at the rate of per week for the period of june,to august.former labor code section,subdivision c provides that when,as here,the employee aggregate temporary disability exceeds days,there is a presumption that the employee is medically eligible for vocational rehabilitation services on june,state fund sent medrano the required notice of potential eligibility nope letter combined with a denial of vocational rehabilitation.the letter advised medrano that he was not eligible for vocational rehabilitation services based on his employer offer of modified or alternative work.
former section sets forth the conditions necessary for termination of the employer liability for vocational rehabilitation services.the obligation to provide services can be terminated if the employer offers,and the employee accepts or rejects,modified or alternative work.former,subds.a,or.if an offer of modified or alternative work meets the criteria of former section,subdivision a,or,a written plan or approval from the rehabilitation unit is not necessary,tit,subd.b.the worker has days to accept or reject a bona fide offer.if the offer is not accepted or rejected within days,the offer is deemed rejected unless there is an agreement for an extension of time.
medrano did not respond to a june,notice of offer of modified or alternative work within the allowable time authorized by the regulation.accordingly,state fund submitted a notice of termination of vocational rehabilitation services to the rehabilitation unit 
thereafter,medrano instituted proceedings with the rehabilitation unit to request vocational rehabilitation services.the rehabilitation unit reviewed the position statements of the parties and issued a determination that medrano was entitled to full vocational rehabilitation services and retroactive vrma,on a basis from april,until a qualified rehabilitation representative evaluated the offer of work for compliance with the regulations.
state fund appealed the determination of the rehabilitation unit.at the hearing on the appeal,medrano testified that he last worked for aquabrew in and went to work for another company on october,where he continued to work.
the wcj determined that medrano was entitled to full vocational rehabilitation services,as the offer of work was not appropriate because it was made while medrano was still medically temporarily disabled,which meant he was completely unable to work.accordingly,the offer was premature.moreover,the wcj found the offer did not comply with former section,as it did not confirm that the job would last at least months it did not provide the salary of the position or the location of the job it did not provide an adequate description of the duties.also,the wcj noted that a job description was not submitted to medrano primary treating physician for an opinion as to the suitability of the offer in view of medrano injuries.there was no other offer of work from aquabrew after medrano medical condition became permanent and stationary medrano was also awarded retroactive vrma from march,to october,at the rate of a week,less temporary disability paid during that period.the termination date of the vrma awarded was when medrano returned to the labor market.
the wcj set aside his findings and award and allowed the parties to reopen the record and brief the issue addressed in a published opinion in gamble,supra,th,d.the court in gamble considered whether an employer could receive credit against wages earned during the period of time the worker was awarded vrma while he continued to work at concurrent employment that preexisted the industrial injury.the court held that the first employer could not take a credit for wages earned at the secondary,concurrent employment against vrma payable amounts.id.at,d.
after a second hearing,the wcj awarded vrma from march,and continuing until medrano completed a vocational rehabilitation plan or he refused to enter into a plan,or it was found that he was not feasible to participate in such a plan,whichever occurred first.the rate of vrma payment was to be made at the delay rate.former section,subdivision a allows for payment at the delay rate,which is the same rate payable for temporary disability,as opposed to the allowable maximum rate of vrma at a week,subd.d.citing gamble,supra,th,d,the wcj also concluded that state fund was not entitled to credit for wages earned by medrano in subsequent employment during the period of time he was awarded vrma,
state fund filed a petition for reconsideration,contending it met its obligation to provide vocational rehabilitation services,and alternately,if required to pay vrma,it was entitled to full credit for wages earned against any vrma that may be due.the board granted review and issued an opinion and decision agreeing with the wcj decision that medrano was entitled to full vocational rehabilitation services.the board,however,determined that the amount of his earnings from subsequent employment must be subtracted from the vrma to which he was entitled.
medrano filed a petition for review that this court summarily denied.he then filed a petition for review by the supreme court.on july,the supreme court granted review,and the matter was transferred to this court with directions to vacate its order denying the petition for writ of review and to issue a writ of review.
