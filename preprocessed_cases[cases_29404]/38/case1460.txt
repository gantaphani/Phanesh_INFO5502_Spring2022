background 
thomas served on active duty in the united states navy from october until july,in the united states army from july until october,and in the alabama army national guard from july,until august.thomas principi,slip op.at,thomas ii.on august,thomas was involved in the altercation with a service member referred to as id.at.thomas contends that he witnessed with an unauthorized woman in the barracks and told him that the female visitor was required to leave.id.when indicated that he would not obey thomas order,thomas went to get the platoon sergeant.id.thomas contends that when he and the platoon sergeant returned to the barracks,yelled at and ran towards thomas.id.the platoon sergeant restrained and ordered thomas to leave the area three times.id.thomas did not comply with these orders and broke loose from the platoon sergeant grasp and attacked thomas.id.at.in the assault,thomas sustained a fractured right clavicle and mouth and dental injuries.id.at.in a memorandum dated august,the commander of thomas unit concluded that both parties were intoxicated and that thomas disobeyed a direct order and provoked id.at.
on february,thomas applied for benefits relating to these injuries.the montgomery,alabama regional office of the department of veterans affairs denied the claim,concluding that the injuries were the result of thomas willful misconduct.id.at.thomas subsequently appealed that decision,and in december,the board found that thomas claim was properly denied because thomas consumption of alcohol on august,constituted willful misconduct.id.on january,the board reconsidered its original opinion and rather than relying on thomas consumption of alcohol,it held that t he evidence establishes that the cause of the veteran injuries in was due to his disobedience of a lawful order and denied thomas claim to establish disability.id.at.thereafter,thomas appealed the board decision to the veterans court.on april,the veterans court issued an order affirming the board decision and entered judgment on august.on september,he appealed the veterans court decision to this court.

standard of review 
this court reviews decisions by the veterans court deferentially.this court must affirm the veterans court decision unless it is a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or d without observance of procedure required by law.d.except for constitutional issues,we may not review any challenge to a factual determination or any challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.id.d.
presumption of service connection 
on appeal,thomas first argues that the veterans court improperly ignored the presumption of service connection created by a.specifically,thomas contends that t he board decision did not address the statutory presumption of service connection in section a or whether the evidence rebutted this presumption.thomas also maintains that t he veterans court did not address the board violation of this law.in response,the government submits that the veterans court properly recognized that the presumption that an injury incurred during active military,naval,or air service was incurred in the line of duty unless the injury was a result of the person own willful misconduct.see id.a 
section creates a presumption of service connection for injuries that occur during active duty unless evidence establishes that the injury was the result of the person own misconduct.shedden principi,forshey principi,en banc.the veterans court properly acknowledged this presumption in its decision.indeed,it specifically referred to as creating the presumption that an injury incurred in the line of duty unless the injury was a result of the person own willful misconduct.thomas i,slip op.at.moreover,the board decision also recognized the presumption,citing and noting that a n injury or disease having an onset in service will be presumed to have been incurred in the line of duty unless the preponderance of the evidence establishes that it was due to willful misconduct.thomas ii,slip op.at.thus,we reject thomas argument to the contrary and conclude that the board and the veterans court properly considered the statutory presumption under a,and then correctly proceeded to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that thomas actions on august,constituted willful misconduct that caused the injuries he sustained on that date.
evidentiary standard 
in rejecting thomas appeal,the veterans court concluded that the government rebutted the presumption under a since it showed by a preponderance of evidence that thomas injuries were a result of willful misconduct.thomas principal argument on appeal is that the veterans court applied the incorrect evidentiary standard,namely the preponderance of evidence standard instead of the clear and convincing standard.acknowledging that sections a and b and m and n of the secretary regulations implementing do not provide an evidentiary standard by which the defense of willful misconduct must be proven,thomas argues that no less than a showing of clear and convincing evidence is necessary to rebut the presumption of service connection.thomas maintains that a preponderance of the evidence standard does not fairly distribute the risk of error between a veteran and the government because t he secretary is more capable of bearing the burden of error if an undeserving claimant prevails.in support of this argument,he points to b,and b as all requiring clear and convincing evidence to rebut a presumption in favor of the claimant.
the government responds that the veterans court properly affirmed the board determination that the presumption of service connection was rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence showing that thomas actions on august,constituted willful misconduct and that his actions were the proximate cause of his injuries.the government acknowledges that a does not specify the evidentiary standard necessary to rebut the presumption that a peacetime disability was incurred in line of duty,but argues that congress established the general evidentiary standard for factual determinations of veterans cases in b the government urges this court to apply,and the evidentiary standard applicable to,to a in this case.
in support,the government points out that this court in forshey examined for the purpose of determining the proper evidentiary standard under a,although forshey declined to decide whether set out a preponderance of evidence or clear and convincing standard.forshey,at.the government therefore contends that establishes a general evidentiary standard governing determinations by the board on issues material to the resolution of claims which is applicabl
