this case concerns the treasury department attempt to overcome the conceptual incompatibility of two statutes.specifically at issue is treasury selection of a weighted national average methodology to calculate locality pay increases under the federal law enforcement pay reform act of flepra,incorporated as title iv of the federal employees pay comparability act of,pub,stat.codified at,for retired uniformed division secret service agents who receive annuities under the district of columbia police and firefighters retirement and disability act dcra,ann.et.the conceptual difficulty arises because locality pay increases are geographically fixed while the dcra equalization provision is based on the salary of an agent in active service.notwithstanding the fact that secret service agents have postings throughout the united states and overseas,treasury has determined that locality pay applies to dcra secret service retirees.hence,no issue is before the court regarding the entitlement of those retirees to locality pay adjustments.rather,when treasury determined it would apply the weighted national average methodology,a number of dcra secret service retirees filed suit,and the district court invalidated treasury methodology.brown summers,d.treasury,joined by the united states and the district of columbia,appeals that judgment and contends that in light of the conceptually difficult task of calculating locality pay increases for retirees that track those of active agents,treasury methodology is fair and valid.we hold,first,that treasury as opposed to the district of columbia is the proper locus of decisionmaking for calculating the amount of locality pay for secret service retirees who have opted to retire under the dcra.we hold second,that whether viewed as filling a gap in the dcra equalization clause or as resolving an ambiguity arising from the confluence of two statutes,treasury methodology is entitled to deference under skidmore swift.accordingly,we reverse.
in floyd district of columbia,the court recounted congress determination that,in light of the secret service unique ties to the district of columbia metropolitan police department,secret service agents who performed duties related to the protection of the president for ten or more years could convert their retirement from the federal employee retirement system,et,to the plan governed by the dcra,ann.et.see ann.unlike the federal system,which provides for adjustments,the dcra contains an equalization clause that automatically increases retired agents pensions each time active agents receive salary increases.the equalization provision provides 
each individual retired from active service and entitled to receive a pension relief allowance or retirement compensation under subchapter i of this chapter shall be entitled to receive,without making application therefor,with respect to each increase in salary,granted by any law which takes effect after the effective date of the district of columbia police and firemen salary act amendments of,to which he would be entitled if he were in active service,an increase in his pension relief allowance or retirement compensation computed as follows his pension relief allowance or retirement compensation shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of such allowance or compensation and the per centum increase made by such law in the scheduled rate of compensation to which he would be entitled if he were in active service on the effective date of such increase in salary.

locality pay for secret service agents was first authorized by congress when it enacted flepra in.under flepra,federal law enforcement officials,including active members of the secret service,are paid a percentage of basic pay in addition to their rate of pay under the general schedule to reflect the higher cost of living in specified geographic areas.since,employees in cities have received locality pay increases,which the office of personnel management opm adjusts annually.and note.
in may,certain retired secret service agents,who were employed as criminal investigators at the time of their retirement and whose annuities are governed by the dcra,filed suit against treasury,the united states,and the district of columbia collectively the government,claiming that locality adjustments awarded to active agents pursuant to flepra were increases in salary subject to the dcra equalization clause.the district court dismissed the case without prejudice in december,subject to reopening within six months,when treasury agreed to include locality pay increases in the retirees annuities.letter of december,from nancy killefer,assistant secretary,dep t of treasury,to earl cabbell,interim chief financial officer,district of columbia the killefer letter,reprinted in joint appendix at.the case was reopened in july,when the retirees had not received locality pay increases.
treasury subsequently determined it would award each retiree locality pay increases based on a weighted national average of locality adjustments for active secret service agents since.the calculation under this methodology was based on the locality pay increases paid to active secret service agents throughout the united states,weighted to reflect the number of agents actually serving in each locality receiving increases.treasury then awarded lump sum back payments to all dcra secret service retirees,and used the weighted national average method to adjust annuity benefits for and each subsequent year.although this method benefitted some retirees,others would have fared better had the locality pay increase been determined by the location of their last post of duty.in january,the district court granted the motion of plaintiff retirees counsel to withdraw due to the irreconcilable conflict of interest between the retirees.
in may,retirees who were disadvantaged by the weighted national average methodology appeared before the district court with new counsel,who filed an amended complaint claiming that the locality pay increases reflected in their dcra retirement benefits should be computed on the basis of the locality pay in effect at their last post of duty.the district court denied the government motion to dismiss,and ruled,on for summary judgment,that treasury weighted national average methodology was not entitled to judicial deference under chevron,natural res.def.council,d,or skidmore,at.at.brown,d at.the court concluded that the district of columbia,rather than treasury,is responsible for dcra implementation,and that the plain language of dcra equalization clause requires individualized calculations based on factors individual to each retiree.id.the court invalidated treasury method,but declined to replace it with the last post of duty method,explaining that the latter is without any specific support in the language of the statute,and that the plaintiffs way is not the only way to comply with the statute mandate of individualized determinations.id.at.the court entered partial summary judgment for the retirees and remanded the case to treasury and the district of columbia to fashion a method that complies with the statute.id.at.
on appeal,the government contends,as it did in the district court,that treasury weighted national average methodology deserves deference under chevron,at.at,or alternatively,deference equal to its power to persuade under skidmore,at.at.either position requires the court to determine whether treasury as opposed to the district of columbia is the locus of decisionmaking with regard to locality pay for dcra secret service retirees,and the dcra plainly prohibits the use of a weighted national average to calculate locality pay increases for such retirees.
