a jury convicted dennis mcclatchey,a hospital executive,of one count of conspiracy and one count of violating the medicare antikickback act,for his role in the hospital payments to two doctors for referring patients to the hospital.the district court granted mcclatchey motion for judgment of acquittal on both charges.we reversed the district court judgment in united states mcclatchey,cir mcclatchey i,and remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict against mcclatchey.
this appeal concerns the sentence imposed on remand.the government appeals the sentence,contending that the district court miscalculated mcclatchey offense level by using an excessively low figure for the net amount of unlawful referral payments attributable to mcclatchey,and the district court improperly departed downward from the prescribed offense level on the grounds of extraordinary family circumstances and aberrant behavior.we have jurisdiction under b.we affirm the district court calculation of the offense level,reverse the downward departure,and remand for resentencing.
background 
facts relating to this case have previously been set forth in our first opinion,mcclatchey i,at,our related opinion in united states lahue,cir,cert.denied,d,and the district court opinion in united states anderson,d.we summarize here those facts relevant to the present appeal.
the gist of the offense was that baptist medical center baptist paid doctors robert and ronald lahue to refer patients to baptist.such referral fees violate the medicare antikickback act prohibition against knowingly and willfully offer ing or pay ing any remuneration to any person to induce such person to refer an individual to a person for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made under a federal health care program b a.
during the pertinent period mcclatchey served as chief operating officer and senior vice president of baptist,and then as a senior vice president at health midwest,which was baptist parent corporation at the time.the lahues were the principals of a medical practice called blue valley medical group bvmg,which provided care to patients in nursing homes and similar facilities.
in january baptist entered into a contract with the lahues,paying the doctors a total of to serve as of gerontology services at baptist.baptist chief financial officer testified that the negotiations for the contract had been backwards,in that the parties first set the fee and only then agreed to the services which the lahues would provide in return.after the contract was executed,the lahues began referring large numbers of their patients to baptist.
in june of,after the contract had expired,baptist entered into a second agreement with the lahues,providing that baptist would pay the doctors a combined to perform specified services.then,despite expiration of the contract,baptist continued to pay the lahues each year through,with the exception of,when each doctor received.the lahues performed only minimal services for baptist.anderson,d at.
in addition to paying cash to the lahues,baptist also provided an employee.in the summer of,at the request of the lahues,baptist chief executive officer dan anderson loaned tom eckard to the lahues to help them manage their practice.despite eckard official title as baptist director of geriatric services,he worked at bvmg and in effect served as bvmg manager.based on his discussions with mcclatchey and other baptist officials,eckard understood that his primary job responsibility was to maintain a positive relationship between bvmg and baptist,in order to assure that the flow of patients to the hospital would continue.anderson,d at.baptist,not bvmg,paid eckard salary.this arrangement continued until march.
in the summer of,after baptist merged into health midwest,the new attorney for baptist discussed with mcclatchey and other baptist officials the need to draft a new contract with the lahues,because the contract did not meet safe harbor regulations under the medicare antikickback act.mcclatchey oversaw the negotiations for a new contract.during the course of these negotiations,in late or early,mcclatchey learned that the lahues had not been performing some of the services specified in the contract and that certain staff members at baptist were not interested in having the lahues perform such services.mcclatchey i,at.also during the negotiations,the lahues informed mcclatchey and others at baptist that they would not accept a proposed contractual provision requiring them to perform a minimum number of hours of services for baptist.the contract ultimately executed in april contained no provision.under this contract baptist again agreed to pay the lahues.
months before execution of the contract,on november,an fbi agent and medicaid fraud investigator questioned mcclatchey and baptist ceo anderson about baptist relationship with bvmg,specifically seeking information about the fees paid to the lahues and the eckard arrangement.shortly thereafter,baptist retained attorneys specializing in civil and criminal health care fraud cases,who recommended that eckard immediately be removed from baptist payroll and placed on bvmg payroll.it was mcclatchey responsibility to fix the eckard arrangement.when it became clear that bvmg would not pay for eckard services,mcclatchey decided to bring eckard back to baptist,effective march.
in october mcclatchey left baptist to become senior vice president of corporate relations at its parent,health midwest.the next month the lahues notified baptist that they were terminating the contract,due to the anticipated sale of bvmg.health midwest executives,including mcclatchey,began discussing a strategy to replace the bvmg patients they anticipated losing upon termination of the lahue relationship.when the sale of bvmg fell through,baptist and the lahues continued their relationship under two temporary contracts.baptist relationship with the lahues finally ended in january.
mcclatchey was indicted on july,for conspiring to violate the medicare antikickback act,and for a substantive violation of the act.the jury returned guilty verdicts on both charges.following the verdict,the district court granted mcclatchey motion for acquittal.
we reversed.although we agreed with the district court that no reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that mcclatchey specifically intended to violate the act based on the evidence of his involvement,or,in the contract,the contract,and the loan of eckard to bvmg,we disagreed with the district court assessment of the evidence concerning mcclatchey negotiation of the contract.mcclatchey i,at.because the evidence presented at trial showed that mcclatchey knew as soon as late or early that the lahues had not performed substantial services required under the prior contracts,knew that some baptist staff members did not want the lahues to perform such services,and understood the importance to baptist of the lahues patient referrals,we concluded,the evidence concerning mcclatchey involvement in negotiating the agreement thus gives rise to a reasonable inference that he knowingly,voluntarily,and purposefully entered into an agreement with the specific intent to induce the lahues to refer their medicaid patients to baptist.id.at.we therefore set aside the district court judgment of acquittal and remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury verdict against mcclatchey.
on remand the district court calculated mcclatchey offense level as under the united states sentencing guidelines ussg.the court then granted him a downward departure on three grounds extraordinary family circumstances aberrant behavior and most strongly for a combination of family circumstances and aberrant behavior.aplt.app.at.the district court sentenced mcclatchey to three years probation,with home detention of six months under electronic monitoring,and imposed a fine and related costs.the government appeals the sentence,challenging the calculation of the offense level and the propriety of the downward departure.
ii.analysis 
calculation of the offense level 
in computing mcclatchey offense level under the version of the sentencing guidelines in effect at the time of his sentencing,the district court properly applied ussg,entitled bribery in procurement of bank loan and other commercial bribery.the base offense level under that guideline is if the bribe exceeded,the district court is instructed to increase that level by the number of levels from the table in.ussg b.amendment of the guidelines,effective november,deleted and moved its substance to.because mcclatchey was sentenced in september,that amendment does not govern this case.see united states williams,cir in general,we apply the guidelines provisions in effect at the time of sentencing.the district court found that the bribe was,and added to the offense level.ussg b f.the government challenges the figure,contending that the bribe was million,or at least.as a result,the offense level would need to be increased by from to levels,rather than only by.ussg b i and l.
both parties agree that the amount of the bribe should be calculated as the amount paid to the lahues less the value of the lawful services they provided.they disagree on which bribes mcclatchey bears responsibility for that is,what part of the unlawful conduct is relevant to sentencing mcclatchey,and the value of the lahues services.
relevant conduct 
the sentencing guidelines state which acts and omissions are to be considered in determining the offense level used in sentencing the defendant.the governing rules are set forth in ussg,entitled relevant conduct factors that determine the guideline range.for a crime such as the one here a jointly undertaken criminal activity a criminal plan,scheme,endeavor,or enterprise undertaken by the defendant in concert with others,whether or not charged as a conspiracy relevant conduct includes all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.ussg a b.see united states tagore,cir.
for assistance in interpreting the guideline language,we turn to the commentary to the guideline.commentary that explains a guideline is authoritative unless it violates the constitution or a federal statute,or is inconsistent with,or a plainly erroneous reading of,that guideline.stinson united states,d.the commentary to ussg states that the focus is on the specific acts and omissions for which the defendant is to be held accountable,rather than on whether the defendant is criminally liable for an offense as a conspirator.ussg,comment.indeed,a defendant jointly undertaken criminal activity is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy,and hence relevant conduct is not necessarily the same for every participant,comment.thus,the court must first determine the scope of the criminal activity the particular defendant agreed to jointly undertake,the scope of the specific conduct and objectives embraced by the defendant agreement.id.emphasis added.proper attribution at sentencing requires the district court to analyze,and make particularized findings about,the scope of the specific agreement the individual defendant joined in relation to the conspiracy as a whole.united states melton,cir internal quotation marks omitted.
the government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the factual basis for attributing the conduct of coconspirators to the defendant for sentencing purposes.united states tran,cir.in this case the district court found that the evidence presented at trial showed,by a preponderance of the evidence,that mcclatchey agreed only to jointly undertake the crime of paying bribes through the contract.aplt.app.at.accordingly,the court considered only the bribe paid under that contract in determining the sentence.
we review the sentencing court fact findings for clear error.see melton,at.to constitute clear error,we must be convinced that the sentencing court finding is simply not plausible or permissible in light of the entire record on appeal,remembering that we are not free to substitute our judgment for that of the district judge.united states torres,cir.
the government argues that the district court finding contravenes our holding in mcclatchey i.it contends that we held in mcclatchey i that mcclatchey joined the referral conspiracy beginning in the summer of,when he oversaw the negotiations for the contract.thus,the government asserts,once it is accepted that mcclatchey was a member of the conspiracy,his culpability is not measured by his relevant conduct found by a preponderance of the evidence,as the district court stated,but instead by the relevant conduct of the other conspirators that was reasonably foreseeable to him.aplt.opening br.at.that conduct,in the government view,encompasses not just bribes paid under the contract,but all illegal payments to the lahues from the summer of forward,including payments under the contract,eckard salary,payments under contracts with the lahues executed after mcclatchey left baptist in october of,and various sweetheart deals between baptist and the lahues.according to the government,the combined value of these payments exceeded million,which would result in an increase in mcclatchey offense level under former ussg b l.
the government misperceives the nature of the inquiry under ussg.although we stated in mcclatchey i that the evidence at trial supported mcclatchey conviction as a member of the conspiracy to violate the antikickback act,mcclatchey i,at,such a determination,by itself,is not sufficient to hold him responsible for all reasonably foreseeable bribes paid by his coconspirators.see melton,at.relevant conduct is limited to those reasonably foreseeable bribes that are part of the criminal activity mcclatchey agreed to jointly undertake.ussg,comment.see tagore,at melton,at.the scope of mcclatchey jointly undertaken criminal activity is not necessarily the same as the scope of the entire conspiracy.ussg,comment.in particular,t he fact that the defendant is aware of the scope of the overall operation is not enough to establish the scope of the defendant agreement and therefore,is not enough to hold him accountable for the activities of the whole operation.united states campbell,cir.
our opinion in mcclatchey i did not determine the precise boundaries of the criminal activity mcclatchey agreed to jointly undertake.all it did was hold that the jury verdict against him had to be sustained because there was sufficient evidence that he conspired to have baptist and the lahues enter into the improper contract.
we recognize that a reasonable person could have found that mcclatchey had agreed to all improper payments to the lahues beginning as early as some time in.but the evidence hardly compelled such a finding.determining the specific conduct and objectives embraced by mcclatchey agreement,ussg,comment,is not a matter of scientific precision.different reasonable people could view the circumstantial evidence differently.we find no clear error in the district court finding regarding the scope of mcclatchey relevant conduct.
the value of the bribe under the contract 
having determined that it was not clear error for the district court to limit mcclatchey relevant conduct under ussg to bribes paid under the contract,we turn to the government contention that the district court clearly erred in calculating the value of the bribe paid under that contract.the payment to the lahues under the contract was.the issue is the value of any services performed by the lahues in return.
at the sentencing of mcclatchey codefendant dan anderson,the district court decided that the lahues rendered worth of services to baptist each year between and,but were paid annually.therefore,the court concluded,at least,though probably more,of the money paid to the lahues each year was a bribe.aplt.app.at.the district court adopted this finding at mcclatchey sentencing,and concluded that the value of the bribe paid under the contract was.
the government contends that the district court bribe calculation was clearly erroneous.it asserts that the entire paid under the contract was a bribe,because the lahues performed virtually no services for baptist.it points out that in the district court july,opinion granting mcclatchey judgment of acquittal,the court stated with respect to the contract that the doctors performed only minimal services under the contract.anderson,d at see id.at.
the government does not,however,suggest any reason why the court could not reassess the evidence at the time of sentencing.we may reverse the district court valuation of the bribe as clearly erroneous only if it is implausible in light of the entire record on appeal.torres,at.that is not the case here.as the government concedes,there is evidence in the record suggesting that the lahues performed substantial services for baptist.aplt.reply br.at.indeed,the record contains direct support for the district court specific finding that the value of the services the lahues rendered was worth per year.in determining the value of those services,the district court relied on a memorandum from ron keel,an operations vice president at baptist,that recommended reducing payments to the lahues from to per year.the court stated that keel was the individual at baptist closest to the relationship with the lahues and was in the best position to put a ceiling on the value to baptist of whatever legitimate services the lahues were performing.aplt.app.at.other evidence in the record also supports the figure.nevada lee,medical director of baptist clinic from,testified that she observed the lahues perform a number of services for the hospital,and that she believed payments of million over ten years for those services was a very fair deal.aplee.at.various doctors and nurses also testified that the lahues performed important services for baptist.
to be sure,as the district court recognized,there was also ample testimony that the lahues performed minimal services for baptist.aplt.app.at.nevertheless,as described above,there was evidence supporting the district court conclusion that the lahues rendered services worth.we therefore can not say that the district court determination of the value of the bribe paid under the contract was clearly erroneous.see anderson city of bessemer city,d where there are two permissible views of the evidence,the factfinder choice between them can not be clearly erroneous.
downward departure 
the district court granted mcclatchey a downward departure from the guideline range on three grounds extraordinary family circumstances,aberrant behavior,and a combination of the two factors.the government contends that none of these grounds supports a downward departure in this case.we review departures from the guidelines under a unitary standard,giving deference to essentially factual questions and plenary review to those that are essentially legal.united states concha,cir.
extraordinary family circumstances 
the sentencing guidelines state that a defendant f amily ties and responsibilities are not ordinarily relevant in determining whether a sentence should be outside the applicable guideline range.ussg.in other words,family circumstances are a permissible but discouraged ground for departure under the guidelines.united states gauvin,cir.a district court may depart based on a factor that is permissible but discouraged only if the factor is present to an exceptional degree or in some other way makes the case different from the ordinary case where the factor is present.id.quoting koon united states,d.
the family circumstance relied upon by the district court was the condition of mcclatchey son,who had been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,severe obsessive compulsive disorder paraphilia,not otherwise specified,a sexual disturbance disruptive behavior disorder mixed personality with antisocial and narcissistic and features and irritability.aplt.app.at.the district court found that the son condition created an exceptional situation because his severe psychological disabilities placed him in need of constant care and supervision.id.at.the court relied on letters from the son psychiatrist,who had been treating him since.according to the psychiatrist,mcclatchey presence in the home has been necessary in order to maintain his son outside of a residential hospital environment.aplee.at.in a january,letter to the district court,the psychiatrist stated 
the son requires ongoing management in order to preclude self destructive acting out behavior that could lead to serious consequences and ongoing management and structure provided by his father and mother in order to maintain his mental and behavioral stability.his father is needed for the stability of the household on an ongoing basis.
id.at.in a letter to the court dated february,he added 
one or the other parent has to be directly involved in transporting him to work,assuring that he takes care of his daily needs,assuring that he makes appointments it has been necessary for both parents to be involved as it is in fact necessary for one or the other parent to be helpful to monitor the son doctor and dentist appointments,job interviews,including getting his hair cut.mcclatchey works full time and is unable to monitor him on an ongoing basis and maintain her job.it has been necessary for both parents to be involved in order to trade off to assure that the son is maintained in the community.if the parents were not directly involved no doubt the son would risk becoming a burden on the state for support and monitoring a family team of both mother and father have been necessary in order to assure that the son ongoing care is maintained.neither parent in my opinion would be able to manage the son in the home environment alone.
the son need for management,structure,and support in his daily routine does not,however,justify a downward departure.the fact that a defendant cares for a family member with a mental or physical disability is not by itself sufficient to make the circumstances exceptional.our decision in united states archuleta,cir,is instructive.there,the defendant was the sole support of two children and his diabetic mother.id.at.in determining that the defendant was not among the rare cases warranting a downward departure for extraordinary family circumstances,id.at,we noted that the record failed to establish that other family members could not care for the defendant mother,or that home nursing or some other means of care was unavailable.id.at.we quoted with approval the following passage from united states brand,cir 
a sole,custodial parent is not a rarity in today society,and imprisoning such a parent will by definition separate the parent from the children.it is apparent that in many cases the other parent may be unable or unwilling to care for the children,and that the children will have to live with relatives,friends,or even in foster homes.
archuleta,at.
archuleta is consistent with the case law of other circuits,which have reversed departures absent evidence that the defendant was the only individual able to provide the assistance a family member needs.see,united states sweeting,cir defendant was single mother of five children,including a son with tourette syndrome departure reversed where there is nothing in the record suggesting that defendant and only defendant can provide the son with the care and attention he needs united states allen,cir defendant was primary caretaker of father with alzheimer and parkinson diseases in reversing departure,court noted that defendant is not the only family member available to care for her father united states rybicki,cir reversing departure where defendant was responsible for wife with mental health problems and young son with neurological problems who needed special supervision responsibility to family not present to exceptional degree united states brown,cir reversing departure because exceptional circumstances not present defendant was single mother of two young children with some undefined medical problems who would have to live with their.
the district court relied upon united states sclamo,cir,in which the first circuit upheld a departure where the defendant had developed a special and crucially important relationship with his girlfriend son,who had become psychologically impaired after abuse by his alcoholic biological father.id.at.the son psychologist had stated that the defendant was the
