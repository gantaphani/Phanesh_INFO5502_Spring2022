defendant albert begil begil appeals from an adverse judgment in a recovery action brought by the department of health services dhs seeking reimbursement for benefits provided to his mother,juanita begil juanita,while she was a resident at a skilled nursing facility.begil contends that the trial court erred in applying the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a rather than the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section finding that the statute of limitations began to run with dhs receipt of notice under probate code section awarding prejudgment interest to dhs failing to find that the action was barred by laches and refusing to reopen the proceedings to allow him to present evidence that dhs had actual knowledge that juanita did not have a surviving spouse.we find no error,and we affirm.

on december,diana bont√°,as then director of the dhs,filed a complaint against begil to enforce and collect money due on creditor claim.the complaint alleged that dhs was entitled to reimbursement from juanita estate for the portion of the health care services that were paid for by the state of california program,which is administered by the dhs.in his answer to the complaint,begil asserted the defenses of laches and the statute of limitations.
a bench trial was held on february,at which the parties stipulated that there were no disputed facts to resolve,and the matter involved only issues of law.the trial court issued a statement of decision holding that the defense of laches did not apply the matter was governed by a statute of limitations the statute of limitations had not run before the complaint was filed and dhs was entitled to prejudgment interest.
juanita had been a resident at a skilled nursing facility before her death.while she was there,her health care services were paid for,in part,by the state of california program,administered by dhs.juanita died on may.shortly after that,the nursing facility informed begil that had been notified of juanita death,and the payments from had been stopped.

matters presenting pure questions of law,not involving the resolution of disputed facts,are subject to de novo review.ghirardo antonioli cal th,d.
applicable statute of limitations 
begil contends that the trial court erred in applying the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section,subdivision a hereafter,section a instead of the statute of limitations under code of civil procedure section hereafter,section dhs action for reimbursement was based on welfare and institutions code section and california code of regulations,title,section neither the statute nor the regulation identifies the applicable statute of limitations.moreover,the parties have not cited,and our research has not revealed,any case law specifically on point.
when a specific limitations period applies,the more general period codified in code of civil procedure section is inapplicable.howard jarvis taxpayers city of los angeles th,d.begil argues that section is the more specific statute,and as such,should have been applied.
in collection bureau of san jose rumsey cal th,d,the court accepted,without discussion,that the statute of limitations under section applied in the action of a collection agency against the estate of the decedent for recovery of hospital and medical expenses of the decedent.the court further held that the statute of limitations similarly applied to the collection agency action against the surviving spouse.id.at,d.rumsey is distinguishable from the present case,however,in that the plaintiff in rumsey was an ordinary creditor under a contract with the deceased person,whereas in the present case,the reimbursement claim exists only by right of statute,and only against the deceased person estate.
the law revision commission comment to section states,section restates former section b without substantive change.this section applies a statute of limitations on all actions against a decedent on which the statute of limitations otherwise applicable has not run at the time of death.this limitations period applies regardless of whether the statute otherwise applicable would have expired before or after the period.italics added.we conclude that on its face,section applies to claims that could have been brought against the decedent had he or she lived.thus,section is inapplicable to the present action,brought on a statutory liability that arose only upon the decedent death and which could not have been brought against the decedent.see kizer hanna cal d,stating that the right to reimbursement under welf.inst.code,arises,if at all,at the time of the recipient death and is dependent on conditions existing at such time.
for purposes of section a,a liability created by statute is one in which no element of agreement enters.it is an obligation which the law creates in the absence of an agreement.citation.blue cross of northern california cory d.in other words,it is a liability that would not exist but for the statute.see travelers express,cory cir.
in kizer ortiz d.ortiz,the parties agreed that the statute of limitations under section a applied to the filing of a claim for reimbursement from a personal injury settlement because the liability was based on a statute.ortiz is not precisely on point,in that the right of reimbursement did not come from a deceased person,but from a personal injury settlement.nonetheless,in ortiz,as in the present case,the right of reimbursement arose under a statute.thus,we conclude that the trial court did not err in applying the statute of limitations under section a.
commencement of running of statute of limitations 
begil next contends that,even if the statute of limitations was properly applied,the action accrued on juanita death on may,and the action was not commenced within three years after that date.dhs argues,however,that the action did not accrue until notice of her death,on february,under probate code section.
probate code section provides where a deceased person has received or may have received health care under chapter commencing with section or chapter commencing with section of part of division of the welfare and institutions code,or was the surviving spouse of a person who received that health care,the estate attorney,or if there is no estate attorney,the beneficiary,the personal representative,or the person in possession of property of the decedent shall give the director of health services notice of the decedent death not later than days after the date of death.the notice shall include a copy of the decedent death certificate.the notice shall be given as provided in section,addressed to the director at the sacramento office of the director.
as a general rule,the statute of limitations begins to run upon a present right to sue.see,lubin lubin d.however,w hen the legislature mandates notice to an agency,the statute of limitations will not begin to run until notice is provided.ortiz,supra,d at.here,probate code section required notice to the dhs,and notice was not provided until december.we conclude that the trial court properly found that the action was timely.
begil argues,nonetheless,that the dhs at all relevant times had actual notice of juanita death and the fact that she had no surviving spouse.shortly after juanita death,the nursing facility informed begil that had been notified of juanita death,and the payments from had been stopped.moreover,dhs received juanita death certificate on december,the death certificate indicated she was a widow when she died.begil thus contends that the action was untimely under the discovery rule.we disagree.notice under probate code s
