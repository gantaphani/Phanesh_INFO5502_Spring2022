john super,a clinical psychologist,conducted an evaluation of doughty in january at the request of the office of disability determinations.super noted that,despite previous attempts at treatment,doughty was still suffering from alcohol dependence.doughty reported that he had been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol when he was eighteen years old.super observed that doughty was alert and did not exhibit any signs of depression.doughty did,however,report exhibiting situational bouts of anxiety,including palpitations,shakes,tremors,and concentrational deficits.doughty testified that his daily activities included vacuuming,sweeping,mopping,and doing dishes.he also reported shopping and cooking occasionally,and reading,watching television,and talking on a citizens band radio for recreation.super submitted a mental capacities evaluation form in which he noted that doughty had a poor to good ability to make occupational adjustments,a good ability to make performance adjustments,and a fair ability to make adjustments.

on these facts,the alj issued a decision on february,denying benefits.the alj found that doughty had a severe impairment or combination of impairments which precludes all work activity,namely alcoholism and anxiety resulting therefrom.the alj concluded that these impairments,while severe,did not meet or equal the criteria of any of the listed impairments found in the applicable regulations.because doughty was not presumptively disabled under this list,the alj next considered doughty subjective statements regarding his impairments and their impact on his ability to work.the alj found doughty claims that he was unable to work due to his anxiety not to be credible.
the alj concluded,however,that doughty had a significant nonexertional limitation consisting of his inability to concentrate while intoxicated.the alj found that this limitation interfered with doughty ability to work.the alj further determined that doughty could not perform his past relevant work and that he did not have the transferable skills to perform other work within his residual functional capacity.therefore,the alj concluded that doughty alcoholism was disabling and that there were no jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy that doughty could perform.nevertheless,the alj denied benefits to doughty because the medical evidence indicated that doughty would not be disabled if he stopped using alcohol,thus making doughty alcoholism a material contributing factor to his disability under to the caaa.
after the alj rendered his decision,doughty submitted additional medical records from manatee glens corporation alcohol and drug services for consideration by the appeals council.this new evidence covered doughty outpatient alcohol treatment from september,through september.the ac denied doughty request for review,stating that it had considered the new evidence.
