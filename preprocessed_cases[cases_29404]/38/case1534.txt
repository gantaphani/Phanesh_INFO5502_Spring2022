robert liesegang,roberto sotelo and paul fletcher collectively,the petitioners challenge the effective date that the secretary of veterans affairs assigned to a regulation,published at fed.reg.may,that creates a presumption of service connection benefits for vietnam veterans who developed diabetes.in challenging the rulemaking process that led to the final regulation and the final regulation itself,the petitioners contend that the department of veterans affairs the agency erroneously assigned a later effective date to the disputed regulation.because we hold that the agency misconstrued congress intent and that the effective date of the regulation is the date of publication in the federal register,we remand to the agency for further actions consistent with this opinion.
the crux of this challenge focuses on the effective date of the regulation the agency assigned to the regulation an effective date of july,while the petitioners assert that it should be april.by obtaining an earlier effective date,the petitioners hope to benefit from the liberalizing provisions of g that permit the agency to award benefits even before the claim was filed.however,section g limits such liberality by providing that benefits shall not be earlier than the effective date of the administrative issue.accordingly,a ruling on the effective date determines whether the petitioners and other veterans in their situation can receive additional months of benefits.
at bottom,the resolution of this dispute turns on the interpretation of,and the agency compliance with,the controlling statute.that statute is the agent orange act of,pub,stat.codified in part at the aoa.in relevant parts,the aoa establishes a procedure for the agency to identify diseases associated with exposure to agent orange during service,and empowers the secretary to promulgate regulations that would create presumptions of service connection for those identified diseases.a b and b lefevre sec y,dep t of veterans affairs,discussing history and framework of the statute.
as part of the procedural framework,the aoa instructs the secretary to take certain actions within a set timeframe.thus,n ot later than days after receiving a report from the national academy of science the nas regarding a certain disease,the secretary must determine whether a presumption of service connection is warranted for each disease covered by the report.c a.then,i f the secretary determines that such a presumption is warranted,the secretary,not later than days after making the determination,shall issue proposed regulations setting forth the secretary determination.id.subsequently,but n ot later than days after issuing the proposed regulations,the secretary must issue final regulations.id.c.such regulations shall be effective on the date of issuance.id.in part,the petitioners claim that the secretary failed to comply with those statutory requirements.
neither party disputes the relevant facts in this case.in,the secretary requested that the nas assess whether there was a connection between exposure to agent orange and the subsequent development of diabetes.on october,the nas issued its report,concluding that such connection appeared to exist.
upon issuance of that report,the agency initiated the process of promulgating the appropriate regulation as required by the aoa.on november,which was days instead of the statutory days after receiving the nas report,the secretary issued a press release announcing his decision to establish a presumption of service connection for diabetes under the aoa.on january,the agency published the proposed regulation.published days after the press release announcement,which was three days later than the statutory deadline,the proposed regulation established a presumption of service connection for diabetes and provided days for the public to submit comments.by the expiration of the deadline for public comment on march,the agency had received comments to the proposed rule.having reviewed those comments,the agency prepared a notice that addressed each of the comments and transmitted the notice to the office of management and budget omb on april.
after receiving clearance from the omb,the agency transmitted the final rule to the office of the federal register on may,and requested an emergency filing of the document for may.in that request,the agency admitted that the statutory deadline for publication of the final rule should have been april.the next day,on may,which was days after publication of the proposed regulation and thus days later than the statute permitted,the federal register published the final rule with an effective date of july.see fed.reg.may.
as part of the final rule,the agency rejected a comment that the regulation should be retroactive.specifically,the agency stated that t he effective date established by this rule is in accordance with c and et.
on june,the acting director of the agency compensation and pension service issued fast letter to the directors of all veterans administration regional offices regional offices.the fast letter notified the regional offices of the new regulation and provided instructions for implementing the new rule.as part of those instructions,the fast letter stated that t he effective date of this regulation is july,and on that date,you should begin processing all pending claims using that effective date.since the fast letter merely implements the final rule,its validity stands or falls with the underlying regulation.
after filing their claims under the regulation in august,the petitioners challenged the effective date contained in the final rule and the fast letter.the three petitioners are honorably discharged veterans who served in vietnam in the and currently suffer from diabetes.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.

the petitioners contend that the agency misconstrued the aoa and improperly assigned to the disputed rule an effective date of july.our review of the agency interpretation is governed by the standards established in chevron,natural resources defense council,d.in chevron,the court stated 
first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
id.at.footnotes omitted.under this framework,w hen reviewing an agency construction of a statute that it administers,this court first determines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.gallegos principi,quoting chevron,at.the parties concede that we need not look beyond congress express intent.
indeed,congress unambiguously addressed this issue in the aoa by decreeing that s uch regulations shall be effective on the date of issuance.c.the agency therefore has no choice but to give effect to congress clear intent.see chevron,at.in compliance with that command,the agency assigned the date of publication in the federal register as the effective date of a rule promulgated under section.see,diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents prostate cancer and acute and subacute peripheral neuropathy,fed.reg,pursuant to the provisions of c,this final rule is made effective on the date of publication in the federal register.disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents multiple myeloma and respiratory cancers,fed.reg,june,c,clearly and unambiguously requires that regulations promulgated under that section be effective on the date of issuance,the date the final rule is published in the federal register.the effective date for this rule conforms to that statutory mandate.
notwithstanding the provisions of c,the agency believed that the rule in this case should receive a later effective date in light of another statute.that other statute is section of the small business regulatory enforcement fairness act of,pub,tit.ii,stat.codified at,more popularly known as the congressional review act cra.enacted five years after the passage of the aoa in,the cra requires congressional review of agency regulations by directing agencies to submit the rule before it takes effect to the comptroller general and each house of congress.a.as part of the submission,the agency must provide a report containing a copy of the rule,a concise general statement of that rule including whether it is a major rule,and the proposed effective date of the rule.id.
under the cra,a regulation must pass an additional hurdle if it is a major rule.a major rule is a regulation that the omb determines to have an annual effect on the economy of million or more,cause a major increase in prices in the economy,or have significant adverse effects on,among other things,competition.id.unless congress objects,a major rule shall take effect on the latest of days from the date congress receives the report or the date on which the rule is published in the federal register,or the date the rule would have otherwise taken effect id.a.in enacting the cra,congress provided that t his chapter shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of law.id.a.
citing the cra,the agency argues that the rule effective date must be the later of days after congress receipt of the report or publication in the federal register.see id.a.to do otherwise,the agency contends,would create a conflict between the cra and the aoa.on the one hand,the cra requires at least a waiting period to give congress the opportunity to review the proposed rule.on the other hand,the aoa states that the rule is effective upon issuance,not days later.attempting to reconcile and comply with both statutes,the agency determined that the later statute changed the aoa effective date to the date upon which the rule take s effect under the cra.according to the agency,to adopt an earlier date than july,would contravene the provisions of the cra.
that reasoning is erroneous and we decline to adopt it.under the agency approach,the cra implicitly repeals part of the aoa when a major rule is involved by delaying the regulation effective date beyond the date provided by the aoa.but,as this court has previously recognized,r epeals by implication are not favored and can only be justified when the earlier and later statutes are irreconcilable.horner jeffrey,citing.valley auth.hill,d morton mancari,d lovshin dep t of the navy.w hen two statutes are capable of,it is the clear duty of the courts,absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary,to regard each as effective.horner,at quoting mancari,at.alteration in original.unlike the agency,we see no need to implicitly eviscerate a law enacted by congress.and,our independent review of the statute and its legislative history indicates that the agency saw a statutory conflict where none exists.in reading the statute,the agency was apparently misled by the assumption that the term take effect under the cra equates to the phrase effective date in the aoa,thereby overruling the aoa provision.
that assumption,however,has no support in the text of the cra or its legislative history.indeed,the statutory text provides that the regulation shall take effect it does not state,the effective date is.see a.also,the ordinary meaning of the term take effect contravenes the agency erroneous assumption.when the statute does not define a term,as it is the case here,the agency and the reviewing court must give the undefined term its ordinary meaning.ak steel united states,citing perrin united states,d a fundamental canon of statutory construction is that,unless otherwise defined,words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary,contemporary,common meaning.using black law dictionary to define statutory term see also humana,forsyth,d citing black law dictionary when interpreting a statutory term.the ordinary meaning of take effect is t o be in force go into operation.black law dictionary ed.as shown by the term denotation,the cra does not change the date on which the regulation becomes effective.it only affects the date when the rule becomes operative.in other words,the cra merely provides for a waiting period before the agency may enforce the major rule so that congress has the opportunity to review the regulation.
our review of the legislative history strengthens our reading of the plain meaning of the statute.as senate report explained,
section of this legislation codified as the cra establishes a congressional review mechanism for all major rules.this allows congress the opportunity to review every major rule before it takes effect and to disapprove any rule to which congress objects.congress may find a rule to be too burdensome,excessive,inappropriate or duplicative this makes congressional review of rules an important component of regulatory reform.congressional review gives the public the opportunity to call the attention of politically accountable,elected officials to concerns about proposed rules.if these concerns are sufficiently serious,congress can stop the rule before any damage is done.
at.see also,at using same language to explain the enactment of the statute.as further explained by another report,the cra will allow congress to examine agency rules before they are made effective and to determine whether to take legislative action disapproving rules that do not accurately reflect the intent of congress in enacting the underlying statutory scheme,at.to permit congress time to review the rule before it becomes operative,the statute establishes a day expanded to days in the final statute period after a major rule is published as final during which congress,by joint resolution,can disapprove the rule using an expedited procedure,at.there is no indication that congress intended to change,amend,or repeal the effective date provision of the aoa in enacting the cra.rather,the legislative history shows that the cra aimed to be a hold provision that stays the operative date of a rule while the legislature can review and,if necessary,disapprove a final regulation.consequently,the agency erroneous assumption regarding the meaning of take effect has no support either in the plain language of the statute or the legislative history.
hence,a correct construction of the cra fully dissipates the agency arguments that the cra and the effective date provisions of the aoa are irreconcilable
