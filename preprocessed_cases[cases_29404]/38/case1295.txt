background 
bond served in the united states marine corps from december to november.on october,he filed a claim for compensation for stress disorder ptsd.the department of veterans affairs va regional office ro granted bond claim on may,and assigned a disability rating of,effective october.
in february,bond submitted to the ro a document stating i respectfully request an increase in percentage rating for my service connected ptsd presently rated at service connected.joint appendix ja.he attached to this document a medical record signed by staff psychologist garner,which references a january,psychological examination and discusses the history of bond psychological condition.in a july,decision,the ro treated the february submission as a new claim for an increased ptsd disability rating.the ro denied bond request for an increased rating on grounds that he had not submitted medical evidence that his ptsd condition ha d worsened.
on july,bond submitted a statement to the ro requesting reconsideration of the july,rating decision,along with an additional psychological examination report.on july,the ro,again,continued the disability rating for ptsd,noting that the report attached to bond july,submission fail ed to show the veteran has symptoms and manifestations of ptsd.the ro,subsequently,construed bond july,request for reconsideration as a notice of disagreement nod with the ro july decision and issued a statement of the case in december.bond perfected his appeal to the board in february.
during the pendency of bond july nod,he filed an additional request for an increased ptsd rating.the ro denied this request in august,finding that and va hospitalization records bond submitted did not warrant a higher rating.on september,bond filed another request for an increased rating,alleging that his ptsd prevent ed him from performance of gainful employment.the ro denied this request in an october,decision.
following this denial,bond submitted a formal application for tdiu due to ptsd documentation associated with va examinations conducted between february,and march,and an affidavit regarding his work history.on december,the ro increased bond schedular ptsd disability rating to and awarded a tdiu rating,both effective july.bond filed a nod as to the effective dates for both disability awards on december.in january,the ro issued a statement of the case on the issue of bond entitlement to earlier effective dates,and bond perfected the matter for board review.
the board addressed both of bond appeals in a september,decision.first,the board considered bond argument that,because his february,submission was received prior to the expiration of the appeal period for the may rating decision,the effective date for his rating should be october,the date of his initial claim for ptsd specifically,bond argued that his february submission was actually new and material evidence relating to the earlier,may,rating decision and should have been assessed as such by the ro.the board rejected this argument,concluding that the ro properly characterized the february submission as a new claim for an increased ptsd rating.the board found that bond had allowed the may decision to become final by failing to file an appeal from that decision within one year and that the february submission did not extend the time for that appeal.
the board then turned to the february claim and the question of whether bond was entitled to an earlier effective date for the ptsd disability rating he received in connection with that claim,finding that he was.after examining the medical records submitted by bond both before and in connection with his february submission,the board determined that those medical records showed symptoms substantially predating january.based on this conclusion,the board noted that those records would be treated as an informal claim,normally allowing for an effective date of up to one year before february.richard bond,slip,citing based on the board earlier conclusions that the may rating decision had become final and that the february claim was an entirely new claim,however,it concluded that may,the day after the earlier,final,rating decision was the earliest effective date it could award.
consequently,the board granted an effective date of may,for bond disability rating based on the medical evidence that predated the veteran february written claim.id.at.the board denied bond remaining claims,finding that he was not entitled to an earlier effective date for tdiu and his symptoms did not warrant a disability rating higher than.
bond appealed to the veterans court,arguing that the board erred in finding that the may,decision awarding a rating for ptsd had become final and erroneously determined the date of his initial claim for tdiu.with respect to the finality issue,bond argued that,when assigning the effective date for his rating,the board failed to consider whether he had submitted new and material evidence prior to the expiration of the appeal period for the may,ro decision.according to bond,the may,decision could not have become final because the board never considered whether his february submission contained new and material evidence relating to his october claim.see muehl west,holding that,when the va fails to consider new and material evidence submitted within the appeal period pursuant to b,and that evidence establishes entitlement to the benefit sought,the underlying ro decision does not become final.
in a march,decision,the veterans court affirmed the board september decision as it applied to bond schedular rating,but vacated the board determination that bond was not entitled to an effective date earlier than july,for his tdiu rating.see bond nicholson,u.vet.claims lexis,decision.in doing so,the court rejected bond contention that the board failed to consider whether he submitted new and material evidence prior to the expiration of the appeal period of the may,ro decision,as required by b,at.specifically,the court held that,because the ro treated that submission as an increased rating claim,it did not fail to consider whether it constituted new and material evidence for purposes of b.id.with respect to the tdiu issue,the court held that the board clearly erred by failing to consider whether bond february submission which served as the basis for the board decision to assign an earlier effect date for bond disability rating also may have reasonably raised an informal claim for a rating of tdiu.the veterans court,thus,remanded the case with instructions to assign an effective date for bond ptsd after considering,among other things,his february increased rating claim,at.
on remand,the board found that bond february submission met the requirements for an informal claim for tdiu and assigned an effective date of february,for that claim.although bond argued for an earlier effective date,the board declined to assign one because,in its view,there was no communication from the veteran prior to february,which could be construed as an informal claim of entitlement to tdiu.richard bond,slip.
bond appealed this decision to the veterans court,arguing that his february submission constituted new and material evidence filed within the appeal period of the may ro decision and that he was,thus,entitled to an earlier effective date for his tdiu rating.see decision.vet.claims lexis,at.the court rejected this argument based on res judicata.specifically,the court held that its march decision expressly ruled on the issue of whether the february submission constituted new and material evidence submitted during the appeal period and concluded that it did not,at.consequently,the court affirmed the board assignment of february,as the effective date for bond tdiu rating.this appe
