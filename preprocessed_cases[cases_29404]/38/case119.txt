in late to early,the government at last filed against the remaining defendants,the hospitals,asserting claims under the fca and common law.upon motion by the government and cosens,the united states judicial panel on litigation assigned the cases to the district of connecticut for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings.
the hospitals moved to dismiss the government claims pursuant to.b,arguing that the government complaints i failed to plead fraud with particularity as required by.b,ii failed to state a claim,and iii were untimely.the district court dismissed the government and claims as,a ruling that the government has not appealed.

more than years after the date when facts material to the right of action are known or reasonably should have been known by the official of the united states charged with responsibility to act in the circumstances,but in no event more than years after the date on which the violation is committed,
whichever occurs last.
b.the earliest violations alleged in this case date from,and the government filed its in
