dho decision at.
the dho concluded that there had been medical improvement of veino impairment s since the comparison point decision,stating that 
a t the comparison point decision cpd claimant had severe anxiety such that he trembled constantly and had visible hand tremors.he was very tense,suspicious,and agitated.he was fully oriented.he could remember five digits forward and three in reverse.he was a loner but did have some friends who visited him.he rarely did any household chores.he drank eight cans of beer a day.currently,claimant reports the shakes and is agitated at night.he exhibits no symptoms or signs of anxiety on exam.there is no shaking or tremors.he is still fully oriented.he can remember six digits forward and four in reverse.he continues to be a loner and friends still visit him occasionally.he does most of the household chores.he drinks up to a twelve pack of beer a day.since the symptoms,signs and lab findings show a decrease in the medical severity of the impairment,it is concluded that the claimant impairment has improved since the cpd.
id.at.finding that a t the time of the comparison point decision cpd,veino impairment met listing,see pt,subpt.p,app,and that his impairment no longer meets that listing,the dho concluded that veino medical improvement is related to the ability to work.dho decision at.
the dho also found that veino alcohol and drug condition results in restrictions in concentration,persistence and pace,and that s ince these are work related activities,it is concluded that the claimant has a severe impairment.id.the dho concluded that 
the jobs veino could do are severely reduced by his drug and alcohol abuse.he is unable to attend and concentrate and complete a normal work day or workweek on a sustained basis.thus he would not be able to meet all the basic mental demands necessary to do even unskilled work.
claimant substance abuse is a contributing factor material to the determination of disability.in the absence of substance abuse,he would be capable of performing a wide variety of unskilled work at all exertional levels.
the claimant is found to be not disabled.
veino sought review of the dho decision accordingly,a hearing was held before an administrative law judge alj in december.veino,represented by counsel,testified and called his wife as a witness.the alj marked as exhibits various documents,including reports from an ssa consultative psychologist and two ssa nonexamining reviewers,and called a vocational expert to testify as to the existence of jobs in the regional and national economy that a person with veino characteristics could perform.the alj also stated,w e also have the records upon which the determination of disability was made at a prior time hearing transcript,december,tr,at,but the transcript does not indicate that those prior records were marked as exhibits.
following the hearing,veino submitted evidence from his physician,john frederick king.according to king,who had been veino treating psychiatrist since approximately november,veino suffered from post traumatic stress disorder,anxiety disorder,and repeated intrusive recollections of past traumatic experiences in addition,veino probably had a paranoid personality and experienced panic.in response to interrogatories,king opined,inter alia,that veino mental condition would interfere with his ability to carry on normal daily activities,his ability to interact appropriately with other individuals such as family members,friends,neighbors or to interact and cooperate with others such as supervisors at work,and members of the public,and his ability to concentrate or maintain a persistent pace in completing tasks either at work or in his personal life.answers to interrogatories.king concluded that veino mental disorders and their symptoms as described above exist independent of any use of alcohol or illegal drugs answer to interrogatory,and that if veino were to entirely stop using alcohol or illegal drugs,it was likely that his mental disorders would persist substantially as described above answer to interrogatory.
in a decision dated may,the alj determined that veino medical condition had so improved that he was no longer disabled alj decision.
medical improvement is defined as any decrease in the medical severity of the impairment which was present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision that the individual was disabled or continued to be disabled.the medical improvement must be related to an ability to work.
at the time of the comparison decision dated october,the claimant trembled and had migraines.he did not like being around people and had intense anger.he heard voices and was homicidal.he was oriented and his memory was intact.he was withdrawn,tense and suspicious.
alj decision at.the alj found,however,that those conditions had changed 
the evidence reveals that the claimant did not require treatment or medication for six years.during a consultative examination his attention and concentration were adequate.he did not demonstrate any unusual motor behavior and had no tremors or shaking.there were no symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder,no symptoms of apprehension or anxiety the medical evidence shows clear improvement in the claimant condition.in examinations conducted by king the claimant was focused on retaining his social security benefits.king described the claimant as stable on effexor and inderol.he is able to function on a daily basis.his condition clearly improved.
the alj discounted the other opinions proffered by king,noting that he had been veino treating physician only since november,that his opinions appeared to be based only on statements by veino rather than on any clinical evidence or any detailed longitudinal picture of veino mental condition id.at,and that king views were in conflict with those of the ssa consultative expert.the alj found that the statements of veino himself were not entirely credible because he was focused on the loss of his disability benefits.id.at.
the alj found that veino continue d to have some restrictions and he would be limited from working a jobs sic involving too much interpersonal contact with the general public,and supervisors.see also id.at veino would be limited to only minimal contact with the general public,and supervisors.the alj credited,however,the testimony of the vocational expert,who had assum ed veino specific work restrictions id.and had opined that veino could perform the job of surveillance systems monitor,of which there were in vermont and new hampshire,and nationally the job of companion,of which there were in vermont and new hampshire,and nationally and the job of night watchman,of which there were in vermont and new hampshire,and nationally.
the alj concluded that veino medical condition had improved and that veino could perform the above jobs,although her findings as to the date on which veino disability ceased seem inconsistent.the alj findings include the following 
the claimant ability to perform a full range of medium work is reduced by his inability to have more than limited interactions with the general public,and supervisors 
beginning november,the claimant had the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of medium work,which was reduced by his inability to have more than limited interactions with the general public,and supervisors 
for the period november,to may,the claimant abused alcohol and marijuana.while drinking he had decreased concentration,persistence and pace,which would have compromised any job base.therefore,alcohol was a factor material to disability.absent the alcohol and marijuana abuse his limitations would be consistent with those outlined above,as such the medical evidence establishes that the claimant would not be disabled if he stopped using alcohol and drugs.therefore in accordance with section of,enacted on march,the claimant was ineligible for disability benefits under title ii of the act.
beginning may,the claimant alcohol and drug addiction wa
