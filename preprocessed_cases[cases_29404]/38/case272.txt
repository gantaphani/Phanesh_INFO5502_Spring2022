lewis coal company,and its insurer,old republic insurance company,petition for review of the final decision and order of the benefits review board brb directing them to pay medical benefits to respondent hershel mccoy.mccoy is a former coal miner and employee of lewis coal adjudged to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis,a pulmonary condition commonly referred to as black lung disease.the brb directed that lewis coal reimburse mccoy for approximately in medical expenses that it concluded were related to his disability,based in large part on the presumption in this circuit that a miner applying for medical benefits may demonstrate his eligibility by showing that he has been adjudged to be disabled by pneumoconiosis.because we find the challenges to the legal and evidentiary underpinnings of the brb order to be meritless,the petition for review is denied.
the essential facts underlying mccoy medical benefits claim are as follows.mccoy ended his roughly career as a coal miner in,at the age of,due to chest problems he began experiencing in.before ending his employment with lewis coal,mccoy filed a disability claim with the social security administration ssa under part b of the antecedent to the black lung benefits act codified as amended at et the blba part b of the blba established a federally funded program administered by the ssa to provide monthly disability payments to miners who claimed to be totally disabled due to pneumoconiosis within the meaning of the blba on or before june.see usery turner elkhorn mining,d discussing statutory history and organization of blba.based on mccoy claim and supporting medical evidence,the ssa concluded mccoy was totally disabled and awarded disability payments under part 
in,congress amended part c of the blba,which established an disability program administered by the department of labor dol for all blba claims filed on or after july.id.as part of its amendments to part c,congress permitted miners with a part b disability determination to file claims for medical benefits only under part see doris coal director,office of workers comp.programs,cir.the dol designated lewis coal as the mine operator responsible for mccoy disability,and thus responsible for covering mccoy medical benefits payments.although lewis coal initially contested mccoy claim,it withdrew its challenge in and entered into a settlement agreement with mccoy.significantly,the agreement stated that lewis coal agrees to accept the initial determination that the claimant,herschel mccoy,meets the standards of total disability under the blba,and that it understood that the agreement may be the basis for the issuance of an award of medical benefits and order to pay medical benefits in this claim.
lewis coal paid mccoy medical bills pursuant to the agreement until,at which point lewis coal and its workers compensation insurer,old republic insurance collectively lewis coal,took the position that the bills reflected unnecessary treatment.specifically,lewis coal alleged that mccoy condition reflected n o cwp coal workers pneumoconiosis or very minimal disease,and that pneumoconiosis present at those levels rarely requires medical attention or interacts to exacerbate other health problems.mccoy filed a complaint with the dol regarding lewis coal denial of benefits,which the dol referred to an administrative law judge alj for a hearing.at the hearing,mccoy presented evidence that the medical treatments for which he sought compensation under part c were related to the disabling conditions on which his part b award was based.in response,lewis coal presented medical evidence from several sources suggesting that mccoy no longer suffered from a part b disability and that the pulmonary conditions for which he sought compensation were attributable to cigarette smoking rather than disabling pneumoconiosis.applying this court presumption in doris coal that most pulmonary disorders are going to be related or at least aggravated by the presence of pneumoconiosis,at,the alj concluded that lewis coal medical evidence did not provide a basis for denying mccoy continuing requests for medical benefits,and the brb affirmed the alj determination on that basis.lewis coal timely petitioned this court for review.
our review of the brb order is limited.we review the brb decision to assess whether substantial evidence supports the factual findings of the alj and whether the legal conclusions of the brb and alj are rational and consistent with applicable law.milburn colliery hicks,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.bill branch coal sparks,cir internal quotation marks omitted.as presented in its petition for review,lewis coal claims require once again that we assess whether the brb properly applied our precedent in doris coal to the facts at hand.gulf western indus.ling,cir.
through doris coal and its progeny,this court has clarified the process by which a miner whose lung disease has been adjudged to be totally disabling under part b may sustain a claim for medical benefits under part c.in order to demonstrate his eligibility,the miner must show that the mine operator was responsible for his pneumoconiosis and that the particular medical expenses for which he seeks reimbursement were necessary to treat his disabling condition.doris coal,at.an expense is deemed necessary to treat pneumoconiosis if the treatment relates to any pulmonary condition resulting from or substantially aggravated by the miner pneumoconiosis.id.at emphasis added.in establishing this regime,this court presumed that most pulmonary disorders are going to be related or at least aggravated by the presence of pneumoconiosis.id.as a result,when a miner receives treatment for a pulmonary disorder,a presumption arises that the disorder was caused or at least aggravated by the miner pneumoconiosis.id.at.
in practice,the doris coal presumption permits a miner to satisfy his initial burden of production regarding his eligibility for part c benefits by presenting his underlying part b award,which specifies the conditions and symptoms that were found to be disabling,and the expenses he claims are related to those conditions and symptoms.doris coal,at.the mine operator may then rebut the presumption of relatedness by showing that a particular expense is actually for a pulmonary disorder apart from those previously associated with the miner disability beyond that necessary to effectively treat a covered disorder or not for a pulmonary disorder at all.ling,at.throughout the process,however,the burden of persuasion as to relatedness remains with the miner.trucking salyers,cir.
as we have often stated,the doris coal presumption precludes a mine operator from attempting to rebut the presumption of relatedness by attacking the underlying part b award.permitting a mine operator to contest a part c claim by requiring the miner to prove his qualifying disability would place a significant burden on the black lung benefits system,increase litigation costs for all of the parties involved,and further delay important medical benefits that a miner suffering from pneumoconiosis needs.doris coal,at see also ling,at.consequently,mine operators can only use subsequent proceedings to challenge the necessity of certain medical charges for the treatment of a pneumoconiosis related disorder or challenge medical charges not related to pneumoconiosis they may not require the miner to prove again that he has pneumoconiosis each time he makes a claim for health benefits.doris coal,at.
in accordance with doris coal,mccoy presented evidence regarding his part b disability determination and the treatment for which he sought reimbursement under part although neither mccoy nor lewis coal introduced a copy of mccoy actual part b award from the ssa that discussed the conditions and symptoms the ssa found to be totally disabling,see ling,at noting that i n every such case,the specific symptoms associated with these disorders will be a matter of record,for it is these of breath,coughing,loss of stamina,render the miner disabled to begin with,the alj found that
