peggy dunahoo filed for social security disability benefits claiming she was unable to work due to carpal tunnel syndrome,rheumatoid arthritis,bronchial asthma,and depression.the administrative law judge alj denied her claim,and the appeals council considered additional evidence and then denied review of the alj decision.both sides moved for summary judgment in the district court and the motion of the social security commissioner was granted.dunahoo appeals,and we affirm.
dunahoo was born in and has a general educational development degree.she has past work experience as a mail clerk and a home health aide.she filed for benefits in march,alleging she was unable to work because of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and arthritis.the social security administration denied her application initially,and she requested an administrative hearing before an alj.at the administrative hearing,dunahoo described her normal day as getting up,eating cereal,reading,cleaning the house,making the bed and washing dishes with the help of her husband,and occasionally visiting with friends.she testified that she also worked as a cashier at a local store for a total of hours per week.she complained of pain and swelling in her hands and joints and that she often felt depressed.her husband vouched for her credibility.she also presented the opinions of doctors brown,stroope,abraham,and roberts.
mark brown,one of dunahoo treating physicians,diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome after she complained of pain in her left hand.lab tests showed a positive rheumatoid factor and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate,and brown referred her to henry stroope,an orthopedist.in june she underwent left carpal tunnel release surgery.stroppe noted that after surgery she was doing extremely well with pain and numbness in her left hand and had an active range of motion,but that she still complained of stiffness in the right hand and he diagnosed a mild carpal tunnel syndrome.in september dunahoo returned to brown with numerous complaints,including pain and swelling in her shoulders,elbows,back,and legs.a subsequent examination revealed no swollen or acutely hot joints,and she had full range of motion.brown diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis and prescribed relafen.at a follow up visit with stroppe,dunahoo continued her complaints of swelling and pain.stroope referred her to a rheumatologist,james abraham.
one month before her appointment with abraham,dunahoo visited a mental health facility for depression.she complained of poor appetite,sleep disturbance,and problems with memory and concentration.the intake summary indicated her depression was triggered by the denial of her application for food stamps and workers compensation.the summary also indicated that she had a supportive family,a sense of humor,and a positive outlook.she was scheduled for therapy,but no evidence was presented that she attended.dunahoo visited abraham in november.his examination revealed numerous tender points but no swelling and normal range of motion.he reviewed brown prior lab work and noted that the rheumatoid factor,erythrocyte,and the negative antinuclear antibody result were mildly elevated,with mild leukocytosis.his initial diagnosis was either fibromyalgia or arthritis,but he scheduled more tests.in december abraham diagnosed fibromyalgia,and he prescribed ultram and a low impact exercise program.he also noted that dunahoo was taking desyrel for depression.dunahoo returned to see brown in december and continued to complain about pain in her shoulders and fingers,but examination revealed no swelling.brown also diagnosed fibromyalgia.dunahoo indicated to him that she was going to seek benefits.
dunahoo filed for social security benefits,and stephen whaley was asked to complete a residual functional capacity assessment in january.he concluded that dunahoo could perform medium duty work.brown referred dunahoo to randy roberts for a consultive evaluation in april.robert examination revealed trigger points and tenderness,but indicated that dunahoo had full range of motion,normal hand strength,and no swelling.he diagnosed fibromyalgia and administered trigger point injections.three days after seeing roberts,dunahoo returned to see brown.dunahoo continued to complain about pain,and she requested a letter from brown stating that she was disabled.brown supposedly gave her a letter stating that she was unable to work at the time,but he refused to write a letter saying she was unable to work for at least one year.in may,dunahoo returned to see roberts.examination showed she still had trigger points,but full range of motion and no swelling.the dosage of her pain medication was increased,and she was told to increase her activity.in july dunahoo returned to brown claiming widespread pain,but the examination revealed full range of motion and no swelling.she was given injections of and and started oruvail and darvocet for pain and pamelor for depression.
based on this medical evidence and the testimony of dunahoo and her husband,the alj denied dunahoo application for benefits,finding that she was not disabled.the alj found that dunahoo had alleged arthritic pain,carpal tunnel syndrome,asthma,diabetes and depression,but had not established an impairment that satisfied one of the medical listings in the regulations.the alj evaluated dunahoo complaints of pain under polaski heckler,cir,and determined that she was not credible.the alj also concluded that she had the residual functional capacity for full range medium work and could return to her past relevant work.finally,the alj found that dunahoo depression was situational and that she failed to receive follow up treatment.
dunahoo asked the appeals council to review the alj decision,and she submitted the opinion of jacob aelion which had not been given to the alj.she had seen aelion three times,complaining of pain in her joints.based on her complaints of swelling and morning stiffness,and lab tests showing erythema,elevated sedimentation rate,and positive rheumatoid factor,aelion diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis.he stated that dunahoo could occasionally lift and carry less than ten pounds,could walk,stand,and sit less than one hour,could balance stoop or bend occasionally,was limited in reaching,feeling,and handling,and could not climb,kneel,or crouch.the appeals council received and considered this additional evidence but nevertheless denied her request for review.dunahoo then brought suit in federal court where both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the commissioner motion,and this appeal followed.
dunahoo argues on appeal that the alj decision is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.she asserts that the alj erred by not explaining why she did not meet the listing for rheumatoid arthritis,and that she did meet that listing.moreover,she contends that the alj improperly discredited her subjective complaints.she also argues that the alj erred by concluding that she has the residual functional capacity to perform medium work.finally,dunahoo argues that she established she has severe depression.the commissioner responds that dunahoo did not meet the listing for arthritis as shown by the conflicting opinions of five doctors,that her complaints were properly evaluated,that she can perform medium duty work,and she does not meet the listing for depression.
a federal court on review must determine whether the commissioner findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.see prosch apfel,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but is enough that a reasonable mind would find it adequate to support the commissioner conclusions.id.the court may not reverse merely because evidence would have supported a contrary outcome.see id.
dunahoo first argues that the commissioner determination that she does not meet the listing for rheumatoid arthritis is not supported by substantial evidence.dunahoo contends that the commissioner did not state why she did not meet the listing.the commissioner responds that failure to explain fully why she did not meet the listing is not error.in determining whether dunahoo has met
