in august,simpson applied for the survivor annuity that simpson had elected for her in.initial decision,slip op.at.opm denied her application,stating that the election of survivor benefits had automatically terminated upon the couple divorce,pursuant to j a and that simpson had neither reelected the survivor benefit within two years of the divorce nor provided for such a benefit in the couple divorce decree,as required to reinstate the benefits under h.id.at.
simpson requested reconsideration,and opm upheld its decision.id.simpson appealed to the board.id.
based on an affidavit from mary beth,the administrator of opm contract for printing and distribution of forms and notices,the board administrative judge aj found that opm had sent standard notices to all annuitants each year from to and in with information concerning the right of an annuitant to make survivor elections.id.at.according to the aj,affidavit satisfied opm burden of showing that simpson was notified of the need to make an election,and the burden then shifted to simpson to prove that simpson did not receive the required notices.id.
the aj credited and found persuasive affidavits from several of simpson friends and relatives,all of whom testified that simpson would have wanted to elect a survivor benefit for simpson,irrespective of the couple divorce.id.at.the aj also credited testimony of simpson and the simpsons son that simpson had been very careful concerning his financial records,keeping all bills,receipts,payments,and annuity checks for at least the seven years prior to his death,and yet that there was no evidence in his records of his having received a notice requiring reelection of benefits.id.at.nonetheless,the aj concluded that the petitioner had not met her burden,finding it equally possible that simpson provided for his former wife to the extent that he wanted to in the separation agreement and his last will and testament and that he had no intention of providing a survivor annuity,despite what he told his friends and family and also that it could be that simpson only kept all of the financial records on those matters upon which he acted,but that he did not keep documents on those matters wherein he took no action.id.at.

discussion 
simpson raises three principal arguments on appeal.first,she contends that the government failed to meet its burden of proving that it actually sent the required notice to simpson.second,she argues that the board erred in finding that the information allegedly provided to simpson gave adequate notice that he needed to take affirmative steps to provide her with a survivor annuity following their divorce,notwithstanding his previous election.finally,simpson asserts that simpson election to provide her with a survivor annuity prior to their divorce became irrevocably restated at the time of his death within the period for making an election.simpson cites brush office of personnel management,for the proposition that t he accident of death,before that statutory period for making an election expired,terminated his ability to yea or nay that election,and,thus,the election he had made,in writing at the time of his retirement,in fact became irrevocably restated at the time of his death,which was within the two year period.id.at.
the government responds to simpson first argument by arguing that,under this court decision in schoemakers office of personnel management,affidavit stating that annual notices were sent to all annuitants sufficed to meet the government burden of establishing that an annual notice was sent to simpson during the relevant period,and that the burden then shifted to the annuitant to come forward with evidence that the notice was not received.id.at.according to the government,the board therefore properly ruled that simpson was sent the required notices and that simpson failed to demonstrate that simpson had not received them.
in response to simpson second argument,the government,citing this court decisions in holder office of personnel management,wood office of personnel management,and hairston office of personnel management,argues that the language of the annual notices sent by opm has been held to be generally sufficient to provide sufficient notice to an annuitant in the absence of some other opm communication that might have confused the annuitant regarding his or her annuity election obligation following a divorce,even if the language is not a model of clarity.the government thus asserts that,b ecause simpson could not rebut the record evidence that simpson received opm notices,the mspb properly concluded that simpson was warned that he needed to take steps if he wanted to provide her a former spouse annuity.
finally,the government responds to simpson third argument that there is no precedent for holding that an annuitant who fails to make an election should be deemed to have done so if he or she dies prior to the expiration of the time period for making an election,and that,on the contrary,this court rejected similar arguments in belanger office of personnel management,and darsigny office of personnel management.the government further argues that brush can be distinguished on the ground that opm had conceded in that case that it had not sent any annual notices to the annuitant.
congress has expressly limited the scope of our review in an appeal from the board.specifically,we must affirm a decision of the board unless it was arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c.substantial evidence is defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.consol.edison nlrb.a review for substantial evidence involves examination of the record as a whole,weighing evidence that both justifies and detracts from an agency decision.in re gartside.the supreme court has explained that the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency findings from being supported by substantial evidence.consolo fed.comm n,d.
we agree with simpson that opm notice was legally deficient in that it failed to adequately inform simpson that,if he still intended that his former spouse receive an annuity,he must make a new election within two years of their divorce.public law,stat,as amended by reorganization plan of,stat.codified at note,states that t he director of the office of personal management shall,on an annual basis,inform each annuitant of such annuitant rights of election under sections j and k of title,united states code.in relevant part,j provides that 
an employee who has a former spouse may elect,under procedures prescribed by the office,to have the annuity computed under subsections a i,n,and q of this section
