the united states appeals the final judgment of the united states court of federal claims holding that the subsequent death of an otherwise eligible beneficiary before the government issues payment does not relieve the government of its obligation to pay benefits under the public safety officers benefits act psoba,et.we affirm.
background 
harold ray presley,a sheriff of lee county,mississippi,was fatally shot by a suspect during a police chase in july.at the time of his death,sheriff presley was survived by his three adult children and his mother,christine roberts roberts filed a claim for death benefits under psoba with the bureau of justice assistance bureau,but passed away a few months later in september.
in december,the psob office issued its initial determination denying death benefits to roberts estate upon the grounds that roberts had not successfully filed a claim before she died,and even if she had filed a claim,roberts death precluded payment of the benefit.this initial determination was affirmed by the bureau hearing officer on appeal.
in response to the estate subsequent request for review by the director of the bureau,the bureau issued its final decision in february denying the estate claim for a death benefit.the bureau determined that roberts had not filed a claim for benefits,construing a as precluding an estate of a beneficiary from executing a claim.it additionally observed that,even if roberts had properly filed a claim during her lifetime,benefits were not payable to her estate based on the unambiguous statutory language of.the bureau concluded that issuing death benefit payments to roberts estate would not further the purpose of the statute,which it argued is to provide a measure of economic security for beneficiaries.final agency decision,psob claim at,citing g.
roberts estate appealed to the court of federal claims.on motion for judgment on the administrative record,the trial court reversed the bureau final determination and awarded the statutory amount of under the psoba.the trial court first determined that roberts had met all the relevant requirements and filed a timely claim for benefits during her lifetime.the trial court next determined that when a beneficiary is otherwise eligible at the time of the public safety officer death,the beneficiary subsequent death does not terminate her eligibility for benefits.the trial court reasoned that the implementing regulations contained in do not terminate eligibility upon death and concluded that the only possible reading of surviving parent contained in is that the parent must survive the officer death,not some future time in the application process.in other words,eligibility is determined at the time of the public safety officer death,and not at some arbitrary time years later when the agency has reviewed the claim,determined eligibility,issued payment,and the beneficiary has actually received payment.

discussion 
the psoba provides for a payment of cash benefits to certain classes of survivors of public safety officers who die in the line of duty.in reviewing an administrative denial of a benefit under the psoba,the court is limited to deciding whether there has been substantial compliance with statutory requirements and provisions of implementing regulations whether there has been any arbitrary or capricious action by the government officials involved and whether substantial evidence supports the agency decision.chacon united states.on appeal,we review the judgment of the court de novo,applying the same deferential standards anew.greeley united states.
when the court is confronted with a challenge to an agency interpretation of a term of a statute it has been charged with administering,th e court engages in the familiar analytical process articulated in chevron.hawkins united states,quoting chevron,natural res.def.council,d.according to chevron 
when a court reviews an agency construction of the statute which it administers,it is confronted with two questions.first,always,is the question whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter for the court,as well as the agency,must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.if,however,the court determines congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,the court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute,as would be necessary in the absence of an administrative interpretation.rather,if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.
at.we are mindful that,in our role as a reviewing court,we must defer to an agency interpretation of a statute if the statute is ambiguous or contains a gap that congress has left for the agency to fill through regulation.see fed.express holowecki,d w hen an agency invokes its authority to issue regulations,which then interpret ambiguous statutory terms,the courts defer to its reasonable interpretations.however,if we determine that the statute is unambiguous on the precise question at issue,we do not defer to the agency interpretation,regardless of whether that interpretation is grounded in a reasonable policy choice.eurodif united states,citing cable telecomms.ass brand x internet,d.
as for regulatory interpretation,an agency interpretation of its own rule or regulation is entitled to controlling weight unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bowles seminole rock sand.if,however,an agency regulation is beyond the scope of ambiguity in the statute,it is not entitled to deference.gonzales oregon,d citing chevron,at.
we also acknowledge that this court has previously found that the bureau interpretations of the psoba have the force of law and are thus entitled to deference under the rubric of chevron.groff united states.
the psoba subsection at issue in this case,a,lists the order of precedence for issuing psoba death benefits and reads as follows 
a amount recipients 
in any case in which the bureau of justice assistance hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the bureau determines,under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter,that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty,the bureau shall pay a benefit of adjusted in accordance with subsection h of this section,as follows 
if there is no surviving child of such officer,to the surviving spouse of such officer 
if there is a surviving child or children and a surviving spouse,to the surviving child or children of such officer in equal shares and to the surviving spouse 
if there is no surviving spouse,to the child or children of such officer in equal shares or 
if none of the above,to the parent or parents of such officer in equal shares.
the issue that we must decide is whether the statutory language of the psoba allows the bureau to require a beneficiary to remain alive until payment is made in order to be eligible for benefits.section a uses the word surviving seven separate times when referencing the potentially eligible beneficiaries we note,however,that the portion of a which pertains to the parent or parents is not preceded by the word surviving.the pertinent agency regulation,which nearly parrots the statute,adds the word surviving before parent and parents 
a when the bureau had determined that a death benefit may be paid according to the provisions of this subpart,a benefit of,adjusted in accordance with b,shall be paid in the following order of precedence 
if there is no surviving child of such officer,to the surviving spouse of such officer 
if there are a surviving child or children and a surviving spouse,to the surviving child or children of such officer in equal shares,and to the surviving spouse 
if there is no surviving spouse,to the surviving child or children of such officer in equal shares or 
if none of the above in paragraphs a through of this section to the surviving parent,or to the surviving parents in equal shares.
b if no one qualifies as provided in paragraph a of this section,no benefit shall be paid.
emphasis added.to the extent that the absence of the word surviving in the statute creates any ambiguity or a gap with regard to whether the parent or parents must survive to be entitled to benefits pursuant to psoba,the agency decision to limit eligibility to surviving parents in the statute and regulation is a permissible construction.the statutory framework fully supports this construction with the officer death as the focal point for eligibility determinations.see a which uses surviving seven times when referencing beneficiaries see also defining a qualifying child beneficiary according to the child age and dependent status at the time of the public safety officer death i amount payable is to be determined as of the date of the death of such officer 
the trial court held that the modifier surviving means that the beneficiary must survive the officer death to be eligible for benefits.we agree.even the government admitted that the plain meaning of the word surviving in the context of this statute and regulation means living beyond the time of the public safety officer death.oral arg.tr.the term survival in terms of the statute and for purposes of the regulation,it used to determine,it keyed to the time of the officer death.there no question about that,the word surviving is keyed to the time of the officer death.a surviving beneficiary,as referred to in the text of the statute,is one who is still alive at the death of the public safety officer.in the absence of a differing statutory definition,we must attribute the ordinary meaning to the word surviving.see asgrow seed winterboer,d when terms used in a statute are undefined,we give them their ordinary meaning.common legal parlance supports such a definition.for example,black law dictionary defines surviving spouse as a spouse who outlives the other spouse.black law dictionary ed accord collegiate dictionary ed defining surviving as to remain alive after the death of.
nonetheless,on appeal,the government argues that both the statute and this regulation,ought to be interpreted as requiring all beneficiaries to survive not only the officer death,but also the processing,evaluation,and determination of the claim for benefits as well as the payment of the benefits.appellant br.the government admits that the ordinary meaning of surviving parent or surviving spouse or surviving child is a parent,spouse,or child who survives the death of the officer.the government argues,however,that the prefatory language of the statute that the bureau shall pay a benefit along with the subsection language to the parent or parents in a,means that benefits may be paid only to individual claimants who are still living by the time the bureau finishes processing and adjudicating a claim and actually issues payment.the government argues that the statute clearly and unambiguously supports its construction we do not agree.the words shall pay a benefit to a beneficiary say merely that the agency shall pay benefits to those who are eligible.those words do not imbue a temporal requirement the way that the word surviving inherently does.the bureau shall pay a benefit to a surviving spouse.this payment is to a spouse that survives the death of the officer,not a spouse who survives the completion of the administrative benefits process or the issuance of the check.moreover,this prefatory language does not manufacture an ambiguity in the statute where there is none.
the government frames the issue as the psoba does not expressly state whether a estate is an eligible beneficiary of a death benefit.appellant br.the government tries to manufacture an ambiguity in the statute by arguing that the statute does not explicitly state that payment can be made to an estate,rather than to a person.the statute need not include the words payable to an estate to clearly convey congress intent.as discussed above,the statute expressly indicates that the bureau shall pay a benefit to a surviving beneficiary.there is no question that roberts was a proper survived the death of her son.her rights vested at this time.the government theory is for a kind of temporary vesting one which can be defeated or lost if the beneficiary dies prior to the agency processing and payment of the benefit to which she is entitled.who knows how long it may take for an agency to process roberts application,resolve any disputes,and issue payment the agency interpretation of the statute would mean that eligibility of a beneficiary could end up varying based on unforeseen agency delays or other extenuating circumstances,as in this instance where the processing of roberts claim has taken up to four years.such arbitrary factors for the eligibility for benefits would place a burden on recipients that congress surely could not have intended.moreover,the agency interpretation would result in the agency itself not knowing who the eligible beneficiary was until the end of its own administrative process.
while this is certainly a close case,we conclude that congress spoke to the precise issue in this time frame for which eligibility for psoba death benefits is determined is based upon the time of the public safety officer death and not on some subsequent time.the statute dictates how long a beneficiary must live to be entitled to arises if the beneficiary survives the officer death.since congress spoke to the precise issue,the agency statutory interpretation is not entitled to deference.see global crossing,metrophones,d under chevron,an agency is due no deference until the court analyzes the statute and determines that congress did not speak directly to the issue under consideration.credit union admin.first bank trust,d concluding that the agency interpretation of the statute at issue was contrary to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress and therefore impermissible under the first step of chevron estate of cowart nicklos drilling,d of course,a reviewing court should not defer to an agency position which is contrary to an intent of congress expressed in unambiguous terms.adams fruit barrett,d rejecting agency interpretation of statute at issue as contrary to the plain meaning of the statute language united states.pac.it is elementary that,where no ambiguity exists,there is no room for construction.
the government also urges us to construe a contrary to its plain language on the ground that its interpretation of the statute is supported by the legislative history of the psoba and serves to further the psoba statutory purpose of providing an economic benefit to the survivors of a public safety officer.this argument lacks merit.first and foremost,it is a bedrock canon of statutory construction that our judicial inquiry ends where statutory language is plain and unambiguous.see.bank germain,d we have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there.bedroc,llc united states,d explaining that there is no occasion to resort to legislative history where the statutory text is clear.second,while providing economic support is undoubtedly one purpose of psoba,there is no requirement of economic need or dependency in the statute itself.in fact,congress amended the psoba in to strike the word dependent from a provision that originally provided benefits to the dependent parent or parents of such officer.white ex rel.roberts united states,citing,tit.vi,subtit.c,pt.as the trial court correctly observed,the legislative history also supports a second purpose for psoba to recognize and show gratitude for the sacrifices made by the families of public safety officers.id.this purpose would be subverted were benefits to be denied in this case.finally,psoba explicitly defines a qualifying child beneficiary according to the child age and dependent status at the time of the public safety officer death.clearly congress did not intend for the processing,administering,or payment of benefits to deprive a child who was eligible at the time of the public
