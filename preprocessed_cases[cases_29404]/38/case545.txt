roger holman petitions for review of the united states railroad retirement board computation of his railroad retirement widower annuity benefits.the board concluded that holman did not qualify for additional payments in his widower annuity because he was not receiving at least percent of his support from his wife in the year before her death.on this petition for review,holman argues that the board use of a dependency requirement violates his constitutional right to equal protection under the law because only men are required to demonstrate dependency to qualify for additional benefits.he also contends that the board did not follow its own regulations when it disregarded household services rendered by his wife in determining that he was not dependent on her for support.the first of these two issues occupies most of the space devoted to this opinion.
holman and his wife mary ann were lifelong employees of the burlington northern railroad.holman began working as a railroad clerk at burlington northern in october at the age of.holman began working at the same railroad as a switchman at the age of.both were employed at burlington northern for their entire working lives.
in june holman was diagnosed with cancer.she retired in may and holman retired a month later.holman passed away on october.eleven days later holman applied for widower annuity benefits based upon his deceased wife earnings under the railroad retirement act of,et.under d i,a widower of a qualified deceased railroad employee is entitled to annuity benefits if he is at least years old and has not remarried.see crown united states retirement,cir.
widower annuity amounts under consist of two tiers.the first tier is the amount of insurance benefits to which the widower would have been entitled under the social security act if the deceased employee service as an employee after december,had been included in the term of employment as defined in that act.see f.in other words,this first tier is the amount of the widower benefits payable under the social security act based upon the same earnings period.see crown,at.the social security act has its own entitlement section,which entitles holman to an annuity equal to the primary insurance amount of his deceased wife.id.this amount,however,must be reduced by the amount of retirement benefits the widower is receiving.see i.here,holman tier one retirement benefits exceeded his widower benefits,and so his tier one benefit total was a net zero.
the second tier provides for certain increases in the annuity amount derived from the tier one calculation.see g.this second tier is an amount computed solely on the basis of the deceased employee individual railroad employment.under this computation a widower is entitled to an additional annuity amount that is percent of the deceased worker tier two amount.crown,at.
the railroad retirement act also provides for a restored amount to be added to the tier two component of the annuity of a widower who would have qualified for an annuity under the railroad retirement act of as administered on december.g.section g governs the payment of a restored amount 
if a widower of a deceased employee is entitled to an annuity under section a of this title and if either such widower or such deceased employee will have completed years of service prior to january,the amount of the annuity of such widower shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount,if any,by which a the widower insurance annuity to which such widower would have been entitled,upon attaining age,under section a of the railroad retirement act of as in effect on december,exceeds b the total of the annuity amounts to which such widower was entitled 
g.this restored amount is the difference between what the widower would have received under the railroad retirement act of where there would have been no reduction for entitlement to a second annuity and what the widower did receive under the act after the tier one calculation is reduced due to the widower receipt of a railroad retirement employee annuity.crown,at.section l i of the act,however,conditions eligibility for a restored amount upon the widower but not a widow receipt of at least of his support from his wife.id.at.
here,holman submitted an application for widower annuity.male applicants must submit a statement regarding contributions and support demonstrating dependence on their deceased spouse.holman stated on his application that he was dependent on his wife for percent of his necessary living expenses.the award that holman ultimately received,however,did not contain a restored amount,and after his motion for reconsideration was denied,he appealed to the board bureau of hearings,arguing that the tier two portion of his annuity should be increased because he was dependent upon his wife for of his support at the time of her death.the hearings officer denied his appeal.holman then appealed to a panel of the board,which remanded the case to the hearings officer to make further findings based on additional evidence newly submitted.the hearings officer evaluated the additional evidence and again denied holman claim for a restored amount.
on appeal for the second time,holman submitted additional information regarding his ordinary and necessary living expenses.once again,the board remanded the case,concluding that the hearings officer erred by using a pooled income theory,which examines the relative incomes of the parties.the board instructed the hearings officer to determine whether holman received regular contributions from his wife that were at least of his ordinary and necessary living expenses.under,that determination requires an evaluation of the reasonableness of holman claimed expenses.on remand the second time,the hearings officer again ruled that holman did not demonstrate a sufficient level of dependency for the year before his wife death.
on appeal for the third time,holman argued that it is unconstitutional to require a widower,but not a widow,to establish dependency.the board summarily rejected that argument,stating only that its application of section g to widowers was upheld in crown railroad retirement,cir.next,holman argued that the hearings officer incorrectly interpreted the board regulations by discounting the value of household services performed by holman.holman had claimed that his wife contributed nearly in household services through laundry,cooking,and cleaning,but the board,citing social security ruling,concluded that such personal services are not the type of services that should be considered in making a support determination.consequently,the board affirmed the hearings officer decision that holman was not entitled to the restored amount.he now petitions for review of that decision pursuant to,which gives us jurisdiction to entertain his plea.
our review is limited to determining whether the board decision is supported by substantial evidence and has a reasonable basis in law.wassenberg united states retirement,cir.the board interpretation of the act and its own regulations,if reasonable,are entitled to deference.id.
holman first argues that the board application of g violates equal protection because it requires widowed spouses of retired female employees,but not widowed spouses of retired male employees,to prove actual dependency in order to qualify for a restored amount in the annuity calculation.in support of his position holman cites two cases that struck down similar dependency requirements on equal protection grounds califano goldfarb,d,and a case from the sixth circuit,kalina railroad retirement board,cir,aff,d.in goldfarb,the supreme court held that a provision in the social security act requiring husbands,but not wives,to prove dependency on their insured spouse in order to receive spousal social security benefits violated the fifth amendment.at.the court concluded that the provision gender classification rested upon old notions and archaic and overbroad generalizations that offend the prohibitions against denial of equal protection of the law.id.at.
