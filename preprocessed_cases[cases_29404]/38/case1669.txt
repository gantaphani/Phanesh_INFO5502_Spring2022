governing principles 
was created to obtain funding available to the states under the provisions of the federal social security act creating the medicaid program et.california medical brian d.see brown stewart d.under these provisions,states participating in the medicaid program are obliged to seek reimbursement from third parties legally liable for the medical expenses of individuals who receive benefits implicating medicaid funds.id.at.a.california enacted the program in compliance with this mandate.brown stewart,supra,d at.
in kizer ortiz d,the court described the pertinent provisions of the program,as effective during the underlying proceedings under the program,the state makes payments to health care providers who render medical care and treatment to beneficiaries.et when health care services are provided because of an injury for which another person or entity is civilly liable,respondent has the right to recover from such person or entity the reasonable value of the services provided.when an action is brought by the beneficiary alone,respondent is allowed a first lien,of not more than,on the proceeds,after payment of reasonable litigation expenses and attorney fees.if the beneficiary brings an action against the third person believed to be civilly liable for the injuries,he or she must give notice to respondent within days of filing the action.the law specifically describes how to give the required notice.notice is again required if a settlement or judgment is received no judgment,award,or settlement in any action or claim by a beneficiary to recover damages for injuries,where respondent has an interest,shall be satisfied without first giving respondent notice and a reasonable opportunity to perfect and satisfy his lien.again,the law provides how notice is to be given.
under the program,the benefits to a beneficiary are neither gifts nor gratuities hanif housing authority d,fn,and respondent right to reimbursement as is independent of the beneficiary rights against the third party tortfeasor.as the court explained in wright department of benefit payments d.respondent right is akin to that of the beneficiary creditor to recover payment for a debt the beneficiary incurred when,having received injuries for which the tortfeasor might be liable,he accepted treatment for which paid.citation.although respondent actual recovery of payment for the debt is conditioned on the existence of a fund created from a judgment or settlement,respondent right to recover is independent of the beneficiary derivative therefrom.
in ahlborn,the united states supreme court held that federal law imposes an additional limit on a state recovery from a judgment or settlement.there,an arkansas college student was injured in a car accident,and received in benefits from arkansas medicaid plan.ahlborn,supra,at.under arkansas law,the state agency administering the plan was authorized to assert a lien for the full amount of the benefits against any judgment or settlement the student might obtain in an action against the parties responsible for her injuries.id.at.after the student initiated an action,the state agency intervened and requested notice of hearings in the case.id.at.no hearings occurred instead,the parties entered into a settlement agreement that awarded the student,without allocating the funds to categories of damages.ibid.the agency did not participate or ask to participate in the settlement discussions,and did not seek to reopen the judgment after the case was dismissed,but asserted a lien for.ibid.
when the student sought declaratory relief regarding the lien in federal district court,the parties stipulated that the students entire claim was reasonably valued at,that the settlement was of this amount,and that only of the settlement funds constituted reimbursement for past medical payments.ahlborn,supra,at.following an examination of the federal medicaid law,the united states supreme court determined that a state recovery for benefits may not exceed the portion of a settlement that represents payments for medical care.id.at.relying on the stipulated facts before it,the court held that the arkansas state agency could not assert a lien exceeding.id.at.
although the court recognized that its interpretation of federal law created a potential for settlement manipulation,in view of the stipulations in the record,it declined to address this issue.ahlborn,supra,at.it nonetheless observed even in the absence of such a agreement,the risk that parties to a tort suit will allocate away the state interest can be avoided either by obtaining the state advance agreement or,if necessary,by submitting the matter to a court for decision.ibid.
the key question before us is whether ahlborn precluded the trial court from ordering christopher mcmillian to satisfy the full amount of the lien asserted against the settlement.generally,reimbursement of payments in third party suits or claims permit no judicial discretion.the only discretion to waive all or part of the lien rests with respondent director.brown stewart,supra,d at.see kizer ortiz,supra,d at.because reimbursement is mandatory upon a proper showing of facts see kizer hirata th,d,we review the trial court resolution of questions of law de novo see home depot,contractors state license bd.th,d,and otherwise examine the record for substantial evidence to support its factual determinations see nordquist broadcasting th,d.
parties showings and ruling 
in seeking to reduce the amount of the lien,appellant contended that ahlborn established a formula for determining the portion of a settlement that represents medical care payments when,as here,the settlement agreement is silent on this matter.applying the formula that they purported to discern in ahlborn,they argued that respondent lien could not exceed in addition,they submitted declarations from attorneys john girardi and delores yarnall,who stated that the january petition for approval of the proposed settlement,which denied the existence of a lien,was submitted in good faith and on the best information then available to appellants counsel.according to girardi and yarnall,prior to the settlement,marguerite mcmillian believed that her private insurance had paid christopher medical expenses,and girardi and yarnall first received notice of payments from respondent after the settlement was approved on january.
in opposition to appellant motion to reduce the lien,respondent submitted evidence that the amount due under the lien was,and requested an order directing payment of this sum.according to declarations of terry mack,a collection specialist with the department,respondent first learned about appellants action for damages in january,when the los angeles county children medical services unit forwarded a request for billing information from a photocopying firm that had provided services to christopher mcmillian.respondent sent a notice of lien to girardi keese in february,and later phoned girardi keese to prompt a response,but none was received.on january,respondent again sent a letter to girardi keese,which answered in april 
following a hearing,the probate court denied the motion,stating this case is distinguishable from ahlborn unlike ahlborn,in which the parties stipulated that of the settlement amount was attributable to medical expenses,no such stipulation exists in this case.indeed,counsel for appellants did not notify respondent as required of the pending settlement so that respondent could have established the percentage of the settlement attributable to medical expenses before the settlement was approved.as a result,this court is put in the position,more than two years after the date of the settlement,to try to make a determination of how much of the million dollar settlement was attributable to medical expenses.appellants have not established how much of the settlement constitutes reimbursement for medical expenses.appellants have presented no contemporaneous evidence of discussions at the time of settlement on the subject.appellants have also failed to provide respondent with the name of christopher mcmillian purported medical carrier which would have allowed respondent to attempt to determine the true value of medical expenses in this case.given this record,the court is satisfied that constitutes a fair determination of the amount of reimbursable medical expenses due to respondent.the c ourt has no discretion to disallow this lien,and therefore orders christopher mcmillian to satisfy the lien in the amount of.
we see no error in these determinations.in view of appellants failure to give advance notice of the settlement to respondent,as required by statute,the probate court properly concluded that it was authorized to determine the amount of the lien.ahlborn,supra,at.moreover,as explained below,the probate court correctly placed the burden of proof on appellants to show that the portion of the settlement representing medical payments was less than,and found they had failed to carry this burden.
regarding the burden of proof,we have noted that respondent status as is akin to that of a creditor.wright department of benefit payments,supra,d at.in seeking to reduce the amount of the lien,appellants motion did not dispute that respondent had provided christopher mcmillian with in benefits instead,they contended that ahlborn mandated a further reduction in the amount of the lien.generally,i n the absence of evidence justifying an alteration in the normal allocation of the burden of proof,the rule in california is that a party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.citations.productions,nbc studios,th,d.thus,when,as here,a debtor asserts that the amount the creditor demands in repayment of a loan exceeds that permitted by law,the assertion is ordinarily regarded as an affirmative defense for which the debtor bears the burden of proof.see ghirardo antonioli cal th,d,usury,subd.b liquidated damages provisions.
moreover,the allocation of the burden of proof to appellants is proper under the circumstances of this case in view of their exclusive access to evidence regarding the settlement discussions.as the court explained in wolf superior court th,d,the burden of proof is properly imposed on a party that has sole or primary control over dispositive evidence.there,the author of a novel entered into agreements with an entertainment corporation to share the profits from a movie and related merchandise based on the novel.id.at,d.after the author initiated an action against the corporation for breach of contract,the appellate court concluded that the burden of proof regarding the claim for breach of contract was to be carried by the corporation due to its exclusive control of the essential financial records.id.at,d.here,there is substantial evidence to support the probate court finding that appellants denied respondent an opportunity to participate in the settlement.in view of this determination,the probate court properly imposed the burden upon them to show that the portion of the settlement representing medical payments was less than.
the probate court also correctly determined that appellants failed to carry their burden.the record contains evidence that the portion of the settlement reflecting medical payments is sufficient to pay the lien the petition seeking approval of the settlement stated that past medical expenses had exceeded,and the lien represents approximately of this amount,and less than four percent of the total settlement.however,john girardi and delores yarnall declarations supporting appellants motion are silent about the portion of the settlement reflecting medical payments the declarations address whether they acted in good faith in failing to give respondent notice of the pending settlement,and other unrelated issues.appellants motion argued only that the probate court was obliged to determine the portion of the settlement reflecting medical payments by reference to a formula they discerned in the factual stipulations in ahlborn.because ahlborn neither considers nor mandates the use of any such formula,the probate court properly rejected their contention.santa clara county local transportation authority guardino cal th,d,a n opinion is not authority for an issue not considered therein see espericueta shewry th,d espericueta rejecting contention that ahlborn imposes formula for determining portion of settlement reflecting medical payments.
on appeal,appellants suggest that statements by attorney john girardi constitute evidence on the portion of the settlement reflecting medical payments.they point to a letter from girardi to dated december,which girardi keese submitted to the probate court in june,in response to an order directing girardi keese to provide an accounting
