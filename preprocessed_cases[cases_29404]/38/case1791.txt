ii.statute and ordinance authorizing medical payments 
preliminarily,we review the statute and ordinance under which the city of chicago paid scott medical expenses.
in,the illinois legislature adopted an act authorizing cities and villages to provide for the payment of allowances of money to the families or dependents of policemen and firemen killed or fatally injured while in the performance of their duties,ch,par.et.in,the statute was amended to authorize cities and villages to provide medical care and hospital treatment in case of an accident to a policeman or fireman,ch,par.this provision,which was incorporated into the illinois municipal code of,ch,par,later became section of the pension code,ch,par.since its incorporation into the pension code in,the relevant language of section has remained the same.it reads 
the corporate authorities of any city or the village may provide by ordinance that in case of an accident resulting in an injury to or death of a policeman or fireman in the employ of such city or village while in the performance of his duties,the officer at the head of the department or such other officer as may be designated may secure and provide proper medical care and hospital treatment for any such policeman or fireman.the city or village may incur the expense aforesaid and appropriate and pay for the same.

with this background,we turn to the parties arguments.
