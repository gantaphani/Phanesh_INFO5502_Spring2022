in these consolidated appeals,the veterans claim that their current disabilities are connected to injuries sustained during their military service.in both cases,the veterans medical records contained at least one physician report opining that the claimed disabilities were and at least one ambiguous or inconclusive report declining to confirm such a nexus.the department of veterans affairs va relied upon these latter medical opinions in denying the veterans entitlement to disability benefits,and the board of veterans appeals board affirmed.finding that the medical examination did not comply with the board instructions and that the board failed to explain its reasons and bases for denying service connection,the court of appeals for veterans claims remanded.deloach shinseki.vet.claims lexis,at.april,greene shinseki.vet.claims lexis,at.april.specifically,the court of appeals for veterans claims held that remand,rather than reversal,was the appropriate remedy where the board decision lacks an adequate statement for its bases,or where the evidence of the record is inadequate.
for the reasons outlined below,we agree the remand was appropriate and affirm.
background 
ronald deloach 
ronald deloach served as a neuropsychiatric specialist in the army from to.he was tasked with restraining,treating,and counseling fellow soldiers returning from the combat zone.in,deloach was hospitalized and diagnosed with catatonic schizophrenia.in connection with several additional hospitalizations between and,he was diagnosed with schizophrenic reaction of chronic,paranoid type as well as anxiety and depression.
deloach filed a disability claim for service connection with respect to schizophrenia,depression,and ptsd in december.in june,the veterans affairs regional office varo found nothing linking a mental condition to military service and,therefore,denied deloach entitlement to service connection.
in november,deloach timely filed a notice of disagreement with the varo denial and requested that the va review his claim.the va issued a statement of the case in december,which reaffirmed the denial.deloach appealed to the board.
in its review,the board considered medical records from deloach private treating physician,linda jenness mcclellan.in a january letter,jenness mcclellan concluded that deloach had significant depression and symptoms characteristic of ptsd and that deloach presentation and report strongly indicates that his initial schizophrenic break resulted from stress encountered as a psychiatric technician caring for maimed psychiatric veteran returnees from vietnam.deloach joint app x at.
in september,the board remanded the case to the varo with instructions that deloach undergo further psychiatric evaluation by a va physician for a diagnosis of all his psychiatric disabilities.additionally,the board requested that the examination report include an opinion on the etiology of each disability diagnosis.
in april,the va again issued a statement of the case denying deloach entitlement to service connection.the va considered new evidence provided by the va examiner lanette atkins.the va noted atkins diagnosis of chronic schizophrenia and that her findings of evidence of psychosis as early as were consistent with jenness mcclellan opinion.finding that evidence demonstrated development of a mental disorder more than one year after deloach discharge from active duty in,atkins could not confirm a service connection without speculating.
deloach again appealed the va decision to the board.in april,the board declined to make a service connection decision based on the evidence of record and remanded to the varo for further development.the board explained that the va examiner failed to comply with remand instructions to provide an opinion on the etiology of deloach disability diagnosis.furthermore,the board found no discussion in the examiner report as to whether deloach satisfied the criteria for a ptsd diagnosis.
in may,in accordance with the board remand instructions,the va provided another evaluation of deloach mental condition.another va examiner,monica wright,offered a primary diagnosis of psychosis,but found that deloach did not meet the criteria for symptoms of ptsd.in september,the va issued a deferred rating decision notifying wright that her examination failed to discuss the etiology of deloach diagnosis and did not comply with the board instructions.wright submitted a report addressing the question of etiology in november.her report indicated that the history of deloach illness during his military service is unclear due to a scarcity of available service medical records.wright concluded that 
there is not presently a way to address the etiology of deloach disorder.according to the sixth edition of kaplan and sadock synopsis of psychiatry post,there is a direct quote that says,the cause or etiology of schizophrenia is not known.therefore,i can not address it,and to do so would result in mere speculation on my part.
deloach joint app x at.as a result,the va issued a statement of the case in december which denied entitlement to service connection.the va pointed to wright opinion that etiology was indeterminable at the time of her examination and concluded that the evidence of record does not provide sufficient connection between deloach schizophrenia and his military service.deloach appealed the va decision to the board for a third time.
in may,the board affirmed the va decision,which deloach then appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims.deloach argued that the board erred in denying his claim of entitlement to service connection for his mental disability and urged the court to reverse the board decision under the clearly erroneous standard.specifically,deloach asserted that reversal is appropriate because the board decision is clearly erroneous in light of the uncontroverted evidence in his favor.
the court of appeals for veterans claims held that reversal was not appropriate under the clearly erroneous standard because such a reversal would require the court to analyze the opinions of jenness mcclellan and atkins in the first instance.instead,the court ruled that a remand was required because it was unclear whether the board adequately considered all evidence in its evaluation,including the records of jenness mcclellan,and provided a sufficient reason for denial of service connection.the court of appeals for veterans claims stated that the lack of an adequate statement of reasons or bases frustrates judicial review,and the failure to provide an adequate medical examination involves factual development.deloach.vet.claims lexis,at.the court observed that the board did not comply with its remand instructions to ensure that the medical examination met instructions outlined by the board specifically,acquiring an opinion on the etiology of deloach mental condition.the court of appeals for veterans claims concluded that remand was required to provide an adequate medical examination.
william greene 
greene served on active duty from february,to february.during his station at fort hood in,greene injured his left foot while playing football.that year,a physician treated him for a foot injury and diagnosed his injury as a sprain.greene reported ongoing pain,swollen or painful joints,and foot trouble in his separation medical examination.
in december,edward carrillo,a private physician had opined that greene foot injuries were connected to military service.similarly,in december,richard dibacco,another private physician,rendered an opinion that greene foot disability was a causal result of the original injury at fort hood.
greene filed a claim for service connection with respect to a bilateral foot condition in january.the varo denied greene claim for service connection,stating that evidence shows the condition existed prior to service.next,greene submitted a statement in support of claim requesting that his claim for serviceconnected compensation be reopened based on the medical nexus provided by carrillo.in the pertinent part,carrillo report stated that 
after reviewing his military records it was noted that greene was seen on base for left foot pain in october of military service duties included activities such as marching,hiking,and other duties that involve the feet it is of my opinion that greene left foot problem is military service related since the problem began while in the military and in the performance of the usual military service activities.
greene joint app x at.
in august,the varo again denied greene claim for service connection on the grounds that recent evidence submitted,including carrillo medical report,was not new material.greene filed another statement in support of claim in november,requesting review and reconsideration of carrillo opinion,and adding a claim for a secondary knee injury resulting from the foot injury.
in april,the varo denied service connection.greene appealed to board on may.the board remanded to the varo twice on august and november with instructions to provide greene an examination and opinion addressing the nature and etiology of his foot disability.
in december,a va compensation pension examination c p exam diagnosed residuals of a left ankle sprain with pain and limited motion and reported that the onset of the injury was november at fort hood.yet the c p exam concluded that the injury was at least as likely as not less than the cause of current symptomatology of left foot and ankle pain.greene joint app x at.based on evidence from the c p exam,the varo continued its denial of greene claim because his left ankle sprain is less likely than not the cause of his current left foot problems.greene joint app x at.
greene appealed to the board which,in june,considered his claim for the third time.the board found that the private physicians opinions from carrillo and dibacco in favor of service connection less probative than the c p examiner opinion,which,according to the board interpretation,did not support service connection.the board discredited the private physicians opinions because they allegedly did not review the entire claim file,did not address a symptomatology gap,and did not discuss relevant facts in the case.in contrast,the board found the c p examiner opinion probative because it reviewed all the evidence and offered a thorough rationale for its opinion that was supported by the record.the board found that the preponderance of the evidence was against awarding service connection and,therefore,denied greene claim.
greene appealed to the court of appeals for veterans claims,which issued an opinion in april vacating the board denial and remanding the case for additional development.it determined that the board decision to attribute less weight to the private physicians opinions and more probative value to the c p exam was based on findings that were inadequate and either erroneous or unclear.in addition,the court noted that the board ignored internal inconsistencies in the c p examiner report and failed to provide an adequate statement of reasons and bases for why it found that report more probative.in light of the incomplete record resulting from the board inadequate findings,the court of appeals for veterans claims held that reversal was not appropriate.instead,it remanded the matter to the board.
these appeals of the remand orders followed.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a,c.
ii.analysis 
jurisdiction 
the secretary argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the decisions remanding deloach and greene cases to the board.generally,we decline to review remand orders of the court of appeals for veterans claims because they are viewed as decisions.see ebel shinseki,joyce nicholson,williams principi.but see byron shinseki,stevens principi,adams principi.unlike statutes governing cases appealed from other tribunals,the jurisdictional statute implicated by these appeals does not explicitly premise appellate review on the finality of the decision.compare a conferring jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision of a district court,with a after a decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims is entered in a case,any party to the case may obtain a review of the decision.thus,we have recognized a narrow exception and depart from the strict finality rule only when three conditions,termed the williams conditions,are met 
t here must have been a clear and final decision of a legal issue that a is separate from the remand proceedings,b will directly govern the remand proceedings or,c if reversed by this court,would render the remand proceedings unnecessary the resolution of the legal issues must adversely affect the party seeking review and,there must be a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand,that the remand proceeding may moot the issue.
williams,at footnotes omitted.
while apparently conceding that the appeals of deloach and greene require resolution of issues that adversely affect the appellants the second williams condition,the secretary contends that neither appeal presents a final decision on a legal issue or a substantial risk that the decision would not survive a remand.those contentions,however,reflect a misunderstanding of the legal issue appellants have pressed on their appeals.appellants do not assert that the court of appeals for veterans claims misinterpreted its standard of review when it determined that initial fact finding by the board was required or that the board failed to properly explain why it rejected certain evidence and favored other evidence.rather,the appellants maintain that they are legally entitled to a reversal on the record,and should not be required to undergo a remand.
this case involves the same legal issue presented in three cases where we had jurisdiction,adams stevens and byron whether the court of appeals for veterans claims has authority to reverse the board instead of remanding the case.as in bryon where the court of appeals for veterans claims explicitly analyzed its statutory authority and held that it did not have the authority to reverse and must remand,the court in the instant appeals held that reversal would be impermissible or not appropriate notwithstanding appellants contentions that the record required reversal rather than remand.compare byron shinseki.vet.claims lexis,at,the court will not address whether direct service connection and an earlier effective date are warranted because that would require it to make factual determinations in the first instance based on the evidence the board failed to consider,which it may not do.therefore,reversal is precluded as a remedy,and remand is appropriate.citations omitted,with deloach.vet.claims lexis,at to reverse the board decision as the appellant requests would require the court to analyze the opinions of jennessmcclellan and atkins in the first instance and to weigh those opinions against the other evidence of record.because the court is generally prohibited from finding facts in the first instance,this would be impermissible.citations omitted,and greene.vet.claims lexis,at although,the appellant asks this court to reverse the board erroneous findings and order the award of service connection,such a request is not appropriate in this case.the court,therefore,will remand this matter to the board.citations omitted.similarly,stevens involved a situation where the court of appeals for veterans claims ordered remand for an alleged prohibited purpose to allow the government to make up a shortfall in its evidence to rebut a presumptive entitlement to compensation.at.likewise,a clear and final decision on a legal issue existed in adams when the appellant argued that the court of appeals for veterans claims should have ruled,without a remand,that the government offered insufficient evidence to rebut the presumption of sound condition.at.all of these cases,like the ones pressed by appellants,implicate a legal right not to be subjected to a remand,which if reversed by this court,would render the remand proceedings unnecessary.
these cases are readily distinguished from ebel where the court of appeals for veterans claims remanded when it found the examiner report insufficient to establish direct service connection.see at.the court in the instant appeals,as in byron explicitly held that it did not have author
