national organization of veterans advocates,nova,disabled american veterans dav,and paralyzed veterans of america pva collectively,petitioners,challenge the validity of a regulation promulgated by the department of veterans affairs,that regulation,as revised in january,restricts the award of dependency and indemnity compensation dic benefits to survivors of deceased veterans to cases where the veteran during his or her lifetime had established a right to receive total disability compensation for the period of time required by the governing statute,or would have established such right but for clear and unmistakable error by the department of veterans affairs in adjudicating the veteran claim.we conclude that the revised regulation is inconsistent with another regulation,that interprets a virtually identical veterans benefits statute,a.we further conclude that the agency has failed to explain its rationale for interpreting these virtually identical statutes in conflicting ways.we therefore remand this case to the department of veterans affairs for further consideration.
background 
initially it is useful to briefly review the statutory scheme governing the award of dic benefits to survivors of deceased veterans.
under chapter of title,united states code,the department of veterans affairs is authorized to pay dic benefits to survivors of a deceased veteran whose death is due to a disability incurred during the veteran military service disability section a,enacted in,provides in pertinent part that w hen any veteran dies after december,from a or compensable disability,the department of veterans affairs shall pay dic benefits to such veteran surviving spouse,children,and parents.a see also a.where the veteran death is,survivors may also be entitled to increased dic benefits,if certain requirements are met.section provides in pertinent part that survivors may receive increased benefits 
i n the case of the death of a veteran who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive compensation for a disability that was rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death.
a emphasis added.in other words,section entitles survivors of a veteran who dies from a total disability to receive dic benefits even if the veteran did not receive compensation for that disability during his or her lifetime.
a different statute is involved here.section of title governs the award of dic benefits when the veteran death is not.this statutory prescription is comparatively recent.before,payment of dic benefits was limited by section a to survivors of service members who died on active duty or veterans who died as a result of disabilities.
in,however,congress,by enacting section,provided for the payment of dic benefits to the survivors of a veteran whose death was not caused by a disability,but who,at the time of death,was in receipt of or but for the receipt of retired or retirement pay was entitled to receive compensation for a disability that was rated percent disabling for years immediately preceding death,or for five years continuously from the date of the veteran discharge.veterans disability compensation and survivors benefits act of,stat.that provision was codified in b supp.ii,a predecessor statute to.in,the department of veterans affairs issued to implement section b.subsection a of that regulation provided,in pertinent part,that 
benefits shall be paid to a deceased veteran surviving spouse or children in the same manner as if the veteran death is when the following conditions are met 
the veteran death was not caused by his or her own willful misconduct and 
the veteran was in receipt of or but for the receipt of military retired pay was entitled to receive compensation at time of death for disability that either 
i was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of or more years immediately preceding death or 
ii was continuously rated totally disabling from the date of the veteran discharge or release from active duty for a period of not less than years immediately preceding death.
in the general counsel of the department of veterans affairs issued an opinion that concluded,in pertinent part,that b does not provide a basis for finding entitlement to survivors benefits where a veteran,at death,had been in receipt of compensation for total disability but not for the requisite duration solely because of department of veterans affairs error in the rating assigned.prec,at may.in other words,that opinion barred survivors from receiving dic benefits in cases where the agency error deprived a totally disabled veteran from receiving his or her statutorily prescribed benefits for the requisite five or period.
in response to that general counsel opinion,congress in amended b.that amended statute as currently codified at states in pertinent part that dic benefits would be awarded to survivors of a deceased veteran whose death was not where that veteran died 
n ot as the result of the veteran own willful misconduct,and who was in receipt of or entitled to receive compensation at the time of death for a disability rated totally disabling if 
the disability was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of or more years immediately preceding death or 
the disability was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of not less than five years from the date of such veteran discharge or other release from active duty.
b supp.v emphasis added.the legislative history accompanying section made clear that the purpose of the amendment was to provide that the requirement that the veteran have been in receipt of compensation for a disability rated as total for years prior to death or for years continuously from the date of discharge is met if the veteran would have been in receipt of such compensation for such period but for a clear and unmistakable error regarding the award of a rating.explanatory statement of compromise agreement,cong.rec,reprinted in,emphasis added.
in sum,sections and both prescribe circumstances under which survivors of deceased veterans may receive dic benefits.and both statutes provide that survivors may obtain benefits or increased benefits in cases where the deceased veteran was entitled to receive compensation for a totally disabling injury preceding death.yet the department of veterans affairs has promulgated implementing regulations for those statutes that interpret the virtually identical language of the statutes in conflicting ways.it is to those implementing regulations that we now turn.
the language and judicial interpretations of 
as noted above,addresses the dic benefits payable to survivors of a veteran whose death is due to a disability.subsection a of states,in pertinent part,that the dic benefits may be increased 
i n the case of the death of a veteran who at the time of death was in receipt of or was entitled to receive compensation for a disability that was rated totally disabling for a continuous period of at least eight years immediately preceding death.
a emphasis added.the statute implementing regulation,provides in pertinent part that e xcept with respect to benefits under the provisions of,issues involved in a survivor claim for dic benefits will be decided without regard to any prior disposition of those issues during the veteran lifetime.
in hix gober,the court of appeals for veterans claims had concluded that where the veteran had not applied for compensation for a disability during his lifetime,the entitled to receive provision of the statute nonetheless required the department of veterans affairs to retroactively determine whether the deceased veteran hypothetically would have been entitled to receive compensation for a totally disabling injury.hix,at.
we affirmed,noting that the requirements of were dispositive of the interpretation of,hix,at.we accordingly held that section required de novo determination of the veteran disability,upon the entirety of the record including any new evidence presented by the surviving spouse.id.at.an opposite result is reached by the regulations under section.
the language and judicial interpretations of 
in,the department of veterans affairs revised in light of the amendment to section.the revised regulation stated,in pertinent part,that survivors would receive dic benefits when the veteran was in receipt of or for any reason including correction of a rating after the veteran death based on clear and unmistakable error was not in receipt of but would have been entitled to receive compensation at the time of death for a totally disabling disability.a emphasis added.
following these revisions,the court of appeals for veterans claims in several cases involving the eligibility of survivors for dic benefits,broadly interpreted the entitled to receive language of section b and the corresponding language of a.before the court of appeals for veterans claims,the department of veterans affairs urged that the statute and regulation limited the award of dic benefits to cases where the veteran failure to receive compensation for a total disability was solely attributable to clear and unmistakable error by the department of veterans affairs in the adjudication of an application for benefits filed by the veteran during his or her lifetime.in other words,the department of veterans affairs argued that survivors could not obtain dic benefits under section unless the deceased veteran had,during his lifetime,filed an application for compensation for a total disability.
the court of appeals for veterans claims disagreed,concluding that section and permitted the award of dic benefits to survivors in cases where the deceased veteran had never applied for compensation for a total disability that could have resulted in entitlement to such compensation.as that court explained in green brown.
a s we interpret the applicable law and regulation in section b and a,a claim of clear and unmistakable error by the department of veterans affairs is not the sole way for a survivor to show the veteran entitlement as of the time of the veteran death.rather,the survivor is given the right to attempt to demonstrate that the veteran hypothetically would have been entitled to receive a different decision on a issue based on evidence in the veteran claims file or department of veterans affairs custody prior to the veteran death and the law then or subsequently made retroactively applicable.
id.at see also,wingo west,s ection and its implementing regulation in a allow the survivor to obtain a determination of whether the veteran hypothetically would have been entitled to receive an award of service connection.quoting green.at carpenter west,reaffirming green.it is these decisions of the court of appeals for veterans claims that led the agency to revise the regulation at issue here.
the revisions to 
on january,the department of veterans affairs promulgated a final rule in the federal register that became effective that same day captioned dic benefits for survivors of certain veterans rated totally disabled at time of death.see,final rule.this final rule is challenged here.
the final rule revised in two pertinent respects.first,it struck from subsection a of the regulation the language that authorized survivors to receive dic benefits if the deceased veteran was for any reason entitled to receive at the time of his or her death compensation for a totally disabling disability.in other words,the final rule revised subsection a to provide in pertinent part that the department of veterans affairs would pay dic benefits to survivors in the same manner as if the veteran death was only if t he veteran death was not the result of his or her own willful misconduct,and a t the time of death,the veteran was receiving,or was entitled to receive,compensation for a totally disabling disability a emphasis added.
second,it revised subsection b to expressly define entitled to receive as effectively limited to a situation where the veteran failure to receive benefits is due solely to clear and unmistakable error by the agency.the revised subsection provides,in pertinent part,that 
a t the time of death,the veteran had disability rated totally disabling by va but was not receiving compensation because the veteran had applied for compensation but had not received total disability compensation due solely to clear and unmistakable error in a va decision concerning the issue of service connection,disability evaluation,or effective date 
b in short,the final rule reflected the department of veterans affairs conclusion that the phrase entitled to receive compensation is most reasonably interpreted as referring to cases where the veteran had established a legal right to receive compensation for the required period,but was not actually receiving the compensation.final rule.at.
the department of veterans affairs made clear in the explanatory text accompanying the final rule that it had revised to respond to the court of appeals for veterans claims decisions in green and its progeny.pointing to the court of appeals for veterans claims decision in wingo.at,for example,the department of veterans affairs stated that,as interpreted by the court of appeals for veterans claims,does not accurately reflect the requirements of the statute and the department of veterans affairs intention in issuing that regulation.final rule.at.finally,the department of veterans affairs characterized this final rule as solely an interpretive rule,a rule that merely clarifies or explains existing statutes or regulations.id.the department of veterans affairs accordingly did not publish the proposed final rule for by interested parties.
as noted above,this final rule became effective on january.nova filed a timely petition for review with this court on march,challenging the validity of,as revised.dav and pva filed similar timely petitions for review on march,and march,respectively.we sua sponte consolidated these three petitions on march.
discussion 
we have jurisdiction to directly review the validity of both the rulemaking process and the regulation challenged here pursuant to.u nder,we may review the department of veterans affairs procedural and substantive rules,any amendments to those rules,and the process in which those rules are made or amended.disabled am.veterans gober,cert.denied,d.
we conduct this review,as stated above,in accordance with the standards set forth in the administrative procedure act apa.this review is highly deferential to the actions of the agency.disabled am.veterans,at.
before considering the merits of the statutory construction reflected in the revised regulation,we must address two preliminary issues.first,at least some of the petitioners assert that the department of veterans affairs must abide by the earlier decisions of the court of appeals for veterans claims in green,carpenter,and wingo.they urge that the agency had the right to appeal those decisions to this court if they thought they were erroneous,and,having failed to do so,the agency is bound by the holdings of those cases.they rely on our recent decision in bankers trust new york united states,where we held that this court is bound by its own earlier decisions directly construing a statutory provision,and in that respect followed decisions of the supreme court in maislin industries,primary steel,d,and its progeny applying that same principle to the supreme court itself.see,neal united states,d lechmere,d.
the petitioners seriously misunderstand the decision in bankers trust and,more importantly,the nature of the judicial function.a final decision of an article iii court binds the parties to that particular controversy as a matter of res judicata.section of the restatement second of judgments,for example,makes clear that a party to an action is bound by and entitled to the benefits of the rules of res judicata with respect to determinations made while he was a party,subject to certain exceptions not applicable here.restatement second of judgments.
but that final judicial decision is not binding on parties in a future case,except in those circumstances where the earlier case would be entitled to collateral estoppel effect.the petitioners here do not assert that the agency in this case is collaterally estopped from the issue of statutory construction.nor could they colorably assert such a claim.section of the restatement second of judgments makes clear,for example,that a lthough an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,and the determination is essential to the judgment,that issue may be when it is one of law and the two actions involve claims that are substantially unrelated.id.at.an accompanying comment emphasizes that this rule applies with particular force when the issue to be involves,as here,the formulation or scope of a statute or applicable legal rule 
i f the issue is one of the formulation or scope of the applicable legal rule,and if the claims in the two actions are substantially unrelated,the more flexible principle of stare decisis is sufficient to protect the parties and the court from unnecessary burdens.a rule of law declared in an action between two parties should not be binding on them for all time,especially as to claims arising after the first proceeding has been concluded,when other litigants are free to urge that the rule should be rejected.
id.at,cmt.b,at.thus the only effect of the court of appeals for veterans claims decisions in green and the subsequent cases is as a matter of stare decisis.
but stare decisis is a doctrine that binds courts to follow their own earlier decisions or the decisions of a superior tribunal.as we have previously noted,stare decisis in essence makes each judgment a statement of the law,or precedent,binding in future cases before the same court or another court owing obedience to its decision.mendenhall cedarapids,cert.denied,d.it does not bind parties not to challenge those decisions,at least where the issue remains unresolved at the highest level.see cooper aaron,d holding that litigants are bound by previous decisions of the supreme court.thus,under bankers trust we are bound to follow earlier decisions of this court that directly construe a statute but that does not mean that the parties are bound to do so,at least if they plan to seek review of that issue to the supreme court,which is not bound by our earlier decision the same rule applies in cases before the court of appeals for veterans claims.moreover,it is even appropriate for a party to seek to an issue of statutory interpretation in the same court that rendered its earlier decision,at least if the original decision was based on deference to the agency interpretation of the statute under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,and the agency has changed its interpretation.see bankers trust,at noting that in such a situation,we might well consider the agency change of heart as a significant factor 
thus,it was perfectly appropriate for the department of veterans affairs to attempt to the court of appeals for veterans claims construction of in this court.it could do so either by raising the issue in a new case at the board of veterans appeals or by proceeding through rulemaking.here it chose the latter course.neither we nor the department of veterans affairs is bound by the earlier court of appeals for veterans claims decisions cited by petitioners.
the petitioners also claim that we should invalidate the regulation because it is a substantive rule otherwise known as a legislative rule that was not promulgated in accordance with the notice and comment rulemaking procedures of the administrative procedure act.in contrast,the department of veterans affairs stated in the explanatory text accompanying that final rule that it had dispensed with those statutory requirements because it considered the rule to be interpretive rather than substantive.final rule.at.
a determination of whether the final rule is substantive or interpretive is significant.the apa provides in pertinent part that when an agency proposes to promulgate a substantive rule,it must give notice to interested parties and allow them an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule 
b general notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the federal register,unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law 
c after notice required by this section,the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments.
b c.failure to allow notice and comment,where required,is grounds for invalidating the rule.see,auer robbins,d a court may certainly be asked by parties to disregard an agency regulation that appears on the public record to have been issued in violation of procedural prerequisites,such as the notice and comment requirements of the apa,chrysler brown,d certainly regulations subject to the apa can not be afforded the force and effect of law if not promulgated pursuant to the statutory procedural minimum found in that act.internal quotations omitted.interpretive rules,in contrast,are exempt from these notice and comment requirements.b a see also splane west.
we have previously explained the distinction between substantive and interpretive rules as follows 
s ubstantive rules are those that effect a change in existing law or policy or which affect individual rights and obligations.interpretative rules,on the other hand,clarify or explain existing law or regulation and are exempt from notice and comment under section b a a n interpretative statement simply indicates an agency reading of a statute or a rule.it does not intend to create new rights or duties,but only reminds affected parties of existing duties.
paralyzed veterans of am.west,quoting orengo caraballo reich,internal citations omitted.an interpretive rule,in other words,merely represents the agency reading of statutes and rules rather than an attempt to make new law or modify existing law.splane,at see also shalala guernsey mem l,d noting that an interpretive rule may be issued by an agency to advise the public of the agency construction of the statutes and rules which it administers.
petitioners argue that the january revisions are substantive because they modify existing law,namely,the decisions of the court of appeals for veterans claims in green,carpenter,and wingo.we do not agree.those decisions rested in large part on the court of appeals for veterans claims interpretation of the earlier version of the agency,in turn,promulgated the revisions to to make clear that those judicial decisions did not accurately reflect the requirements of the statute and the department of veterans affairs intention in issuing that regulation.final rule.at.in short,the january,revisions merely clarified the department of veterans affairs interpretation in of.and a rule that does no more than clarify the interpretation of a statute is necessarily interpretive in character,even if that interpretation has consequences for the rights of the parties.
this conclusion finds support in decisions of at least four of our sister courts of appeals,namely,the second,seventh and ninth circuits and the district of columbia circuit.
the second,seventh and ninth circuits have concluded that an interpretive rule may change or clarify an agency interpretation of its governing statute.in white shalala,cir,for example,the second circuit held that i f the rule is an interpretation of a statute rather than an imposition of rights,duties or obligations,it remains interpretive even if the rule embodies the secretary changed interpretation of the statute.id.at.similarly,in chief probation officers of california shalala,cir,justice white,sitting by designation,concluded that the rule at issue that terminated federal matching funds for state juvenile justice programs was interpretive not substantive,and rejected the blanket proposition that that any change in policy constitutes a substantive rule.id.at.finally,in metropolitan school district of wayne township davila,cir,cert.denied,d,the seventh circuit noted in pertinent part that an agency change in its reading of the statute does not necessarily make the rule announcing the change substantive.id.at.
to be sure,if the earlier interpretation is contained in a substantive rule,a change may also have to be made in the same manner.in orengo caraballo reich,for example,the district of columbia circuit emphasized that a rule that changes or clarifies an agency interpretation of its governing statute is not necessarily a substantive rule.the court made clear that o nly where a second rule repudiates or is irreconcilable with a prior substantive rule must the second rule be an amendment of the first,and therefore itself be a substantive rule.id.at internal quotations and brackets omitted.the revisions here neither repudiate nor are irreconcilable with the agency earlier version of,and accordingly are not substantive rules 
in light of the decisions of our sister courts of appeals on this point,we conclude that the challenged rule,which does no more than interpret the requirements of section,and clarifies the agency earlier interpretation of that statute,is an interpretive rule not subject to the notice and comment requirements of the apa.
turning then to the merits,each side claims that is clear each side claims that it can only be interpreted in accordance with its position.we disagree with both sides.in our view the statute is ambiguous.
as noted above,the statute provides,in pertinent part,that dic benefits will be awarded to survivors of a deceased veteran where that veteran died 
n ot as the result of the veteran own willful misconduct,and who was in receipt of or entitled to receive compensation at the time of death for a disability rated totally disabling if 
the disability was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of or more years immediately preceding death or 
the disability was continuously rated totally disabling for a period of not less than five years from the date of such veteran discharge or other release from active duty.
b supp.v emphasis added.
the phrase entitled to receive compensation,standing alone,provides no guidance as to whether the statute allows a hypothetical claim of total disability in other words,the statute is ambiguous.and the usual tools for resolution of that ambiguity push in opposite ways.
on the one hand,the legislative history of section appears to favor resolution of the ambiguity for the government.thus the senate report that accompanied the legislation stated in pertinent part that the legislation would clarify congressional intent that the existence of clear and unmistakable va administrative error would be a basis for entitlement to dic benefits when such administrative error is the only bar to entitlement otherwise,at,reprinted in,emphasis added.the explanatory statement of the compromise agreement for the legislation similarly states that the purpose of the insertion of the phrase entitled to receive compensation in the statute was 
t o provide that the requirement that the veteran have been in receipt of compensation for a disability is met if the veteran would have been in receipt of such compensation for such period but for a clear and unmistakable error regarding the award of a rating.
explanatory statement of compromise agreement,cong.rec,reprinted in,emphasis added.given the difficulties of adjudicating initial or reopened claims many years after the relevant events,it may be unlikely that congress intended to adopt the hypothetical claim approach adopted by the court of appeals for veterans claims in green,wingo,and carpenter.
on the other hand,it is a rule of statutory construction that when a statute is ambiguous,interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran favor.brown gardner,d see also,king vincent,d referring to the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the armed services are to be construed in the beneficiaries favor mcknight gober,certainly,if there is ambiguity in the statute,interpretive doubt is to be resolved in the veteran favor.internal quotations omitted.
ordinarily at this juncture in the analysis where application of the usual canons of statutory construction push in opposite directions we would resort to the chevron principle,which mandates that we defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute.chevron,at.while the parties do not argue the point,the supreme court has held that chevron deference does not normally apply to informal rulemakings.in christensen harris county,d,for example,the supreme court noted that agency interpretations of statutes that lack the force of law,that are not the product of formal adjudication or rulemaking do not warrant deference.id.at.this standard was recently clarified in united states mead,d,where the supreme court stated 
an administrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for chevron deference when it appears that congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law,and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of ways,as by an agency power to engage in adjudication or rulemaking,or by some other indication of a comparable congressional intent.
id.at see also martin occupational safety health review comm n,d noting that interpretative rules are not entitled to the same deference as norms that derive from the exercise of the agency delegated lawmaking powers.
it is,of course,true that,while the revised regulation at issue is not entitled to chevron deference,it is entitled to some deference under skidmore swift,given the department of veterans affairs specialized experience here and the broader investigations and information available to that agency.id.at.and the degree of deference afforded the revised regulation hinges in turn on its power to persuade.id.at.but we need not decide whether skidmore deference would be sufficient to support the government interpretation,for,as revised,must be remanded to the agency for another reason.without further explanation of,it is inconsistent with the agency interpretation of another virtually identical statute.
as noted above,both section and its counterpart,section,use the same entitled to receive language when discussing a veteran eligibility for benefits arising from a totally disabling condition and the survivors corresponding eligibility for dic benefits upon the veteran death.in hix,at,this court noted that the agency implementing regulation for section,provides that survivors applications for dic benefits will be decided without regard to any prior disposition of those issues during the veteran lifetime.in contrast,the revisions to preclude the survivors from the veteran eligibility for disability benefits except in the case of clear and unmistakable error in short,the revised regulation challenged here appears to be inconsistent with,though those regulations purport to interpret virtually identical language contained in related veterans benefits statutes.
under these circumstances,the agency is required to explain the rationale for its interpretation of section.though there are exceptions,see dewsnup timm,d,it is a rule of statutory construction that normally identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.gustafson alloyd,d quoting dep t of revenue of acf,d.that rule applies with equal force where,as here,the words at issue are used in two different sections of a complex statutory scheme and those two sections serve the same purpose,namely,the award of dic benefits to survivors.
to overcome this presumption that congress intended the phrase entitled to receive to have the same meaning in sections and,the agency must explain the rationale for the different interpretations.and that explanation must be a reasonable one.see,national ass of cas.sur.agents bd.of governors of fed.reserve,upholding different agency interpretations of same phrase when based on reasonable explanation,cert.denied,d common cause fed.election comm n,where agency provides a reasonable explanation for interpreting the word name differently in separate sections of same statute,its construction is upheld 
it may be that the agency can provide a reasonable explanation for its decision to interpret the virtually identical language of sections and in inconsistent ways.but it has not yet done so.we there
