a group of former employees of sonoco products company sonoco appeals from the dismissal of its claim by the united states court of international trade.former employees of sonoco prods.united states sec y of labor,d cit.because the court of international trade did not err in determining that the appellants were neither diligent nor misled by government agents and,thus,were not eligible for equitable tolling,we affirm.
background 
following sonoco closure of a plant in north carolina,it filed a petition on behalf of the company workers under the north american free trade adjustment assistance act.dorothy fail fail was one of these workers.during the spring and early summer of,fail made a series of visits to the local state unemployment office to look for work and to maintain her unemployment benefits.sonoco,d at.she inquired during these visits about the status of the petition sonoco had filed and alleged that she was told that the office would be notified of the decision and would subsequently communicate it to her during one of her visits.
the department of labor agency denied the petition the result was published in the federal register on may.notice of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance and nafta transitional adjustment assistance,fed.reg.dep t labor may.fail was apparently informed of the agency denial of the petition on july,on her third visit to the unemployment office after the result was published.sonoco,d at.fail then researched her options and on august,along with other workers,filed a claim in the court of international trade.this claim was filed days after the final determination was published in the federal register.id.at.the court of international trade noted that a prescribes that workers aggrieved by a denial of a petition may challenge the agency determination within sixty days after notice of such determination.the court held that the deadline was not subject to equitable tolling because fail had not been diligent,nor had she been misled by government officials into filing late.accordingly,the court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.id.at.
standard of review 
the parties disagree as to the standard of review applicable to the issues presented in this appeal.appellants,citing frazer united states,argue that whether a statute is subject to equitable tolling is a legal determination reviewed de novo,while application of the equitable tolling doctrine in a particular case is reviewed for clear error.on the other hand,the agency,quoting brown united states,argues that the dismissal of a complaint for lack of jurisdiction is a question of law reviewed de novo by this court.while the parties apparently agree that the question of whether equitable tolling applies to a statute is a question of law,they apparently disagree as to the appropriate standard of review for whether fail is entitled to equitable tolling under the facts in this record.
we have had the opportunity to address the standard of review in several prior equitable tolling cases.in leonard gober,we considered equitable tolling in an appeal from the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court.in leonard we concluded that to reverse the veterans court would require consideration of the various facts adduced to determine whether the appellant failure to timely file was due to her own neglect.we also noted that this required the court to judge the accuracy of the facts found by the lower court.id.at.because the evaluation of factual findings of the veterans court and the application of the law of equitable tolling to the facts are beyond our jurisdiction in an appeal from the court of appeals for veterans claims under,we dismissed the appeal.id.
in jaquay principi,en banc,another appeal from the veterans court,we considered the narrow issue of whether the misfiling within the agency of a motion for reconsideration tolls the rosler limitations period until the initial board of veterans appeals decision is abated by the board of veterans appeals receipt of the motion.we held that such a misfiling tolls the limitations period as a matter of law.we went on to state explicitly that we were not applying law to facts rather,we concluded that our holding resolves a contested interpretation of the veterans court jurisdictional statute,and its relationship to the regulation directed to the filing of a motion for bva reconsideration.id.at.
in two subsequent veterans cases,we resolved similar issues without dismissing for lack of jurisdiction.in principi,we held 
as a matter of law that a veteran who misfiles his or her notice of appeal at the same regional office from which the claim originated within the judicial appeal period of,thereby actively pursues his or her judicial remedies,despite the defective filing,so as to toll the statute of limitations.
again,we expressly stated that we were not applying law to fact but were resolving whether the veterans court properly interpreted a when it dismissed appeal as being untimely.id.similarly,in bailey principi,we considered our authority to address the ultimate question of equitable tolling after deciding the appropriate standard in the context of a veteran appeal.after discussing leonard,jaquay,and,we concluded that 
when the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of the equitable tolling claim,this court has treated the question of the availability of equitable tolling as a matter of law that we are authorized by statute to address.
id.in bailey,we went on to conclude that the veterans court misconstrued a when it dismissed bailey appeal as untimely.id.at.
thus,in the context of veterans cases,we have drawn a distinction between cases,such as jaquay,and bailey,at one end of the spectrum where the facts are not in dispute and the selection of the appropriate standard resolves the case,and cases,such as leonard,at the other end of the spectrum where application of the standard to disputed facts is necessary to determine whether the diligence requirement is met.falling in the middle of the spectrum are cases where the facts are undisputed,but application of the appropriate standard to the undisputed facts is required.for these cases,selection of the standard does not automatically dictate the outcome.
an example of the cases in the middle of the spectrum is found in newell kenney manufacturing.in newell we considered,in the patent context,whether a trial court could direct a verdict in an obviousness determination after a jury had delivered a verdict on the issue.we said 
all of our precedent holds that,where the only issue is,as here,the application of the statutory standard of obviousness to an established set of facts,there is only a question of law to be resolved by the trial judge,and that the trial court conclusion on obviousness is subject to full and independent review by this court.
id.at.where the facts are undisputed,all that remains is a legal question,even if that legal question requires the application of the appropriate standard to the facts of a particular case.in newell,we analogized the standard for a directed verdict in an obviousness determination to the standard to be applied in the context of a summary judgment motion,stating,in that connection,we have held that where the ultimate legal conclusion of obviousness is disputed,but not the underlying facts,there is no issue of fact requiring a trial,even though some facts favor obviousness,some nonobviousness.id.at.thus,cases falling in the middle of the spectrum,requiring application of the appropriate standard to undisputed facts,are properly questions of law reviewed de novo by this court.
we believe that the present case falls in this middle ground.here,the court will have to consider whether,in view of all the undisputed facts in this case,fail meets the diligence standard required for equitable tolling.the application of the diligence standard to the undisputed facts of this case presents a question of law that we review de novo.
our resolution of this issue is not inconsistent with frazer.the standard of review articulated in frazer was more nuanced than appellants portrayal.the court in frazer explained that both a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and a decision as to whether equitable principles can constitute a defense to a statute of limitations are legal determinations reviewed de novo.at.the court went on to explain,in contrast,whether equitable relief is warranted on the circumstances of a particular case involves factual determinations,such as the presence or absence of detrimental reliance,which are entitled to deference.id.in this case,however,the relevant facts are undisputed.the court of international trade did not make credibility determinations or weigh conflicting evidence.thus,the deference referred to in frazer is unwarranted in this case.
applicability of equitable tolling 
we next address the agency argument that the statutory provisions here,a and d,are timing of review provisions rather than statutes of limitations,because they address the time in which a person must remove from one adjudicative forum to another.bailey west,en banc.the agency notes that the supreme court has held that provisions specifying the timing of review are mandatory and jurisdictional,and are not subject to equitable tolling.stone immigration naturalization,d citing missouri jenkins,d.therefore,the agency concludes,the court of international trade erred in concluding that the period of a and d was subject to equitable tolling.
we disagree.first,there is not a distinction between a timing of review provision and a statute of limitations.in west,this court noted that the statute the supreme court considered in irwin department of veterans affairs,d,which dealt with the time period in which to file an employment discrimination complaint in a federal district court after a final action of the equal employment opportunity commission,could be viewed either as a statute of limitations on the filing of an action in a trial court or a statute specifying the time for review from an agency action.at.the same confusion is present here both sections a and d could be viewed as statutes of limitations on the filing of an original action in a court of law.see a a group of workers may,within sixty days after notice of a negative determination,commence a civil action in the united states court of international trade.emphasis added d a civil action contesting a final determination of the secretary of labor is barred unless commenced in accordance with the rules of the united states court of international trade within sixty days after the date of notice of such determination.emphases added.in contrast,the statutes the supreme court characterized in jenkins and stone as governing the timing of review involved the filing of a petition for review in an appellate court of law.in jenkins,the statute at issue governed the filing of writs of certiorari to the supreme court,at,while in stone the statute at issue governed the filing in a regional circuit court of a petition for review of a final deportation order by the immigration and naturalization service,at.given this,it is unclear that the period of a and d can properly be described as setting forth the timing of review.
even if we were to conclude that these statutes are timing of review provisions,that conclusion alone would be insufficient to conclude that they are not subject to equitable tolling.in west,this court considered the issue of whether equitable tolling was applicable in a situation analogous to the present case.the statute at issue in west,a,specified that a notice of appeal of an agency decision by the board of veterans appeals to a court the court of appeals for veterans claims had to be filed within days.we rejected the proposition that the supreme court had in stone laid down a strict rule that timing of review provisions were not subject to equitable tolling 
we do not think the not subject to equitable tolling language can be read to mean that statutes specifying the time for review can not be subject to equitable tolling because such statutes are mandatory and jurisdictional.the statute in question in irwin,held to be subject to equitable tolling,is no less mandatory and jurisdictional than the one in stone we think it reasonable to read the language at the end of stone to mean that statutory provisions specifying the time for review are not subject to equitable tolling,after irwin,if congress has so expressed its intent.
west,at.the agency characterizes as dictum our conclusion in west that timing of review provisions are subject to equitable tolling absent contrary congressional intent.this contention is without support.in west,as here,the statute at issue specified the time period in which an applicant had to appeal to a court of law from a final rejection by the agency.we are constrained by our en banc precedent in west to conclude that there is no rule in this circuit that equitable tolling does not apply to timing of review provisions.
nor do we accept the agency argument that west rested on the paternalistic relationship between the veterans administration and veterans.west did make mention of the particular relationship between veterans and the government,but only in the context of whether the veteran could have been misled by actions of va employees,making his case analogous to cases in which equitable tolling would be available in private suits.id.at.the agency reads too much into this.it goes too far to infer from the comments in west that a similar paternalistic relationship would be required to make it possible for department of labor employees to mislead an applicant.we decline to establish a rule to that effect.
finally,the agency undertakes a textual analysis of the statutes under review in search of congressional intent to bar equitable tolling.it correctly notes that d provides that the court action challenging the final agency determination is barred unless commenced in accordance with the rules of the court of international trade within sixty days after the date of notice.the agency sees in the is barred language a rebuttal of the presumption that the statutory period is subject to equitable tolling.see irwin,at.the supreme court has,however,instructed us in united states brockamp,d,to consider a broader range of factors in determining whether equitable tolling applies to a particular statutory period.in brockamp,the supreme court considered the statute detail,its technical language,its multiple iterations of the limitations period in procedural and substantive form,its explicit inclusion of exceptions,and its underlying subject matter.brice sec y of health human,citing brockamp,at.the court of international trade has previously applied these factors to section d and concluded that the period set forth in that statute is subject to equitable tolling 
complexity in the manner in which a statute sets forth a time limitation may be interpreted as an indication of congressional intent to deny the availability of equitable tolling.brockamp,at.stating that fairly simple language can often be plausibly read as containing an implied equitable tolling exception see also bailey,at noting in its determination that statute under consideration was subject to equitable tolling the absence therein of highly detailed,technical,or repetitive language.here,neither the language nor the structure of d is complex.as observed in a prior opinion of this court,contains no alternative time limitations,administrative preconditions,or express tolling provisions of any kind.see stone container united states,d.intl trade.the corresponding provision,a,merely reiterates the time limit in similarly straightforward terms.in fact,none of the linguistic factors considered by other courts as evidence tending to rebut the irwin presumption of equitable tolling are present here.see,brockamp,at.detailed,technical language set forth in complicated statutory framework weddel secy.of health and human,clear language creating date for filing of petition which was unconnected to date of accrual of claim.furthermore,the inclusion in d of the phrase barred unless commenced does not demonstrate a congressional intent cont
