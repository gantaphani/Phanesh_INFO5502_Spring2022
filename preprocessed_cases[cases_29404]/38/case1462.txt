the secretary of health and human services government appeals the judgment of the united states court of federal claims reversing the special master denial of margaret althen claim under the national childhood vaccine injury act of,to vaccine act,for loss of vision caused by a tetanus toxoid tt vaccination.althen sec y of health human.althen ii.because althen met the statutory burden for establishing causation by a preponderance of the evidence,we affirm.
background 
on march,margaret althen,aged,received tt and hepatitis a vaccinations.notwithstanding prior diagnoses of hypothyroidism and duane syndrome althen enjoyed good health.on april,she sought medical treatment for an incessant headache,painful eye movements,and blurred vision in her right eye,which progressed in four days to a complete loss of sight in that eye.an ophthalmologist initially diagnosed althen condition as right optic neuritis,inflammation of the optic nerve,which was confirmed by an april,magnetic resonance image.after subsequent complaints of vision impairment in her right eye and numbness in her right hand,she was diagnosed with significant right optic neuritis on may.on june,althen was admitted to the hospital after suffering from fever,confusion and neck stiffness.after several days of testing,she was discharged with a diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis adem right optic neuritis and congenital duane syndrome.
althen was again admitted to the hospital on july,because of dizziness and gait instability.on july,she was discharged after being diagnosed as possibly suffering from encephalitis or adem.by june,her physician concluded that she had developed adem.on july,and january,althen experienced optic neuritis in her left eye.on august,she suffered a brain seizure.a brain biopsy showed evidence of inflammation in the central nervous system,and she was diagnosed with vasculitis with secondary tissue destruction and demyelination consistent with primary angiitis 
althen initiated her vaccine act claim on march.a special master of the court of federal claims held an evidentiary hearing on june,and in a june,decision denied compensation upon determining that the tt vaccination did not cause althen illness.despite the testimony of derek smith,a neurologist with a subspecialty in neuroimmunology,that the tt shot caused her injury and that the onset of her optic neuritis occurred within a time period for causal connection,the special master found that because althen did not provide literature that demonstrated a suspected or potential association between the tetanus toxoid vaccine and the alleged injuries as required by stevens secretary of health and human services,wl,she did not prove.althen sec y of health human,wl,at fed.cl.sp.mstr.june,althen i emphasis in original.
althen sought review of the decision by the court of federal claims,arguing that the special master erred as a matter of law by imposing the stevens test to heighten her evidentiary burden.after concluding that the stevens test was not in accordance with law and the special master reliance on it was in error,the court reversed,holding that althen had proven causation in fact under the preponderant evidence standard set forth in the vaccine act.the court remanded to the special master for an award of compensation to althen.the government appeals,and we have jurisdiction under f.
discussion 
under the vaccine act,the court of federal claims reviews the special master decision to determine if it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.e b.because we review the trial court legal determination that the special master acted in a manner not in accordance with law de novo,we effectively review the special master decision under the same standard.see hines sec y of health human.while we owe no deference to either the special master or the trial court on questions of law,whitecotton sec y of health human,we review the trial court factual findings for clear error,hines,at.
the act provides for the establishment of causation in one of two ways through a presumption of causation upon a showing that the injury falls under the vaccine injury table table injury,see a or where the injury is not listed in the vaccine injury table injury,by proving causation in fact,see a,c c ii i.althen sought redress for her illness under the vaccine act compensatory provision for injury.she must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the tt vaccination caused her malady.see shyface sec y of health human,hines,at see also a.to meet the preponderance standard,she must show a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury.grant sec y of health human,citations omitted.a persuasive medical theory is demonstrated by proof of a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury,the logical sequence being supported by reputable medical or scientific explanation,evidence in the form of scientific studies or expert medical testimony.grant,at.althen may recover if she shows that the vaccine was not only a cause of the injury but also a substantial factor in bringing about the injury.shyface,at.although probative,neither a mere showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury,nor a simplistic elimination of other potential causes of the injury suffices,without more,to meet the burden of showing actual causation.see grant,at.concisely stated,althen burden is to show by preponderant evidence that the vaccination brought about her injury by providing a medical theory causally connecting the vaccination and the injury a logical sequence of cause and effect showing that the vaccination was the reason for the injury and a showing of a proximate temporal relationship between vaccination and injury.if althen satisfies this burden,she is entitled to recover unless the government shows,also by a preponderance of evidence,that the injury was in fact caused by factors unrelated to the vaccine.knudsen sec y of health human,alteration in original citation omitted.
the government urges us to reinstate the special master initial ruling under the arbitrary or capricious standard of review.it posits that the trial court finding of causation,based upon its acceptance of smith theory of causation over that of the government witnesses whose testimony the special master found more credible,was an improper reweighing of the evidence.while the government is correct that the trial court and this court review the special master factual findings under the arbitrary and capricious standard,the trial court based its reversal on a conclusion that the decision was not in accordance with law.see althen ii.at.that was,of course,a legal conclusion based appropriately on de novo review.thus,the true issues presented here are whether the special master finding that althen had not established by a preponderance of the evidence a causal connection between her illness and her tt vaccination is in accordance with law and if not,whether the court of federal claims erred as a matter of law by finding causation under the proper standard.
the disputed stevens test requires that a claimant provide proof of medical plausibility confirmation of medical plausibility from the medical community and literature an injury recognized by the medical plausibility evidence and literature a temporal relationship between the vaccination and the onset of the alleged injury and the elimination of other causes.stevens,wl,at.the special master found that althen evidence satisfied prong one,but that,because she did not provide literature linking the tt vaccine to her injuries,she did not satisfy prong two.althen i,wl,at.he found that w ithout some objective confirmation that the vaccine administered is potentially associated with the injury alleged,petitioner causal claims are mere speculation and thus insufficient.id.at.the government argues that although the stevens test contravenes law the special master application of prong two did not impermissibly alter althen burden of proof 
we see no objective confirmation requirement in the vaccine act prepondera
