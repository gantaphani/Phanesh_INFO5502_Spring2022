plaintiff,a beneficiary of the california medical assistance program,has aids acquired immune deficiency syndrome.he depends upon for prescription drugs.plaintiff physician diagnosed him with wasting syndrome,a disorder related to hiv human immunodeficiency virus that causes the body to use lean body mass rather than fat as an energy source.plaintiff physician prescribed a drug specifically approved for the treatment of wasting.
after an initial course of treatment,which proved beneficial,plaintiff physician concluded plaintiff was still suffering from wasting syndrome and prescribed the drug for an additional period.the state department of health services department,which administers,disagreed with the physician determination and denied the request based on its published drug criteria.several weeks later,a second prescription request was submitted to the department and also denied.
plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the trial court,challenging the department published drug criteria on the grounds they had not been promulgated in accordance with the administrative procedure act apa,et or the act welf,and they did not accord proper deference to a treating physician determination of medical necessity,thereby violating state and federal law.the trial court denied the petition.
we conclude that state law exempts the department published drug criteria from the apa see welf,subds.a,c but requires compliance with the act notice and comment provisions,subds.b,c.plaintiff has not demonstrated that the department failed in that respect.further,neither state nor federal law requires the department to defer to a treating physician determination of medical necessity when the department published drug criteria dictate a contrary conclusion,but the physician determination is a factor that must be considered.
background 
plaintiff has been living with aids since.eventually,his physician diagnosed him with wasting,a chronic,progressive syndrome that,if left untreated,may be debilitating and potentially,causing muscle weakness and an increase in disease complications.wasting syndrome typically consists of weight loss throughout the body and a decrease in lean body mass.
a human growth hormone,somatropin,sold under the trade name serostim,has been approved by the federal food and drug administration fda to treat wasting syndrome.serostim increases lean body mass,body weight,and protein synthesis.fda approval was based on an analysis of patients body weight and lean body mass in studies lasting up to weeks.anabolic steroids,which promote weight gain,have also been used to treat wasting syndrome.
there is no single,optimal treatment for wasting syndrome.treatment must be individualized.a physician needs to manage a patient condition on an individual basis.aids patients taking antiretroviral drugs may experience changes in body mass and fat distribution that mask wasting syndrome.similarly,several factors can cause weight loss in patients with hiv,making it necessary to treat those underlying causes before determining whether serostim is appropriate.
under the auspices of the federal medicaid program,provides individuals with health care benefits that are medically necessary.see et welf,morris williams cal d.as permitted by federal law,the department may place appropriate limits on a service based on such criteria as medical necessity or on utilization control procedures.d.in turn,state law authorizes the p urchase of prescribed drugs subject to the list of contract drugs and utilization controls,subd.d.
when serostim was approved by the fda in,it was added by operation of law to the list of contract drugs for the treatment of certain aids conditions,subds.a,b.its use by individual used under the conditions specified on the list of contract drugs,tit,subd.b was not subject to utilization controls,namely,prior authorization,which is approval by a department consultant,of a specified drug in advance of the use of that drug based upon a determination of medical necessity,subd.a.
thus,at first,the department did not require prior were no utilization serostim was prescribed for the treatment of aids wasting or cachexia associated with aids then,in,the department adopted more restrictive utilization controls and started to require prior authorization if a patient sought to take serostim for more than weeks.this change in utilization controls was announced beforehand in pharmacy bulletins and,dated february and july,respectively,and the department issued updated replacement pages for insertion into pharmacies provider manuals.the department also developed prior authorization criteria in to implement the change but did not make them available to providers.
because the provider manuals were used by pharmacies,the change in utilization controls soon became common knowledge.but,lacking the specific implementing criteria,providers did not know how the department would determine prior authorization.to obtain prior authorization for a prescription,typically a pharmacy submitted a treatment authorization request tar,setting forth various medical information about the patient.see,tit,see also welf,eff.the tar had to show that the use of the prescribed drug was medically necessary.see,tit,subd.e.
the department never published its prior authorization criteria for serostim,informing its field staff via that the serostim prior authorization guidelines were for internal use only,were not,repeat not a public document,and may not be given to providers,prescribers,the criteria relied on an analysis of changes in body weight,body mass index bmi,and body cell mass bcm to determine whether prior authorization would be granted the acknowledged that percent of the tar requesting continuation of serostim beyond the first weeks would be denied under the unpublished criteria.as it turned out,pharmacies often submitted tar with clinical information and laboratory data that the department deemed insufficient,resulting in processing delays or outright denials.
to improve the tar process,the department eventually decided to develop more objective prior authorization criteria for serostim and to make them public.in,the department policy division consulted with serostim manufacturer,medical practitioners who specialized in hiv and aids treatment,and patient advocates.the policy division attended two meetings with the department aids drug assistance program advisory committee,which consisted of eight physicians,one psychiatrist,three pharmacists,one county aids administrator,one aids advocacy organization representative,and three community members affected by hiv or aids.the department also reviewed medical literature and published studies.
in may,the package insert for serostim stated that studies of up to weeks in duration showed the drug to be effective in treating wasting no significant additional efficacy was observed beyond weeks and t here are no data available from controlled studies for patients that start,stop,and treatment.a year later,the package insert indicated there were no significant changes when treatment went beyond weeks.the manufacturer did note,however,that patients receiving an additional weeks of therapy were able to maintain their earlier gains of lean body mass and weight.
in drafting the new prior authorization criteria,the department considered whether to include the following provision in cases where the recipient bmi,bcm,or unintentional weight loss fall outside of the listed parameters,or can not be assessed,a clinical statement from the treating physician may be used as a basis for serostim approval.such a statement would need to specify exactly why serostim is medically necessary and why the normal criteria,used to document aids wasting,are not applicable for this recipient.as explained by an internal department although strictly from a policy standpoint the foregoing provision may not seem necessary,the reality in the field office setting is that such a statement is necessary.there are personality types,currently working in the pharmacy units,which see the prior authorization criteria as something out of the ordinary and thus will not deviate from anything included,or not included,in the criteria.it is the impression of the administration of these units that the above provision will relax the perceived rigidity of the criteria and allow the consultant s to exercise their professional judgment in a more productive manner.this provision will also appeal to any physicians,who happen to obtain the guidelines it impresses upon them that their clinical judgment is a factor in serostim tar adjudication.
in late,the department publicly announced new prior authorization criteria for using serostim after an initial period,publishing them for physicians outpatient service bulletin and pharmacies pharmacy bulletin.the criteria were based primarily upon changes in body weight,bmi,and bcm.they did not include the proposed provision concerning a treating physician determination of medical necessity.
according to the department chief of the pharmacy policy unit,i n the case of serostim,the department issued the notice of change to serostim criteria at least days prior to changes in utilization control.notice to the public was also achieved by publication of bulletin articles or notices on the website at www.medi cal.ca.italics added.
on june,the department further restricted the utilization controls on serostim so that p rior authorization is required in all an initial use of weeks or the possible exception of emergencies.notice of this change was given in pharmacy bulletin,dated april,and updated replacement pages were issued for inclusion in pharmacies provider manuals.in june,the department publicly announced new prior authorization criteria to implement the change,publishing them for physicians outpatient services bulletin june and pharmacies pharmacy bulletin june.
in adopting the more restrictive utilization controls and prior authorization criteria in and,the department reacted in large part to the misuse of serostim.an underground market had developed for serostim among bodybuilders,athletes,and entertainers who wanted to build muscle mass quickly.some beneficiaries were selling their serostim prescriptions to cappers or recruiters who would resell the drug.the department was also concerned about the cost of serostim.in,paid million for serostim.in,a month prescription cost.by law,the department may restrict the use of a drug based on its potential for misuse or its cost.see welf,subd.c d,e,tit,subd.a.
plaintiff started taking serostim in,before the department required prior authorization for more than weeks use.on february,after the effective date of the restriction,plaintiff pharmacy submitted a tar for serostim.the tar stated that plaintiff had hiv wasting syndrome,was feet,inches tall,and weighed pounds.it listed plaintiff bmi and bcm percent.based on a standard bmi chart,plaintiff was overweight.three days later,the department denied the tar,noting that plaintiff had been on serostim for the preceding weeks,his bmi and bcm had normalized,and the submitted information failed to establish that he was still in a state of wasting.
on april,plaintiff pharmacy submitted another tar for serostim.the tar stated again that plaintiff was suffering from wasting syndrome.it listed his weight as pounds and stated his bmi but not his bcm.by standard measurements,plaintiff was still overweight.the next day,the department denied the tar,commenting that plaintiff was not in a state of wasting.
plaintiff appealed the denials administratively.in support,his physician submitted letters explaining that plaintiff suffered from aids,wasting syndrome,and multiple complications of hiv infection plaintiff needed serostim because other treatments for wasting syndrome,such as testosterone therapy,had not been effective plaintiff had tried anabolic steroids,but they had caused a loss of kidney function after being forced to discontinue serostim,plaintiff lost lean body mass he weighed pounds in may the department criteria required that plaintiff redeteriorate before serostim would be reapproved and the cycle of gaining weight while on serostim,losing weight when the prescription was denied,and regaining weight when the drug was finally reapproved,put a strain on plaintiff liver and kidneys and posed a threat to his life.
after conducting a hearing on the appeal,an administrative law judge sustained the denials of the tar because the first tar did not show that plaintiff weight,bmi,or bcm had deteriorated since his recent use of serostim,and the second tar did not indicate his bcm.further,notwithstanding plaintiff drop in weight to pounds,he was still above the baseline weight for his height pounds.
on february,plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the trial court,naming the department and its director as defendants.plaintiff later filed a first amended petition.see code civ.defendants filed an answer.
on may,plaintiff filed papers in support of the petition,arguing that the prior authorization criteria violated the apa,federal medicaid laws,and the act,and did not defer to a treating physician determination of medical necessity.plaintiff did not challenge the denial of his administrative appeal.he sought a writ of mandate declaring the criteria invalid.defendants filed opposition.
by minute order,the trial court ruled that the act see welf,exempted the department criteria from the apa,the criteria had been published in accordance with the act see ibid,and the department was not bound by a treating physician determination of medical necessity see cowan myers d.cowan.judgment was duly entered.plaintiff appealed.we agree with the trial court and affirm.
discussion 
this appeal requires that we interpret state and federal statutes and regulations.the pertinent facts are not in dispute.a trial court interpretation of a statute is reviewed de novo,and the application of a statutory standard to undisputed facts is reviewed de novo.emeryville redevelopment agency harcros pigments,th,d.
compliance with the apa 
the apa establishes the procedures by which state agencies may adopt regulations.the agency must give the public notice of its proposed regulatory action issue a complete text of the proposed regulation with a statement of the reasons for it give interested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed regulation respond in writing to public comments and forward a file of all materials on which the agency relied in the regulatory process to the office of administrative law,which reviews the regulation for consistency with the law,clarity,and necessity 
one purpose of the apa is to ensure that those persons or entities whom a regulation will affect have a voice in its creation,as well as notice of the law requirements so that they can conform their conduct accordingly the legislature wisely perceived that the party subject to regulation is often in the best position,and has the greatest incentive,to inform the agency about possible unintended consequences of a proposed regulation.moreover,public participation in the regulatory process directs the attention of agency policymakers to the public they serve,thus providing some security against bureaucratic tyranny.tidewater marine western,bradshaw cal th,d,citations omitted.
no state agency shall issue,utilize,enforce,or attempt to enforce any guideline,criterion,bulletin,manual,instruction,order,standard of general application,or other rule,which is a regulation unless the guideline,criterion,bulletin,manual,instruction,order,standard of general application,or other rule has been adopted as a regulation and filed with the secretary of state pursuant to the apa,subd.a.a regulation subject to the apa has two principal identifying characteristics first,the agency must intend its rule to apply generally,rather than in a specific case.the rule need not,however,apply universally a rule applies generally so long as it declares how a certain class of cases will be decided second,the rule must implement,interpret,or make specific the law enforced or administered by the agency,or govern the agency procedure.tidewater marine western,bradshaw,supra,cal th at,d,citations omitted.
here,the department prior authorization criteria,published in late and june,were not promulgated in compliance with the apa.but the question before us is whether the apa applies.see california medical brian d.as we explain,the criteria are exempt from the apa.
effective august,the legislature enacted section of the welfare and institutions code section,which provides 
a the department may implement utilization controls through the establishment of guidelines,protocols,algorithms,or criteria for drugs,medical supplies,durable medical equipment,and enteral formulae.the department shall publish the guidelines,protocols,algorithms,or criteria in the pharmacy and medical provider manuals.
b the department shall issue providers written notice of changes pursuant to subdivision a at least days prior to implementation.
c changes made pursuant to this section are exempt from the requirements of the administrative procedure act,and shall not be subject to the review and approval of the office of administrative law.the department shall consult with interested parties and appropriate stakeholders in implementing this section with respect to all of the following notifying the provider representatives of the proposed change.scheduling at least one meeting to discuss the change.allowing for written input regarding the change.providing advance notice on the implementation and effective date of the change.italics added.
in construing this statute,we follow t he fundamental rule that the court should ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law in determining that intent,we first examine the words of the statute itself under the plain meaning rule,courts seek to give the words employed by the legislature their usual and ordinary meaning if the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous,there is no need for construction however,the plain meaning rule does not prohibit a court from determining whether the literal meaning of a statute comports with its purpose if the terms of the statute provide no definitive answer,then courts may resort to extrinsic sources,including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.the legislative purpose will not be sacrificed to a literal construction of any part of the statute bodell construction trustees of cal.state university th,d,citations omitted.
under the plain meaning rule,subdivision a of section permits the department to effectuate drug utilization controls by publishing criteria in provider manuals.in that way,the affected community learns about the criteria.the necessary effect of this subdivision is to exempt the criteria from the apa.it would make little sense to require that the criteria be published only in the provider manuals,which are of limited availability,if the broader notice requirements of the apa had to be met.see alta bates hospital lackner d.alta bates apa did not apply to department percent cutback in outpatient services because act permitted department to take steps to prevent cost overruns.
further,under the act,the department may need to respond rapidly when a drug is being misused or raises cost problems.see welf,subd.c d,e,tit,subd.a.compliance with the relatively lengthy process under the apa would frustrate that statutory purpose.see alta bates,supra,d at fn.indeed,section itself was enacted on an urgency basis.see stats,ch.
and t he administrative procedure act is a general law containing general provisions applicable to the promulgation of regulations by administrative agencies.however,section is a specific provision relating to a particular narrow subject,and,as such,under principles of statutory construction,is to be treated as an exception to or as exempt from the general provisions.alta bates,supra,d at see state water resources control bd.office of admin.law th,fn,d.similarly,subdivisions b and c of section require that prior authorization criteria satisfy notice and comment procedures which are less demanding than the apa.
in the trial court,plaintiff argued that subdivision c of the states that changes are exempt from the that original criteria are not exempt from the apa under subdivision a.plaintiff asserted that the were applied in denying his continued use of original criteria and thus not exempt.we disagree.
according to the legislative history of section,the department shall publish the guidelines,protocols,algorithms,or criteria in the pharmacy and medical provider manuals.in addition,the department will issue pharmacy providers written notice of changes.these actions would be exempt from requirements of the administrative procedures act.rules,off.of floor analyses,reading analysis of assem.bill reg.sess.as amended july,italics added.
another committee report explained section would allow the implementation of utilization controls through the establishment of guidelines,protocols,algorithms,or criteria for drugs,medical supplies,durable medical equipment,and enteral formulae.utilization controls are an important piece of cost reduction.utilization controls help ensure the appropriate use of healthcare products and services the department believes that it must implement new strategies to reduce or eliminate the costly,inappropriate use of drugs this new statute would allow the department to act quickly to implement utilization controls through policy rather than regulation or statute.section would require the department to continue to meet with and receive input from provider organizations and other interested parties prior to implementing any new protocols.cal.health and human services agency,enrolled bill on assem.bill reg.sess,italics added.
thus,as evidenced by legislative intent,section permits the department to implement utilization controls for drugs by publishing prior authorization criteria in provider manuals.at the same time,changes in criteria,that is,new protocols,must comply with the statute less stringent notice and comment requirements in subdivisions b and c.compliance with the apa is not required.
nevertheless,the department is not satisfied with an exemption from the apa but goes even further,arguing that the serostim criteria did not have to comply with section notice and comment requirements.the department,like plaintiff in the trial court,seeks to narrow the scope of section by distinguishing between original criteria and changes in criteria.original criteria,it argues,are governed solely by subdivision a,which stands on its own and has no applicability to changes.under this theory,the and criteria were original and thus did not have to comply with subdivisions b and c,which require days notice of changes to providers,acceptance of written comments,one meeting to discuss the changes,and advance notice of the changes implementation and effective date.just as we rejected plaintiff narrow interpretation of changes,so we are unpersuaded by the department contention.
first,subdivision b of section requires that the department give providers notice of changes made pursuant to subdivision a italics added,indicating that subdivision a is not limited to original criteria.subdivision c refers to c hanges made pursuant to this section italics added and mandates that the notice and comment requirements be satisfied in implementing this section italics added,supporting the same conclusion.
second,where,as here,the drug criteria implement an announced change in utilization controls,the criteria themselves constitute a change in any sense of the word.as the department chief of the pharmacy policy unit acknowledged,the first published a change to serostim criteria.and the forth the standards for the first weeks of serostim changes in the outlined the requirements for use after weeks.
third,the legislative history indicates that the term changes includes original criteria,stating that new protocols will continue to require a meeting with,and input from,provider organizations and interested persons.in other words,new criteria need not comply with the apa but will continue to be subject to a preapproval process,as established in subdivisions b and c.in this case,the and criteria were new and thus came within the meaning of changes.
finally,we can not surmise any reason why the legislature would exempt original criteria from all notice and comment requirements but mandate that subsequent changes go through such a process.the limited approval procedure mandated by subdivisions b and c days notice,one meeting,and written not interfere with the department need to act quickly in response to the misuse or high cost of medications.
in short,we reject the parties narrow reading of changes.section in its entirety applies to all drug criteria that implement utilization controls.the statute reference to changes includes new as well as original criteria.consequently,the department drug characterized as original,new,or be published in provider manuals and comply with the notice and comment requirements of the statute but need not comply with the apa.
in this case,plaintiff does not challenge the substance of the prior authorization criteria.he does not dispute that they are adequately supported by medical data.nor does he seek an award of damages.and he does not request review of the denial of his administrative appeal.rather,he contends that the criteria are procedurally infirm because of rules of retroactivity.but these circumstances,plaintiff petition to declare the criteria invalid seeks prospective relief,that is,a judicial decision as to whether the criteria are presently valid.see hartwell superior court cal th,d.a statute does not operate retroactively merely because some of the facts upon which its application depends came into existence before its enactment,here,the earlier publication of the serostim criteria.see kizer hanna cal d,department of health services fontes d.
the criteria were published in provider manuals in late and june.in fact,the applicable criteria were published before plaintiff tar were denied.under section,subdivision a,which became effective on august,the criteria were properly published before plaintiff filed his petition.
and plaintiff has not established that the department violated the notice and comment provisions of the statute,subds.b,c.the record contains evidence from the department as to some of the actions it took in adopting the and criteria,suggesting it may have complied with those provisions.plaintiff simply asserts the department did not take all of the necessary steps to obtain approval.but an assertion is not evidence.thus,no violation of the notice and comment provisions has been shown.see california of nursing homes,williams d.plaintiff has burden of proving statutory violation.accordingly,writ relief is inappropriate.see county of san diego brown th,fn,d galster woods d.
it follows that the trial court correctly denied a writ of mandate declaring the criteria invalid under the apa,et and the act.
deference to treating physician 
we agree with plaintiff contention that the department must consider a treating physician determination as to whether the use of a particular drug is medically necessary,but we do not conclude that,in this case,the department failed in that regard.we also reject plaintiff argument that a treating physician determination necessarily trumps the department prior authorization criteria for serostim.
medicaid is a cooperative program through which the federal government reimburses states for certain medical expenses incurred on behalf of needy persons participation by states is voluntary,but those that choose to participate must comply both with statutory requirements imposed by the medicaid act and with regulations promulgated by the secretary of health and human services 
to qualify for federal assistance,participating states must submit to the secretary,and have approved,a plan for medical assistance that describes the nature and scope of the state program the medicaid act prescribes a laundry list of requirements that this state plan must satisfy,and an extensive body of regulations implements these requirements.the secretary shall approve any state plan or amendment that fulfills these statutory and regulatory conditions 
under normal circumstances,if the secretary or statutory designee approves the state plan,the federal government reimburses the state for a fixed percentage of certain expenses that the state incurs on behalf of individuals.this percentage,known as the federal medical assistance percentage fmap,varies from state to state.health care providers bill the state,the state pays the providers,and the federal government reimburses the state at the fmap rate the state is responsible for the balance.in theory,this arrangement incentivizes states to keep rates at efficient levels,because they share financial responsibility for medicaid costs with the federal government.ak,health social medicare medicaid cir,citations omitted.

in support of his position,plaintiff relies in part on the legislative history of the medicaid act et.the senate report commented t he physician is to be the key figure in determining utilization of health it is a physician who is to decide upon admission to a hospital,order tests,drugs and treatments,and determine the length of stay.for this reason the legislation would require that payment could be made only if a physician certifies to the medical necessity of the services furnished,sess,reprinted in cong.admin.news,italics added.
in,congress amended the medicaid act to require that states implement a plan for reviewing the use of prescription drugs,as follows the state shall provide for a review of drug therapy before each prescription is filled or delivered to an individual receiving benefits,typically at the or point of distribution.the review shall include screening for potential drug therapy problems due to therapeutic duplication,contraindications,interactions including serious interactions with nonprescription or drugs,incorrect drug dosage or duration of drug treatment,interactions,and clinical.g a i,italics added.

the legislative history of the amendments noted under current law,states may,at their option,offer coverage for prescribed drugs.in order to qualify for federal matching funds,drug products must be prescribed by a physician or other licensed practitioner,dispensed by licensed pharmacists and licensed authorized practitioners,and dispensed on a written prescription that is recorded and maintained in the pharmacist or practitioner records states may require prior authorization with respect to any of the prescription drugs which they elect to cover.
states that elect to offer prescription drug coverage under their medicaid programs would be required to cover all of the drugs of any manufacturer entering into and complying with a rebate agreement with the secretary as under current law,states would have the option of imposing prior authorization requirements with respect to covered prescription drugs in order to safeguard against unnecessary utilization and assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care.how
