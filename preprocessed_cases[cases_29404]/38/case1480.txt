background 
killeen worked as an air traffic controller from september,until his retirement on september.killeen worked a schedule of eighty hours per pay period until march,at which time he switched to a schedule of hours per pay period,which he maintained until he retired.
air traffic controllers are entitled to annuity benefits as provided by statute 
an employee who is voluntarily or involuntarily separated from the service,except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency,after completing years of service as an air traffic controller or after becoming years of age and completing years of service as an air traffic controller,is entitled to an annuity.
e.the amount of the annuity to which the air traffic controller is entitled is similarly controlled by statute 
the annuity of an employee retiring under section e of this title is computed under subsection a of this section.that annuity may not be less than percent of the average pay of the employee unless such employee has received,pursuant to section of this title,payment of the credit attributable to deductions under section a of this title during any period of employment as an air traffic controller and such employee has not deposited in the fund the amount received,with interest,pursuant to section d of this title.
e emphasis added.subsection a,referenced above in subsection e,provides the formula for calculating the annuity due an air traffic controller 
except as otherwise provided by this section,the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 
percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as does not exceed years plus 
percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds years but does not exceed years plus 
percent of his average pay multiplied by so much of his total service as exceeds years.
however,when it results in a larger annuity,percent of his average pay plus is substituted for the percentage specified by paragraph,or of this subsection,or any combination thereof.
a.the average pay referred to in section e is also defined by statute as 
the largest annual rate resulting from averaging an employee or member rates of basic pay in effect over any consecutive years of creditable service 
the three highest paying years,or,are used to calculate the average pay.
as his retirement approached,killeen calculated his annuity according to the above statutes and found a discrepancy with the amount proposed by opm.he contacted opm regarding the discrepancy and received a written response on september,explaining that the method of calculation that he used was incorrect.his error,opm explained,was in the value of average pay used by killeen to calculate the minimum annuity limit imposed by section e.according to opm,the correct average pay value when calculating the minimum annuity amount was the average of pay actually received by an air traffic controller,which,in killeen case,occurred during his final three years of service.killeen work periods,although paid at a higher pay rate than his service,resulted in less actual pay received and therefore did not count as the for the average pay calculation.
killeen objected to opm use of pay received,rather than pay rates in calculating his minimum annuity amount.the basis of his objection was subsection p,which explains 
in computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service that was performed on a basis 
a the average pay of the employee,to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a basis,shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for service in the position and 
b the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee actual service,as determined by prorating an employee total service to reflect the service that was performed on a basis,bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a basis.
p emphases added.according to killeen proposed methodology,subsection p requires the minimum annuity amount to be calculated with an average pay value using a based on the deemed pay rate,what he would have received if paid at the same rate as paid for his service for service.the resulting benefit should then be reduced according to the proration factor prescribed in subsection p b.opm rejected this methodology,explaining that subsection p applied only to the annuity calculations under section a not to the minimum annuity calculation required by section e.according to opm,the minimum continued to use the definition of average pay in existence before the enactment of section p.under the old definition,opm explained,the values were based on pay actually received by the retiree rather than the deemed pay rates described in subsection p 
killeen began receiving his annuity payments in october of,following his retirement.on january,killeen received a letter from opm explaining to him that it had miscalculated his annuity amount and that,as a result of the miscalculation,he should have been receiving more than he actually received during the periods.the error,opm explained,was that it had failed to compare the annuity amount calculated pursuant to the formula in section a to the minimum annuity amount as required by section e.the minimum,it turns out,exceeded the annuity amount calculated under the section a formula.in concluding its letter,opm explained that,in calculating the base amount,it had used a average that was based on the last three years that killeen had worked full time as an air traffic controller.opm selected those three years because they were the highest compensation amounts received by killeen during his employment.
killeen unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of his annuity calculation by opm.in denying his request,opm reiterated the methodology set out in its previous letter,citing one of its regulations as additional support.that regulation,f,states that the deemed average pay of section p does not apply to the minimum annuity calculation in section e.based on the statutes and its regulation,opm concluded that killeen proposed methodology reflects an inaccurate interpretation of statutory construction and it sic implementation would result in the creation of an annuity computation formula and payment of a retirement benefit that is not otherwise expressly provided for by law or regulation.
killeen appealed opm decision to the board,where an administrative judge affirmed without notable change.the administrative judge described the annuity computation for air traffic controllers as choosing the larger of the rate of annuity computed according to p as implemented by or of the actual earned average pay of the employee according to e.initial decision,slip op.at emphasis added.killeen filed a petition for review of the administrative judge decision with the board.killeen petition was denied,causing the administrative judge decision to become final.final order,slip op.at.killeen timely appealed the decision to this court,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
