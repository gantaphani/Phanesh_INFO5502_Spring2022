mary warren appeals from an order of the merit systems protection board,docket no,wl,affirming a decision of the office of personnel management opm,which denied her request for a survivor annuity under the civil service retirement system csrs.we uphold the board decision to the extent that it sustained opm ruling that warren is not entitled to a survivor annuity based on the two court orders entered in connection with her divorce from richard pike,a retired federal employee.however,the parties agree that opm did not provide pike with the requisite notice of his right to make a election of a survivor annuity for warren.for that reason,we remand this case to the board for further proceedings to determine whether pike wishes to elect,or has already taken steps that constitute a valid election,to provide a survivor annuity for warren in the event pike should predecease her.
warren and pike were married on november.during their marriage,pike worked for the department of agriculture until he retired on april.upon his retirement,pike elected to a receive a reduced lifetime annuity in order to provide for a maximum survivor annuity for his spouse.warren and pike were subsequently divorced.in connection with their divorce,they entered into a settlement agreement dated december.
the settlement agreement provided that warren would receive the following portion of pike benefits 
of any entitlement which results from monies to be paid under the terms and conditions of the respondent pension plan from the,which plan is more particularly described in the qualified domestic relations order in this case which applies to vested sums which are accumulated or vested as of the date of this de c ree.
the qualified domestic relations order issued by the district court of angelina county,texas the qdro,which was entered pursuant to the settlement agreement,provided that warren would receive fifty percent of benefits available on the date of divorce.the qdro also provided that of the marital portion of the vested and accrued benefit rights was assigned and transferred to warren on the date of the divorce.the qdro did not explicitly refer to a survivor annuity or any other survivor benefits for warren.
opm found the qdro to be unacceptable for processing because it contains language that is unacceptable under section of title of the code of federal regulations.in particular,in a letter to pike,opm explained that the qdro did not contain the reference required for such orders under section a of title of the code of federal regulations,which requires the qdro to refer to part of title of the code of federal regulations and to state that the provisions of the order concerning csrs benefits are drafted in accordance with the terminology used in that part.a.after opm sent that letter to pike,the angelina county district court issued a second qdro on august,the qdro.the qdro contained the language necessary to satisfy section a of the opm regulations.in response to the submission of that qdro,opm awarded warren a share of pike lifetime annuity.
with respect to the issue of warren eligibility for a survivor annuity,the qdro purported to grant warren the maximum possible former spouse survivor annuity under csrs,and it further provided that the cost of the annuity shall be paid for sic the retiree annuity and not from the former spouse share of the retiree annuity.opm,however,ruled that warren was not entitled to any survivor annuity because the survivor annuity was not awarded in the first order the qdro that divided property between you and pike.in so ruling,opm referred to h,which governs the eligibility of a former spouse of a deceased employee to a survivor annuity.that statute provides that a former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under j,which permits an employee to elect a survivor annuity for a former spouse following a divorce,or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or property settlement agreement incident to such decree.h.the statute further provides that a modification in such a decree,order,or agreement is not effective if it is made after the retirement or death of the employee and to the extent that the modification involves an annuity.id.h.because the qdro constituted a modification of the original qdro and involved an annuity,opm ruled that the statute rendered the qdro ineffective to grant warren a survivor annuity.
warren appealed opm decision to the merit systems protection board,which affirmed opm determination.the administrative judge who was assigned to the case found that the qdro did not award warren a survivor annuity and that warren therefore has not established her eligibility for a former spouse survivor annuity under the csrs.warren appealed the administrative judge decision to the full board,which denied warren petition for review.warren then petitioned for review by this court.
the divorced spouse of a retired federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity if the employee has elected a survivor annuity under j,or a survivor annuity has been provided for in a divorce decree or a court order or property settlement agreement issued in connection with the divorce decree.id.h.the statute requires that the right to a survivor annuity be expressly provided for in the election or in the court order or settlement agreement.see vaccaro office of pers,stating that a former spouse is not eligible for a survivor annuity unless the annuity is expressly provided for,citing hokanson office of pers.however,this court has held that magic words are not required to assign a csrs survivor annuity in favor of a former spouse.fox office of pers.a court order or settlement agreement is sufficient if it contains a clause which could fairly be read as awarding a csrs survivor annuity and if the evidence of the parties intent and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the document dictate only one possible meaning for the clause that it refers to a csrs survivor annuity.id.at.
although pike elected a survivor annuity for his wife at the time of his retirement and before they were divorced,the election is not effective to provide her with a right to a survivor annuity following the divorce,see j a ii,and she does not argue that it is.instead,she argues that the qdro expressly provided for a survivor annuity and that opm erred when it ruled that the qdro was ineffective to grant her that annuity.specifically,she argues that although the qdro did not use the specific term survivor annuity,the language of that document was nonetheless sufficiently broad to include a survivor annuity as a matter of law.
we disagree.the qdro merely provided that warren would receive fifty percent of benefits available on the date of divorce.at the time of the divorce,pike survivor annuity was not one of the benefits available,because a survivor annuity would not become available for collection until pike death and then only if warren survived him.moreover,the reference to fifty percent of the benefits available has no sensible application to a survivor annuity,which by its nature is not shared between the retiree and the survivor.
warren makes the further argument that the language in the qdro providing that warren would receive of the marital portion of the vested sums which are accumulated or vested as of the date of this de c ree was sufficient to constitute an express grant of a survivor annuity,because her right to a survivor annuity had already vested as of the time of the divorce.that argument fails not only because the language falls far short of an express reference to a survivor annuity,but also because,once again,it makes no sense to describe a survivor annuity as of the marital portion,since a survivor annuity is an undivided,conditional interest that is received only by the surviving spouse,and would not naturally be described as a marital portion.thus,we agree with the board that the qdro was meant to divide the csrs lifetime annuity that pike was receiving at the time of the divorce by giving to appellant and to pike and that t here is no other reasonable inter
