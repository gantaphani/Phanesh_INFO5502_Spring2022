appellant,major frederick mchenry mchenry,appeals the decision of the court of federal claims granting the government motion for judgment upon the administrative record and upholding the disability rating assigned to mchenry by the navy physical evaluation board peb,based upon his level of impairment as a result of hiv infection,which is a precursor to aids.we affirm the decision of the court of federal claims.
background 
congress has provided that,upon the pertinent secretary determination that a service member is unfit to perform the duties of the member office,grade,rank,or rating because of physical disability incurred while entitled to basic pay,the service member may retire for disability only if the secretary also makes the determinations with respect to the member and that disability specified in subsection b of.a.subsection b provides 
b required determinations of referred to in subsection a are determinations by the secretary that 
based upon accepted medical principles,the disability is of a permanent nature and stable 
the disability is not the result of the member intentional misconduct or willful neglect,and was not incurred during a period of unauthorized absence and 
a the member has at least years of service computed under section of this title or 
b the disability is at least percent under the standard schedule of rating disabilities in use by the department of veterans affairs at the time of the determination and either 
i the member has at least eight years of service computed under section of this title 
ii the disability is the proximate result of performing active duty 
iii the disability was incurred in line of duty in time of war or national emergency or 
iv the disability was incurred in line of duty after september.
id.b emphases added.
in order to determine the existence and extent of disability,the secretary established a peb in to act on behalf of the secretary of the navy secnav in making determinations of fitness for duty,entitlement to benefits,and disposition of service members referred to the board.see secretary of the navy instruction c secretary instruction enclosure of the secretary instruction set forth various procedures and standards that the peb was required to follow.
the instruction,however,was somewhat confusing.on the one hand,it recognized that,pursuant to,the department of veterans affairs va has adopted the veterans administration schedule for rating disabilities vasrd,see generally pt,which are regulations that set forth ratings for various medical conditions,including illness but it stated that the vasrd was merely a guide.secretary instruction,encl.the instruction also provided a different set of guidelines for certain circumstances,because of the secretary concern that the vasrd guidelines were unclear or could result in pyramiding secretary instruction,encl.at.it also stated that the scale is for descriptive purposes only and is not meant to imply a specific disability rating is warranted for that stage.id.at.in some areas,including the present one,the vasrd ratings and the schedule c ratings were different.
in,while mchenry was on active duty in the marine corps,he tested positive for hiv.he was found fit for duty by several navy medical boards until november,when a navy medical board diagnosed mchenry with department of defense stage v hiv infection because of mchenry multiple symptoms related to hiv infection and his resulting physical impairments.the navy medical board recommended that a peb evaluate mchenry case to determine whether mchenry was unfit for duty,and,if so,his disability rating.the peb assigned a record review panel rrp to review mchenry records.on january,following the guidelines set forth in schedule c,rather than the vasrd guidelines,the rrp found mchenry unfit for duty.because the schedule c guidelines did not specify a separate rating for stage v hiv infection,the rrp assigned mchenry a disability rating,which was consistent with stage vi infection see secretary instruction,encl.at.the rrp sent these findings to mchenry in a letter dated february.mchenry responded to the rrp findings on march,by initialing the following block on the peb form 
i accept the preliminary reconsidered findings.i understand that it is subject to a legal review before becoming final.i waive my right to a formal hearing.
at emphasis and strikethrough in original.however,no notification of decision was issued.
meanwhile,on february,the director of the naval council of personnel boards ncpb issued a policy letter directing the peb to follow the vasrd in determining the degree of disability for members found unfit for duty as a result of illnesses,rather than the guidelines set forth in schedule at.on february,the national defense authorization act for fiscal year,stat,was signed into law.the act included the dornan amendment,which amended to require discharge or retirement for members of the armed forces.id,stat.at.in response,the director issued a second policy letter to the peb on february,which directed that all hiv cases pending peb action are to be held in abeyance until further guidance is provided by a higher authority.pending peb action includes those cases in which all peb procedures have been completed but a notification of decision en bloc has not yet been promulgated.at.as noted,no notification of decision had been promulgated in mchenry case at the time of the second policy letter.
the dornan amendment was repealed on april,by the omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of,stat.on may,the assistant secretary of defense for force management policy sent a memorandum to the assistant secretary of the navy manpower and reserve affairs providing that the department policies affecting members,that were in effect prior to the enactment of section,remain unchanged.at.the director issued a third policy letter to the peb on may,providing that t he physical evaluation board will use the vasrd code guidelines for assigning disability percentage ratings for hiv related illnesses however,no member will be assigned any percentage rating less than.at.
the peb rrp treated mchenry case as still pending because no decision had issued.in accordance with the vasrd,the rrp assigned mchenry a disability rating on may.on june,mchenry demanded a formal hearing,and the hearing panel of the peb assigned mchenry a disability rating on august.on september,mchenry accepted these findings,stating 
i agree with and accept the findings of the regional hearing panel.i am not going to appeal or rebut the final decision and hereby waive my right to the fifteen day appeal period which follows a formal hearing.i respectfully request my case be processed without delay for.
at emphasis in original.on september,the president of the peb issued the formal notification of decision assigning mchenry a disability rating,and mchenry was placed on the temporary disability retired list on december.
on april,mchenry applied to the board for correction of naval records bcnr,seeking the initial january,disability rating.the bcnr denied mchenry application on april.on october,mchenry filed an action in the court of federal claims,seeking the difference between the retirement pay he would have received if he had been retired with a rating the initial rating of january,and the retirement pay he had received pursuant to his disability rating,and correction to his records so he would receive future disability retirement pay at the level.on march,the government moved for judgment on the administrative record.mchenry for summary judgment.
on november,the court of federal claims granted the government motion for judgment on the administrative record,denied mchenry for summary judgment,and entered judgment in favor of the government.mchenry united states,c.the court held that there was a conflict between the two rating systems,that the director had authority to choose which rating system to apply,and that the use of the vasrd rating system in mchenry second preliminary findings letter was both proper and acceptable by law and rejected mchenry other arguments,slip op.at.mchenry timely filed this appeal.
discussion 
before proceeding to the merits,we must decide whether we have jurisdiction,even though both parties agree that we do.we have previously established that the court of federal claims and we have jurisdiction pursuant to the tucker act,in cases asserting claims under section.fisher united states,sawyer united states.however,we have not decided whether jurisdiction is defeated by a service member voluntary retirement.in another pending case,poole united states,the government argued that the court of federal claims does not have jurisdiction over claims by a service member whose separation from the military was voluntary.although the government did not make a similar argument in this case,we ordered supplemental briefing in both this case and in poole.mchenry united states.july,poole united states.july.in response,both parties and amicus curiae,the national veterans legal services program,filed briefs in support of jurisdiction in this case.we conclude that mchenry voluntary retirement is not a jurisdictional bar.
some of our cases have suggested that a voluntary retirement bars certain claims,such as claims for benefits attendant to a promotion that a service member alleges should have occurred.see,adkins united states,if adkins retirement was voluntary,he retained no statutory entitlement to compensation,and thus no provision would support tucker act jurisdiction over his claim.sammt united states,there is no fact dispute on the question of whether sammt chose to voluntarily retire that choice deprives the court of federal claims of jurisdiction over his claims.in moyer united states,we addressed the line of cases represented by adkins and sammt.we held that there is no jurisdictional bar if the claim for benefits would survive whether the retirement was voluntary or involuntary,stating that the claimant can hardly be said to have waived entitlement to the provision by voluntarily retiring or resigning if it applies irrespective of the manner in which the claimant leaves the service.id.at.that is the situation here even a member of the armed forces who retires voluntarily may still seek disability benefits the fact that a service member chose to separate voluntarily does not lessen the government obligation to pay disability retirement if the service member actually had an incapacitating disease at the time of separation.beckham united states,see also sawyer,at.we hold that mchenry voluntary retirement did not deprive the court of federal claims of jurisdiction 
we review a decision of the court of federal claims granting or denying a motion for summary judgment without deference.info.tech.applications united states.
in order for mchenry to have a claim,section must be substantively.the supreme court has established the standard for determining whether a statute is substantively t he asserted entitlement to money damages depends upon whether any federal statute can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the federal government for the damage sustained.united states testan,d quoting eastport united states.the court has recently reiterated this standard,holding that,in determining whether a statute is substantively,the court must determine whether the relevant source of substantive law can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation for damages sustained as a result of a breach of the duties the governing law impose s.united states navajo nation,d quoting united states mitchell,d mitchell ii alterations in original see also united states white mountain apache tribe,d it is enough that a statute creating a tucker act right be reasonably amenable to the reading that it mandates a right of recovery in damages.while the premise to a tucker act claim will not be lightly inferred,a fair inference will do.quoting mitchell ii,at.citations omitted.the court further noted that the statute need not expressly provide for money damages the availability of such damages may be inferred.navajo nation,at.
we have previously held that section satisfies the fair interpretation test of testan and navajo nation,concluding that section is a source of substantive law which can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation,which sets out a right to recover expressly or by implication.sawyer,at quoting mitchell ii,at.internal quotation marks and alterations omitted.therefore,because section can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation,navajo nation,at.quoting mitchell ii,at,it is substantively.indeed,the government admits that section is substantively.def response to court order at.
we turn then to the question whether mchenry has a claim on the merits under the facts of this particular case.mchenry claims are justiciable to the extent that there are tests or standards by which the navy decision can be measured.fisher,slip op.at.mchenry first argues that the schedule c ratings were binding and that the peb improperly departed from them in giving him a disability rating of.we disagree,but,unlike the court of federal claims,we do not believe that the two rating systems are in conflict with one another.mchenry,slip op.at.
the statute mandating the creation of the vasrd requires only the secretary of veterans affairs to apply the guidelines,see but requires that disability ratings by the secretary of the pertinent military department be based on the vasrd schedule.section provides determinations that a service member is unfit for duty because of a physical disability are determinations by the secretary that the disability is at least percent under the standard schedule of rating disabilities in use by the department of veterans affairs at the time of the determination b emphasis added.section b,involving disability retirement for service members not covered by section,similarly requires that disability ratings be based on the vasrd schedule,using the same language as section.see also b.in thompson united states,our predecessor court held that section b requires the secretary to apply the vasrd in rating disabilities.id.at see also hordechuck united states.the court noted that the statute requires by specific reference,that the rating of disability be made under the standard schedule of rating disabilities in use by the veterans administration.thompson.at quoting b t here is no authority for reducing percentages beyond those found in the schedule itself.wolf united states.although the armed forces must use the vasrd guidelines when the service member disabilities come within them,the secretary may make upward departures from the vasrd guidelines in particular cases.id.at see also finn united states,these same rules apply to the section involved in this case.
mchenry argues that the secretary provided for just such an upward departure in schedule however,schedule c itself provided substantial flexibility in the application of its own disability rating scale,stating that the scale is for descriptive purposes only and is not meant to imply a specific disability rating is warranted for that stage.secretary instruction,encl.at.the secretary instruction also specifically granted the director the authority to issue internal instructions within the des to further interpret,implement and govern the workings of the peb.encl.she was not limited to proposing changes pursuant to paragraph of the secretary instruction.the director policy letters were such internal instructions.thus,the director policy of applying the vasrd code guidelines,b,with a floor,instead of the schedule c guidelines,was fully authorized by the secretary instruction.we accordingly hold that the director policy on hiv ratings was not contrary to the secretary instruction.
this leads us then to the second principal the preliminary peb decision of january,granting the appellant a disability rating became final and binding when he accepted it.the appellant argues that the findings of the peb became final when he agreed with the rrp finding and waived his right to a formal hearing.we disagree.the governing provision is paragraph of the secretary instruction,which provided 
the findings of the peb are final upon issuance by the president,peb,or when the provisions of paragraph are met.the finding
