monmouth medical center and staten island university hospital are facilities that receive payments under medicare part a for services to medicare beneficiaries.since,the secretary of health and human services has made payments to cover hospital operating costs for inpatient care under the prospective payment system pps,which reimburses according to a uniform national rate schedule.see d.the two hospitals,because they serve a disproportionate share of medicare recipients,are eligible for disproportionate share hospital dsh adjustments to their pps payments.see d f.monmouth and staten island sought the aid of the district court in an attempt to have their fiscal year fy and fy dsh payments recalculated,asserting jurisdiction under a a,and.the district court decided that the hospitals failed to follow the statutorily mandated procedure for appealing their payments,that precludes other review,and that,accordingly,it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.we reverse.
the secretary of hhs has delegated authority to administer the medicare act to the health care financing administration hcfa determinations of payment amounts are in turn often delegated to fiscal intermediaries,generally private insurers that manage the payments for the secretary.see.estimated payments are made periodically and an annual accounting is done by the intermediary in the form of a notice of provider reimbursement npr based on a cost report submitted by the provider after the close of each fiscal year.
the medicare act has detailed instructions on the means for seeking review of payment determinations.under a a a dissatisfied provider may appeal two types of final determinations to the provider reimbursement review board board.clause i covers a fiscal intermediary final reimbursement decision,commonly the npr,and clause ii covers a final determination of the secretary regarding payments under b or d,including the dsh payments.appeals are to be filed within days of notice of the final determination.id.a.in either case,the decision of the board is then reviewable by filing in district court within days of notice of the decision,or by the secretary own motion.id.f.section generally forecloses other avenues of review by incorporating the provision of the social security act,h 
the findings and decision of the secretary of hhs after a hearing shall be binding upon all individuals who were parties to such hearing.no findings of fact or decision of the secretary of hhs shall be reviewed by any person,tribunal,or governmental agency except as herein provided.no action against the united states,the secretary of hhs,or any officer or employee thereof shall be brought under section or of title to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter.
the secretary regulations provide three additional channels of administrative review.under cfr b,a request for board review may be considered by the board,provided that good cause is shown and the request is filed no more than three years after the npr.the regulations also provide two possibilities for the reopening of a determination,again with a limit.cfr a provides for reopening,at the discretion of the decisionmaker,on the motion of the provider.subsection b of that same regulation,which ultimately controls here,mandates reopening in one special circumstance.it directs that the decision 
shall be reopened and revised by the intermediary if the hcfa notifies the intermediary that such determination or decision is inconsistent with the applicable law,regulations,or general instructions issued by the hcfa.
cfr b emphasis added.
under the statute authorizing dsh adjustments,eligibility for and calculation of the payment require the summing of two fractions.the numerator of one of these fractions calls for the number of inpatient days of patients who were eligible for medical assistance under a state plan,medicaid.d f vi ii emphasis added.the secretary promulgated a regulation on how to make the calculation and has repeatedly amended it.see cfr version in force when original dsh calculations were made.at the same time,the secretary published an interpretation of that rule in the federal register as part of the notice and comment rulemaking implementing the pps.see,may,september.reading who were eligible as who for such days were eligible the secretary declared that medicaid covered days will include only those days for which benefits are payable.at emphasis added.this interpretation had the effect of reducing payments by limiting adjustments for patients who were eligible for medicaid benefits under the natural reading of the word,but who,because of a particular state program,were not receiving such benefits on a given day.
neither hospital timely availed itself of the right to appeal the nprs in question.but other providers did.the secretary interpretation fared poorly,being struck down in four of our sister circuits.see cabell huntington hosp.shalala,cir legacy emanuel hosp.health ctr.shalala,cir deaconess health serv.shalala,cir jewish,secretary of health and human services,cir.in light of these decisions,the administrator of hcfa issued a ruling that rescinded the secretary challenged interpretation nationwide.see health care financing administration ruling february,hcfar.the ruling established a new interpretation more favorable to hospitals,providing that medicaid eligible days would be counted whether or not the hospital received payment for those inpatient hospital services.id.the new interpretation was to be effective in the month of its publication and applied to all as yet unsettled cost reports and all cases in which jurisdictionally proper appeals were still pending.see id.the ruling explicitly foreclosed retrospective application we will not reopen settled cost reports based on this issue.see id.like all such rulings,hcfar was issued without notice or opportunity for comment.
the hospitals nonetheless sought recalculation of their dsh payments,filing with their intermediaries for reopening well within the three years required by.their respective intermediaries denied the requests,citing hcfar.both hospitals also sought board review in attempts to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of.they filed their appeals within days of the publication of hcfar,but the intermediaries objected that the trigger event was each hospital npr,not hcfar.in response,the hospitals invoked b,which allows extension of the time limit for good cause.they argued that the delay was unavoidable because they could not have anticipated hcfar refusal to grant reopening.in separate letters to the providers,the board stated that your rationale for late filing does not constitute good cause and that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeals.both hospitals sought review in the district court.we review the district court jurisdictional determination de novo.see moore valder.although we eventually conclude that we have jurisdiction under,we must first examine all other possible avenues of relief to ensure that the hospitals have fully exhausted those which were available.
the hospitals first invoke the jurisdiction of the district court under f to review the board denial of their appeals.having acknowledged that their appeals were untimely with respect to the nprs,they frame the appeals here as challenges to the reopening prohibition in hcfar.at issue is whether the board could properly consider such an attack.as noted above,clause i of a a gives the board jurisdiction to review final reimbursement determinations by intermediaries.but it appears that neither of the hospitals framed its appeal as being from its intermediary decision,and an hcfa ruling is not the action of an intermediary.staten island did not even request reopening until three months after it sought board review.and monmouth,while it tried for reopening before making its appeal to the board,made absolutely no mention of its intermediary or its reopening request in its appeal to the board.
clause ii,which applies to final determinations of the secretary regarding a provider pps calculations,brings jurisdiction no nearer.in washington hosp.center bowen,we determined that a challenge could be br
