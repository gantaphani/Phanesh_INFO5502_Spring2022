william heino,heino appeals from a judgment of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court affirming a decision by the board of veterans appeals board denying him a lower copayment for his prescribed medication.heino contends that his copayment amount must be reduced because it is more than what the department of veterans affairs va pays for his medication and that a prohibits the va from charging a copayment in excess of what the va pays for a veteran medication.however,because section a is ambiguous,and because the va copayment regulation,is reasonable in light of the statute,we affirm.
heino,a veteran,is prescribed a daily dose of milligrams of atenolol the lowest strength available for the prescription is a milligram tablet,so heino physician instructed him to split each tablet in half.at the time this case began,heino paid a copayment for a day supply of tablets,which he claimed was excessive in light of the fact that some veterans paid the same copayment for twice the medication.on march,heino sent a letter to the va requesting that it adjust his copayment.the va responded by stating that the copayment is being applied as it should be.in february,heino again contested his copayment amount to the.in a letter dated february,the va office of regional counsel determined that the copayment was correct under applicable law and regulation.heino filed a notice of disagreement with the va decision and on december,the board concluded that the copayment amount was proper 
heino appealed the board decision to the veterans court,and the veterans court affirmed.heino shinseki.heino argued that the regulation the va uses to calculate his copayment amount,conflicts with section a,which prohibits the va from charging a copayment in excess of the cost to the secretary for medication,because the actual cost of his atenolol prescription was well below contrary to heino interpretation of the statute,the veterans court held that the cost referred to in section a could be interpreted as including the secretary costs in dispensing the medication,his administrative costs as well as the va actual cost.id.at.because the term the cost was ambiguous,the veterans court reviewed the va copayment regulation,which did not charge heino a copayment in excess of the va projected average administrative cost,for reasonableness.id.the veterans court held that given the regulatory and statutory history,as well as the statutory framework,the regulation was valid id.
judge hagel dissented in part and reasoned that the phrase the cost to the secretary for medication in section a is clear,unambiguous,and can not be construed as including costs incurred by the secretary in dispensing the medication.id.at hagel,dissenting.judge hagel stated that n owhere in this statutory interplay is there a reference to administrative costs incurred by the secretary in dispensing the veteran day supply of medication,costs that are wholly apart from the cost to the secretary for the medication itself.id.at.
heino filed a timely notice of appeal to this court.we have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to a.
to determine whether the va is correctly charging heino,we must interpret and determine whether comports with the statute.we will first discuss the law and regulations at issue in this case and then will proceed by examining them under the framework provided in chevron natural resources defense council,d.
what is now section was initially codified as by the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,stat.in congress redesignated the law as without amending its language,a,stat.the current section a is substantively the same as the law,see a incorporating the language removed from the original section a,and the current section a is identical to the original statute.the current law reads 
a subject to paragraph,the secretary shall require a veteran to pay the united states for each day supply of medication furnished such veteran under this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a disability or condition.if the amount supplied is less than a day supply,the amount of the charge may not be reduced.
the secretary may not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the cost to the secretary for medication described in paragraph.
a emphasis added.in,as part of the veterans millennium health care and benefits act,stat,congress added the current subsection b to the statute,which reads 
b the secretary,pursuant to regulations which the secretary shall prescribe,may 
increase the copayment amount in effect under subsection a and 
establish a maximum monthly and a maximum annual pharmaceutical copayment amount under subsection a for veterans who have multiple outpatient prescriptions.
b emphasis added.a report from the house committee on veterans affairs stated that the va new authority under section b was intended to bring the va benefit program in line with private and other government healthcare providers where individuals carry a larger share of costs,at.the report stated that allowing the va 
to set reasonable copayment increases on prescription drugs is a reasonable policy in the face of va mounting pharmaceutical billion annually.notwithstanding an aggressive pharmacy benefits management policy,va pharmacy costs have nearly doubled since copayments were instituted some nine years ago.
id.at.the report mentioned that although congress was granting the va relatively broad discretion to raise copayments,the va should exercise caution that copayments not be set so high as to result in veterans not seeking needed care and services id.at.
pursuant to subsection b,the va published a proposed rule in that would increase the copayment amount to from the listed in section a.copayments for medications,proposed july,to be codified at pt.additionally,the proposed rule would enact an escalator provision to increase copayments with inflation as measured by the prescription drug component of the medical consumer price index.id.however,the provision would round all increases in inflation down to the nearest whole dollar id.in that proposed rulemaking,the va stated 
u nder,va may not require a veteran to pay an amount in excess of the actual cost of the medication and the pharmacy administrative costs related to the dispensing of the medication.the veterans health administration conducted a study of the pharmacy administrative costs relating to the dispensing of medication on an outpatient basis and found that va incurred a cost of to dispense an outpatient medication even without consideration of the actual cost of the medication.this amount covers the cost of consultation time,filling time,dispensing time,an appropriate share of the direct and indirect personnel costs,physical overhead and materials,and supply costs.under these circumstances,we believe that a copayment would not exceed va costs.
id.at emphasis added.the va further stated that based on commensurate increased costs to va,we believe that va costs would remain higher than the increases made by the escalator provisions.id.following a period,the va issued a final rule implementing the proposed rule,which was codified as.in finalizing the rule,the va stated 
many recent newspaper articles have reported dramatic increases throughout the health care industry for medication copayment amounts which are reflective of increases in medication costs.accordingly,even with the increase we may have one of the lowest copayment amounts.under these circumstances,we believe that a copayment amount is reasonable.further,we believe that increases should be based on the prescription drug component of the medical consumer price index since it is most relevant to the cost of prescriptions and thereby should be relevant to any general increases in medication copayments in the private sector.
copayments for medications.in response to commenters that stated they would return to health care if the copayment were increased,the va stated that it believed its copayments were still on the low end of the copayment scale.id.at.
this court has limited jurisdiction to review appeals from the veterans court.we lack jurisdiction to review factual determinations outside of constitutional claims,but can review questions of law.d.we review the veterans court interpretation of a statute de novo.boggs peake.
under applicable law,the va may not charge a veteran a copayment in excess of the cost to the secretary for medication described in section a.a.the dispute in this case lies in the meaning of that phrase.in reviewing the va copayment scheme,we must apply a chevron analysis,which requires two steps.first,we must determine whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.in this case,the precise question at issue is whether the cost to the secretary for medication,a,refers to only the actual cost of medication or may also refer to administrative costs.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter chevron,at.however,if congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue,we must,second,determine if the va copayment regulation is based on a permissible construction of the statute.id.at.
in order to determine whether a statute clearly shows the intent of congress in a chevron analysis,we employ traditional tools of statutory construction and examine the statute text,structure,and legislative history,and apply the relevant canons of interpretation.delverde,srl united states.
beginning with the statute text,heino argues that the cost referred to in section a should be afforded its plain meaning,which he contends is the actual cost of medication given that several dictionary definitions equate cost to a purchase price.heino further contends that the statute refers to a singular the and specific cost amount,which he argues can only be what va paid for the medication itself.however,a term as general as the word cost in section does not have a single plain meaning.see webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defining cost as a the amount or equivalent paid or charged for something price as well as b the outlay or expenditure as of effort or sacrifice made to achieve an object random house unabridged dictionary ed defining cost as.the price paid to acquire,produce,accomplish,or maintain anything the high cost of a good meal.an outlay or expenditure of money,time,labor,trouble,what will the cost be to me.thus,the plain meaning of the term the cost in section a is ambiguous and does not reveal congressional intent.see verizon commc ns,fcc,d without any better indication of meaning than the unadorned term,the word cost in d,as in accounting generally,is a chameleon,a virtually meaningless term quoting strickland comm r,me.dep t of human,cir.
section structure further demonstrates how the statute is ambiguous.t he cost to the secretary for medication in section a is that described in paragraph,which is a day supply of medication furnished such veteran under this chapter on an outpatient basis for the treatment of a disability or condition.a.heino argues that subsection a relates only to a veteran supply of medication and that because a veteran is only supplied with his or her actual medication,the intended cost in subsection a can only be the actual cost of medication.however,as the veterans court found,it is not clear that section a only refers to the cost of a veteran supply of medication and may also refer to the cost to furnish veterans with medication.heino.at the costs of furnishing the day supply of the medication implies that the cost of the medication also includes the costs incurred for providing or getting the pills into the hands of the veterans the administrative costs associated with dispensing of the medication.
similarly,the legislative history surrounding section does not clarify the meaning of the cost to the secretary for medication.a.when congress passed then section a now section a in,it was silent with respect to what cost was being referenced.neither the act,stat,nor the house conference report accompanying the act,at,discuss what congress may have meant with regard to section a 
finally,relevant canons of construction do not reveal a clear congressional intent for the phrase the cost to the secretary for medication.a.heino argues that if congress intended various administrative costs to be encompassed by section a it would have said so expressly,as it has done elsewhere.see,e b the va requires a veteran survivors,in some circumstances,to pay the amount of the administrative costs incurred by the secretary in providing an outer burial receptacle,among other costs.it is well settled that w here congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same act,it is generally presumed that congress acts intentionally and purportedly in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.russello united states,d quoting united states wong kim bo,cir.however,the statutes heino cites to support his argument are neither part of section nor neighboring statutes.see sioux honey ass hartford fire ins,citing russello and looking to congress use of the term jurisdiction in to determine the meaning of a term in.therefore,the presumption heino relies upon is not applicable in this case because section and the statutes he cites are entirely different acts 
thus,after employing traditional tools of statutory construction,we hold that congress has not directly spoken to the precise question of whether the cost to the secretary for medication refers to only the actual cost of medication or may also refer to administrative costs.
when a statute is silent or ambiguous and implicitly delegates to an agency on a particular question,the question for the court is whether the agency answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.chevron,at.in such a circumstance,the agency interpretation of a statutory term governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute not necessarily the only possible interpretation,nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts.entergy riverkeeper,d emphasis in original.
heino argues that even if the phrase the cost to the secretary is ambiguous and could encompass the actual cost of medication as well as the administrative cost associated with dispensing medication,the va copayment regulation is unreasonable because it is not linked to the actual cost of medication provided to the veteran.rather,the va regulation allows the agency to charge a copayment based on generalized and averaged calculations.moreover,heino takes issue with the va reliance on the consumer price index as a means to raise copayments because,appellant argues,the cost of some medication may not rise with inflation.heino believes that the va reliance on the index completely untethers the copayment regulation from the va costs as copayments rise according to an algorithm.
we hold that the va copayment regulation,is reasonable in light of section and therefore valid.given the ambiguous nature of the word cost in section a,it was reasonable for the va to conclude that the statute prohibits the secretary from charging veterans a copayment in excess of the actual cost of the medication and the pharmacy administrative costs related to the dispensing of the medication.at emphasis added.the va has reasonably calculated its cost to determine it does not charge a veteran in excess of the cost to the secretary for medication.the va estimates that its national average administrative cost for dispensing prescription drugs is for calendar year.prescription drugs not administered during treatment update to administrative cost for calendar year.march.yet,the va currently does not charge any veteran more than a copayment under the regulation,and many copayments are currently frozen at.see.thus,the va regulation does not charge a veteran in excess of the average administrative costs associated with a veteran prescription,let alone the combined administrative and actual cost of a prescription.as a result,the va copayment regulation is reasonable in light of the statute ambiguity.
it is also reasonable for the va to base copayments on the average administrative cost associated with dispensing medication,as opposed to the administrative cost associated with each individual supply of medic
