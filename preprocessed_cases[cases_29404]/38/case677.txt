joann reed appeals from the district court order affirming the final decision of the commissioner of social security,which denied her applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.we reverse and remand.
reed was born on september.though she did not attend school beyond the tenth grade,she has obtained her general education diploma.reed has been diagnosed with an disorder,stress disorder,depression,migraine headaches,and degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine.at the hearing before an administrative law judge alj,reed testified that she last worked in december of or thereabouts and had to quit because of her back.i could handle the sitting,she stated.in,one of her husband friends raped and beat reed and then abandoned her in a field.since the attack,reed has suffered from frequent anxiety attacks and nightmares and has been prescribed medications for depression,anxiety,and insomnia.reed treating physician,a psychiatrist by the name of antonio dimalanta,provided a medical source statement mss indicating that reed was markedly limited in her ability to understand and remember detailed instructions,maintain attention and concentration for extended periods,and travel in unfamiliar places or use public transportation.he further indicated that she was extremely limited in her ability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms.
reed testified that she was evicted from her apartment for not paying rent and had moved in with her.her allocation of in food stamps was reduced to when her husband took a job as a cashier.she further stated that she does not have a driver license and that she relies on friends or taxis for transportation.reed described herself as capable of preparing her own meals,feeding two dogs,and doing a little bit of crafts,including stamping,making cards,and some beadwork.she does crafts to keep busy,but can stay with them for only about an hour before losing focus and getting frustrated.reed described her other activities and capabilities as follows though she does the laundry,she can not carry the basket she sometimes has difficulty using her hands for gripping and holding things,and sometimes her appendages go numb she can not vacuum the floor or clean the bathtub or shower,but considers herself probably able to take out the trash she can make the bed,but can not change the sheets.reed does not belong to any club,organization,or church.
read stated that she can lift five to ten pounds,sit for twenty minutes,stand for ten to fifteen minutes,and walk one block.harold davidson,the vocational expert,identified reed past work to include stints as a sales attendant,cashier,assembler,packager and nurse aid,in addition to her last job as a microfilmer.the alj asked davidson whether an individual of the same age,education,and work history as reed could perform reed past work,assuming an ability to do the following lift ten pounds frequently and twenty pounds occasionally stand or walk six hours of a day and sit six hours a day with normal breaks and occasionally stoop.the alj further asked davidson to rule out stressful environments,such as deadlines and activity,and to assume that the person could not perform work that required sustained attention to detail.davidson responded that such a person could not perform reed past relevant work,but that they could work as a hand packager or assembly worker.davidson went on to specify that for unskilled hand packagers able to engage in light activity,jobs could be found in missouri and could be found nationally.for those who required a sedentary activity level,such jobs could be found in missouri.in terms of unskilled assembly jobs with light or sedentary activity levels,and,respectively,could be found in missouri and could be found nationally.
the alj then asked davidson whether such a person could perform these jobs if that person was markedly limited in the ways described by dimalanta.davison answered that such a person would be incapable of performing the packaging and assembly work discussed.davidson commented that the extreme limitation noted in reed ability to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods,ex,implicated the qualities of sustained concentration and persistence which are heavily weighted in terms of the average workers.and with that limitation,davidson concluded,that would essentially prevent a person from sustaining the work that i gave you.
following the alj determination that reed was not disabled,the appeals council denied review of the alj decision.as set forth above,reed now appeals from the district court affirmance of the commissioner decision denying reed claim for benefits.
we review de novo a district court decision affirming a denial of social security benefits.strongson barnhart,cir.w e must affirm the commissioner decision so long as it conforms to the law and is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.collins ex rel.williams barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is that which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,whereas substantial evidence on the record as a whole entails a more scrutinizing analysis.wilson sullivan,cir see also burress apfel,cir noting that the substantial evidence in the record as a whole standard is more rigorous than the substantial evidence standard.o ur review is more than an examination of the record for the existence of substantial evidence in support of the commissioner decision we also take into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from that decision.haley massanari,cir.reversal is not warranted,however,merely because substantial evidence would have supported an opposite decision.shannon chater,cir.
reed first asserts that the alj failed to give controlling weight to the opinion of her treating psychiatrist,dimalanta,thereby contradicting the rules established in ssr and.second,reed claims that the alj did not explain the evidence he relied upon in developing her mental residual functional capacity mrfc in violation of ssr.
reed contends that the alj provided no rationale for disregarding dimalanta opinion.a treating physician opinion is given controlling weight if it is by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence.dolph barnhart,cir.a treating physician opinion do es not automatically control,since the record must be evaluated as a whole.bentley shalala,cir.w e have upheld an alj decision to discount or even disregard the opinion of a treating physician where other medical assessments are supported by better or more thorough medical evidence,or where a treating physician renders inconsistent opinions that undermine the credibility of such opinions.prosch apfel,cir.
the alj noted several grounds for his conclusory rejection of the mss completed by dimalanta.the alj first stated that he considers such evaluation by box category sic to be deficient.the relevant question is not whether the alj,on a personal level,considers this method of evaluation deficient,but rather whether there exists a principled reason to reject it.an mss is a checklist evaluation in which the responding physician ranks the patient abilities,and is considered a source of objective medical evidence.burress,at.we have upheld an alj decision to discount a treating physician mss where the limitations listed on the form stand alone,and were never mentioned in the physician numerous records or treatment nor supported by any objective testing or reasoning.see hogan apfel,cir see also strongson,at affirming the alj decision to give little weight to an mss where the completing physician opinion was without explanation or support from clinical findings and not internally consistent with his own treatment notations.we have never upheld a decision to discount an mss on the basis that the evaluation by box category is deficient ipso facto.
second,the alj disregarded dimalanta opinion on grounds of
