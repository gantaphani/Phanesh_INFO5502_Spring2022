introduction 
orange county employees receive retirement benefits under a retirement system established pursuant to the county employees retirement law of cerl,et.all further statutory references are to the government code,unless otherwise specified.the pension amount an employee receives is based in part on the employee compensation earnable which is defined in section as the average compensation for the period under consideration upon the basis of the average number of days ordinarily worked by persons in the same grade or class of positions during the period,and at the same rate of pay.an employee compensation earnable includes compensation received for mandatory overtime work the employee performed that is also ordinarily worked by others in the same grade or class.compensation received for work performed that is not ordinarily worked by others in the same grade or class of positions is excluded.
plaintiff robert stevenson worked as an investigator in the narcotics bureaus of the orange county sheriff department until he suffered a serious injury and was approved for disability retirement.in calculating stevenson pension allowance,the orange county employees retirement system ocers did not include the overtime compensation he received for duties performed for the narcotics bureaus in calculating his compensation earnable.stevenson challenged ocers board of retirement ocers board exclusion of the overtime from the calculation of his compensation earnable and the ocers board referred the matter to a referee to conduct an administrative hearing.
the referee concluded stevenson overtime compensation should not be included in his compensation earnable calculation because stevenson grade or class under cerl was that of the class of investigators and not of a subgroup comprised of narcotics investigators.in reaching this conclusion,the referee cited section the ocers board resolution the resolution,which addresses the elements included in determining an employee compensation earnable and language from a memorandum of understanding applicable to peace officers,which did not identify narcotics investigators as a class separate from the class of investigators.he concluded the overtime stevenson might have regularly worked as part of the narcotics investigator teams should not be included in compensation earnable because other investigators,specifically investigators who did not work in the narcotics bureaus,were not required to work such overtime and did not ordinarily work such overtime.the ocers board adopted the referee recommendation.
stevenson filed a petition for administrative mandate challenging the decision of the ocers board.stevenson petition was denied by the trial court and he appealed.
we affirm.as discussed in detail post,the administrative record contains substantial evidence showing stevenson grade or class within the meaning of section was that of investigator.therefore,the overtime he worked that was unique to investigators in the narcotics bureaus was properly excluded from his compensation earnable.
background 
employment 
stevenson was hired by the orange county sheriff department in november as a deputy sheriff.in august,he was promoted to the position of senior deputy sheriff and then in march,he was promoted to the position of investigator with the south narcotics bureau in october,he transferred to the north narcotics bureau where he worked until june,when he was seriously injured and began the process of applying for disability retirement.
while with the narcotics bureaus,stevenson worked with other investigators to investigate narcotics crimes.we refer to the investigators who,like stevenson,worked on narcotics cases as narcotics investigators.stevenson was regularly scheduled to work monday through thursday,from until.he had to be available by pager hours a day and available to work overtime whenever it was necessary to complete an ongoing investigation.because drug dealers often worked late at night and opportunities to set up controlled buys with informants were limited to the dealers availability,all narcotics investigators would be required to work overtime to complete an investigation if and when the opportunity arose.stevenson testified he worked or more hours of overtime each week.
stevenson unsuccessful challenges to ocers exclusion of the overtime compensation he earned in calculating his compensation earnable.
stevenson disability retirement was effective in october.he was informed by an ocers specialist that his monthly disability retirement allowance was,which was calculated by measuring his employment period from april,to march.during this time period,two different memoranda of understanding entered into between the county of orange the county and the association of orange county deputy sheriffs for the peace officer unit and supervising peace officer unit were in effect the mous,collectively.each of the mous identified the following as the c lasses included in the peace officer unit deputy sheriff i deputy sheriff ii deputy sheriff trainee investigator and operator.
stevenson sought review of ocers calculation,arguing ocers failed to consider narcotics investigators as a grade or class under cerl and thus erred by excluding from his compensation earnable the overtime he,along with the other narcotics investigators,was required to work to complete ongoing narcotics investigations.
ocers manager of member services,stephen cadena,conducted an independent review of ocers exclusion of stevenson overtime compensation as an element of the compensation earnable and concluded its exclusion was proper.stevenson sought review of cadena decision by ocers chief executive officer,keith bozarth.bozarth agreed with ocers original calculation,stating although the overtime described by stevenson is mandatory,it is not regularly scheduled in the ordinary course of his workday.it is incidental,and occurs on a basis.bozarth further explained that the resolution passed by the ocers board excludes from the compensation earnable calculation compensation paid for overtime work that is neither mandatory nor ordinarily worked by others in the same pay grade or class.
stevenson appealed to the ocers board,which upheld the staff decision to exclude the overtime from his compensation earnable.stevenson appealed the ocers board decision by requesting an administrative hearing.
the ocers board adopts the referee recommendation that stevenson overtime should be excluded from his compensation earnable.
in response to stevenson request to appeal its decision,the ocers board assigned a referee,james armstrong,to conduct the administrative hearing.following the hearing,armstrong issued his summary of the evidence,findings of fact,conclusions of law and recommendation,which identified the issue to be decided as whether the overtime worked by stevenson as a narcotics investigator for the orange county narcotics unit was compensable earnable and includable in the calculation of his retirement pension.armstrong concluded the short answer is that overtime worked as part of a team of investigators in the performance of duties as a narcotics investigator conducting surveillance,serving warrants,making controlled buys and arrests,and overtime are compensable earnable and should be included in calculation of stevenson retirement pension.overtime which is not performed as part of such team is true overtime and not includable in said computation.after ocers filed objections to armstrong conclusions of law and recommendation,armstrong reaffirmed his original conclusions and recommendation to the ocers board.
the ocers board did not adopt armstrong recommendation,but instead sent the matter back to armstrong with instructions to decide the case based on the resolution and cerl,and to take additional evidence on whether the narcotics unit comprises a separate grade and class and all the employees in stevenson same grade or class and having his same rate of pay were required to and ordinarily did work the same overtime as that worked by stevenson 
armstrong passed away before further hearing in the case occurred,and the matter was assigned to referee edward trabin.in the summary of evidence,findings of fact,conclusions of law and recommendations after consideration of objections,trabin cited the resolution,the classifications listed in the mous,and the language of section,and concluded investigators who worked for the narcotics unit did not constitute their own separate grade or class within the meaning of cerl.therefore,overtime compensation stevenson received for overtime unique to narcotics investigators should not be included in the calculation of compensation earnable under cerl.the ocers board adopted trabin recommendations.
stevenson filed a petition for writ of administrative mandate under code of civil procedure section,in which he contended the ocers board committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law because the findings of fact made by the original hearing officer,adopted by trabin and the ocers board,are not supported by the weight of the evidence introduced at the administrative hearing the ocers board decision is not supported by the findings of fact the ocers board did not properly apply the law to the findings of fact the ocers board conclusions of law are not supported by section,the resolution,case law,the mous or by the findings of fact and the ocers board incorrectly concluded that it did not have the authority pursuant to the resolution and section to determine that narcotics investigators were properly a grade or class of position within the meaning of that resolution and statute,respectively,such that they would be entitled to overtime as a part of their compensation earnable.
in the petition,stevenson sought an order requiring the ocers board to vacate its decision and enter a new and different decision recalculating his pension benefits to include overtime as part of his compensation earnable within the meaning of cerl,retroactive to the date of his first pension payment.stevenson also sought interest,attorney fees,and costs.
the trial court denies the petition and stevenson appeals.
the trial court denied stevenson petition.in its statement of decision,the trial court stated the record of the administrative proceedings having been received into evidence and examined by the court,and no additional evidence having been received by the court,arguments having been presented,and the matter having been submitted for decision,the court makes the following statement of decision robert stevenson petition for writ of mandamus directing the board of retirement of the orange county employees retirement system to vacate its decision of december,and enter a new and different decision recalculating petitioner retirement benefits to include overtime as part of his compensation earnable retroactive to the date of his first retirement benefit payment is denied.the court exercised its independent review in determining the correctness of the underlying administrative hearing.petitioner has the burden of persuading the court the board findings are incorrect and against the weight of the evidence.citation.petitioner has not met that burden here.the evidence and the case law submitted does not support petitioner theory the narcotics investigator unit should be treated as a of the job class investigator so as to allow the members of the narcotics investigator unit to treat the overtime worked at issue in this case as mandatory overtime for the purposes of calculation of retirement benefits.there is insufficient evidence of any formal resolution or other authority requiring narcotic s investigators to work mandatory overtime as part of their normal hours of employment.the court is not prepared to a memorandum of understanding between the narcotics investigators and their employer to create a for narcotics investigators.if the narcotics investigators wished to pursue a of the investigatory classification,it should have been part of the bargaining process.the request for attorneys fees is likewise denied.
no party filed any objections to the court statement of decision.judgment was entered and stevenson appealed.
discussion 
stevenson contends the trial court erred by denying the petition because the court erroneously determined that the class language contained in the appendices of the mous controlled the determination of stevenson grade or class of positions within the meaning of section,and found insufficient evidence showed the overtime worked by narcotics investigators was mandatory.for the reasons discussed in detail post,the petition was properly denied.
