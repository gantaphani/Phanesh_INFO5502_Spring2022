opinion of the court 
relator thomas zizic,zizic filed this qui suit under the false claims act fca,alleging that,llc and rivertrust solutions,rts fraudulently billed the united states for the unperformed review of benefit claim denials that was required by the medicare act medicare,et,department of health and human services hhs regulations,and their government contracts.and rts moved to dismiss zizic claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under federal rule of civil procedure b.the district court dismissed the complaint with prejudice,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because the allegations against and rts were based on certain prior public disclosures and because zizic was not an original source of that information.for the reasons stated below,we will affirm.
because zizic fca claims allege medicare fraud,we first describe those two statutory schemes.next,we relate the relevant factual background of this case we finally recount the procedural history of this appeal.
zizic asserts claims under the fca,which punishes the knowing presentation of a fraudulent demand for payment to the united states,a a b a i,and permits a private relator to bring a qui tam civil suit in the government name,b.to proceed with the suit,the relator must serve on the government a written statement disclosing substantially all material evidence and information the person possesses.b.if the government declines to take over the case,b b,the successful relator is entitled to reasonable expenses,attorney fees,and between and of the proceeds of the litigation,d,which include civil penalties and treble damages,a.importantly,the fca public disclosure bar divests a court of subject matter jurisdiction over a qui tam suit that is based on allegations or transactions that have been publicly disclosed in certain sources,unless a relator is an original source of that information.e 
zizic fca claims are based on allegations of fraud related to medicare,a federal health insurance program for the aged and disabled.medicare part b subsidizes the costs of covered medical services and devices.a.covered medical supplies include certain durable medical equipment dme,n s,which are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury,a a.
hhs contracts out the administration of dme coverage determinations to a dme medicare administrative contractor dmac.a.the dmac may make an initial determination whether a claimant is entitled to benefits,a a,based in part on whether a dme is reasonable and necessary.if the dmac denies the claim,the claimant may engage in a appeals process.first,the claimant may request a redetermination by the same dmac.a.
second,the claimant may request a reconsideration,b a,by a qualified independent contractor qic,c,which must have sufficient medical and other expertise and sufficient staffing for such reconsiderations,c a.if the initial determination was based on whether the dme is medically reasonable and necessary,then the qic review shall include consideration of the facts and circumstances of the initial determination by a panel of physicians or other appropriate health care professionals.c b i.similarly,w here a claim pertains to the provision of items or services by a physician,a reviewing professional must be a physician.c.the qic decision with respect to whether the dme is medically reasonable and necessary must be based on applicable information,including clinical experience including the medical records of the individual involved and medical,technical,and scientific evidence,c b i,and must include an explanation of the medical and scientific rationale for the decision,c e.

zizic is the former president and ceo of the bionicare medical technologies,bionicare,a company formed to commercialize the bio,a dme designed to treat osteoarthritis of the knee.bionicare attempted to bill medicare for the bio,but many claims were denied as not medically reasonable and necessary.zizic personally participated on behalf of bionicare in the alj appeals of the qic denials of the bio claims.
from july to about december,contracted with hhs to serve as the qic responsible for review of all dme claim denials across the nation.frequently denied bio claims,always as medically unreasonable and unnecessary.however,decisions were reached without the physician review required by the medicare act,hhs regulations,and its government contract,as demonstrated by the lack of evidence of such review in the alj files.
according to a march,affidavit by wayne van halem van halem,a former employee who managed all dme appeals for all dmac regions from november to september,employed only three or four physicians to review several hundred daily appeals of claim denials.because was,it first implemented an internal policy to deny all bio claims,which were reviewed by a single nurse rather than a panel of physicians.then,allowed subcontractors to prepare bio appeals for review by a single physician.finally developed a mail merge letter that automatically denied bio claims without any review.
from about january to the present,rts replaced,contracting with hhs to serve as the qic responsible for review of all dme claim denials throughout the country.rts consistently denied bio claims,often as medically unreasonable and unnecessary.like,rts arrived at its decisions without performing the physician review required by the medicare act,hhs regulations,and its government contract.rts employed only two physicians to review the more than one hundred thousand annual appeals of claim denials.
on july,bionicare declared bankruptcy.amended complaint at,almy sebelius,cv.may.the bankruptcy trustee then sued hhs,seeking the reversal of the denial of seven groups of bio claims as neither medically reasonable nor necessary.id.at.during discovery,hhs produced almost pages of documents,statement of material facts in support of plaintiff motion for summary judgment summary judgment submission at,almy sebelius,cv,at least some of which contained personal medical information related to individual beneficiaries,id.at.on the trustee behalf,zizic personally reviewed the medical records for claims that we re the subject of th at complaint and based on his experience and expertise,explained why the bio was reasonable and medically necessary for the beneficiary.id.at.the trustee moved for summary judgment,arguing that the qics,which were funded by a contract with hhs,id.at,subjected none of the bio claims to physician or nurse review,id.at citations omitted,despite the fact that they were required to use a panel of physicians or other appropriate health care professionals,id.at quotation omitted.the trustee also alleged that the coverage decisions of the qics on the medical reasonableness and necessity of the bio were inconsistent.id.at.
on december,zizic filed his complaint asserting fca claims against and rts to which he attached van halem affidavit.the government declined to intervene.and rts moved to dismiss zizic complaint with prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under rule b.zizic filed an opposition,which included a request for leave to amend his complaint,but which did not include a draft amended complaint.the district court,after holding a hearing,granted the motions to dismiss the complaint,concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because the allegations against and rts were based on public disclosures,and because zizic was not an original source of that information zizic timely appealed.
zizic argues that the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case under and under the fca,a.we have jurisdiction over this appeal under.we exercise plenary review of the district court dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction under the fca public disclosure bar,united states ex rel.atkinson.shipbuilding,cir,and we review the district court dismissal of the complaint with prejudice for an abuse of discretion,united states ex rel.wilkins united health,cir.
zizic concedes that the district court correctly concluded that and rts launched a factual,rather than facial,jurisdictional attack,zizic opening br.at,by challenging the actual failure of his claims to comport with the jurisdictional prerequisites contained in e,app.at quoting atkinson,at.thus,we may properly consult evidence outside zizic pleadings.see atkinson,at.significantly,zizic bears the burden of persuasion of establishing jurisdiction,see,and his jurisdictional allegations are not entitled to a presumption of truthfulness,see id.at.
in this appeal,zizic asks us to reverse the district court on three alternative grounds.first,zizic asserts that the district court erred in concluding that the fca public disclosure bar applied to his case because his allegations against and rts were not based on public disclosures.second,zizic claims that even if his allegations against and rts were based on public disclosures,the district court erred in concluding that the public disclosure bar applied to his case because he was an original source of that information.third,zizic contends that even if the public disclosure bar did apply to his case,the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint with prejudice.we address and reject these arguments in the following discussion.
the district court concluded that the fca public disclosure bar divested it of subject matter jurisdiction over zizic claims in part because his claims against and rts were based on the public disclosure of transactions warranting an inference of fraud in the almy litigation.zizic disputes the district court determination,arguing that the almy litigation did not publicly disclose any fraudulent transaction on which his claims could have been based.we disagree.
the public disclosure bar,in pertinent part,withdraws jurisdiction over a qui tam suit that is based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions in a civil hearing.e a.in other words,the public disclosure bar applies if there was a public disclosure in a civil hearing of allegations or transactions of the fraud and that the relator action was based upon.united states ex rel.paranich sorgnard,cir citation omitted.although the purpose of the public disclosure bar is to strike a balance between encouraging private persons to root out fraud and stifling parasitic lawsuits,graham cnty.soil water conservation dist.united states ex rel.wilson,d,it has a generally broad scope,schindler elevator united states ex rel.kirk,d.
starting out with the first and second elements,we analyze whether information was publicly disclosed via one of the sources listed in e a.atkinson,at.the district court held that civil litigation hearings are e a public disclosures.app.at.zizic does not contest this conclusion.we too hold that the almy litigation publicly disclosed the information included in the summary judgment submission filed by the trustee,see paranich,at holding that the public disclosure bar precludes qui tam suits based on a complaint filed with the court and available to the public,and the discovery produced by hhs,see united states ex rel.stinson,lyons,gerlin bustamante,v.the prudential ins,cir holding the same with respect to discovery material not under any court imposed limitation as to its use.
moving on to the third element,we consider whether the information publicly disclosed in the almy litigation constituted allegations or transactions of fraud an allegation of fraud is an explicit accusation of wrongdoing.united states ex rel.dunleavy cnty.of,cir,abrogated on other grounds by wilson,d.a transaction warranting an inference of fraud is one that is composed of a misrepresented state of facts plus the actual state of facts.id.
we have adopted a formula to represent when information publicly disclosed in a specified source qualifies as an allegation or transaction of fraud 
if x y z,z represents the allegation of fraud and x and y represent its essential elements.in order to disclose the fraudulent transaction publicly,the combination of x and y must be revealed,from which readers or listeners may infer z,the conclusion that fraud has been committed.
id.quoting united states ex rel.springfield terminal ry.quinn.the essential elements of the allegation of fraud z are a misrepresented x and a true y state of facts.atkinson,at citation omitted.thus,the public disclosure bar applies if either z fraud or both x misrepresented facts and y true facts are publicly disclosed by way of a listed source.id.
the district court decided that the summary judgment submission publicly disclosed a transaction warranting an inference of fraud the district court reasoning centered on the trustee statement 
although the medicare regulations required physician review at the qic for claims for services or items provided by a physician,only two of the claims in a certain case show any indicia of physician review and only a small number of claims in the same case have indicia of nurse review.none of the claims in the other cases have any evidence of nurse or physician review.in fact,the qic that originally reviewed claims for the bio subjected none of the claims to physician or nurse review.
app.at quoting summary judgment submission at however,the district court did not separate out the misrepresented facts and the true facts.
zizic argues that the almy litigation did not publicly disclose a fraudulent transaction.zizic admits that the true state of facts that unnamed qics performed reviews as part of a appeals process that was generally fraught with problems at each level was publicly disclosed in the almy litigation.zizic opening br.at.he asserts,however,that the misrepresented state of facts that either rts or,in particular,performed sham medicare reviews in violation of medicare regulations and statutes and their contracts was not.id.
the problem with zizic characterization of the misrepresented state of facts is that it is actually an allegation of fraud.the true state of facts,as set forth in zizic complaint,is that and rts were obligated to perform physician reviews in appeals under government contracts incorporating medicare rules,app.at this true state of facts was publicly disclosed by the trustee,summary judgment submission at if the appeal involves medical necessity,the qic is required to use a panel of physicians or other appropriate health care professionals.a.if the item is provided by a physician,the qic must use a physician when conducting the reconsideration.c.similarly,the misrepresented state of facts,as set forth in zizic complaint,is that and rts received payment under those contracts despite their failure to perform such services,app.at this misrepresented state of facts was also publicly disclosed by the trustee,summary judgment submission at the qic is funded by a contract with hhs id.at none of the claims have any evidence of nurse or physician review by the qic.thus,we hold that the almy litigation publicly disclosed a fraudulent transaction.
finishing up with the fourth element,we decide whether the relator complaint is based on those public disclosures.atkinson,at.to be based on allegations or transactions of fraud,claims need not be actually derived from public disclosures.united states ex rel.mistick pbt hous.auth.of the city of pittsburgh,cir.rather,claims need only be supported by or substantially similar to public disclosures.id.
the district court concluded that zizic claims were substantially similar to the fraud allegation that could be inferred from the fraudulent transaction publicly disclosed in the almy litigation.zizic contends that his claims were not based on that public disclosure because the almy litigation never identifies or refers to rts or.zizic opening br.at.zizic attempts to analogize this case to the seventh circuit decision in united states ex rel.baltazar warden,cir.there,the relator alleged that a certain chiropractor submitted fraudulent bills to medicare,and an hhs report publicly disclosed that about half of a sample of chiropractors engaged in similar improper conduct.the court reasoned that the public disclosure alone would not support an fca suit because it did not reveal any particular responsible party.instead,it was only the relator identification of an individual chiropractor,which placed that particular provider among the unnamed wrongdoers referenced in the report,that enabled an fca suit.thus,the court held that the relator claims were not based on the public disclosure.
and rts counter that this case is comparable to the seventh circuit decision in united states ex rel.gear emergency med.assocs.of,cir.there,the relator alleged that a certain teaching hospital submitted fraudulent bills to medicare,but government and media reports publicly disclosed the same fraud throughout that industry.the court rejected the relator argument that it was impossible to infer the identity of the particular provider he accused from the public disclosures inculpating each and every teaching hospital,and ruled that i public disclosures bar qui tam actions against any defendant who is directly identifiable from the public disclosures.id.at citations omitted.thus,the court held that the relator claims were based on the public disclosures.
this case is closer to gear than to baltazar.even if and rts were not actually identified in the almy litigation,they were directly identifiable from that public disclosure.according to zizic complaint,the qic industry is an industry of one and rts were the only qics during their respective contractual terms.app.at.additionally,the identities of and rts were publicly available.hhs,listing of active contracts centers for medicare and medicaid services,available at htt p.because and rts were directly identifiable from the almy litigation,zizic claims are substantially similar to the fraudulent transactions in the summary judgment submission.
separately,zizic argues that his claims are not substantially similar to the almy litigation because he added some information to the trustee account of the fraudulent transaction.for example,zizic points out that the trustee only alleged that qic coverage decisions about medical reasonableness and necessity were inconsistent,see summary judgment submission at,while he added an allegation that a particular at rts was responsible for the inconsistent coverage determinations,app.at.zizic complaint does add some minor details to the trustee description of the fraudulent transaction.
nonetheless,the public disclosure bar is not confined to actions solely based upon public disclosures.glaser wound care consultants,cir citing united states ex rel.mckenzie bellsouth,cir fed.recovery,united states,cir.instead,the public disclosure bar covers actions simply based upon public disclosures,including actions even partly based upon such allegations or transactions.id.quoting united states ex rel.the precision koch,cir.we conclude that zizic additional information,the identity of the qic employee responsible for the inconsistent coverage determinations,is too insubstantial to prevent his otherwise substantially similar allegations from being based on the almy litigation.therefore,we hold that zizic claims against and rts were based on the publicly disclosed fraudulent transaction in the almy litigation 
the district court conclusion that the fca public disclosure bar deprived it of subject matter jurisdiction over zizic claims was also based on its determination that zizic was not an original source of that information.zizic protests,arguing that he had direct and independent knowledge of the information on which his allegations against and rts were based.we can not agree.
even if the public disclosure bar would otherwise apply to a claim,it does not when the person bringing the action is an original source of the information.e a.the term original source means an individual who has direct and independent knowledge of the information on which the allegations are based and has voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action which is based on the information.e b.the word information in turn refers to the facts on which the relator allegations are based,not the facts on which the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions of fraud are based.rockwell int l united states,d.
the district court determined that zizic lacked direct knowledge to the extent his claims against depended on van halem affidavit.a relator possesses direct knowledge if he obtains it without any intervening agency,instrumentality,or influence.paranich,at quotation omitted.in other words,direct knowledge is based on information,id.at quoting united states ex rel.findley fpc boron emps.club,and it is gained by the relator own efforts,and not by the labors of others,id.quoting united states ex rel.hafter spectrum emergency care,cir.
zizic argues that his knowledge was direct.he asserts that no document was ever provided by any third party stating that medical reviews by were not done in the medicare appeal.zizic opening br.at emphasis omitted.however,van halem provided that exact information in his affidavit.app.at simply issued a denial with a mail merge program without according the claims any review.
zizic also contends that he had direct knowledge from his personal participation in the alj appeals and that van halem affidavit merely substantiated his suspicion of fraud.zizic reply br.at.zizic analogizes his case to the circuit decision in springfield.there,civil discovery publicly disclosed information that did not constitute allegations or transactions of fraud,but that did pique the relator curiosity.the relator then conduct ed its own investigation of that information,at,by interview ing with individuals and businesses identified in the discovery,id.at.because the relator bridged the gap between the innocuous publicly disclosed information and the allegation of fraud through its own efforts and experience,the court held that it was an original source.id.
certainly,van halem did more than substantiate zizic suspicions in fact,the affidavit is the sole source of all of the specific incriminating facts alleged against in the complaint.additionally,springfield is distinguishable.at oral argument,zizic indicated that van halem reached out to him unlike the relator in springfield,zizic did not discover van halem as a result of his own investigation.indeed,zizic has provided no information about his investigation,an omission that is especially troubling in light of the fact that it is zizic burden to establish the direct nature of his knowledge.thus,we conclude that zizic lacked direct knowledge to the extent his claims against relied on van halem affidavit.
the district court also determined that zizic lacked independent knowledge of his surviving claims because his information was based on e a public disclosures.a relator knowledge is independent if it does not depend on public disclosures.atkinson,at citation omitted.significantly,the concept of a public disclosure under e b is broader than the concept of a public disclosure under e a a public disclosure under e b encompasses not only information that is disclosed via the sources enumerated in e a,but also information that is part of the public domain.id.at.this distinction is important.on the one hand,reliance solely on public disclosures under e a is always insufficient under e b to confer original source status.id.at.on the other hand,reliance on public information that does not qualify as a public disclosure under e a may also preclude original source status,depending on the extent of that reliance,and the nature of the information in the public domain,id.citing united states ex rel.barth ridgedale,cir,as well as the availability of information,and the amount of labor and deduction required to construct the claim,id.quoting kennard comstock,cir.
zizic presents two reasons why his knowledge was not dependent on the almy litigation.first,he asserts that because only he had the requisite medical expertise and background to understand and review the medicare appeals files concerning the dmes that were produced during discovery in the almy litigation,the trustee relied on his labor and deduction to construct her claims.zizic reply br
