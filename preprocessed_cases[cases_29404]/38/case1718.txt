discussion 
section requires the department to reinstate hanna to paid status as a deputy sheriff.
government code section provides permanent incapacity for the performance of duty shall in all cases be determined by the board.if the medical examination and other available information do not show to the satisfaction of the board that the member is incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his duties in the service and the member application is denied on this ground the board shall give notice of such denial to the employer.the employer may obtain judicial review of such action of the board by filing a petition for a writ of mandate in accordance with the code of civil procedure or by joining or intervening in such action filed by the member within days of the mailing of such notice.if such petition is not filed or the court enters judgment denying the writ,whether on the petition of the employer or the member,and the employer has dismissed the member for disability the employer shall reinstate the member to his employment effective as of the day following the effective date of the dismissal.
the department contends section does not apply here because it did not dismiss hanna from her employment.the department claims it offered to place hanna in another position consistent with her work restriction,but hanna refused to cooperate.on appeal,the department asserts it never represented it would reduce hanna pay.in its disability application,however,the department stated it had no position consistent with the work restriction which would afford hanna the same pay she received as a deputy sheriff.hanna responds,arguing the department dismissed her within the meaning of section when it refused to restore her to full salary as a deputy sheriff.based on the plain language of section,and the case law discussed below,we conclude the department had a mandatory duty to reinstate hanna to paid status as a deputy sheriff once the retirement board decision denying her application for disability retirement became final.
