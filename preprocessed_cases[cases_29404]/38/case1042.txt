alonzo lax lax appeals the district court order affirming the decision of the commissioner of social security to deny lax application for social security disability benefits ssd and supplemental security income benefits ssi under titles ii and xvi of the social security act,a m and.lax contends that the administrative law judge alj erred in determining that lax impairment did not meet or medically equal listing b for mental retardation.we conclude that in the absence of a valid iq score of or less,the severity prong b of listing is not met,and that making factual determinations on the validity of an iq score is within the province of an alj and will be upheld when supported by substantial evidence.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and g and affirm.
procedural history 
lax filed an application for ssd on december,alleging disability as of december.he claimed that he was disabled because he had pain from a prior gunshot wound,could not lift objects or stand for extended periods of time,had poor concentration and memory,and suffered from mental health issues.his claim was denied at the initial and reconsideration levels.after conducting a hearing in march of,the alj ruled that lax was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act.lax filed a request for review by the appeals council,which was denied.in june of,lax applied for ssi 
in september of,lax filed a complaint in federal court.on september,the district court adopted the magistrate judge report and recommendation r r,which concluded that the alj decision should be reversed and remanded to the commissioner for additional proceedings pursuant to g.on remand,the appeals council vacated the commissioner decision and remanded lax case to a new alj.see when federal court remands for further consideration,appeals council,acting on behalf of commissioner,may make a decision or remand to alj.
in september of,the new alj held a hearing to consider lax claims for ssd and ssi.in november of,the alj issued a decision denying lax benefits.because the appeals council remanded lax case to an alj after the federal court initial remand,the alj decision stands as the final decision of the commissioner for purposes of our review,when federal court remands case for further consideration,decision of alj becomes final decision of commissioner unless appeals council assumes jurisdiction of case hamlin barnhart,cir.
lax then filed a second civil action in federal court.on october,the magistrate issued an r r recommending reversal of the commissioner decision and a remand for further proceedings.after reviewing the commissioner objections to the r r,the district court rejected the magistrate judge recommendation and affirmed the decision of the commissioner on march.

lax has been evaluated by mckenna,a state agency psychological consultative examiner,on at least two occasions.after meeting with lax in february of,mckenna reported that lax believed he c ould do anything,but mckenna noted h e is not mentally retarded and he appears to be functioning in the borderline range,intellectually.id.at.mckenna reported that lax was immature and unreliable and sees himself as slow and needs other people to assist him to complete most tasks.id.he noted that lax abilities to bathe,dress,and eat appeared to be at an independent level,but that lax relied on his landlord to assist him with meal preparation,shopping,transportation,and laundry.he diagnosed lax with adjustment reaction with depression related to his release from prison and borderline intelligence dependent personality disorder.

standard of review 
we review the commissioner decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.hackett barnhart,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.it requires more than a scintilla,but less than a preponderance.zoltanski,cir.we consider whether the alj followed the specific rules of law that must be followed in weighing particular types of evidence in disability cases,but we will not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for the commissioner.hackett,at internal citations omitted.
the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency findings from being supported by substantial evidence.zoltanski,at.we may not displace the agenc y choice between two fairly conflicting views,even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.id.
disability determination 
the social security act defines disability as the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months d a,a a williams bowen,cir.this duration requirement applies to the claimant inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity,and not just his underlying impairment.barnhart walton,d.
the commissioner is required to follow a sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled.hackett,at.the claimant bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case of disability at steps one through four.id.step one requires the claimant to demonstrate that he is not presently engaged in substantial gainful activity.grogan barnhart,cir.at step two,the claimant must show that he has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.id.at step three,if a claimant can show that the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment,he is presumed to be disabled and entitled to benefits.williams,at.if a claimant can not meet a listing at step three,he continues to step four,which requires the claimant to show that the impairment or combination of impairments prevents him from performing his past work.grogan,at.
if the claimant successfully meets this burden,the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner at step five to show that the claimant retains sufficient rfc residual functional capacity to perform work in the national economy,given her age,education,and work experience.hackett,at.if a determination can be made at any of the steps that a claimant is or is not disabled,evaluation under a subsequent step is not necessary.williams,at.
step three,listing b for mental retardation 
at step three,the determination is made whether the impairment is equivalent to one of a number of listed impairments that the commissioner acknowledges are so severe as to preclude substantial gainful activity.williams,at d,a d.if the impairment is listed and thus conclusively presumed to be disabling,the claimant is entitled to benefits.williams,at.to show that an impairment or combination of impairments meets the requirements of a listing,a claimant must provide specific medical findings that support each of the various requisite criteria for the impairment.see.
in this appeal,lax argues that the alj erred in determining that he did not meet the listing for b.listing,mental retardation,states 
m ental retardation refers to significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive functioning initially manifested during the developmental period,the evidence demonstrates or supports onset of the impairment before age,pt,subpt.p,app.
this is what is commonly referred to as the capsule definition for this listing.in addition to meeting this capsule definition,a claimant must also meet one of the four severity prongs for mental retardation as listed in the regulations.the listing states,
t he required level of severity for this disorder is met when the requirements in a,b,c,or d are satisfied.
b a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of or less or 
c a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of through and a physical or other mental impairment imposing an additional and significant limitation of function or 
d see,pt,subpt.p,app,a d.
the alj determined that lax failed to satisfy both the capsule definition for the listing and severity prong b of the listing.in his appeal,lax argues that he meets the capsule definition for the listing,as well as the criteria for severity prong b.in the alternative,lax argues that the alj erred in failing to consider whether he met the criteria for severity prong c.we will first examine whether lax met severity prong b of the listing.
severity prong of listing b 
lax argues that the district court erred in finding that he did not meet severity prong b of the listing,which requires a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of or less.pt,subpt.p,app,b.in cases where more than one iq is customarily derived from the test administered,where verbal,performance,and full scale iqs are provided in the wechsler series,we use the lowest of these in conjunction with.see,pt,subpt.p,app,d c.
lax contends that there are two test results in the record and both establish a full scale iq below in may of,mckenna administered the wechsler adult intelligence scale iii iq test to lax,who received a verbal iq score of,a performance iq score of,and a full scale iq score of.in october of,barnett administered this same test to lax,who achieved a verbal iq of,a performance iq of,and a full scale iq of.although these scores fall below the numeric requirement of the listing,the alj determined that w hen the entire record is reviewed the low iq scores can not be considered sic as valid.app.at.
lax argues that the alj based this conclusion on his own opinions and observations,rather than on valid objective evidence in the record.the commissioner responds that making factual determinations on the validity of iq scores is within the province of an alj and the record contains substantial evidence to support the alj finding that lax iq scores are not an accurate measurement of his intellectual functioning.we agree.
the alj discussed lax iq scores in his analysis of step two and step three of the disability determination.in his analysis of step two,the alj noted that in february of,mckenna diagnosed lax with borderline intelligence with a dependent personality disorder.app.at.in regards to the iq test mckenna administered in may of,the alj found that mckenna clearly renounc ed the scores reported because lax effort w as minimal and inadequate and his responses appeared unreliable.id.at.the alj also commented on the results of lax iq test administered by barnett and stated,
t he claimant was examined by robert barnett,on october.barnett did not notice any unusual behavior.barnett found the claimant verbal iq to be,his performance iq was,and his full scale iq was.barnett expressed his belief that the claimant was actually functioning in a higher range.id.at.
in his analysis at step three the alj determined that lax medical evidence demonstrated that he suffers from depression,reduced intellectual functioning,inability to read and is sic status post gunshot wound in thoracic area of back with resulting pain.id.the alj concluded that these are severe impairments within the meaning of the regulations,but that these impairments were not severe enough to meet or medically equal a listing,either singly or in combination.specifically,in regards to listing b,the alj noted disparities between lax iq scores and other evidence in the record and commented that 
t he only conclusion that can be reached is that the claimant is either not performing consistently on the tests or he is deliberately attempting to have low scores.when the entire record is reviewed the low iq scores can not be considered sic as valid.no examiner has vouched for the validity of the tests,and the large variations in results raise legitimate questions concerning their validity.the undersigned will not assume the tests to be valid representations of the claimant intelligence levels,and will not rely on them to establish a listing level mental impairment.id.at.
the alj also determined that lax credibility was at issue and concluded that his claims of a mental impairment severe enough to meet listing b were not supported by objective evidence.
we conclude that it was proper for the alj to consider other evidence in the record when determining whether lax iq scores were valid and that the record contains substantial evidence to support a finding that lax iq scores were not an accurate reflection of his intellectual capabilities.our decision is consistent with the reasoning of other circuits on this issue.see markle barnhart,cir noting that commissioner is not required to accept a claimant iq scores and may reject scores that are inconsistent with the record clark apfel,cir same muse sullivan,cir noting that an alj may make factual determinations on the validity of iq scores popp heckler,cir commissioner is not requi
