concorde garment manufacturing corporation,and more than temporary,nonresident former employees of concorde,appeal from the district court entry of judgment on the pleadings in favor of the united states the district court held that temporary foreign workers in the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands cnmi and their employers are required to pay federal insurance contributions act fica taxes,which fund social security and medicare.section b of the covenant governing relations provides that laws that impose excise taxes to support the social security system apply to the cnmi as they apply to guam because fica is a law that imposes an excise tax to support the social security system,it applies to the cnmi as it applies to guam.in turn,fica applies to all workers and their employers in guam,regardless of their citizenship.therefore,fica also applies to all workers and their employers in the cnmi,including appellants,regardless of their citizenship.we therefore affirm the district court.
background 
appellants concorde garment manufacturing corporation concorde and the chinese national,nonresident workers formerly employed at concorde facilities in the cnmi employees paid fica taxes from the years to.in,appellants filed refund claims for those payments.the internal revenue service irs refunded concorde fica taxes but otherwise took no action on appellants claims.thereafter,appellants sued the united states in the district court for the northern mariana islands to recover the remainder of the fica taxes they had paid.the united states to recover the refund of concorde fica taxes,which it argued was erroneously issued.the district court ruled that all workers and their employers in the cnmi are subject to fica,regardless of the citizenship of either.
appellants timely filed this appeal,arguing that the covenant was intended to subject only cnmi citizens,not temporary nonresident foreign workers,to fica taxes even if fica generally applies to all workers and their employers in the cnmi,employees are entitled to the fica tax exemption for temporary nonresident filipino workers in guam even if the first two arguments are rejected,the employee portion of fica does not apply because it is an income tax,and only excise and taxes that support social security apply to the cnmi and the statutory basis for applying fica to appellants is unconstitutionally vague 
ii.standard of review 
we review de novo an order granting judgment on the pleadings,accepting facts alleged by the nonmoving party as true and drawing all inferences in its favor.legras aetna life ins,cir.we also review de novo underlying issues of statutory interpretation and constitutionality.fournier sebelius,cir,cert.denied.
we have held that taxing statute s must be construed most strongly in favor of the taxpayer and against the government.greyhound united states,cir.however,w e are not impressed by the argument that any doubtful question should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.white united states.thus,where the rights of suitors turn on the construction of a tax statute it is our duty to decide what that construction fairly should be,and doubts which may arise upon a cursory examination of tax statutes may disappear when they are read,as they must be,with every other material part of the statute,and in the light of their legislative history.id.citation omitted see also irwin gavit,it is said that the tax laws should be construed favorably for the taxpayers.but that is not a reason for creating a doubt or for exaggerating one when it is no greater than we can bring ourselves to feel in this case.
therefore,while tax statutes are not to be extended by implication beyond the clear import of the language used,united states merriam,we do not mechanically resolve doubts in favor of the taxpayer but instead resort to the ordinary tools of statutory interpretation.ultimately,the literal meaning of the words employed is most important.see also united states fei ye,f d,cir if the plain language of a statute renders its meaning reasonably clear,we will not investigate further unless its application leads to unreasonable or impracticable results.internal quotation marks and citation omitted mariana islands united states,cir we would be undermining congressional intent if we were to decline to give effect to what section a of the covenant by its terms requires.
we note that the federal circuit has ruled in favor of the government and against the taxpayers in a materially indistinguishable case,a decision which is persuasive,though not dispositive.see zhang united states,zhang ii,cert.denied.we have recognized,however,that u niformity among circuits is especially important in tax cases to ensure equal and certain administration of the tax system.hill comm r,cir quoting pac.first fed.sav.bank comm r,cir.that is particularly true where,as here,a circuit split would create two mutually exclusive rules applicable to the cnmi,leading to uncertainty and obvious forum shopping opportunities.
iii.discussion 
a.the cnmi is within the united states for purposes of fica.covenant b 
fica imposes an employer and an employee tax on wages with respect to employment.see a employee tax,a employer tax.fica applies to wages related to work performed within the united states,irrespective of the citizenship or residence of either the employee or employer,id.b,and to wages related to work performed outside the united states by a citizen or resident as an employee for an american employer,id.section e defines the term united states when it is used in a geographical sense to include the commonwealth of puerto rico,the virgin islands,guam,and american samoa thus,wages for services performed in guam are subject to both the employee and employer provisions of fica,irrespective of the citizenship or residence of either the employee or the employer.id.b.
section b of the covenant,in turn,provides 
those laws of the united states which impose excise and taxes to support or which provide benefits from the united states social security system will upon termination of the trusteeship agreement or such earlier date as may be agreed to by the government of the northern mariana islands and the government of the united states become applicable to the northern mariana islands as they apply to guam.
just as in guam,then,wages for services performed in the cnmi are subject to fica taxes,irrespective of citizenship or residence.see b.we hold that the district court correctly held that appellants,who paid and received wages for services performed in the cnmi,are required to pay fica taxes on those wages,even though employees were temporary nonresident chinese nationals 
covenant b is not limited to citizens or residents of guam or the cnmi.
appellants attempt to steer us away from this straightforward conclusion,which flows directly from the plain language of covenant b,by advocating a application of fica to the cnmi.they argue that the phrase in covenant b as they apply to guam is ambiguous,and that the term guam does not mean guam,but actually means the people who reside in or who are citizens of that geographic area.from this manufactured ambiguity,appellants assert that b reference to the cnmi is also ambiguous and could refer to persons in the cnmi,rather than to the geographic area itself.appellants then argue that b does not refer to all the people in the cnmi,but instead refers only to citizens of the cnmi.under this tortured reading of the covenant,appellants conclude that b subjects only cnmi citizens and their employers to fica taxes.
there is no plausible method by which to arrive at appellants conclusion from the plain language of the covenant and,were b amenable to a application,we would decline to adopt that construction because fica is incompatible with such an application.
to begin with,b does not mention citizenship or people,and we see no reason to read those words into the covenant.moreover,even if we were to read references to geographic areas as references to people in those geographic areas,our reading would not be limited to citizens.the very extrinsic drafting material appellants rely upon actually suggests the contrary conclusion.it suggests that references to guam or to the cnmi could refer either to the geographic areas or to the people who reside in or who are citizens of those geographic areas.see cong.emphasis added.thus,there is no plausible way to limit the applicability of b exclusively to the citizens as opposed to the residents of the cnmi 
further,to the extent that any ambiguity exists as to whether the to guam refers to people as opposed to geography,the plain language of fica compels us to adopt the geographic application.by its terms,fica never applies solely based upon a worker citizenship.rather,fica applies in two instances when work is performed within the united states,and when work is performed by a citizen for an american employer.see b.therefore,unless we construe b to include the cnmi within the united states geographically,fica would not require cnmi citizens to pay fica taxes unless they were working for an american employer.see id.there is no indication that fica was intended to have such a limited effect within the cnmi.indeed,because cnmi citizens became citizens under the covenant meaning they already must pay fica taxes when working for an american employer such an outcome would render b meaningless.see covenant b we avoid this result and afford b meaning by concluding that,through operation of the to guam,the cnmi is brought within the geographical territory of the united states for purposes of fica.
intervening legislation does not preclude b applicability.
appellants assert that even if they were subject to fica pursuant to covenant b as originally drafted,two statutes enacted after the covenant was approved,but before b became effective in,preclude application of fica to appellants.we disagree.
first,appellants look to a amendment to,which altered the definition of the term state in the social security act.in doing so,the amendment extended the application of certain benefit provisions to the cnmi.critically,from appellants perspective,although the amendment expressly mentioned both the cnmi and guam,a different menu of benefits was extended to each.see a.appellants assert that this amendment demonstrates congress intent to treat guam and the cnmi differently,and that it is therefore improper to mechanically substitute the cnmi for guam in covenant b.
this argument is without merit,and like the federal circuit,we reject it.see zhang ii,at contrary to appellants arguments,congress did not subsequently abandon the substitution of guam for the cnmi by enacting.see also zhang i,fed.cl.at.before the amendment to,social security benefits in the cnmi were linked to benefits in guam pursuant to covenant b.the amendment operated to eliminate the benefit parity between the two territories.but there is no indication that congress intended its amendment to social security benefits to extend to fica taxes.indeed,far from supporting appellants conclusion,that congress did not amend any taxation provisions when it amended the benefits provisions confirms congress intent that fica taxes remain applicable to the cnmi as to guam.thus,the cnmi fica tax treatment remains linked to guam pursuant to covenant b.
second,appellants direct us to section of the act of,stat.relations were governed by a trusteeship agreement following world war ii.during the unexpectedly delayed transition from the trusteeship agreement to the covenant,cnmi citizens did not meet the citizenship requirement included in many statutory benefit provisions as the federal circuit has explained,purpose was to accelerate cnmi citizens receipt of certain statutory benefits to which they otherwise would not have been entitled until termination of the trusteeship agreement.zhang ii,at.the act accomplished this purpose by waiving the citizenship requirement for certain benefits.section of the act provides 
a the president may provide that the requirement of united states citizenship or nationality provided for in any of the statutes listed on pages of the interim report shall not be applicable to the citizens of the northern mariana islands 
b a statute which denies a benefit or imposes a burden or a disability on an alien,his dependents,or his survivors shall,for the purposes of this act,be considered to impose a requirement of united states citizenship or nationality.
reading the two subsections together,b clarifies which of the statutes listed in the interim report referenced in a contains a requirement of united states citizenship.thus,b defines the type of statutory provision for which the president may waive a requirement of united states citizenship pursuant to the authority granted in a.
appellants read b out of context when they contend that it actually reads a citizenship requirement into all statutes that den y a benefit or impose a burden or a disability on an alien.it turns the act of on its head to conclude that b excludes aliens from both the benefits and the burdens of a wide range of laws.the very purpose of the act was to include cnmi citizens,who remained aliens until the official termination of the trusteeship agreement in,within benefits programs that explicitly required citizenship.we therefore join the federal circuit in holding that of the act of has no effect on the applicability of fica to nonresident workers in the cnmi.see zhang ii,at.
b.the fica exemption for nonresident filipino workers in guam does not extend to nonresident chinese workers in the cnmi.
appellants next argue that even if fica applies to nonresident workers and their employers in the cnmi generally,appellants fit within an exemption to fica taxation that congress created for certain nonresident workers in guam.the exemption on which appellants rely,however,is expressly limited to filipino citizens admitted to guam under h visas.see b pursuant to covenant b,then,filipinos admitted to the cnmi under h visas arguably would be exempt from fica.however,even if we overlooked the fact that employees were not admitted to the cnmi pursuant to h visas,the exemption remains plainly inapplicable because employees are chinese nationals 
moreover,as appellants concede,filipinos were not the only temporary nonresident workers in guam when the exemption was created.see house of,comm.on the judiciary,subcomm.on immigration,citizenship,and int l law,the use of temporary alien labor on guam.in light of this demographic reality,congress decision to expressly limit the exemption to filipinos,in part because of our nation unique political ties with the philippines,suggests that the exemption was not meant to cover all nonresident workers in guam.in sum,congress singled out filipinos for preferential treatment.because it is undisputed that employees are not filipinos,the exemption does not apply to them.
fica and seca apply in their entirety to the cnmi as they apply to guam.
section b states that t hose laws of the united states which impose excise and taxes to support the united states social security system will become applicable to the cnmi as they apply to guam.covenant b.appellants contend that even if fica generally applies to the cnmi,the employee portion does not apply because it is an income tax,not an excise or tax.see a imposing on the income of every individual a tax.in other words,appellants read b as if it contains an additional limitation those laws of the united states which impose only excise taxes and only taxes to support the united states social security system will become applicable to the cnmi as they apply to guam.appellants misread the provision.
section b does not contain the limitation suggested by appellants,nor does it state that excise taxes apply in the cnmi as in guam.instead,b provides that those laws which impose such taxes apply in the cnmi as in guam.the difference is subtle but crucial laws imposing excise taxes,and not simply the excise taxes themselves,apply in the cnmi as in guam.in short,if a law imposes an excise tax to support social security,the law not just that part of the law imposing an excise tax applies in the cnmi as in guam because fica imposes an excise tax,it applies in the cnmi as in guam.and because fica subjects employees in guam
