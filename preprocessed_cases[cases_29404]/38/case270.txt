lisa gayle retained a law firm to represent her as she sought to preserve her disability benefits.for nearly seven months,the firm did nothing to press her claim.by the time it rediscovered her case,gayle opportunity to appeal the denial of her disability benefits claim had expired.under the terms of her employee welfare benefit plan,gayle could not pursue her claim in federal court until she had exhausted the internal appeals process.but the plan declined to consider her appeal since it was almost two months late.in this case,we consider whether attorney negligence justifies equitable tolling sufficient to excuse the lack of compliance with the plan appeal procedure.we conclude that it does not.
lisa gayle had been employed by united parcel service ups for years before she suffered health problems serious enough to require her to stop working in march.she was a participant in the flexible benefits plan plan,which is by ups and is an employee welfare benefit plan governed by erisa,et.the plan is administered by the ups claims review committee committee.claims are processed by a claims administrator.
gayle received disability benefits for six months,and disability benefits from september until january.at that point,she received a letter informing her that a review of her medical documentation showed she was no longer eligible for disability benefits.
in bold print,the letter also stated that i f you disagree with this determination,you must submit an appeal within one hundred eighty days from your receipt of this letter.this internal appeal requirement was consistent with the appeal process described in the summary plan description spd.erisa and federal regulations also mandate that each welfare benefit plan include such internal review.see employee benefit plans shall afford a reasonable opportunity for a full and fair review of a denial of benefits.
the spd states that upon the denial of benefits,plan participants may file a first level appeal with claims administrators within days of receiving the denial.if this appeal is unsuccessful,a second level appeal is available.it should be filed with the committee within days of receiving the denial of the first level appeal.the spd notes that e ach level of appeal will be independent from the previous level,the same person s involved in a prior level of appeal will not be involved in the appeal and that o n each level of appeal,the claims reviewer will review relevant information that you submit even if it is new information.particularly important for this case,the spd also states you can not file suit in federal court until you have exhausted these appeals procedures.
gayle denial letter arrived on january.six weeks later,on march,she retained the columbia,south carolina,law firm of suggs kelly to assist her in navigating the appeal process.ordinary practice at suggs kelly is to take in an erisa case like gayle,and then send it to an attorney at the foster law firm in greenville,south carolina.suggs kelly either mistakenly thought it had appealed gayle case the reason suggested to the plan or,through an administrative oversight,thought that the file had been sent to the foster law firm when,in reality,it had not the reason provided on appeal.whatever the reason,the attorney handling the appeal pending before we emphasize was in no way responsible for the that gayle case simply fell through the cracks.
the claims ultimately the committee to make an exception to their rules for gayle.instead,they adhered to their interpretation of the plan timeliness requirements,and refused consideration of her internal appeal when she sought review on september.they pointed out that gayle request for an appeal was due no later than july.gayle then brought suit in the district of south carolina under erisa,a b.she asked the court to remand the claim to the plan,requiring it to consider the merits of her appeal.the district court dismissed the motion to remand with prejudice and dismissed the underlying erisa claim without prejudice.
we review grants of summary judgment de novo,bailey blue cross blue shield,cir.for the reasons that follow,we affirm the judgment.
gayle distinguishes between the two levels of appeal provided under the plan terms.she acknowledges that her first level appeal was untimely,but argues that the court can remand her claim to the plan under the doctrine of equitable tolling.she believes that tolling should be available in erisa claims,and that her attorney negligence and her own innocence justifies tolling here.
an erisa welfare benefit plan participant must both pursue and exhaust plan remedies before gaining access to the federal courts.makar health care,cir exhaustion of plan remedies is a prerequisite to an erisa action for denial of benefits.the federal regulation governing such appeal procedures authorize limited periods for claimants to file requests for review of denied claims.see h.courts enforce these limits because 
h aphazard waiver of time limits would increase the probability of inconsistent results where one claimant is held to the limitation,and another is not.similarly,permitting appeals well after the time for them has passed can only increase the cost and time of the settlement process.
terry bayer,cir.in short,internal appeal limitations periods in erisa plans are to be followed just as ordinary statutes of limitations.likewise,f ailure to file a request for review within a plan limitations period is one means by which a claimant may fail to exhaust her administrative remedies.gallegos sinai med,cir.gayle therefore acknowledges that the exhaustion rule applies to her,at least with respect to her first level appeal.
if available,however,equitable tolling would restore a claimant right to review even though she otherwise would be.but f ederal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly.irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.the rarity of our resort to equity does not spring from miserliness.rather,equitable tolling must be guarded and infrequent,lest circumstances of individualized hardship supplant the rules of clearly drafted statutes.harris hutchinson,cir.
equitable tolling,while rare,does allow for exceptions to the strict enforcement of deadlines.such exceptions are narrow,and none is available here.equitable tolling has been permitted where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the limitations period.irwin,at.in this case,however,gayle made no appeal to the plan,defective or otherwise,within the authorized period.equitable tolling has also been appropriate where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.id.but the plan sent gayle a detailed denial letter.she does not dispute receiving it,or from tricking her into was anything short of clear on the simple procedures she should follow should she disagree with the denial of benefits.
gayle therefore fits none of the established justifications for equitable tolling.she instead argues that equitable tolling is warranted here because she was innocent and had acted to protect her rights by retaining an attorney.the attorney negligence alone caused her appeal to become untimely.gayle argument boils down to a request that we relieve her of her counsel negligent failure to observe required procedure.however,the supreme court and our own case law have already rejected such a distinction between the conduct of attorneys and their clients.indeed,the supreme court has held that there is 
no merit to the contention that dismissal of petitioner claim because of his counsel unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client.petitioner voluntarily chose this attorney as his representative in the action,and he can not now avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent.any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation,in which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his
