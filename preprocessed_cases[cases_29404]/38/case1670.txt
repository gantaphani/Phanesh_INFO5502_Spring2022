introduction 
this case turns on our interpretation of the term disability allowance as used in government code section,part of the county employees retirement law of,government code section et.cerl.all further statutory references are to the government code unless noted.the disputed portion of section states no provision of this chapter shall be construed to authorize any member,credited with service in more than one entity and who is eligible for a disability allowance,whether service connected or nonservice connected to receive an amount from one county that,when combined with any amount from other counties or the public employees retirement system,results in a disability allowance greater than the amount the member would have received had all the member service been with only one entity.italics added.
based on the language of section,the statutory scheme,principles of statutory interpretation,and legislative history,we hold the term disability allowance means all benefits a member receives from reciprocal systems or from the california public employees retirement system calpers for retiring concurrently due to disability,regardless whether those benefits are labeled disability retirement or service retirement.accordingly,the decision of the orange county employees retirement system ocers board of retirement was correct,and we reverse the judgment of the trial court.
ocers is a defined benefit,public employee retirement trust that provides retirement,health,death,and disability benefits to retired employees of orange county and other public employers within the county.cerl governs the rights and obligations of ocers and its members.
toby block was employed by the buena park fire department from january until october.his last assignment was as a fire captain.as an employee of the buena park fire department,block was a member of calpers.
on october,the buena park fire department merged with the orange county fire authority.block worked as a fire captain with the orange county fire authority from october,to march.as an employee of the orange county fire authority,block was a member of ocers.
in december,block applied for a disability retirement from ocers.block concurrently applied for service retirement benefits from calpers.on july,ocers board of retirement approved block application for disability retirement benefits with an effective date of may.calpers approved block application for regular service retirement benefits also with an effective date of may.
because block retired concurrently from ocers and calpers,section permitted him to use his highest average salary under either retirement system to calculate his retirement benefits under both systems block final average monthly compensation,which he earned while a member of ocers,was.from calpers,block received as a retirement benefit percent of his highest average monthly compensation which calpers deemed to be,which amounted to x.block disability retirement benefit from ocers was equal to percent of his final compensation,which would be x,subject to applicable limitations and caps.combined,block calpers monthly benefit and ocers monthly benefit would be,which is percent of his final average monthly compensation of.
administrative proceedings 
relying on section,ocers reduced block disability retirement benefits pro rata so that his total retirement benefit would not be greater than what he would have received had his employment been with just one entity block disputed the reduction and requested an administrative hearing.after a hearing,the administrative referee concluded ocers was not authorized under section to reduce block retirement benefit and recommended his annual retirement benefits from ocers be equal to percent of his final compensation.
the ocers board of retirement declined to adopt the referee recommendation and opted to review the matter de novo based on the evidence presented to the referee.the board conducted its review and on august,issued a final decision concluding ocers has appropriately applied the pro rata reduction to block retirement benefit in accordance with.
the board found was clearly intended by the california legislature and the governor who signed the legislation to eliminate the possibility that an employee receiving benefits under the county employees retirement system of could be eligible for more than of salary upon retirement because of successive coverage in more than one public retirement system.the concept of reciprocity is critical to this case.essentially,reciprocity allows a member who has transferred to be treated as though he had always been in the same retirement system.block was a reciprocal member of ocers based upon his prior service with calpers the result of this reciprocity is that block is treated as though he were a member of ocers for his entire career in the fire service even though he actually moved between two fire service agencies and two pension systems.he changed the patches on his uniform sleeve,but his pension benefit remained in singularity.he is credited with one period of years of career service resulting in a public pension benefit paid to block with a check from each of the two pension systems that are tied together due to the concept of reciprocity this allowed block to move between two pension systems without any loss of benefits.applies to a member receiving a pension benefit from two or more systems when one of the systems has determined that the member is eligible for a disability allowance,whether or connected.links the or connected disability allowance from one system with the words any amount of a pension benefit from the other system.ocers correctly interpreted and applied to this case.any other interpretation is creative wordsmithing and leads to a result that treats two members of ocers differently the minimum level is financial protection for a worker injured in the line of duty.it is not an additional allowance that block feels he is entitled to.regardless of what the referee thought in her opinion,the action by the legislature in enacting and amending was clearly intended to address a public policy issue where a member receives combined pension benefits in excess of his final compensation.the maximum amount of final compensation allowed to a member of ocers is per the applicable government code sections had block been in one system for the years of fire service,the maximum monthly benefit he could have received would have been.
finally,the board found block would receive about of pay as a combined retirement benefit if it ruled in his favor.the board concluded,t his is an absurd result and defies common sense.
proceedings in the superior court 
block challenged the board decision by filing a petition for peremptory writ of mandate under code of civil procedure section.after briefing,the superior court heard the matter in october and november.on november,the superior court entered a minute order granting the petition and concluding that section,according to the usual,ordinary import of the language used,did not authorize a reduction in block disability retirement benefits.the court reasoned had the legislature wanted this statute to guarantee that the total retirement benefit disability,service,etc.would not be more than what block would have earned had he stayed with any given,then it could have easily stated,for example,no retiree shall receive a sum that results in a total retirement benefit greater than the amount the member would have received had all the member service been with only one entity.but the legislature instead stated,no member shall receive an amount that results in a disability allowance greater than the amount the member would have received had all the member service been with only one entity.second ellipsis added.
the superior court stated that a ruling in block favor reaches a counter intuitive and,one could argue,an absurd practical result,that captain block receives a combined of his total employment compensation.the court believed,however,that result is compelled by the fact that the california legislature has not passed a statute that a person in block position is not entitled to both his full service pension and his full disability pension.
ocers timely appealed from the judgment in block favor entered on january.
discussion 
issue what is the meaning of the term disability allowance as used in section 
the portion of section in dispute provides no provision of this chapter shall be construed to authorize any member,credited with service in more than one entity and who is eligible for a disability allowance,whether service connected or nonservice connected to receive an amount from one county that,when combined with any amount from other counties or the public employees retirement system,results in a disability allowance greater than the amount the member would have received had all the member service been with only one entity.italics added.
both parties agree the words an amount,as used in this case,refer to the amount of block disability benefit from ocers,the words any amount refer to the amount of block retirement benefit from calpers,and the words the amount refer to the amount block would receive for retiring due to disability if all his years of service had been with a single public entity with a retirement system subject to cerl.the issue is the meaning of the term disability allowance.
block argues,and the superior court concluded,the term disability allowance in section does not include his service retirement from calpers awarded concurrently with his disability from ocers.thus,block argues,the amount he receives from ocers in disability retirement,when combined with the service retirement he receives from calpers,would not produce a disability allowance greater than the amount he would have received if all of his service had been with one entity.
ocers argues the term disability allowance in section must refer to all amounts,whether labeled disability retirement or service retirement,the member receives when the member retires due to disability.block disability retirement from ocers,combined with his service retirement from calpers,equals over percent of block final than the amount he would have received had his service been with one entity.thus,ocers argues,section permits it to reduce block disability retirement allowance pro rata.
principles of statutory construction 
we begin by laying out the applicable principles of statutory construction.the goal of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.citation.ordinarily,the words of the statute provide the most reliable indication of legislative intent.citation.when the statutory language is ambiguous,the court may examine the context in which the language appears,adopting the construction that best harmonizes the statute internally and with related statutes.citations.both the legislative history of the statute and the wider historical circumstances of its enactment may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent.citation.pacific gas electric county of stanislaus cal th,d.
ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of pension legislation must be resolved in favor of the pensioner,but such interpretation must be consistent with the statute language and purpose.lear board of retirement th,d.
cerl reciprocity provisions,related cerl provisions,and section legislative history 
the words of section standing alone are neither clear nor unambiguous,and shed little light on the legislature intent.indeed,section,as part of a greater statutory scheme,makes sense only when construed in context as part of that scheme.accordingly,in subpart a we discuss the cerl reciprocity provisions,in subpart b we discuss related cerl provisions,and in subpart c,we discuss section legislative history.in part iv,we analyze section language in light of this discussion to resolve the issue presented.
cerl reciprocity provisions 
cerl reciprocity provisions,article of chapter,part,division,title of the government code,provide for certain reciprocal retirement benefits when a person formerly employed by one reciprocal public entity retires from another reciprocal public entity.section states the provisions of this article are intended to encourage career public service by granting reciprocal retirement benefits to members who are entitled to retirement rights or benefits from two or more retirement systems established under this chapter or from a retirement system established under this chapter and the public employees retirement system,the state teachers retirement system,or a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with the public employees retirement system subject to the conditions of section,and to delineate the financial obligations of each system and related political entity so that no system or political entity shall be liable for more than its just financial obligation.
a member establishes reciprocity by leaving employment and deferring retirement from one public entity and within the applicable time period,becoming a member of a calpers,b another retirement system governed by the cerl in another county,c california state teachers retirement system,or d a retirement system of any other public agency of the state that has established reciprocity with calpers.
section provides that a member who defers retirement from a prior employer in a retirement system subject to cerl,and who establishes reciprocity,may be retired for disability,regardless of age or length of service,and receive a disability retirement allowance under this article based on the service credited to him at the time of retirement during any period thereafter in which he receives a disability retirement allowance under calpers or a retirement system established under this chapter in another county.when the disability is,the allowance shall be an annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the member accumulated contributions,subd.
reciprocity under government code,title,division,part,chapter,article eliminates the adverse consequences a member might otherwise suffer when moving from one retirement system to another.for example,section provides that the member age at entry into a reciprocal retirement system is the member age of entry into the first reciprocal retirement system.thus,section permitted block to have his ocers contributions based on his younger age when he entered calpers.under cerl,members with a younger age of entry pay less in member contributions to the retirement system than members with an older age of entry.
another example is section,which permits a member to use his or her highest compensation while a member of any reciprocal retirement system for computing the member retirement allowance from both retirement systems.section states,in relevant part the average compensation during any period of service as a member of any reciprocal retirement system shall be considered compensation earnable by a member for purposes of computing final compensation for that member from both systems.to take advantage of section,the member must retire concurrently under both systems and be credited with the period of service under that other system at the time of retirement,subd.
in a similar vein,section provides that a member service,for purposes of qualification for payment of benefits and retirement allowances,includes service as a state employee or as an employee of another county with a retirement system governed by cerl,if the compensation for such service qualifies under section.
a purpose and an effect of these reciprocity provisions are to treat a member retiring concurrently from reciprocal retirement systems as having been employed by a single employer and having been a member of a single retirement system for the member entire career,for purposes of calculating retirement benefits.as applied here,reciprocity means block would be treated as having served his entire career as an employee of the orange county fire authority,even though he served the first years of his career with the buena park fire department.
related cerl provisions 
the cerl reciprocity provisions do not set forth the formulas for calculating the dollar amount a member may receive as a disability or retirement allowance.those are contained in articles and of chapter,part,division,title of the government code.
pertinent here is section,which sets forth the amount a member may receive in disability.section reads,in relevant part upon retirement of any member for disability,he shall receive an annual retirement allowance payable in monthly installments,equal to of his final compensation.notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,any member upon retirement for disability shall receive a current service pension or a current service pension combined with a prior service pension purchased by the contributions of the county or district sufficient which when added to the service retirement annuity will equal of his final compensation,or,if qualified for a service retirement,he shall receive his service retirement allowance if such allowance is greater but in no event shall it exceed the limitation as set forth in section as it now reads or may hereafter be amended to read.
section does not use the term disability allowance,but states that u pon retirement of any member for disability,the member shall receive an annual retirement allowance.the retirement allowance may be an amount equal to of the member final compensation,or,if the member qualifies,the amount the member would receive as a service retirement allowance,whichever amount is greater.
the term disability allowance is found in section,concerning disability retirement.section provides,in relevant part upon retirement for disability,in lieu of any other allowance,a member who has five years or more credited service shall receive a disability allowance equal to the percentage of final compensation set forth in the following table 
section includes the formulas for calculating the amount of service retirement allowance for safety members,such as block.both sections and expressly incorporate the limitation set forth in section,which caps the total amount a member may receive in service retirement at the amount of the member final compensation.section states,in part i n no event shall the total retirement allowance exceed the member final compensation.neither section nor section uses the term disability allowance,rather,both refer to the member retirement allowance.
significant too,the provisions regarding the amount of retirement allowance distinguish between the service retirement annuity,the current service pension,and the prior service pension.the service retirement annuity is an annuity based on the member contributions.the current service pension and the prior service pension are pensions purchased with the employer contributions.none of these provisions uses the term disability allowance.
in a petition for rehearing,block for the first time cites to section,which he argues demonstrates the legislature recognition that disability pensions and service pensions are separate and distinct.subdivision a of section permits a member to apply for a service retirement allowance pending determination of the member entitlement to disability retirement.subdivision b of section states,in part this section shall not be construed to authorize a member to receive more than one type of retirement allowance for the same period of time nor to entitle any beneficiary to receive benefits which the beneficiary would not otherwise have been entitled to receive under the type of retirement which the member is finally determined to have been entitled.section permitted block to receive a service retirement allowance from ocers pending its determination of his entitlement to disability allowance.
section does recognize tacitly,if not expressly,that service retirement and disability retirement are different.but the issue in this case is the meaning of the term disability allowance in section.section does not use the term disability allowance or shed any light on what that term means in section.section therefore does not assist us in analyzing the meaning of the term disability allowance.
section legislative history 
former section stats,ch,was enacted in response to a concern that members with reciprocal benefits under cerl could receive more in disability than a member could receive in disability.a september legislative analyst report stated historically,persons retiring because of disabilities have been given special consideration due to the fact that their disability was job related.consequently,rewarding disabilities more than disabilities is contrary to retirement principles.moreover,allowing some but not all retirees to multiply benefits is costly and provides a windfall to a select group of persons.we recommend that a new section be added to the government code prohibiting reciprocal retirement allowances from being greater than what would have been received if the employee had remained in one system.legis.analyst,review of retirement systems established under the county employees retirement law of,pursuant to conc.res.reg.sess.
senate bill reg.sess.was introduced in response to that recommendation.assem.com.on public employees retirement,analysis of bill reg.sess.as amended may.senate bill stated purpose was to add restrictive language to preclude multiple disability retirements from the cerl.com.on public employment retirement,analysis of bill reg.sess.may.
the assembly committee analysis explained the purpose of reciprocity is to permit movement of employees from public employer to public employer without impairment of retirement rights.reciprocity protects the individual retirement system by avoiding the transfer of financial liabilities and by relying upon the exchange of information between the systems at the time of movement of the employee and at the time of retirement.it is understood that the intent of sb is to preclude the payment,under the cerl,of multiple disability retirement allowances,in instances in which a member had served a qualifying number of years in more than one retirement system.assem.com.on public employees retirement,analysis of bill,supra,as amended may.the analysis concluded that senate bill reg.sess.would provide that a cerl county member who is eligible for any benefit pursuant to section of the cerl could not receive a disability allowance from one cerl county that,when combined with any amount from other counties or the cal pers,would result in a pension greater than the amount the member would have received had all the member service been with one county only.assem.com.on public employees retirement,analysis of bill,supra.
the legislative counsel digest of senate bill reg.sess.explained as follows the cerl authorizes members who are entitled to rights and benefits from two or more retirement systems to receive,among other things,disability benefits based upon service in all systems.this bill would specify that no provision of that law shall be construed to authorize such a member to receive a combined disability pension in excess of what would have been received if all of the member service was with only one county.
senate bill reg.sess,enacted in stats,ch,and codified as former section,provided no provision of this chapter shall be construed to authorize any member,credited with service in more than one entity and who is eligible for a nonservice connected disability allowance,to receive an amount from one county that,when combined with any amount from other counties or the public employees retirement system,results in a pension greater than the amount the member would have received if all the member service has been with only one entity.each entity shall calculate its respective obligations based upon the member service with that entity and each shall adjust its payment on a pro rata basis.italics added.
the first paragraph of former section differed in two ways from the first paragraph of current section stats,ch.first,former section referred only to a member eligible for disability allowance,while current section refers to both and disability allowance.second,former section used the word pension,while current section replaced the word pension with the term disability allowance.
the changes to former section resulted from senate bill reg.sess,introduced in by state senator speraw and sponsored by the los angeles county board of supervisors a report by the assembly committee on public employees and retirement explained the genesis of senate bill sb was the result of a study of the legislative analyst,which concluded that due to reciprocity it was possible for a member serving in more than one retirement system,to qualify for several related benefits.in such instances,the total amount received by the member could exceed the final compensation earned by the injured individual.los angeles county,the sponsor of sb,states that instances have occurred where a county employee,retired for a job connected disability under cal pers,has come to work for a cerl county,and has applied for,and had received,a job connected disability under a county system.in such cases,the combined disability allowances could exceed of salary.sb would subject job related disability allowances to the same restrictions as placed on related allowances by sb.assem.com.on public employees retirement,on bill reg.sess.as amended may.
the legislative counsel digest of senate bill reg.sess.stated the cerl authorizes members who are entitled to rights and benefits from two or more retirement systems to receive,among other things,disability benefits based upon service in all systems,and specifies that no provision of that law shall be construed to authorize such a member to receive a combined disability pension in excess of what would have been received if all of the member service has been with only one entity.this bill would also apply this limitation to disability allowances payable to members who,after being employed with another county or an entity within the public employees retirement system,become employed by a second public entity on or after january,and make technical changes.legis.counsel,bill reg.sess.as amended may,original italics.

analysis of section language in light of the cerl reciprocity provisions,related cerl provisions,and section legislative history 
analysis of section language in light of the cerl reciprocity provisions,related cerl provisions,and section legislative history leads us to conclude the term disability allowance in section refers to all amounts the member receives in reciprocal benefits when retiring due to disability,regardless whether those amounts are labeled disability retirement or service retirement.
the term disability allowance is used twice in section first in referring to a member who is eligible for a disability allowance and second in stating the amount the retiring member receives must not result in a disability allowance greater than the amount the member would have received had all the member service been with only one entity.
the term disability allowance is not defined in the cerl.see,tit,div,pt,ch,et the cerl general provisions,including definitions.as explained ante,it does not appear in section,which states a member retiring for disability receives an annual retirement allowance equal to half the member final compensation,or,if qualified,a service retirement allowance.the term disability allowance does appear in section,which provides that a member with five years or more of service and who is retiring for disability,may,instead of any other allowance provided,receive a disability allowance determined according to a table included in the statute 
this distinction between sections and is important to understanding the meaning of disability allowance in section.as initially enacted,former section applied only to disability.it read no provision of this chapter shall be construed to authorize any member,credited with service in more than one entity and who is eligible for a nonservice connected disability allowance,to receive an amount from one county that,when combined with any amount from other counties or the public employees retirement system,results in a pension greater than the amount the member would have received if all the member service has been with only one entity.stats,ch,italics added.the term nonservice connected disability allowance must have referred back to section because a member retiring for disability with at least five years of service is eligible for a disability allowance pursuant to that section.
as explained ante,former section was amended in so that it would apply to as well as to disability retirement.the amendment was accomplished by deleting nonservice connected from the phrase nonservice connected disability allowance and thereafter inserting the phrase whether service connected or nonservice connected.however,in making this amendment,the legislature did not change the term disability allowance.
but a member retiring for disability is not eligible for a disability allowance instead,under section,such member is eligible for an annual retirement allowance or service retirement.section applies both to and disability retirement,so it makes sense for the term disability allowance,itself inapplicable to disability,to refer to section when the disability retirement is.when the member retires for disability,the term disability allowance in section thus refers to the benefit the member would receive under section of the member final compensation,or service retirement.
the term disability allowance should be accorded the same or equivalent meaning the second time it is used in section.when used the second time in section,disability allowance means the amount of retirement benefit the member would receive from a reciprocal cerl retirement system or from calpers when the member concurrently retires due to disability.for disability from a reciprocal cerl system,that amount under section could be half of the member final compensation or service retirement,or the amount paid under the reciprocal retirement system.disability allowance under section therefore can include the amount of service retirement a member might receive when retiring due to disability.
under calpers,a member retiring for disability concurrently with retiring from an employer with a reciprocal cerl system may receive service retirement.part of a calpers information brochure,entitled reciprocal benefits requirements,informs the calpers member i f you are eligible for disability retirement from your other system,you may also be entitled to calpers disability retirement benefits,if you retire from both systems on the same date.the brochure explains that calpers will pay an amount that does not exceed the difference between what you are going to receive from the other system and what you would receive if all your calpers service were also credited with that system if you retire from your other system because of a disability,calpers will pay an annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of
