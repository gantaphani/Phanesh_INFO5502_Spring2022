on may,salazar went to see ryan again about her broken arm when she perfectly well knows.id.at.it was his impression that she is almost using her arm to shield her from any judge and so on.id.
salazar missed her october,appointment with a physician retained by the social security administration ssa to conduct a consultative psychiatric examination.salazar later said that she missed the appointment because she was out of it and very depressed and suicidal.id.at.

following the initial denial of her application for ssi benefits,salazar filed for reconsideration on december,complaining of problems with her broken arm and adding that she was being treated for mental problems by a physician,robert franklin.
on july,the ssa psychological reviewer declined to complete a psychiatric review technique form,stating that because salazar failed to attend the consultative psychiatric examination in october,there was insufficient evidence to determine whether she had a mental disorder.
the final medical record concerns the period of january through february,when salazar was hospitalized at the las vegas medical center for depression.it appears that she brought some,but not all,of the records from this hospitalization and her treatment with franklin to the hearing.
sequential evaluation 
in determining disability,the commissioner generally uses a sequential evaluation process.see williams bowen,cir.here,the alj followed the process and found that salazar met steps one and two.at step three,the alj found that she had an impairment that met one of the commissioner listed impairments mood disorder under listing,but that this impairment was secondary to chronic polysubstance abuse and that without the effects of drug and alcohol abuse,she would not be disabled,vol.ii,at.at step four,the alj concluded that if she stopped the abuse of drugs and alcohol,she would recover to a condition of only minimal limitation,and thus retained the residual functional capacity rfc for light exertional work and could perform her past relevant work.id.at.accordingly,the alj concluded that salazar was not disabled.
standard of review 
we review the alj decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.hamlin barnhart,cir quotation omitted.b ecause our review is based on the record taken as a whole,we will meticulously examine the record in order to determine if the evidence supporting the agency decision is substantial,but we neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our discretion for that of the commissioner.id.quotation and brackets omitted.
substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.however,a decision is not based on substantial evidence if it is overwhelmed by other evidence in the record or if there is a mere scintilla of evidence supporting it.id.quotation and brackets omitted.
borderline personality disorder 
salazar argues,and we agree,that the alj misapplied the law when he failed to consider her borderline personality disorder in his disability determination.it is beyond dispute that an alj is required to consider all of the claimant medically determinable impairments,singly and in combination the statute and regulations require nothing less.see,d b a.further,the failure to consider all of the impairments is reversible error.langley barnhart,cir.
the commissioner argues that the alj did not need to consider salazar borderline personality disorder because the references in the record to this condition are minimal and not the result of thorough examinations.aplee.br.at.to the contrary,the opinions of the psychiatrist,julie walker,and the psychologist,john lang,both of whom diagnosed salazar with a personality disorder,are the most thorough examinations in the record.also,the references to this disorder are not minimal instead,they appear repeatedly and consistently throughout the record,and include the reports from several emergency room physicians and counselors,as noted above.
alternatively,the commissioner asserts that the alj did in fact consider this impairment because he stated that he considered all the evidence of record.id.at.this assertion is untenable.indeed,personality disorders are set forth separately in the listing of impairments,pt,subpt,app.i,listing.the alj never mentions this listing in his decision.
what is particularly troublesome about the alj failure to consider salazar borderline personality disorder is that it may account for her abuse of drugs and alcohol,as well as her suicidal conduct and.borderline personality disorder is marked by at least five of the following symptoms 
i mpulsiveness in,inter alia,substance abuse instability of mood,interpersonal relationships and sieges o
