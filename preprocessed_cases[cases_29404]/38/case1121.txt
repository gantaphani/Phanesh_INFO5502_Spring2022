the petitioner filed for supplemental security income ssi benefits for her daughter yvonne,claiming yvonne was disabled.yvonne suffers from sickle cell disease,as a result of which she occasionally suffers crises,which are 
painful episode s in the life of a person affected with sickle cell anemia.they occur when the sickle cells red blood cells form masses that obstruct the flow of blood to various parts of the body.the limbs and joints are the most commonly affected parts,but the central nervous system,the lungs,and the abdomen may also be involved.
schmidt,attorney dictionary of medicine and word finder.an administrative law judge alj with the social security administration ssa rejected yvonne application.in re shinn ex rel.shinn,shinn i.a federal district court,acting pursuant to a magistrate judge recommendation,affirmed the alj ruling.we vacate the district court ruling and direct the court to remand this case to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
part i explains the rather byzantine law governing determinations of disability in young children.part ii sets forth the procedural history of this case and the proper standard of review.part iii explains our rationale for vacating.
federal regulations set forth the process by which the ssa determines if a child is disabled and thereby eligible for disability benefits.see a c i setting forth the definition of disabled for children under same.the process begins with the alj determining whether the child is doing substantial gainful activity,in which case she is considered not disabled and is ineligible for benefits.a,b.
the next step is for the alj to consider the child physical or mental impairment s to determine if she has an impairment or combination of impairments that is severe.id.a,c.a disability counts as an impairment only if it arises from anatomical,physiological,or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.id.consequently,the determination as to whether someone has an impairment at all is primarily based on medical evidence.id.a the alj need s evidence from acceptable medical sources to establish whether you have a medically determinable impairment s.in contrast,evidence,including the testimony of e ducational personnel and parents and other caregivers,siblings,other relatives,friends,neighbors,and clergy,may be used to demonstrate that a child impairment is severe.id.d,a a.
for an applicant with a severe impairment,the alj next assesses whether the impairment causes marked and severe functional limitations for the child.b,d.limitations arising from pain count in this determination.id.a the alj will also evaluate any limitations in your functioning that result from your symptoms,including pain.parenthetical omitted see also id.a b y our symptoms such as pain may limit your functioning.
this determination is made according to objective criteria set forth in the code of federal regulations.the contains a listing of impairments the listings,found at app.specifying almost every sort of medical problem impairment from which a person can suffer,sorted into general categories.see id.a.for each impairment,the listings discuss various limitations on a person abilities that impairment may impose.limitations appearing in these listings are considered marked and severe.id.the listing of impairments describes impairments for a child that cause marked and severe functional limitations.
a child impairment is recognized as causing marked and severe functional limitations if those limitations meet,medically equal,or functionally equal the l istings.id.b see also,a.a child limitations meet the limitations in the listings if the child actually suffers from the limitations specified in the listings for that child severe impairment.a child limitations medically equal the limitations in the listings if the child limitations are at least of equal medical significance to those of a listed impairment.id.a.
finally,even if the limitations resulting from a child particular impairment are not comparable to those specified in the listings,the alj can still conclude that those limitations are functionally equivalent to those in the listings.in making this determination,the alj assesses the degree to which the child limitations interfere with the child normal life activities.the specifies six major domains of life 
i acquiring and using information 
ii attending and completing tasks 
iii interacting and relating with others 
iv moving about and manipulating objects 
v caring for one self and 
vi health and physical.
id.a b.the contains various benchmarks that children should have achieved by certain ages in each of these life domains.see id.a g l.a child impairment is of severity,and so functionally equals the listings,if as a result of the limitations stemming from that impairment the child has marked limitations in two of the domains above,or an extreme limitation in one domain.id.a d see also id.a.
assuming that the limitations stemming from a child severe impairment meet,medically equal,or functionally equal the limitations specified in the listings,the alj concludes by ensuring that the impairment meets the duration requirement specified in the federal regulations.id.a.this duration requirement is that the impairment must be expected to cause death or has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.see also id.
having explained the applicable regulatory regime,we will now delve into the procedural history of this case in greater depth.
yvonne application for ssi was initially rejected by the ssa,which declined to reconsider its decision.she then requested and received a hearing from an alj,who issued a written opinion rejecting her application.the alj found that yvonne had not been,and was not then,engaged in substantial gainful activity.shinn i,at the claimant,age,obviously,has never worked.he also found that she has a severe impairment based on her sickle cell disease,which causes more than minimal functional limitations.id.at.the alj ruled,however,that the limitations on yvonne activities arising from this impairment did not meet or medically equal or functionally equal any of the limitations specified in the listings for sickle cell disease,at.
section of the listings specifies the limitations that an individual with sickle cell disease may have which count as marked and severe.these include 
recent,recurrent,severe crises musculoskeletal,vertebral,abdominal or 
b.a major visceral complication in the months prior to application for ssi benefits or 
c.a hyperhemolytic or aplastic crisis within months prior to application or 
chronic,severe anemia with persistence of hematocrit of percent or less or 
congestive heart failure,damage,or emotional disorder as described under the criteria in other sections of the.
yvonne presented two types of evidence to demonstrate that she suffered from the limitation described in listing a,r ecent,recurrent,severe crises.first,she offered the testimony of her mother as to the pain yvonne felt and the apparent crises she suffered.second,she put forth medical evidence,including her history of hospitalization and statements of her physician.
without offering any explanation,the alj failed to consider any of the testimony offered by yvonne mother in deciding whether yvonne suffered from such crises,and instead focused exclusively on yvonne medical evidence.he wrote,
wall yvonne physician,in her statement of january,noted that there was a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the child could have one of these limitations specified in a happen.however,this statement has little bearing on this decision as we can not make a finding of disability based on what could happen,only what has happened.
shinn i,at.consequently,the alj found that yvonne failed to introduce sufficient evidence to prove that she suffered from either recent,recurrent,and severe crises,or any other limitation specified in the listings for sickle cell disease.id.he therefore concluded that the limitations stemming from yvonne sickle cell disease did not meet,and were not the medical equivalent of,any limitations specified in the listings.id.
the alj then turned to whether her limitations were the functional equivalent of those specified in the listings by assessing whether she had marked or severe limitations in one or more major life domains.for three of these and using information,interacting and relating with others,and caring for one alj found that t here is no evidence or allegation that the child has any limitation of function.id.at.the alj found that yvonne sometimes suffers briefly from limitations in two other and completing tasks,and moving about and manipulating her crises,but because these episodes are short and somewhat infrequent,these inconveniences did not rise to the level of being marked or severe limitations.id.
regarding the final life domain,health and physical,the alj made the following assessments 
the evidence establishes that the claimant has a chronic condition with episodic crises.between february and september,she was hospitalized on four occasions for such a crisis.these hospitalizations lasted only a few days,after which she was described as doing well.during that time period,she went as long as a year between severe crises and has had none requiring hospitalization since.her parents testified that she has had other crises,less severe,that did not require hospitalizations.this is certainly credible,but fails to demonstrate more than a moderate limitation of function in this domain.her crises have been characterized by complaints of pain in the abdomen primarily and sometimes associated with a fever.she quickly responds to treatment.her mother also testified that the last severe crisis was in and that she has gradually gotten better.certainly she will require close ongoing medical treatment,but this treatment does not impose limitations on her ability to function.
shinn i,at.because yvonne did not have marked limitations in any of the major life domains,her limitations were not functionally equivalent to those specified in the listings,and so she was not disabled or entitled to ssi benefits.the final requirement for receiving benefits,duration of impairment,is not an issue in this case because yvonne has suffered from sickle cell disease her entire life.
yvonne appealed to the ssa appeals council the issue of whether the limitations on her activities arising from her severe impairment sickle cell disease meet,are medically equivalent to,or are functionally equivalent to the limitations specified in the listings for sickle cell disease.the ssa appeals council affirmed the alj ruling without a separate written opinion consequently,the alj ruling must be considered the final decision of the commissioner of the ssa.doughty apfel,cir.
yvonne then appealed her denial of ssi benefits to the united states district court for the middle district of florida.a magistrate judge issued a report recommending that the district court affirm the alj decision.shinn ex rel.shinn comm r of soc.may,shinn ii.the magistrate judge recognized that his review of the alj determination had to be somewhat deferential he was required to affirm if the decision was supported by substantial evidence,g,defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d quotation marks omitted.
the magistrate judge began by agreeing with the alj implicit and unexplained decision to base his determination of whether yvonne met the listings exclusively on medical evidence,without taking into account the testimony of her mother.he elaborated that the testimony of yvonne mother about the pain from which yvonne suffered was irrelevant in deciding whether yvonne suffered from recent,recurrent,severe crises.the magistrate judge explained,
in order to meet a listing,plaintiff must show that she has a diagnosed condition and provide objective medical reports documenting that this condition meets the specific criteria of the applicable listing and the duration requirement.the testimony of a parent is not an objective medical report documenting the severity of a condition.
shinn ii,at citation omitted.
focusing exclusively on the sufficiency of the medical evidence,the magistrate judge held 
there is substantial evidence in the record to support the alj conclusion that plaintiff disease was not of listing severity.while plaintiff was briefly hospitalized four times,the medical records reflect a short course of conservative treatment,with no transfusions,complications or intensive care admissions.plaintiff immediately responded to treatment and was discharged in stable condition and doing well.
shinn ii,at.the magistrate judge noted that while one of yvonne doctors said her condition could result in severe crises the alj correctly noted that disability can not be based on what can happen,but on what has happened.id.at emphasis in original.
due to the insufficiency of the medical evidence in itself,the magistrate judge concluded that there was substantial evidence supporting the alj ruling that yvonne limitations were not marked and severe because they did not meet or medically equal those specified in the listings for her impairment.he reinforced this conclusion by pointing out that two state agency doctors reviewed the medical evidence and opined that plaintiff disease did not meet or equal the listings.shinn ii,at.consequently,he agreed that yvonne was ineligible for ssi benefits.the magistrate judge never reviewed the alj conclusion that yvonne limitations were not functionally equivalent to the limitations specified in the listings,or the alj underlying analysis of yvonne functioning in the six life domains specified in the 
the district court reviewed the file de novo and concur red with the magistrate judge finding that the commissioner decision was supported by substantial competent evidence shinn ex rel.shinn comm r of soc,july,order.yvonne now appeals this decision.we consider this appeal essentially as if we were the district court,reviewing the alj ruling rather than the district court judgment.see phillips barnhart,cir our review in a social security case is the same as that of the district court.we,like the district court,must assess whether the alj finding was supported by substantial evidence.wilson apfel,cir.if the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence we must affirm,even if the proof preponderates against it.miles chater,cir.
as noted earlier,yvonne is entitled to ssi benefits if she demonstrates that the limitations stemming from her severe impairment sickle cell disease meet,medically equal,or functionally equal the limitations specified in the listings.the alj found that none of these possibilities applied in this case.on appeal,yvonne challenges only the first determination,claiming that her limitations meet those in the listings.see appellant br.at there are other methods of establishing eligibility including showing that the impairment is medically or functionally equal to a listed impairment which are not relevant to this discussion.
we discussed in part i how the listings specify five limitations from which people with sickle cell disease may suffer that count as sufficiently marked and severe to render a person disabled.yvonne claims only that she suffers from one of them r ecent,recurrent,severe crises musculoskeletal,vertebral,abdominal.listing a.she admits,there are other listed limitations under sickle cell disease which are not relevant to this discussion.appellant br.at.consequently,this appeal centers around one very narrow the magistrate judge finding that yvonne did not suffer from recent,recurrent,severe,crises,and so did not have marked and severe limitations on her life activities and was not clearly erroneous.
we agree with the alj that the medical evidence yvonne adduced,standing alone,is insufficient to prove that she suffered from recent,recurrent,severe,crises.four hospitalizations for crises over the course of several years do not establish that the crises are recurrent.moreover,although yvonne hearing before the alj was on january,she had not been hospitalized since.consequently,her
