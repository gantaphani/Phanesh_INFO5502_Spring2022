in,omar stratman began his quest to challenge the secretary of the interior the secretary certification of woody island as a native village under the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa.years later,we must decide whether congress ratified the secretary favorable eligibility determination when,in,it enacted the alaska national interest lands conservation act anilca which listed woody island village corporation,leisnoi,leisnoi,as a deficiency village corporation entitled to lands under ancsa.we hold that it did.therefore,we dismiss stratman appeal as moot.
background 
statutory frameworki.ancsa 
congress enacted ancsa in in order to resolve land disputes between the federal government,the state of alaska,alaskan natives,and settlers.leisnoi,stratman,cir.in its findings and declaration of policy,congress recognized an immediate need for a fair and just settlement of aboriginal land claims that was to be accomplished rapidly,with certainty,in conformity with the real economic and social needs of natives,and without litigation a,b.in furtherance of this basic purpose,alaskan natives received,in exchange for the extinction of all claims of aboriginal title,approximately million acres of land and nearly billion in federal funds.leisnoi,at.these resources were distributed amongst thirteen regional corporations,groups of natives unified by a common heritage and sharing common interests,a,and an unspecified number of village corporations,corporate entities based around native villages.the native villages were defined to include any tribe,band,clan,group,village,community,or association in alaska either listed by name or determined by the secretary to have met certain requirements.c.
to qualify as a native village under ancsa,the secretary must determine that 
a or more natives were residents of an established village on the census enumeration date as shown by the census or other evidence satisfactory to the secretary,who shall make findings of fact in each instance and 
b the village is not of a modern and urban character,and a majority of the residents are natives.
b.department of the interior doi regulations establish procedures for determining village eligibility,and initially envisioned that these determinations would be made by the end of the director of the juneau area office regional director of the bureau of indian affairs bia was required to make an initial determination of eligibility not later than december,a,and protests to the eligibility determination were barred if brought days after publication of the decision,id.at a.the regional director was required to render a decision as to the protest within days,id.at a,and appeal from that decision could be taken before the interior board of land appeals ibla,id.at a.that decision would not become final until personally approved by the secretary.id.
although ancsa fixes the total allocation from the federal government to village corporations at million acres,the final allocation of land to each village corporation depends upon the distribution of native alaskans in eligible villages.first,the area included in the patent issued to the village corporation varies based on the number of natives residing in the village for example,a village with native alaskans is entitled to patent an area of public lands equal to acres,while a village with a population of over is entitled to acres.see a.next,any difference between the million acres reserved for village corporations and the amount of land actually claimed by eligible villages as discussed above must be reallocated on an equitable basis after considering historic use,subsistence needs,and population.b the final allocation of lands to eligible village corporations is therefore contingent upon the resolution of the eligibility of all other putative villages within each regional corporation.further,the village allocations affect the computation of lands granted to the regional corporations,if the area patented to the village corporations within a regional corporation exceeds the percentage of acreage allotted to the regional corporation based on its relative size within the state.see c.
once a village is deemed eligible,its village corporation may select lands pursuant to.in those situations where land selection criteria can not be met because of a deficiency of available lands,the secretary must withdraw three times the deficiency from the nearest unreserved,vacant and unappropriated public lands,withdrawing,insofar as possible,lands of a character similar to those on which the village is located and in order of their proximity to the center of the native village.a a.
the foregoing eligibility and land selection provisions of ancsa created problems for villages within the koniag,koniag region,leisnoi regional corporation,because of a shortage of available lands on kodiak island.a further problem for koniag,and the village corporations in the region,was uncertainty over the status of several putative villages.in the midthrough,eleven villages brought suits challenging ineligibility determinations made by the secretary.see koniag,andrus.congress addressed these problems in anilca.
although anilca is generally concerned with the designation,disposition,and management of land for environmental preservation purposes,see anilca,stat,codified at,part of anilca is devoted to the implementation and cleanup of ancsa.in particular,part a of title xiv includes amendments to ancsa,and part b contains other related provisions.see stat.table of contents.those provisions resolve extant membership,land,and village status questions.see id.section concerned issues specific to koniag and was referred to as the koniag amendment.
section a contains several definitions relevant to this dispute.because of the deficiency of available lands on kodiak island,the koniag villages had been previously assigned deficiency lands on the alaska peninsula by the secretary.these lands,described as deficiency village acreage on the alaska peninsula,were defined as the aggregate number of acres of public land to which koniag deficiency village corporations are entitled under section a a,stat.the subsection also defined koniag deficiency village corporation explicitly to include leisnoi.see a,stat.koniag deficiency village corporation means any or all of the following lesnoi,incorporated.another definition made leisnoi eligible,upon koniag designation,to receive land under b of ancsa,b,as a village corporation listed above.a.
subsection b contains several relevant substantive provisions.first,it provides that i n full satisfaction of the right of each koniag deficiency village corporation to conveyance under ancsa of the surface estate of deficiency village acreage on the alaska peninsula and in lieu of conveyances thereof otherwise,the secretary of the interior shall,under the terms and conditions set forth in this section,convey lands on afognak island b,stat.pursuant to this exchange of lands on afognak island for those on the alaska peninsula,the claims of the deficiency villages and koniag to lands on the peninsula would be extinguished,all claims arising under ancsa or this section of anilca relating to this transaction would be barred,and the land would be included within the alaska peninsula wildlife refuge.b,stat.
subsection e resolves an ongoing legal dispute involving the eligibility challenges by the eleven villages.see koniag,at.by releasing the united states and its agents from all prior claims arising under ancsa,they would be deemed an eligible village under ancsa.e,stat.finally,subsection f provides that a ll conveyances made by reason of this section shall be subject to the terms and conditions of ancsa as if such conveyances including patents had been made or issued pursuant to that act.f,stat.
section,in part a of title xiv,states that,e xcept as specifically provided in this act,i the provisions of ancsa are fully applicable to this act,and ii nothing in this act shall be construed to alter or amend any of such provisions.
procedural history 
in,stratman and several other plaintiffs filed suit in the district of alaska,seeking to enjoin the secretary from issuing lands to three villages on or around kodiak island,one of which was woody island,on the ground that the villages did not satisfy ancsa certification requirements.this action,no.cv,has been referred to by the parties as the decertification action.
the district court initially dismissed the claims made by the plaintiffs asserting recreational use of woody island because those plaintiffs did not exhaust their administrative remedies under.chapter of the alaska conservation soc y kleppe.however,stratman and another plaintiff,toni burton,avoided dismissal on the ground that,as the owners of grazing leases potentially affected by leisnoi land selections,they were entitled to actual notice of woody island certification.leisnoi later mooted stratman action by relinquishing all claims to the land involving the grazing leases,see stratman andrus,and the district court dismissed stratman claim on that basis.id.at.this court reversed the district court,holding that stratman claim was not barred by a failure to exhaust administrative remedies because he was not given actual notice of the certification,and that he still had standing to sue on the basis of his alleged recreational use.stratman watt,cir.we remanded to provide stratman with the opportunity to pursue his administrative remedies.id.at.
on remand,in,the parties entered into a settlement agreement.the failure of the parties to abide by the terms of the settlement agreement eventually resulted in our determination that stratman could reopen the decertification action in federal court.stratman leisnoi,wl,at cir.the district court concluded that the matter was not ripe for judicial review without a formal determination on the merits of stratman claims by the agency.it therefore remanded the matter to the ibla and dismissed stratman action.
following remand,a hearing was held on woody island eligibility.the administrative law judge issued an opinion on october,concluding with three findings 
the alleged village did not have or more native residents on april,the alleged village,as of april,was not an established native village and did not have an identifiable physical location evidenced by occupancy consistent with the natives own cultural patterns and,and less than enrollees to the alleged village used it during as a place where they actually lived for a period of time.
three years later,the ibla affirmed the merits of stratman claim.
shortly thereafter,stratman filed the instant action.in the meantime,however,leisnoi petitioned the secretary for review of the ibla decision pursuant to a providing that d ecisions of the board on village eligibility appeals are not final until personally approved by the secretary,and a granting the secretary authority to review any decision of any employee or employees of the department to reconsider a decision.
on december,the office of the doi solicitor issued a memorandum reviewing the decision of the ibla.the solicitor concluded that of anilca ratified the eligibility determination of the secretary,and thus mooted stratman challenge to leisnoi certification.the solicitor first observed that was quite clear in treating leisnoi as an eligible village.to the extent that the statute was ambiguous,the solicitor resolved the ambiguity in favor of leisnoi in light of congress desire to resolve the land entitlements of koniag as soon as practicable.the secretary adopted the solicitor memorandum as his own decision and disapprove d the decision of the ibla.
following the issuance of the secretary decision in late,stratman filed a third amended complaint in which he sought enforcement of the ibla decision.on september,the district court granted the secretary,leisnoi,and koniag collectively,the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that of anilca ratified the secretary eligibility determination,rendering stratman action moot.stratman timely appealed.
standard of review 
we review de novo the district court dismissal of a complaint under.b.wah chang duke energy trading,llc,cir.federal jurisdiction over this case depends on whether anilca has rendered stratman administrative challenge moot.we review this question of statutory interpretation de novo.see alaska wildlife alliance jensen,cir.
i f an event occurs while a case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any effectual relief whatever to a prevailing party,the appeal must be dismissed.church of scientology united states,d quoting mills green.we have repeatedly recognized that the enactment of a new law that resolves the parties dispute during the pendency of an appeal renders the case moot.see,consejo de desarrollo economico de mexicali,united states,cir interpreting relevant provisions of the tax relief and health care act of to exempt a canal lining project from statutory environmental claims qwest city of surprise,cir.here,the defendants contend that of anilca had the effect of designating leisnoi as an eligible village corporation and conveying land to leisnoi,thereby ratifying the secretary eligibility determination and rendering moot stratman challenge.stratman,on the other hand,contends that is a land withdrawal and selection provision that merely identified leisnoi as a village whose land selection might change if it satisfied the eligibility requirements of ancsa.we agree with the defendants.
congressional intent 
statutory language and framework 
when interpreting a statute,we must first determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case.texaco united states,cir citation and quotation marks omitted.along with the specific provisions at issue,we examine the structure of the statute as a whole,including its object and policy.consejo de desarrollo economico,at citation and quotation marks omitted.in viewing the statutory context,we attempt to give effect,if possible,to every clause and word of a statute id.internal citation and quotation marks omitted.we therefore turn to and other related provisions of anilca.
section,titled koniag village and regional corporation lands,falls within the portion of anilca devoted to the resolution of issues specific to villages and regional corporations.in support of their position,the defendants point to a,which defines d eficiency village acreage on the alaska peninsula as the aggregate number of acres of public land to which koniag deficiency village corporations are entitled,under section a of ancsa,a emphasis added,and leisnoi,incorporated as a koniag deficiency village corporation a.section a of ancsa,a,entitles eligible village corporations to a patent for surface estates.to the extent that a shortage of land exists around the village,of ancsa,a,requires the secretary to withdraw deficiency acreage from the nearest unappropriated public lands of a similar character.under ancsa,a village logically must be deemed eligible before the problem of land deficiency can possibly arise.the fact that identifies leisnoi as a koniag deficiency village corporation and further indicates that such deficiency village corporations are entitled to land under ancsa is strong evidence of congress intent to treat leisnoi as an eligible village.
section b goes on to state that i n full satisfaction of the right of each koniag deficiency village corporation to conveyance under ancsa of the surface estate of deficiency village acreage on the alaska peninsula the secretary of the interior shall convey the surface estate of public lands on afognak island b emphasis added.under the plain language of the statute,then,leisnoi is entitled,a,and has the right,b,to public land under a of ancsa.this language inexorably leads to the conclusion that congress intended to treat leisnoi as an eligible village corporation under ancsa.it would defy logic and common sense for congress to deem leisnoi entitled to deficiency lands without also implicitly having found that it was entitled to other lands under a of ancsa.it would also be illogical for congress to convey lands to an ineligible village corporation.further,congress identified only one condition precedent to conveyance of land to leisnoi l
