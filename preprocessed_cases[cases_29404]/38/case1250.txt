this is a national childhood vaccine injury act of vaccine act case.see et.the question before us is whether the estate of a petitioner who dies prior to judgment is entitled to compensation for lost future earnings.the united states court of federal claims claims court answered in the affirmative.tembenis sec y health human,trial op.because eligibility for future lost earnings under a b requires the person suffering from a injury to survive the compensation judgment,we reverse.
background 
when he was approximately four months old,elias tembenis received a diptheria tetanus acellular pertussis dtap vaccine.elias developed a seizure disorder shortly afterwards,and his parents,harry and gina tembenis,filed a petition for vaccine compensation on his behalf.while the petition was pending,elias died as a result of his seizure disorder at the age of seven.the caption of the case was then amended to name harry and gina tembenis,administrators of elias estate,as petitioners.
the tembenis petition proceeded,and,in,a special master determined that the dtap vaccine caused elias epilepsy and resulting death.tembenis sec y of health human,wl fed.cl.spec.master.the secretary of health and human services secretary and the estate agreed that the secretary would pay the death benefit under a and would also pay for actual pain and suffering and past unreimbursable expenses under a and a.the parties did not agree,however,on whether elias estate was entitled to recover future lost earnings under a b.the special master,after receiving briefing from the parties on this issue and relying on our decisions in zatuchni sec y health human,and edgar sec y of health human,determined that the estate was entitled to future lost earnings.tembenis sec y health human,wl fed.cl.spec.master.
the secretary reserved her right to challenge the future lost earnings award,but proffered the sum of as a measure of the lost earnings.the petitioners agreed,and the special master awarded petitioners a lump sum payment of,the sum of the in uncontested awards and the in contested future lost earnings 
the secretary subsequently filed a motion for review with the claims court,limited to the question of whether the tembenis estate is entitled to any future lost earnings award.the secretary made no challenge to the special master causation finding or to the awards of the death benefit,pain and suffering,and past unreimbursable expenses.the claims court also read our decisions in zatuchni and edgar to support recovery for lost future earnings for a child who died as a result of his injury before a compensation judgment was entered,and thus affirmed the special master future lost earnings award.trial op.at.
the secretary now appeals to our court,again arguing that an estate can not recover lost future earnings under a b when the person injured by a vaccine dies before entry of a compensation judgment.we have jurisdiction under f,and,as this is purely a question of statutory interpretation,we review the decision of the claims court de novo,locane sec y health human.before this case,no compensation award under the vaccine act had allowed future lost earnings for the estate of a deceased petitioner.the interpretive question before the court is thus one of first impression.
discussion 
congress enacted the vaccine act to stabilize the vaccine market and facilitate compensation for deaths and injuries.see lowry sec y health human.among other things,the vaccine act established the national vaccine injury compensation program,see a,which provides compensation for injuries or death through a system designed to work faster and with greater ease than the civil tort system.bruesewitz wyeth llc,d quoting shalala whitecotton,d.
a person injured by a vaccine,or his or her legal representative,may file a petition for compensation in the claims court,naming the secretary as respondent.a special master then makes an informal adjudication of the petition,bruesewitz.at,subject to further review by a judge of the claims court and our court,see e and f.
the vaccine act provides several forms of compensation to those who show that they were injured by a vaccine.see a through a.because the different forms of compensation under a are interrelated,we consider each to determine if subsection a b is restricted as the secretary asserts.
under subsection a,a person may recover both past and predicted actual unreimbursable expenses which result from the injury.a.this includes a vast array of expenses,such as those for diagnosis,medical or other remedial care,rehabilitation,developmental evaluation,special education,vocational training and placement,case management services,counseling,emotional or behavioral therapy,residential and custodial care and service expenses,special equipment,related travel expenses,and facilities determined to be reasonably necessary.id.at a b iii.an award under a is intended to alleviate the financial burden of the petitioner medical treatment.the estate of a person who is dead at the time of the award can recover past expenses,but obviously has no future expenses.zatuchni,at.
subsection a allows recovery for actual and projected pain and suffering and emotional distress from the injury.a.an award under a ameliorates,to some extent,the injured person pain and suffering.as under subsection a,when a claimant is deceased at the time of a compensation award,the estate can recover for pain and suffering and emotional distress from the time of the injury until the date of death.see zatuchni,at.taken together,both a and a are attempts to make the injured person whole.
similarly,subsection a is also designed for a compensatory purpose.under a,a person may recover lost earnings.subsection a provides 
a in the case of any person who has sustained a injury after attaining the age of and whose earning capacity is or has been impaired by reason of such person injury for which compensation is to be awarded,compensation for actual and anticipated loss of earnings determined in accordance with generally recognized actuarial principles and projections.
b in the case of any person who has sustained a injury before attaining the age of and whose earning capacity is or has been impaired by reason of such person injury for which compensation is to be awarded and whose injury is of sufficient severity to permit reasonable anticipation that such person is likely to suffer impaired earning capacity at age and beyond,compensation after attaining the age of for loss of earnings determined on the basis of the average gross weekly earnings of workers in the private,sector,less appropriate taxes and the average cost of a health insurance policy,as determined by the secretary.
a.recovery for past and future lost earnings is compensation for the lost wages which would have otherwise provided the income necessary to sustain the person.see sarver sec y health human,wl,at fed.cl.spec.master.
subsection a treats those over differently from those under.persons over may recover both actual and anticipated lost earnings.a a.by allowing recovery for actual as well as anticipated future earnings,subsection a a contemplates that a person who was injured by a vaccine after attaining the age of could have entered or remained in the workforce.the lost earnings award is tailored to the individual in accordance with generally recognized actuarial principles and projections.id.actual lost earnings are available to an estate and may be recovered for the time between the injury and the date of death.zatuchni,at.anticipated lost earnings are available to those who are alive at the time of the award and are expected to suffer from a lost earning capacity going forward,but death terminates any anticipation of future lost earnings.
for persons under,subsection a b sets forth another inquiry.in order to be eligible for lost earnings,the minor must have an injury which is which impaired the minor earning capacity and which is of sufficient severity to permit reasonable anticipation that such person is likely to suffer impaired earning capacity at age and beyond.a b.in other words,the court asks how the injury will affect the person earning capa
