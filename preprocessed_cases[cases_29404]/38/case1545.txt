oliver jaquay seeks review of the final decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the board of veterans appeals bva because the notice of appeal was not timely filed nor otherwise tolled.see jaquay west.because jaquay misfiled request for reconsideration with the va regional office varo from which his claim originated equitably tolled the judicial appeal period for filing his notice of appeal to the veterans court,the veterans court dismissal is reversed,and the case is remanded.
background 
jaquay served in the united states military from february to july,where he developed a hearing loss.on april,jaquay applied for an increase in his benefits.the department of veterans affairs new york regional office denied the claim in october.jaquay appealed the decision to the bva in february.on september,the bva notified jaquay of the denial of his benefits request.along with a copy of the decision,the bva sent jaquay the statutorily required form entitled board of veterans appeals notice appeals notice,informing jaquay of his right to either file a motion for reconsideration with the bva or an appeal to the veterans court.specifically,the appeals notice provided you may file a motion for reconsideration of this bva decision at the following address board of veterans appeals,vermont avenue,washington,dc.see a.
on december,jaquay executed a motion for reconsideration and addressed it to the chairman of the board of veterans appeals.in the motion,jaquay sought an independent medical opinion and expressed his belief that the department of veterans affairs va failed to assist him in the development of this claim.the motion concludes this is why i am asking the board of veterans appeals for reconsideration.please review this reconsideration carefully because i intend to go to the court of veterans appeals if my request is not granted.instead of mailing the motion to the bva in washington,jaquay representative,joseph hill of the division of veterans affairs of the state of new york,mailed it to the department of veterans affairs new york regional office,which was the varo where jaquay claims file was located.approximately ten months later,that varo forwarded jaquay motion to the bva,where it was received on november.the bva considered and denied jaquay motion for reconsideration on january.
on may,within days of the bva decision on reconsideration,jaquay filed a notice of appeal with the veterans court.the secretary moved for dismissal of the action as untimely.throughout a series of orders directing the parties to brief the issue of the veterans court jurisdiction in the case,jaquay argued that the varo should have forwarded his motion for reconsideration to the bva and any time limits should have been tolled in light of the fact that his appeal would have been timely but for the mailing being directed to the varo rather than the bva office in washington,
the veterans court granted the secretary motion to dismiss because jaquay notice of appeal was not timely filed within days of the initial bva decision as required by a nor otherwise tolled under the principles set forth in rosler derwinski.in rosler,the veterans court,relying on icc brotherhood of locomotive engineers,d,held that if a motion for reconsideration is filed within days of a final decision by the bva,the finality of the initial bva decision is abated by that motion for reconsideration,and a new period begins to run on the date on which the bva mails to the claimant notice of its denial of the motion to reconsider.see linville west,applying the rosler doctrine.jaquay argued that equitable tolling should apply because the varo had a duty to forward the motion to the bva,or return it to jaquay in a timely manner with instructions on proper filing.in determining when jaquay motion for reconsideration was filed with the bva,the veterans court applied its caselaw regarding when notices of appeal are filed with the veterans court.the veterans court then strictly construed rosler and found that jaquay motion for reconsideration was filed with the bva only upon the board actual receipt,and the board receipt came more than days following the initial decision of the bva.id.at.the veterans court further concluded that jaquay filing with the varo did not constitute constructive receipt by the board,and the varo had no duty to forward or return the motion.id.at.
jaquay timely appealed to this court,and the case was heard before a panel on september.on february,the court took the case en banc and entered a sua sponte order directing the parties to brief the following issues 
do the provisions of,the department of veterans affairs procedure manual,part iii,create a duty to timely return or forward all documents misfiled with the department of veterans affairs 
did the enactment of the veterans claims assistance act of affect any duty of the department of veterans affairs established by,the dva procedure manual,part iii 
if the answer to question one is yes,what effect does a violation of such duty have on the requirement that a veteran must exercise due diligence before invoking the doctrine of equitable tolling see irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.
discussion 
we begin with a brief overview of the veterans benefits system.congress has created a paternalistic veterans benefits system to care for those who served their country in uniform.see,hensley west,recognizing that the veterans benefit system is uniquely nolen gober,pointing out congress recognition of the strongly and uniquely system of awarding benefits to veterans citations omitted.under this system,the secretary has the affirmative duty to assist claimants by informing veterans of the benefits available to them and assisting them in developing claims they may have.see.congress recently passed the veterans claims assistance act of vcaa,stat,to reaffirm and clarify the duty of the secretary of veterans affairs to assist claimants for benefits under laws administered by the secretary 
when a veteran seeks to file an original claim for benefits or reopen an existing claim,he does so at one of the varos located throughout the country.if the veteran is unsatisfied with a varo decision,he can,among other things,appeal the decision to the bva.to appeal a varo decision,the veteran is required to file a notice of disagreement nod.rather than sending the nod to the bva in washington,the veteran must send it to the varo from which the veteran received the adverse decision.id.the varo reviews the nod and prepares a statement of the case soc,which details the varo position on the issues.id.the filing of the soc marks the start of the appeal.id.the veteran then responds to the soc by filing a substantive appeal on va form or another form of correspondence containing the necessary information.id.the varo then prepares a certification of the appeal which certifies the case to the bva.id.
in addition to filing the substantive appeal with the bva,a veteran has the right to a hearing before the bva.id.the location of the hearing is governed by,which provides 
a hearing on appeal before the board of veterans appeals may be held in one of the following places at the option of the appellant 
a in washington,dc,or 
b at a department of veterans affairs facility having adequate physical resources and personnel for the support of such hearings.
thus,the veteran has the choice of having the hearing before the bva at a varo or in washington.when the bva sits at a varo rather than washington,it is known as a travel board.when a travel board convenes,the veteran file remains with the varo.if no hearing is requested or if a hearing is requested in washington,the file is sent to the bva in washington,see.
once the bva reaches its decision,the original copy of the bva opinion is placed in the veteran claims file and copies are sent to the veteran.the entire claims file is then returned to the varo from which it was received.if the bva decision is adverse to the veteran,the veteran may,at any time,ask the bva to reconsider its decision.requests for reconsideration are handled in two stages.during the first stage,the chairman of the bva decides whether the request meets the standards for reconsideration set forth in the regulations.if the chairman orders the bva to readjudicate the claim,then the claim proceeds to the second stage where the initial bva decision is vacated and then subjected to a de novo review by a larger panel of the bva.see smith brown,en banc.
instead of filing a motion for reconsideration of the bva decision,the veteran may appeal a final decision of the bva to the veterans court.see generally graves principi.under a,the appeal to the veterans court must be filed within days of the bva mailing of its decision.as stated above,the veterans court in rosler interpreted this provision as allowing an additional days to file a notice of appeal to the veterans court when the claimant filed a motion for reconsideration before the bva,so long as the claimant filed the motion for reconsideration within days of the initial bva decision.see rosler.at 
in addition to the foregoing,the chairman of the bva,at any time,can order that a bva claim be readjudicated,even after a veteran files an appeal at the veterans court.reconsideration of an appellate decision may be accorded at any time by the board of veterans appeals on motion by the appellant or his or her representative or on the board own motion.in this case,we are only concerned with motions for reconsideration filed during the judicial appeal period of a rather than challenges to the chairman decision to not reconsider a case.see mccall brown,distinguishing decisions reviewing bva decisions from those reviewing the chairman decision to deny reconsideration patterson brown,same.
when a claim for benefits is before the agency,either at the varo or before the bva,the relationship between the veteran and the government is and.forshey principi,en banc.during the stages of disputes over benefits,veterans often act pro se or are assisted by a representative of a veterans services organization.in fact,a veteran may not enter into a fee agreement with an attorney until the bva issues a final decision in a case.see c.although the statute does not prohibit an attorney from representing a veteran before the varo or bva on an original claim,the law prohibiting lawyers from charging a fee has the practical effect of limiting the ability of veterans to retain a lawyer at the early stages of the claim process.see,maggitt west,noting that the lack of access to counsel before the varo or bva makes the system less user friendly than congress intended but see stanley principi,noting that lawyers were historically kept out of the process to protect veterans from the perceived threat that agents or attorneys would charge excessive fees for their services and to keep the system informal and.
throughout jaquay attempts to petition the va for benefits,jaquay had different representatives during the different stages of the claim process.he acted pro se at times.at other times,he was represented by a representative of the division of veterans affairs of the state of new york.currently,he is represented by private counsel.at the time when jaquay representative filed the motion for reconsideration,jaquay was still seeking relief through the bva rather than the veterans court.thus,he was operating in the portion of the veterans compensation process.
the issue before the court in the present case is whether the veterans court properly interpreted its jurisdictional statute when it dismissed jaquay appeal as being untimely.the veterans court held that it lacked jurisdiction because jaquay failed to file a notice of appeal with the court within days after the date on which notice of the decision was mailed.according to the veterans court,the initial bva decision had not been abated until more than days after it had been mailed.thus,the notice of appeal filed by jaquay at the veterans court came after the judicial appeal period expired.this presents the specific question of whether the veterans court erred by holding that filing a motion for bva reconsideration at the varo within the judicial appeal period does not toll the judicial appeal period for filing a notice of appeal to the veterans court.
equitable tolling is generally available in two types of situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period,or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass.irwin,at.the irwin court noted that courts are less forgiving in receiving late filings where the claimant failed to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights or where there is a garden variety claim of excusable neglect.id.
although the doctrine of equitable tolling gives courts some latitude in excusing the missing of filing deadlines,an appeal by a veteran of a bva decision involves a waiver of sovereign immunity,which must be strictly interpreted.united states sherwood.following the veterans court decision dismissing jaquay appeal,this court sat en banc in bailey west and discussed the relationship between the principles of sovereign immunity and the statute of limitations set forth in,en banc.specifically,this court was asked to decide whether the statute of limitations under was subject to the doctrine of equitable tolling.
in bailey,a veteran went to the varo in huntington,west virginia,and with the assistance of a varo employee,filled out and signed a notice of appeal to the veterans court following an adverse decision of the bva.see id.at.the varo employee took the notice and informed the veteran that she would take care of the appeal.see id.however,the employee then failed to file the notice of appeal with the veterans court,causing the veteran to miss the statutory deadline.see id.the veteran appealed to this court,arguing that the statute of limitations should be tolled.relying on irwin,this court concluded that the doctrine of equitable tolling,when available in comparable suits of private parties,is available in suits against the united states,unless congress has expressed its intent to the contrary.id.at.in bailey case,equitable tolling was available under the second irwin prong because the veteran was lulled into accepting and relying upon the advice and aid of the government.id.at.
jaquay amici argue that jaquay is entitled to equitable tolling under both of irwin two prongs.whether equitable tolling should apply when a veteran misdirects a motion for reconsideration thus turns on whether,by such conduct,the veteran has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period,or,in the alternative,whether he has been induced or tricked by the va misconduct into allowing the judicial appeal period to pass.irwin,at.implicated in the consideration of these questions are the statute governing the timeliness of an appeal to the veterans court,the regulation governing the filing of a motion for bva reconsideration,and the appeals notice which explains to veterans the procedures for obtaining review before the veterans court or reconsideration before the bva.we address each,in turn.
the statute governing the timeliness of an appeal to the veterans court,a,provides 
in order to obtain review by the court of appeals for veterans claims of a final decision of the board of veterans appeals,a person adversely affected by such decision shall file a notice of appeal with the court within days after the date on which notice of the decision is mailed pursuant to section e of this title.
a.under the statute,the statute of limitations period begins once the bva issues its initial decision.if a motion for reconsideration is filed with the bva during that period,the initial decision is abated,and the veteran has days from the subsequent bva decision to file a notice of appeal with the veterans court.see rosler.at.
motions for reconsideration before the bva are governed by,which provides,in pertinent part 
a application requirements.a motion for reconsideration must be in writing and must include the name of the veteran the name of the claimant or appellant if other than the veteran,a veteran survivor,a guardian,or a fiduciary appointed to receive va benefits on an individual behalf the applicable department of veterans affairs file number and the date of the board of veterans appeals decision,or decisions,to be reconsidered.it must also set forth clearly and specifically the alleged obvious error,or errors,of fact or law in the applicable decision,or decisions,of the board or other appropriate basis for requesting reconsideration.if the applicable board of veterans appeals decision,or decisions,involved more than one issue on appeal,the motion for reconsideration must identify the specific issue,or issues,to which the motion pertains.issues not so identified will not be considered in the disposition of the motion.
b filing of motion for reconsideration.a motion for reconsideration of a prior board of veterans appeals decision may be filed at any time.such motions must be filed at the following address director,administrative service,board of veterans appeals,vermont avenue,washington,dc.
a b emphasis added.
unlike the filing of a notice of appeal before the veterans court,the bva sets no statute of limitations for filing a motion for reconsideration.a motion for reconsideration may be filed at any time.id.b.the regulation evinces a belief that any unfairness toward the va is outweighed by the veteran right to present his claim.in other words,all claims for benefits are instances where the interests of justice require vindication of the plaintiff rights.burnett new york cent,d.if the veteran,with the assistance of the va,gathers information to substantiate a claim,the veteran is entitled to receive the appropriate benefits,no matter how long it takes to substantiate the claim.
under,an adverse decision of the bva must be accompanied by a notice explaining the reasons for the decision and an explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the decision.in cummings west,overruled on other grounds,bailey,at,this court held that requires nothing more than a general outline of the available procedures for obtaining review of a final bva decision.the appeals notice provided to jaquay informed him of three options filing a motion for reconsideration with the bva appealing the decision to the veterans court or reopening the claim by submitting new and material evidence to the varo.the instructions for filing a motion for reconsideration provided 
you may file a motion for reconsideration of this bva decision at the following address board of veterans appeals,vermont avenue,washington dc.your motion may be in the form of a letter.it should state clearly and specifically which issue or issues you want the bva to reconsider and the specific reasons why the bva should reconsider the issue or issues.
emphasis added.
the instructions also explain the alternative option of filing an appeal with the veterans court 
you may have the right to appeal this decision to the united states court of veterans appeals the court.you may appeal to the court a final decision of the bva that follows a notice of disagreement filed on or after november.a notice of appeal must be filed with the court within days from the date of mailing of the notice of the bva decision.the date of mailing is the date that appears on the face of the bva decision.the court address is the united states court of veterans appeals,indiana avenue,suite,washington dc.you may obtain information about the form of the notice of appeal,the methods by which you may file your notice of appeal with the court,the amount of any filing fee,and other matters covered by the court rules directly from the court.you should also mail a copy of the notice of appeal to the va general counsel,vermont avenue,washington,dc.however,the va general counsel is not a part of the court and filing a copy of your notice of appeal with the va general counsel or any other va office will not protect your right of appeal.
emphasis added.
jaquay argues that he is entitled to equitable tolling under either of the two irwin prongs.we begin with jaquay argument that equitable tolling is available if,by filing a motion for reconsideration with the varo during the judicial appeal period of,he shows that he actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period.irwin,at.
the supreme court has allowed equitable tolling where a plaintiff filed the correct complaint in the wrong court.id.at.citing burnett,at.herb pitcairn.in burnett,an employee of the new york central railroad filed suit against his employer in state court under the federal employers liability act fela,stat,as amended,et.the state court dismissed the case because venue was improper.eight days later the employee brought an identical action in the federal district court.the district court dismissed the action on the ground that although the state action was brought within the limitations period,the federal action was not timely and was thus barred by the limitation provision of fela.burnett,at.the court of appeals affirmed.the supreme court reversed,holding that equitable tolling was appropriate in order to effectuate the basic congressional purposes in enacting this humane and remedial act,as well as those policies embodied in the act limitation provision id.at.the court concluded that the humanitarian purpose of the fela makes clear that congress would not wish a plaintiff deprived of his rights when no policy underlying a statute of limitations is served in doing so.id.at.
filing a motion for reconsideration with the varo instead of the bva is analogous to the factual situation in the tolling cases before the supreme court.while the above supreme court cases tolled originally filed actions in trial courts as opposed to actions before appellate courts,the filing of a notice of appeal at the veterans court,like the filing of a complaint in a trial court,is the first action taken by a veteran in a court of law.this court in bailey recognized that and applied equitable tolling principles to appellate filings in the context of.as judge michel recognized in bailey,the veterans court is an article i court set in a sui generis adjudicative scheme for awarding benefit entitlements to a special class of citizens,those who risked harm to serve and defend their country.this entire scheme is imbued with special beneficence from a grateful sovereign.bailey,at michel,concurring.in the context of the,paternalistic,uniquely veterans compensation system,and consistent with our decision in bailey,the availability of equitable tolling pursuant to irwin should be interpreted liberally with respect to filings during the stage of the veterans benefits process.just as the limitations period of can be stopped and reset by the timely filing of a properly addressed motion for reconsideration,see rosler.at,nothing in the statute or regulations at issue suggests that equitable tolling should not be available under appropriate circumstances.young united states,d it is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling,irwin department of veterans affairs,d,unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute,united states beggerly,d.united states brockamp,d holding that by set ting forth its limitations in a highly detailed technical manner and reiterat ing its limitations several times in several different ways,there was good reason to believe that congress did not want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply.
jaquay only misstep in his quest for reconsideration by the bva and judicial review by the veterans court was his directing of the motion for reconsideration to the varo that had been assisting him develop his claim rather than to the bva at the address specified in.that regulation was promulgated pursuant to.a review of that statute does not evince any congressional intent to preclude equitable tolling while motions for reconsideration are pending.according to the secretary,the regulation is designed to ensure that the bva actually receives the motions for reconsideration and identifies them as such.in other words,the must be filed at
