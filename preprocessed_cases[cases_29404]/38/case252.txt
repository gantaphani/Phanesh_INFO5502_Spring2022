petitioner stephanie wheeler appeals from a decision of the benefits review board the board denying her claim for benefits under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act,lhwca or the act.respondent newport news shipbuilding and dry dock company the employer opposes the relief sought by wheeler.the director,office of workers compensation programs,united states department of labor the director,supports wheeler petition in this matter and joins in her request for reversal of the board decision.
because we conclude that the term compensation in section of the act does not include the payment of medical benefits,we affirm the board decision.
this case requires us to determine the meaning and scope of the term compensation,as used in section of the lhwca in particular,we must decide whether compensation under that statute includes voluntary payments by an employer to a claimant medical providers.
the pertinent facts are undisputed.on may,wheeler sustained an injury to both knees while working for the employer.she sought and was awarded scheduled permanent partial disability compensation,as well as a period of temporary total disability compensation.wheeler later sought continuing permanent total disability compensation,which the employer contested.on august,the administrative law judge alj issued an order denying wheeler claim for permanent total disability compensation.wheeler appealed,and the board affirmed on september.no further appeal was taken from that order,and by that date,the employer had completed its compensation payments for wheeler scheduled permanent partial disability 
since the decision,wheeler continued to seek regular medical treatment for her knees,which the employer authorized and paid.this treatment included surgeries in and for a right total knee arthroplasty and left knee arthroplasty,respectively.
on september,wheeler submitted a request for modification of her permanent partial disability award,pursuant to section of the act,once again seeking total disability benefits as a result of the deteriorating condition of her knees.specifically,wheeler sought temporary total disability from june,to june,temporary partial disability from june,to september,and temporary total disability from september,to the present and continuing.
her request for modification was rejected as untimely by an alj decision and order because the request was not filed within one year after the date of the last payment of compensation or after the rejection of a claim,as set forth in section.while wheeler request for modification was filed within one year of when the employer last paid medical benefits on wheeler behalf,it was filed more than four years after the board last order in denying her claim for permanent total disability compensation.
in determining wheeler request for modification was untimely,the alj expressly rejected wheeler argument that the term compensation as used in section of the act includes the voluntary payment by an employer of a claimant medical expenses.the alj concluded that wheeler filed her modification request more than one year after the date on which the board denial of her claim became final in and that her current request was therefore.
wheeler appealed the alj decision to the board.the opinion and order of the board affirmed the alj denial of wheeler modification request,finding the request was untimely and thus.
wheeler filed a timely petition for review of the board decision to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
this court reviews the board decisions for errors of law and to ascertain whether the board adhered to its standard for reviewing the alj factual findings.gilchrist newport news shipbuilding dry dock,cir.as to the board interpretation of the act,review is de novo,because the board is not a agency and its statutory interpretation is thus not entitled to any special deference from the court of appeals.id.at.
in pertinent part,section of the act provides as follows 
upon his own initiative,or upon the application of any party in interest,on the ground of a change in conditions or because of a mistake in a determination of fact by the deputy commissioner,the deputy commissioner may,at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation,whether or not a compensation order has been issued,or at any time prior to one year after the rejection of a claim,review a compensation case and issue a new compensation order which may terminate,continue,reinstate,increase,or decrease such compensation,or award compensation.
emphasis added.at issue here is the meaning of the term compensation in the emphasized portion of the statute,which effectively sets a statute of limitations for reopening a compensation order.in particular,for resolution of the case at bar,if compensation includes the payment of medical benefits,then wheeler claim for modification is arguably timely if it does not,then her claim for benefits was properly denied by the board as.
the parties have not identified any court decisions directly addressing whether the term compensation within section of the act should be interpreted to include medical payments.in resolving this issue of first impression,we look initially to the language of the act itself 
if it is plain,we apply it according to its terms.to determine whether the language is plain,we consider the language itself,the specific context in which that language is used,and the broader context of the statute as a whole.if the language is ambiguous,in that it lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation,our obligation is to find that interpretation which can most fairly be said to be imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and the general purposes that congress manifested.

the plain language of section,however,does not clearly indicate that compensation either includes or excludes medical payments.by contrast,other provisions of the act,by their text or structure,do clearly reflect that the payment of medical benefits may,or may not,constitute compensation.see.shipbuilding drydock jenkins,cir compensation in section a includes medical benefits because the section requires payment of compensation payable under sections,and of the act its explicit reference to section which pertains solely to medical services and supplies means that compensation includes medical benefits lazarus chevron usa,cir compensation under section a includes medical benefits oilfield safety mach.specialties,harman unlimited,cir compensation under section a includes medical benefits a n o compensation shall be allowed for the first three days of the disability,except the benefits provided for in section,thereby including medical benefits in compensation.
additionally,although the act includes a definition of compensation,that definition does not expressly state whether the term should be interpreted to include medical benefits.see compensation means the money allowance payable to an employee or to his dependents as provided for in this chapter,and includes funeral benefits provided therein.moreover,the supreme court and this court have held that the term compensation does not include medical benefits in other places in the act.see,marshall pletz.compensation in section,which requires an employee to file a claim for compensation for disability within one year after the injury,does not include medical payments brown root,sain,cir compensation in section g does not include medical benefits,in light of fact that section g refers to compensation and medical benefits the inclusion of medical benefits in subsection suggests that its omission in subsection was intentional.
in short,as noted by the fifth circuit,the term compensation is not utilized as a term of art in the act.see oilfield safety mach.specialties,at.rather,its meaning varies among the statutes within the act.
in this case,both the alj and the board relied heavily on the supreme court decision in pletz.alj decision board decision.in pletz,the supreme court determined that the term compensation in section of the act did not include medical aid.at.section requires an employee to file a claim for compensation for disability within one year after the injury,except that if payment of compensation has been made without an award on account of such injury a claim may be filed within one year after the date of the last payment id.at citing ellipses in original.
because pletz addressed a separate statute with different language,we do not find it controlling.in particular,the provision at issue in pletz specifically referred to the right to compensation for disability or death.a.this was an obvious reference to sections and of the act titled compensation for disability and compensation for death,respectively.the clear implication of section reference to compensation would logically exclude section,which is the provision governing medical benefits and titled medical services and supplies.thus,it is easy to see why the pletz court did not read section to encompass the payment of medical benefits as compensation.by contrast,section does not make reference to disability or death as does section.thus,we find pletz distinguishable and not controlling precedent.moreover,as already noted,there are other provisions in the act where the term compensation clearly does include medical benefits.see jenkins,at compensation in section a includes medical benefits.
while we do not find pletz controlling,it is instructive.one particular reason that is so is that section and section both establish statutes of limitation for filing compensation claims under the act and use similar language.section allows a claim to be filed within one year after the date of the last payment and earlier in the same sentence refers to payment of compensation.similarly,section allows modifications and review of an award of compensation at any time prior to one year after the date of the last payment of compensation.thus,although there are differences,there are also similarities in the language of the two sections that counsel careful consideration of the reasoning of pletz as we analyze section.
in view of the lack of any controlling precedent and the lack of the clear inclusion or exclusion of medical benefits as part of compensation in either the definition of compensation or the text and structure of section,we conclude that the meaning of compensation in section is ambiguous.accordingly,we must find the interpretation most fairly imbedded in the statute,in the sense of being most harmonious with its scheme and the general purposes that congress manifested.brown,at citations omitted.
as explained by this court in brown,
t he lhwca is a workers compensation scheme that provides employees with the benefit of a more certain recovery for harms while providing employers with definite and lower limits on potential liability than would have been applicable in tort actions for damages.the lhwca is thus designed to accommodate employees interest in receiving a prompt and certain recovery for their industrial injuries as well as the employers interest in having their contingent liabilities identified as precisely and as early as possible.

the director and wheeler describe section as this court did in betty b coal director,owcp,by referring to the modification procedure in section as extraordinarily broad and flexible,potent,easily invoked,and intended to secure justice under the act,cir see also shipyards,d section allows modification of an earlier compensation order when changed conditions make such modification desirable in order to render justice under the act.
wheeler focus on the general purpose of section as a whole,however,ignores the reality that the provision also contains a statute of limitations.that is,both the section time bar and the initial period for filing claims,see,are obviously limitations on the right of a party to seek redress under the act,even in cases where there may be a meritorious claim.indeed,a statute of limitations,by its very nature,may result in the denial of otherwise meritorious claims.gould dep t of health human,cir statutes of limitations often make it impossible to enforce what were otherwise perfectly valid claims quoting united states kubrick,d.but statutes of limitations serve important,purposes affirmed throughout our jurisprudence.we are bound to give them effect until such time as the creator of such provisions,the legislative branch,exercises its prerogative to amend the statute.gould,at.
thus,we must interpret section in a way so as to maintain the provision extraordinarily broad modification procedure,betty b coal,at,while still giving effect to the limitations period it contains.
notably,the legislative history of section reflects congress attempt to strike such a balance,and also supports the conclusion that compensation in section does not include payment of medical benefits.as originally enacted,section permitted the modification of a prior order of compensation only during the term of an award.see intercounty constr.walter,d citation omitted.courts construed this provision to limit the power to modify a previous order to the period of payments pursuant to an award.id.at.because employers often paid benefits voluntarily and completed making payments before a final compensation order was entered,claimants were frequently left unable to seek additional compensation because the term of the award had expired with the last payment of compensation and that occurred long before they received an order.see intercounty constr.walter,aff,d.
in an attempt to remedy this situation,the united states employees compensation commission usecc,which then administered the act,recommended that congress amend section to permit continuing review and modification of previously entered orders.walter,at.the purpose of the usecc recommendation was to broaden the length of time during which the deputy commissioner could exercise his power to modify previously entered orders.id.
as recounted by the supreme court in walter,congress responded in by amending section and explained the change as follows 
this bill amends section of the existing act so as to broaden the grounds on which a deputy commissioner can modify an award and also while strictly limiting the period,extends the time within which such modification may be made 
the amendment is in line with the recommendation of the usecc except that it limits to year after the date of the last payment of compensation the time during which such modification may be made.
walter,at emphasis added alterations in original quoting.
thus,congress explicitly rejected the recommendation that modification be permitted with no time limitation,instead restricting modifications to a time period after certain events.see id.this legislative history further shows that congress inclusion of the limitations period was not accidental,and bolsters the conclusion that the section limitations period must not be construed in a way that strips it of much of its force.
the director argues that the legislative history does not support a strict construction of any portion of section.he points to the supreme court decision in metropolitan stevedore rambo,d rambo i,in which the supreme court stated that congress unwilling ness to extend the limitations period in which a party may seek modification should not lead courts to 
infer that congress intended a narrow construction of other parts of,including the circumstances that would justify reopening an award.we rejected this very argument in banks chicago grain trimmers ass n,d,and its logic continues to elude us.congress decision to maintain a limitations period has no apparent relevance to which changed conditions may justify modifying an award.
unlike the rambo i and banks courts,however,we are not tasked with interpreting a different portion of section,but with interpreting the statute of limitations itself and what events trigger it.rambo i,at addressing which conditions justify modification banks,at suggesting that the legislative history might be relevant to the time period in which review was to be available,but the history did not address the grounds for review.
