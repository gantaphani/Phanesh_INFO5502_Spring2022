rodney miller filed suit in the united states district court for the district of new mexico challenging monumental life insurance monumental denial of a request for disability benefits.the district court granted summary judgment for monumental.because the employee retirement income security act erisa,governs the terms of monumental insurance policy,the district court jurisdiction arose under.exercising jurisdiction pursuant to,we reverse and remand.
background 
in september of,rodney miller was injured in an automobile accident while working for aycock transportation,a texas corporation.after receiving months of temporary disability benefits from monumental,aycock provider of a policy the plan,miller applied for the plan continuous total disability benefit continuous benefit,a disability payment.in order to qualify for the continuous benefit,an applicant must be totally disabled,which the plan defines as unable to perform every duty pertaining to any occupation for which he is or may become qualified by education.aplt app.at monumental master policy,effectuated june.the plan also requires applicants to present proof of a social security disability award,which the plan defines as social security disability benefits for which the insured person has submitted a claim and has been approved for payment by the social security administration.id.
miller applied for disability benefits under title ii and title xvi of the social security act,et.although the social security administration ssa administers both programs,the supreme court has outlined their distinctions title ii is an insurance program.enacted in,it provides,survivor and disability benefits to insured individuals irrespective of financial need.title xvi is a welfare program.enacted in,it provides social security insurance benefits to financially needy individuals who are blind,or disabled regardless of their insured status.bowen galbreath,d citation omitted.
the ssa denied miller claim for title ii disability insurance benefits because he had failed to accrue sufficient quarters of coverage to confer disability insured status.aplt app.at social security administration office of hearings and appeals decision,filed august,title ii decision.nevertheless,the ssa granted miller claim for title xvi supplemental social security income benefits because the administrative law judge alj determined that he met the regulatory standard for physical disability and had basically no income.miller sent monumental notice of the ssa title xvi decision,but monumental denied payment on the grounds that it was not a social security disability award.miller brought suit challenging monumental conclusion.
because monumental had not retained authority to interpret the plan,the district court reviewed monumental denial of coverage de novo.reasoning that there is little difference between new mexico law and texas law,miller monumental life ins,d,the district court applied new mexico law to interpret the term social security disability award.the court granted monumental motion for summary judgment on the theory that the plan unambiguously provided that a title xvi award was not a social security disability award.more specifically,the district court found that the phrase social security disability award has a technical meaning that does not include social security income payments and refused to go beyond the technical meaning of social security disability award.id.at.the court emphasized that the language in each of these places means what monumental meant it to say when it wrote the definition.id.this appeal followed.
ii.discussion 
we begin by holding that the district court erred in interpreting the plan according to new mexico law because erisa state rules of insurance contract interpretation.see blair metro.life ins,cir applying federal common law to interpret an erisa plan.then,applying federal common law,we determine that the proper inquiry is not what monumental intended a term to signify rather,we consider the common and ordinary meaning as a reasonable person in the position of the plan participant would have understood the words to mean.admin.comm.of assocs.health welfare plan willard,cir internal quotation marks omitted.employing this standard,we hold that the plan is ambiguous because a reasonable plan participant could easily conclude that a title xvi award coupled with a finding of physical disability would constitute a social security disability award for the purposes of the continuous benefit.we then apply the doctrine of contra proferentem,which strictly construes ambiguities in insurance contracts against the drafter.
we review de novo the question of what law governs our interpretation of the plan.mowry united parcel,cir.although the district court applied new mexico law to interpret the plan,the parties do not dispute that federal law governs our determination of whether the plan is ambiguous.we agree.
congress enacted erisa to ensure national uniformity in fiduciary standards for the administration of employee benefit plans.see shaw delta air lines,d.to that end,it included a broad provision that all state laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.ass of health plans,miller,d internal quotation marks omitted.nevertheless,even under this expansive preemption scheme,state law s which regulat e insurance are saved from.id.quoting b a.in miller,the supreme court held that for a state law to be deemed a law which regulates insurance under b a,it must satisfy two requirements.first,it must be specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance.second the state law must substantially affect the risk pooling arrangement between the insurer and the insured.id.at.
like the seventh circuit,w e can not imagine any rational basis for the proposition that state rules of contract interpretation regulate insurance within the meaning of b.hammond fid.guar.life ins,cir.in the context of the saving clause,the miller court described an insurance regulation as a law that placed conditions on the right to engage in the business of insurance.at.rules of contract interpretation force the insurer to bear the legal risks associated with unclear policy language.hammond,at.shifting legal risk is,however,a far cry from transferring or spreading a policyholder risk.id.internal quotation marks omitted.thus,the rules of contract interpretation at issue do not satisfy the first prong of the miller inquiry.
our decision to apply federal common law is consistent with our precedent,and that of the vast majority of other circuits.see blair,at metlife urges us to apply federal common law,governed by principles of trust law.we do so.internal citation omitted see also thibodeaux cont l cas.ins,cir hammond,at brewer lincoln life ins,cir evans safeco life ins,cir mcmahan new england mut.life ins,cir sampson mut.benefit life ins,st cir.
having determined that state law is,we now assess whether the plan is ambiguous.
standard of review 
in firestone tire rubber bruch,d,the supreme court observed that erisa imposes upon providers a fiduciary duty similar to the one trustees owe trust beneficiaries.id.at.erisa legislative history confirms that the act fiduciary responsibility provisions codify and make applicable to erisa fiduciaries certain principles developed in the evolution of the law of trusts.internal quotation marks omitted.just as a trustee must conduct his dealings with a beneficiary with the utmost degree of honesty and transparency,an erisa provider is required to clearly delineate the scope of its obligations.
this fiduciary duty also enables erisa providers to retain the authority to interpret ambiguous provisions in a plan.when an erisa provider retains this authority in explicit terms,we employ a deferential standard of review.id.at.noting that t rust principles make a deferential standard of review appropriate when an erisa provider has explicitly retained the authority to interpret ambiguous plan.in the instant case,however,monumental did not reserve any such powers of interpretation.hence,we review the contract and monumental denial of benefits de novo.id.at.noting that where
