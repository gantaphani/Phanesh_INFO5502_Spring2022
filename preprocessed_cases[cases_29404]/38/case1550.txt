petitioner joseph roman seeks review of a decision of the merit systems protection board upholding the method by which the central intelligence agency computed his survivor annuity under the federal employees retirement system fers.because the agency misapplied the relevant statute and regulations,we reverse.
roman wife,laurie roman,began work at the cia as a contract officer on august,at which time she became a participant in fers.roman worked at the agency full time until august,when she began a period of leave without pay lwop to care for her newborn daughter.in july,roman was diagnosed with lymphoma.on august,she returned to work,but on a basis.for the next two years,she worked hours per week,or hours per pay period,until her illness forced her to take disability retirement on august.roman died shortly thereafter.
because roman is the surviving spouse of a federal disability annuitant,he is entitled to a survivor annuity,the amount of which is calculated according to a statutory formula.the statutory scheme that governs the calculation of the survivor annuity is complex and requires some explanation.
the surviving spouse of a disability annuitant receives an annuity equal to percent of the value of the annuitant annuity as of the day before the annuitant death.g,a.the value of roman annuity as of the day before her death is determined by multiplying her total service by a percentage of her average pay,id.a,and then,because some of her service was part time,by multiplying that product by a proration factor,id.e b.
roman total service began with a period of employment,for which she received full service credit.following that period,she had a period of lwop.she did not receive service credit for that entire period,however,because an employee is entitled to no more than six months of service credit for lwop during any calendar year.d.roman also received credit toward her period of total service for her two years of service following her period of lwop.by the time of her retirement,roman had eight years and months of total service.
when a disability annuitant dies before reaching age,the value of the annuitant annuity is calculated based on the annuitant actual service plus a constructive period of service which we refer to as imputed service consisting of the period between the annuitant retirement and the anniversary of the annuitant birth.g b ii ii,b b.in roman case,the period of imputed service totaled years and months.for purposes of determining the value of her annuity,roman total service at the time of her death was therefore deemed to be years and months.because roman service included work,however,the value of her annuity was reduced by applying a proration factor.the statute that sets out the method for calculating the proration factor,e b,states 
t he benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee actual service,as determined by prorating the employee total service to reflect the service that was performed on a basis,bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a basis.
the dispute in this case is over the manner in which the proration fraction is determined.in particular,the dispute concerns the way the cia treated roman period of imputed service in calculating the proration factor 
the proration factor is expressed as a fraction.for the denominator,the cia used the total number of hours that roman would have worked if she had worked full time for years and months.for the numerator,the agency added the number of hours roman actually worked plus a projected number of hours corresponding to the allowable portion of roman lwop period and the imputed service period between her retirement and the anniversary of her birth.the agency determined the projected number of hours for roman allowable lwop period and for the period of imputed service following her retirement based on her work status immediately preceding each of those periods.because roman was working full time before taking lwop,the agency credited her with status during her allowable lwop period.however,because roman was working only hours out of a possible hours per pay period prior to her retirement,the agency credited her with only hours per pay period for the lengthy period of imputed service following her retirement.
based on that methodology,the cia derived a proration factor of for use in calculating the value of roman annuity.that meant that roman survivor annuity was percent of what it would have been if his wife actual service had all been full time.
roman took issue with the manner in which the cia prorated his wife years of service.in particular,he argued that the agency should not have treated the year and month period of imputed service as if roman had continued to work part time at hours per week for that entire period.instead,he argued that the agency should not have taken the period of imputed service into account in either the numerator or the denominator of the proration fraction.under roman methodology,the proration factor for his wife years of service would have been,and his survivor annuity would have been considerably larger than under the agency calculation.
the cia rejected roman arguments and stood by the method it used to determine the proration factor.roman appealed to the merit systems protection board.the administrative judge assigned to the case issued an opinion affirming the cia decision,and the full board affirmed the administrative judge decision.roman then petitioned for review by this court.
section e b provides that the proration factor is a function of actual service and total service.for situations in which an employee has some service but no imputed service,the computation described in e b is straightforward the numerator of the proration fraction consists of the employee actual service,which is derived by prorating the employee total service to reflect the service that was performed on a basis.that is,if the employee worked full time for six years and half time for six years,the employee would have nine years of actual service.the denominator consists of the total service that would be creditable if all of the employee service had been full time.in the example given above,the denominator would be years,the employee period of total service if all years had been full time.
the difficulty in this case is that the period of years and months that was used to calculate the value of roman annuity included two periods in which she did not months of allowable lwop and the years and months of imputed service following her retirement.
under the cia interpretation of the statutory scheme,the agency was required to put the entire period of years and months in the denominator of the proration fraction,and it was required to put some period of imputed service in the numerator.because the cia interprets section e b as being silent on the method of prorating the period of lwop and imputed service,it contends that it was permissible to credit those periods of service in some reasonable way,such as by basing the credit for each of those periods on the employee work status,full time or part time immediately preceding the period of lwop or imputed service,respectively.
roman agrees that the cia properly treated his wife period of allowable lwop by including it in both in numerator and the denominator of the proration factor and not prorating it.roman disagrees,however,with the manner in which the agency treated his wife period of imputed service.as to that period,roman contends that the cia misapplied the governing statute and regulations when it prorated that entire period as if roman had continued to work at the rate of hours per week that she had worked in the two years prior to her retirement.the reason the statute is silent on how to assign hours for imputed service,roman argues,is that imputed service is not part of the proration calculation at all,and the period of imputed service should not be included in either the numerator or the denominator of the proration fraction.according to roman,the numerator of the proration fraction
