our review is limited to determining whether the commissioner decision is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole,that is,evidence that reasonable minds would accept as adequate to support the commissioner conclusion.g,c richardson perales,d holz apfel,cir.the review is more than a search of the record for evidence supporting the secretary findings.gavin heckler,cir.in determining substantiality,the court must also balance the weight of evidence that detracts from the commissioner decision.because of the insufficiency of the record with regard to muncy mental status,we must remand this matter to the commissioner for further proceedings.
background 
medical record 
muncy was at the time of the hearing before the administrative law judge alj in april.he is functionally illiterate,although he finished tenth grade in special education classes.he worked a series of hard physical labor jobs until when he suffered a heat stroke while working as an oil field roustabout.he tried several other jobs,but found that he had developed severe heat intolerance.the medical records do not reveal an exact cause for the heat intolerance.
the medical records do show,however,that muncy has several health problems apart from heat intolerance,including obesity hypertension spinal arthritis a small herniated disk at the level a pinched nerve headaches and chronic sinusitis,sore throats,and earaches.in addition,he claims significant pain on the left side of his body as a result of an accident in when he fell through the rotting floor of his housing authority apartment.he alleges that he has experienced pain,periodic numbness,spasms,and swelling in various parts of the left side of his body since the accident,along with chronic neck,buttock,lower back,and leg pain.
in,a neurosurgeon discovered that the calf of muncy left leg had atrophied one inch and that he had sensory hypalgesia along the dermatome down the calf into the big toe,likely caused by the piriform muscle compressing the perineal portion of the sciatic nerve.also in,a neurologist diagnosed headaches and neck pain resulting from the injury.nerve conduction studies showed a slight prolongation of the ulnar distal motor latency,suggesting a mild ulnar neuropathy.an mri of muncy cervical spine showed a vertebral lesion.
in,another neurosurgeon found some limitation of motion in muncy neck and low back with spasms in the low back on both sides.grip strength was on the dominant right hand and on the left.the doctor found numbness in the entire left hand and left foot.he diagnosed chronic cervical and lumbrosacral arthritis,by history chronic cervical strain chronic lumbrosacral strain small,central,herniated lumbar disc and cerebral concussion,grade i,by history.the doctor said that muncy could lift twenty pounds occasionally,and could sit no more than thirty minutes at a time and no more than six hours a day.
more than one doctor,however,has suggested that muncy demonstrates behavior and questioned his attempts to procure pain medications.the neurologist whom muncy saw in questioned why muncy continued to complain of such significant pain,and wondered if there is some secondary gain associated with these complaints.administrative record ar.
mental status 
muncy mental status is of primary concern in this appeal.during his initial benefit determination in,a psychologist found that on the muncy full scale iq was,verbal iq was,and performance iq was,placing him in the mild range of retardation.that result qualified him for benefits under the section b listing for mental retardation.section b requires a valid verbal,performance,or full scale iq of or less.pt,subpt.p,app.
during the continuing disability review in,however,another psychologist,stevens,tested muncy and found that on the,his full scale iq was,verbal iq was,and performance iq was.an iq of placed him in the low normal range,described by borderline intellectual functioning.holz apfel,cir thomas sullivan,cir.
in his report,stevens also noted that he had difficulty communicat ing concepts to muncy as he has difficulty listening.stevens found that muncy had a second grade reading and spelling level and a third grade arithmetic level.the results of the short form mmpi suggested some schizoid personality traits in an individual who has some periodic situational depression and preoccupation with his condition,referred to as psychological factors affecting physical condition.this represents some emotional distress but is not at a severe level.ar.muncy did not score well on work simulation testing.on the crawford small parts dexterity test,muncy placed in the fourth percentile on part i and in the third percentile on part ii.muncy could not complete the valpar simulated assembly work sample because pain in his back left him stooping,holding onto the table,after only about five minutes.
stevens concluded that before muncy accident,he had some remaining vocational and earnings potentials,but the injury to his back has removed these potentials and he can now look forward to a life of chronic discomfort and feelings of uselessness.thus,the prognosis is poor and i expect limited change in the foreseeable future.id.

alj decision 
the alj found that muncy cervical and lumbar strain was severe enough to reduce his ability to work,but not severe enough to meet or equal the criteria of any impairment in the listings muncy new iq score of took him outside the criteria of section b of the listings muncy experienced medical improvement related to his ability to work and,as of january,had the residual functional capacity to perform a full range of light work,despite his illiteracy other than exertional impairments caused by his cervical and lumbar strain,muncy had no additional nonexertional impairments to reduce the light work base occupations existed in the national and regional economies in significant numbers that muncy could perform regardless of his impairments and while muncy impairments and residual functional capacity precluded him from performing his past relevant work,he was no longer disabled as of january.ar.
the alj discredited muncy allegations of pain because they were not based on the objective findings by treating and examining physicians,because muncy sought medical treatment only sporadically and was not taking any pain medication,and because muncy did not evidence discomfort during the hearing.the alj also noted that the medical records did not mention heat exhaustion except as a historical incident or muscular weakness.further,the medical records showed no basis for a cla
