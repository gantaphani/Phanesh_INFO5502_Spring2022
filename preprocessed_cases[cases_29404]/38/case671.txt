the district court affirmed the commissioner denial of clay claim for social security disability benefits.on appeal,clay argues that her physical and mental impairments,taken together,meet listing c for mental retardation.see pt,subpt,app.she argues in the alternative that the administrative law judge alj erred when he found that she could perform available jobs.we affirm.
clay applied for social security disability benefits on march,alleging disability due to pain and limited mobility in her left knee and right arm.she also alleged poor hearing and a humming in her ear.the present appeal follows her fifth administrative hearing on the application.the first four hearings on her application resulted in two remand orders from the appeals council and two remand orders from the district court.during the protracted pendency of her application,she was subjected to repeated physical and mental examinations.accordingly,in her latest hearing,on september,extensive evidence was available.the record before us includes information from multiple hearings as well as a large,cumulative body of medical evidence.
her medical history,prior to her application,included surgery in the late due to an infection in her right ear a gunshot wound and related surgery on her right arm in the early and a left knee fracture followed by surgery.she has a plate and pin in her left knee.she claims to have her knee in.her current complaints of left knee,right arm,and right ear defects pain are all claimed as residual effects of these prior events.she claims a disability onset date of sometime in the.
clay did not initially claim mental retardation as a source of disability,and the record contains no reference to iq testing or mental retardation before the date of her application for benefits.she dropped out of school in the ninth grade and received poor grades prior to that time.she claims that she was seen in by a psychiatrist in blytheville,arkansas,for problems related to the fact that she would fly off the handle.there is no suggestion that this earlier visit involved evaluation for,or diagnosis of,mental retardation.
on may,a consultative physician,james russell,examined clay.he noted that she reported that her left knee swelled occasionally,and that she had pain from the prior knee fracture and gunshot wound to the arm,but that she did not have intermittent pain caused by walking or standing.he reported that she could hear normal conversations.an audiogram showed that she had moderately severe hearing loss in her right ear and moderate to mild hearing loss in her left ear.she exhibited normal ranges of motion in all joints other than her left knee,which was limited to degrees compared to a normal range of motion of degrees.he noted that this restricted range partially limited her ability to squat.he also noted that she could hold a pen and write and grip objects with her hands and that she denied having any mood related disorders or hallucinations.he concluded,this lady could do work activities such as sitting,standing would be compromised by her left knee,walking would be compromised,objects would be compromised.she can hear although,that is compromised as described above.
on october,she was treated and released at an emergency room for a crack cocaine overdose.this appears to have been an isolated incident as the record does not support an inference that she was a habitual user or addict.the emergency room doctor recommended that she enter a treatment program.she did not enter a treatment program.
on december,a consultative psychiatrist,crupie,examined clay at the request of the alj.the alj ordered the exam because clay had claimed that she was seeing and hearing things.crupie concluded that clay suffered from no psychiatric illness or disorder and that the things she saw and heard were most likely night terrors or dreams.he set forth a clinical estimate that her iq was eighty.he did not claim to have conducted a physical examination,but reported that she claimed pain as her reason for not being able to work.in his report,under diagnosis,he wrote chronic pain syndrome involving left knee,right shoulder and upper arm.he also noted,i feel that this patient is describing her situation and condition honestly.i do not think that she is consciously exaggerating or malingering.he rated her as good or good in all categories of mental or job skills other than understand,remember and carry out complex job instructions and demonstrate reliability,for which he rated her as fair and poor or none,respectively.
in june,clay attorney sent her to another consultative psychiatrist for evaluation,justin adler.adler noted clay physical condition,stating that she walked without difficulty,without limping,and without the aid of a supporting device.he also noted that she claimed that she occasionally took tylenol for pain,but that she was not taking any prescription pain medication.her chief complaint was bad nerves.adler did not offer an opinion as to whether clay exaggerated her mental infirmities.he diagnosed her as having conversion hysterical disorder manifested by subjective pain sensations in an individual of limited intellectual endowment.he concluded 
i do believe that clay is consciously exaggerating her discomforts.she actually believes that she has pains as the result of her knee surgery.there is however a lack of commensurate emotional response to her pains which suggests a dissociative reaction hysterical reaction.her limited intellect also may play a contributory role here.her hallucinatory experiences are very vague and more suggestively due to her limited mentality also,a fact not uncommon in individuals of a lowered status.the prognosis for substantial improvement is very doubtful.
on february,a consultative psychologist,michael inman,examined clay.inman stated that clay was initially hostile,was resentful throughout her examination,and was ostensibly complying with the evaluation,though providing minimal effort.he stated that her minimal effort was best exemplified on iq testing,on block design subtest,when she would discontinue the task even when considerable time remained.he found that her g eneral fund of information was limited,but consistent with her general full scale iq she was able to successful ly perform simple calculations,including addition,subtraction,multiplication and division and abstract reasoning was limited and quit e concrete,though again considered commensurate with her full scale iq.judgment and social reasoning were grossly intact.
inman administered a wechsler adult intelligence test iq test and found clay verbal,performance,and full scale iq scores to be,and,respectively.although he noted that she exhibited minimal effort and discontinued tasks on the iq test when there was still time left,he ultimately concluded that,present subtests sic results are considered a valid indication of clay intellectual abilities,which are within the higher range of mildly mentally retarded.
inman administered other tests and determined that,regarding these other tests,clay was consciously exaggerating her symptoms to secure benefits.regarding results from an minnesota multiphasic personality test test,inman stated,clay responded to the items in an extremely exaggerated manner moreover,she responded in a manner suggesting that her pattern of excessive symptom checking was for the purpose of falsely claiming psychological problems one is left,therefore,with the conclusion that current results are from extreme and conscious exaggeration of her symptoms apparently secondary to attempts to secure benefits.he diagnosed clay with somatization disorder,dependent personality traits,and chronic pain syndrome involving left knee,right shoulder,and right arm.he stated that malingering remained to be ruled out.he concluded,there is considerable evidence that her responses are extremely exaggerated,based on objective evidence of an extremely high f score on her as well as my own subjective impressions throughout the evaluation.my clinical impression was that clay was probably malingering though this is difficult to assess.he specifically noted,however,that d espite clay extreme exaggeration of her physical symptoms,her intellectual abilities nevertheless fall within the mildly mentally retarded range.
on september,another consultative psychologist,richard maddock,examined clay.maddock described her as defensive,indifferent,disinterested,and only minimally cooperative.he administered a full battery of psychological tests.he could not score her test because she skipped many items and filled out columns on the answer sheet in fashion,ignoring the questions and their alternatives.he also administered the wahler physical symptoms inventory and concluded that her results suggest a strong emotional component to her physical complaints and also suggest malingering.
maddock also administered an iq test.clay received verbal,performance and full scale iq scores of,and,respectively.maddock noted that these scores were lower than the scores found by inman in.he concluded that the scores he measured,as well as her earlier scores were not valid,stating,since malingering has been an issue with clay since the beginning and was addressed at least one time by inman when he tested her,the scores from are probably not valid.this would mean that neither set of scores could be considered to be valid or reliable.in reaching this conclusion about inman scores,maddock created a graph on which he plotted the scores he measured against the scores maddock measured to demonstrate the decrease over three years time.he concluded that the difference in scores supported the conclusion that both sets were unreliable.
maddock also administered a wide range achievement test.he found that clay various raw scores on the achievement test equated to first grade or kindergarten levels of achievement.because he found that she was malingering,however,he found the achievement test results to be invalid.
to test for malingering,maddock conducted a computerized assessment of response bias assessment carb.maddock concluded that the results of the carb assessment verified malingering and resulted in scores that could only be related to giving misleading responses.maddock stated,it is extremely unlikely that even an individual who has sustained a severe brain injury would perform this poorly in the absence of symptom exaggeration or malingering issues.
maddock,like all the psychologists and psychiatrists who examined clay,noted that she cared for herself,dressed appropriately,was understandable when she talked and was able to communicate effectively.he concluded,however,that clay has not been open and honest during this interview.there was extensive evidence of malingering and exaggeration of symptoms in order to establish eligibility for disability benefits.
on september,james galyon,an orthopedist,examined clay.he concluded that she could not rotate her right outwardly but that she could rotate the right inwardly full pronation but zero degrees supination,and that the limitation would impact her ability to work.he concluded that she had a full range of motion in her other joints,including her left knee,and that her left knee was not disabling or limiting.
at clay fifth hearing,a vocational expert testified and answered hypothetical questions asked by the alj.the hypothetical questions involved progressively more restrictive combinations of impairments to determine what jobs would be available to someone with these different levels of impairment.the first hypothetical involved a person who had mild to moderate pain that was mostly controlled with pain medicine and who had a residual functional capacity that included the ability to lift or carry ten pounds frequently and up to twenty pounds occasionally stand or walk about six hours in an day,one to two hours without interruption walk for two blocks without walking on uneven ground sit with no limitation and only occasionally balance,kneel,crouch,crawl,or stoop.in this first hypothetical,the alj also included a restriction regarding borderline intellect and issues related to depression by further restricting the person to perform only,simple,unskilled work,level three or below meaning unskilled or level three or below understand,remember,and follow simple,concrete instructions drive work with supervision,superficial contact with the public and coworkers and can meet and agree to change.based on these limitations,the vocational expert recommended cashier work,with million jobs available nationally,statewide,and in two local counties.the vocational expert also recommended work as a machine operator,with jobs available nationally,and,and in two local counties.
the alj then amended his hypothetical to include a further limitation with more restrictive pain so that the worker would only be able to stand or walk for four hours out of an eight hour day and only be able to perform work while sitting down.the vocational expert classified this hypothetical as unskilled work at sedentary exertional levels and recommended assembly work with jobs available nationally,and in two local counties,respectively.
during her interviews with the mental health professionals and through testimony at her five hearings,clay described her daily activities and work history.she had worked part time,for short periods of time as a food worker,waitress,dish washer,and machine operator.she cared for herself and,for a period of time,for her grandchild.early in the extended application process,she reported that she performed various household chores,but later she claimed that her son or daughter did most of the housework.she claimed to attend church regularly,socialize seldomly,and watch television most of the time.
applying the sequential analysis of a g,the alj found that clay had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since her alleged onset date.although clay had worked at a few part time jobs,the alj concluded that she had no relevant past work experience.he found that her impairments were severe,but alone or in combination,neither medically nor functionally equal to any listed impairment.the alj found that clay was physically and mentally restricted in the manner that he described in his first hypothetical and that there were a significant number of jobs available nationally for someone with those restrictions.he specifically found that clay had some physical limitations but that her extreme subjective complaints were not borne out by the evidence.also,he found that,although she was a person of limited intellectual abilities,her mental diagnosis was malingering rather than mental retardation.ultimately,he found her not disabled and denied her application for benefits.
the appeals council denied further review,making the alj denial of benefits the commissioner final decision.the district court affirmed,finding the evidence sufficient to support the commissioner findings under the deferential standards applicable to the review of social security determinations.
we review the district court decision to uphold the denial of social security benefits de novo.cunningham apfel,cir pettit apfel,cir.our review of the commissioner decision,however,is deferential,and we do not substitute our own view of the evidence for that of the commissioner.id.rather,we affirm the commissioner decision if it is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.dixon barnhart,cir grebenick chater,cir hall chater,cir.substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind would find adequate to support a decision,considering evidence that detracts from the commissioner decision as well as evidence that supports it.cunningham,at young apfel,cir.if there is substantial evidence to support the commissioner conclusion,we may not reverse even though there may also be substantial evidence to support the opposite conclusion.clark apfel,cir gaddis chater,cir.
