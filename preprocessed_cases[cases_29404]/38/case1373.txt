after the war capellan applied for veterans benefits based on her husband service.the application was granted and capellan received benefits for several months in until they were terminated in august of that year.this appeal is from the most recent denial of her claim for dependency and indemnity compensation,by decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court.the veterans court held that capellan military service had not been established by an official united states military document or verified by a united states service department pursuant to,and declined to consider the new evidence from philippine military authorities in its ruling the veterans court appears to have diverged from other decisions concerning verification of philippine military service when new information was provided after an earlier adverse determination.see,padilla nicholson,wl,at,requiring review of new information dela cruz nicholson,wl,at,requiring review of new information.

the secretary of veterans affairs herein the va argues that this court does not have jurisdiction to consider any aspect of this appeal,stating that capellan is simply seeking review of a factual determination concerning capellan military service.capellan argues that the decision of the veterans court was based on an incorrect interpretation of certain statutes and regulations.the issues she raises primarily concern,a va regulation that relates to evidence of military service and that states the procedures to be followed by claimants and by the va in collaboration with the military services.capellan argues that this regulation was incorrectly interpreted in view of the va statutory duty to assist,and the statute applicable to veterans claims,b.

after the war capellan filed a claim for death pension and other benefits based on her husband military service and his death at bataan.a united states army report dated august,states that the army confirmed that santiago capellan served in the military service of the united states through the philippine commonwealth army,that his service began on december,and that he was killed in action on february,during the battle for bataan.the report states that capellan was a private in b company,battalion,infantry regiment,and that three affidavits pertaining to his military service were attached.on august,the army issued another report,stating that capellan has no recognized guerrilla service nor was he a member of the commonwealth army in the service of the armed forces of the united states.the report does not explain the change from the report,although it refers to a separate loyalty report on capellan father which is not included in the record.capellan briefly received benefits from the va but they were terminated in.
the activity relevant to this appeal is focused on documentation from the philippine military authorities that capellan received in with respect to her husband service and death at bataan.a document dated december,signed by records officer romeo soriben and captain narciso erna,assistant adjutant general of the armed forces of the philippines,certified that private santiago capellan served in the b co bn regt,and described his service as

admin.rec.at.these documents were submitted in january to the va regional office in manila.in october the regional office wrote capellan that it was unable to locate the relevant claims files and requested additional information.the regional office letter stated 
so that proper adjudicative action may be taken on your claim,you must furnish the following 
va form.please fill out every blank which applies to you.
va form.please explain why your benefits were terminated in july.
copies of notices of award and disallowance to include all available previous va correspondence.
a copy of the veteran death certificate.
a copy of your marriage certificate.
admin.rec.at.capellan responded in december,providing both requested va forms and stating that she had not received a death certificate because her husband body was unrecovered and no document was issued to us by proper authorities.i hope that this military service record will serve as his death certificate.she included a copy of her marriage certificate,and explained that her copies of the notices of awards and disallowances were misplaced or lost and could not be provided.she explained that capellan father had received a letter from the va in july asking for capellan military service record but that w e were not able to submit the document needed because of improper guidance,and referred to a february letter from the va stating that her benefits were terminated for the reason that my husband has no recognized guerilla service.
the regional office requested a search for capellan military records from the national personnel records center nprc in missouri.the nprc is part of the united states national archives and records administration,and receives and stores records of various types concerning persons who served in the armed forces.the nprc provided the regional office with the army report,which stated that capellan had served with the philippine commonwealth army in the service of the united states armed forces from december,through february,when he was killed in action.the regional office then wrote the nprc that it had reason to believe that there may have been a subsequent that revoked the report.the nprc then provided the army report,the nprc stating that the determination of that date stands.the record provided on this appeal does not reflect that the va provided the philippine military records,or any of capellan other evidence,to the nprc for verification of service.
the regional office then denied capellan claim,stating that under decisions concerning verification of military service are the responsibility of the nprc and are binding on the va which has no authority to change or amend the findings.although the regional office decision listed the evidence provided by capellan,including the newly provided documents from the philippine military officials and other materials,the record shows no evaluation of this evidence by the nprc,the regional office,or any united states military authority.the regional office decision did not state that any of capellan evidence had been provided to the nprc or any other authority for review.the denial informed capellan of her right to appeal,which would commence by filing a notice of disagreement with the regional office.
capellan submitted a notice of disagreement,attaching some previously submitted documentation from various philippine authorities,including a document dated march,from the philippine veterans affairs office stating that it certified that santiago capellan is a veteran of world war revolution who served with reg.div.pa with the pvt,that his service was in the usaffe,and that an old age pension for his widow fortunata capellan based on his service was approved on june.capellan also refiled an october,affidavit of major jose javier,the commanding officer of the b company,battalion,infantry regiment division,which included the following

the regional office held a hearing in manila on september.in addition to the documentary records,capellan and two family members testified that her husband was killed in action while serving in the usaffe.they provided a photograph of capellan in military uniform,and a group photo with his battalion.the regional office then denied the claim,stating that the army report was dispositive and that the entirety of the evidence provided by capellan can not be accepted as proof of military service of your deceased husband in absence of substantiating evidence in the records of the army.the regional office did not discuss any of the evidence,and sought no substantiation from the united states or philippine military authorities.
capellan appealed to the board of veterans appeals,which held that the duties to notify and to assist should be applied,and remanded to obtain additional development and full compliance with the va due process requirements.on march,the va appeals management center wrote to capellan and asked her to please provide us with any evidence or information you may have pertaining to your appeal.provide medical evidence that you have not already submitted that will show that the deceased had valid military service.the letter stated that the va was responsible for retrieving r elevant records from any federal agency,and would make reasonable efforts to get r elevant records not held by a federal agency.capellan was instructed to give us enough information about your records so that we can request them from the person or agency that has them.the letter also stated it your responsibility to make sure that we receive all requested records that are in the possession of a federal department or agency.
on april,capellan replied to the appeals management center and referred to the evidence in her file,pointing to the affidavits from persons who knew capellan and witnessed his military service and saw his death in action at bataan.she stated that his body was never recovered,and that there was thus no medical evidence of his death.the appeals management center then denied her claim,stating that t he evidence clearly indicates that santiago capellan has no recognized guerrilla service,nor was he a member of the commonwealth army of the philippines in the service of the armed forces of the united states.the decision did not discuss any of capellan evidence,and it appears that the center relied solely on the army report in reaching its conclusion,stating that substantial evidence to refute this conclusion had not been submitted.the center did not say how or if the center had assisted,although it stated that a march letter met the va duty to notify the claimant of her rights.
capellan appealed to the board,and summarized the material she had submitted as follows
