introduction 
petitioners own pharmacies in marin and yolo counties and used to be paid by the state on a basis for dispensing prescription drugs to medicaid beneficiaries.however,in late,the state required medicaid eligible seniors and persons with disabilities to be enrolled in managed health plans.as a result,in,petitioners became part of partnership health plan of california managed care network of pharmacies.petitioners claim the rates they are paid by partnership are so low they are being driven to the brink of insolvency.they contend partnership failure to take their costs into account violates the quality of care and equality of access provisions of section a a of the social security act hereafter section a,subd.a a.petitioners ground their section a claims on the ninth circuit court of appeals decision in orthopaedic hosp.belshe cir orthopaedic hosp,in which the circuit court held section a requires that medicaid rates be reasonably related to provider costs and that states must base rates on cost studies.
partnership demurred to the writ petition on several grounds,including that section a applies only to programs,and not to managed care.the trial court agreed,sustained the demurrer and ultimately dismissed the writ petition.we affirm,but for a different reason.regardless of whether section a is applicable in the context of managed care,we conclude petitioners section a claims are no longer viable in the wake of the ninth circuit decision in managed pharmacy care sebelius cir managed pharmacy care,in which the circuit court repudiated its holding in orthopaedic hosp.
ii.background 
statutory framework 
a rudimentary understanding of the medicaid program is necessary to understand the allegations of the writ petition.we therefore start with a general overview of the applicable statutes and regulations.
evolution of federal law 
medicaid is a cooperative program through which the federal government reimburses states for certain medical expenses incurred on behalf of needy persons.managed pharmacy care,supra at,quoting alaska of health and soc.services ctrs.for medicare medicaid services cir,alaska dhss.states do not have to participate in medicaid,but those that choose to do so must comply both with statutory requirements imposed by the medicaid act and with regulations promulgated by the secretary of the department of health and human services secretary.managed pharmacy care,supra,at,quoting alaska dhss,supra,at.
congress established the medicaid program in.june,see life care centers of america caloptima th,d life care.the program is jointly funded by the federal and state governments and is administered by the states.the states determine eligibility,the types of services covered,payment levels for services,and other aspects of administration,within the confines of federal law.clayworth bonta d,clayworth,rev on another ground,fed.appx.cir.
states must submit to a federal agency cms centers for medicare medicaid services,a division of the department of health and human services a state medicaid plan that details the nature and scope of the state medicaid program.it must also submit any amendments to the plan it may make from time to time.and it must receive the agency approval of the plan and any amendments.douglas independent living center of southern california.congress expressly delegated to the secretary the responsibility and the authority to administer the medicaid program and to review state medicaid plans and plan amendments for compliance with federal law.managed pharmacy care,supra,at.
section a of the social security act enumerates the required contents of a state plan,subd.a.section a,in particular,requires that a state plan must provide such methods and procedures relating to the utilization of,and the payment for,care and services available under the plan as may be necessary to safeguard against unnecessary utilization of such care and services and to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency,economy,and quality of care and are sufficient to enlist enough providers so that care and services are available under the plan at least to the extent that such care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area,subd.a a.
exactly what section a requires of states in terms of payments to providers has been the subject of considerable litigation.see.may,discussing cases and noting at the time there was no consensus among the circuits.in orthopaedic,for example,the ninth circuit held the section requires that payments bear a reasonable relationship to an efficient and economical provider costs in providing quality care,and the circuit court remanded with directions to the state to undertake responsible cost studies that will provide reliable data as to the provider costs in providing efficient,quality care.orthopaedic,supra,at.orthopaedic hosp.paved the way for a series of ninth circuit cases reiterating and applying its holding in various contexts,california pharmacists maxwell jolly cir,state legislature must engage in analysis required in orthopaedic hosp.in fixing reimbursement rates independent living center of southern california maxwell jolly cir,state is required to rely on responsible cost studies in setting reimbursement rates see also california hospital maxwell jolly th,d agreeing with orthopaedic hosp.that state must consider provider costs in setting reimbursement rates.
in its recent decision in managed pharmacy care,however,the ninth circuit reversed course and held section a does not require states to consider provider costs in setting rates.managed pharmacy care,supra,at.the statute says nothing about cost studies.it says nothing about any particular methodology.id.at.the court further observed every other circuit that had considered the issue also had held section a does not require any particular methodology.id.at pp.see also california for health services at home state of health care services th,d similarly concluding section a does not require states to utilize any particular methodology in setting reimbursement rates,nor does it require the state to consider provider costs in performing its rate review,much less ensure that its rates bear a reasonable relationship to such costs.we discuss the scope and import of section a in more detail in the next section of this opinion.
fee for service model and shift to managed care 
when the medicaid program was created,coverage typically was provided through reimbursements by the state agency to health care providers who submitted claims for payment after they provided health care services to medicaid beneficiaries.this reimbursement arrangement is referred to as fss payment.june.not surprisingly,then,i nitially,there were no statutory or regulatory provisions specifically addressing the use of managed care by state agencies.id.at.
during ensuing years,pressure grew to provide medicaid funded services through managed care programs.in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of,enacted on august,congress amended the social security act to allow state agencies to mandate that medicaid beneficiaries enroll in managed care organizations.june.while states were empowered to mandate enrollment in managed care,to implement such programs they were generally required to obtain a waiver of the medicaid statutory requirement for beneficiary freedom of choice of providers.ibid.
after the passage of the budget act,states increasingly provided medicaid coverage through contracts with managed care organizations,such as health maintenance organizations through these contracts a managed care organization is paid a fixed,prospective,monthly payment for each beneficiary enrolled with the entity for health coverage.this payment approach is referred to as capitation.beneficiaries enrolled in capitated managed care organizations are required to receive health care services through the managed care organization that receives the capitation payment.june.
by,percent of all medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in managed care organizations for a comprehensive array of medicaid services.june.at this point,the need for statutory and regulatory provisions pertaining specifically to managed care was acute.accordingly,in the balanced budget act of,enacted on,congress once again amended the social security act,this time adding new provisions pertaining to managed care.june,budget act represent ed the first comprehensive revision to federal statutes governing medicaid managed care in over a decade.specifically,the budget act added section to the social security act and amended section m of the act,subd.m.
these two statutory provisions reduce requirements for state agencies to obtain waivers to implement certain managed care programs eliminate enrollment composition requirements for managed care contracts increase beneficiary protections for enrollees in medicaid managed care entities improve quality assurance establish solvency standards protect against fraud and abuse permit a period of guaranteed eligibility for medicaid beneficiaries and improve certain administrative features of state managed care programs.june.
the secretary,in turn,promulgated an extensive regulatory scheme implementing the new legislation,set forth in code of federal regulations part.et.the secretary drew on two decades of studies and oversight of managed care programs to identify the approaches,tools,and techniques that we believed would most effectively measure and improve health care quality in managed care.june.
california medicaid program med al 
california medicaid program is known as medi cal.clayworth,supra,d at.it is administered by the california department of health services and operates on both a and managed care basis.ibid.
in connection with the fee for service process the department determines whether the healthcare services were medically necessary and,if so,pays the service providers directly.citation.when the department pays service providers directly,it follows a schedule of benefits welf,many of which are subject to utilization controls,such as prior authorization by a department consultant,a postservice prepayment audit,a limitation on the number of services,and a separate review of the services provided.life care,supra,th at.
alternatively,the department administers medi cal through various managed care models operated by public and private entities under contract.welf.the purpose of these managed care programs is to reduce costs,prevent unnecessary utilization,reduce inappropriate utilization,and assure adequate access to quality care for medicaid recipients.citation.life care,supra,th at pp.
one legislatively authorized managed care model is a county organized health system,such as partnership health plan.life care,supra,th at.in the omnibus budget act of,congress both acknowledged this particular species of managed care entity which,in federal parlance,is called a health insuring organization and exempted it from the statutory requirements otherwise applicable to a managed care organization as defined under federal law.june.
county organized health systems operate under a legislative scheme set forth in welfare and institutions code sections to.life care,supra,th at.such a system operates under a contract negotiated by the california medical assistance commission now,by the department on behalf of the state.welf,subd a,c.rather than operating under specific statutory mandates,the county is bound by the rules,terms,and conditions negotiated under the contract.in addition,standard contracts require the county organized health system to develop,implement and maintain utilization management controls.life care,supra,th at.thus,unless the contract expressly incorporates statutory provisions otherwise applicable to the state department of health services in providing medi cal services directly through programs,a county organized health system is not subject to such provisions.id.at pp.
a county organized health system is paid on a fixed,or capitated basis for each medi cal recipient,regardless of the level of services used by each recipient.in turn,the health system assumes the financial risk of its members care and pays health service providers directly.welf.life care,supra,th at.section also confers upon counties operating a county organized health system broad authority to determine the manner in which it reimburses care providers.id.at.in short,the legislature granted county organized health systems the authority to negotiate a broad range of payment terms with health care providers,subject only to the restriction that the amount payable not exceed the estimate under the medi cal program.ibid.the state may,of course,contractually restrict a county payment rates and practices.ibid.the state also is required to monitor each county organized health system as to the level and quality of services rendered,the costs incurred,and compliance with federal law.welf.ibid.
prior to the enactment of the medicaid statutes pertaining specifically to managed care,california operated medi cal managed care programs through various waivers issued by the secretary under section b of the social security act.one of these waivers allowed for the use of health insuring organizations called,as we have discussed,county organized health systems under state law,pursuant to which partnership health plan has operated a managed care system.
with this general background,we now turn to petitioners allegations.
b.the allegations of the petition 
we recite only the allegations pertinent to the issue on appeal,namely whether petitioners have stated a claim against partnership health plan under section a.in this regard,petitioners allege the following 
in october,the state enacted legislation requiring medicaid eligible seniors and persons with disabilities to be enrolled in medi cal managed care plans,so long as the state obtained the necessary waiver under section of the social security act.the following month,the secretary through the centers for medicare medicaid services granted such waiver for a medicaid demonstration entitled california bridge to reform california demonstration.the waiver covers the period from november,through october.
the waiver and its special terms and conditions allowed the state department of health care services to contract with partnership health plan to arrange for the provision of pharmacy services to medicaid eligible seniors and persons with disabilities through contracting pharmacies.
as a result,on july,thousands of seniors and persons with disabilities in marin and mendocino counties who formerly received their medi cal pharmacy services under a statewide medi cal program were mandatorily enrolled en masse into partnership health plan,a medi cal managed care entity.petitioners pharmacies,likewise,became part of the network of pharmacies in partnership medi cal pharmacy program.
the pharmacies contract directly with medimpact,a pharmacy benefit manager which performs data processing for partnership.however,it is partnership health plan,itself,that authorizes and approves payment rates or amounts paid to pharmacies in the network,adopts the drug formulary and the policies for approving treatment authorization requests for the network,ultimately approves or disapproves every treatment authorization request submitted by a pharmacy on behalf of the medi cal beneficiary,determines which generic drugs are subject to a maximum allowable cost limit on reimbursement for the pharmacy acquisition cost,and sets the amount of the maximum allowable cost limit for each generic drug.
there is a significant disparity between the reimbursement provided by private third party payors and by partnership for pharmacy services and prescription drugs,and the pharmacies are sustaining net losses on virtually all or most of their sales in the partnership program.
section a allegedly manifestly applies to setting rates for partnership health plan pharmacy program.p rocedurally,section a allegedly requires partnership to consider the statutory factors of efficiency,economy,and quality of care in setting a pharmacy provider rate.s ubstantively,the statute allegedly requires that payments be set or paid that bear a reasonable relationship to efficient and economic pharmacies costs of providing quality services.to do this,partnership must rely on responsible cost studies.additionally,partnership can not set rates in which budgetary considerations are the sole or conclusive consideration.
thus,partnership allegedly procedurally violates section a systematically by having systems,policies,practices,and payments which are based on purely budgetary,financial,considerations,made without regard to the factor of quality of care.or,stated another way,there is a procedural violation of section a in that the rates are set so substantially below the costs of pharmacies to the medicines,that they could not have been set with any consideration of quality of care or of costs of pharmacies to furnish quality care to their patients.italics omitted.partnership similarly substantively violates section a systematically by having systems,policies,and practices and payments which pay pharmacies payments that bear no relationship to pharmacies costs to medications.or,stated another way,there is a substantive violation of section a because rates bear no rational relationship to pharmacies costs to the vast majority of the prescriptions.
as relief,petitioners seek a writ requiring partnership health plan,among other things,to adopt new pharmacy rates i for their cost to acquire both brand drug products and drug products,and ii for their overhead cost,per prescription,which rate or rates of payment,including payments to reimburse for acquisition costs,and dispensing fee payments to reimburse for overhead costs to dispense a prescription,which shall be reasonably related to costs of pharmacies to furnish quality pharmacy and prescription services and shall comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of section.petitioners similarly seek a writ requiring partnership to cease utilizing its maximum allowable cost policy for generic drugs and to adopt a new policy which complies with section a.in the interim,petitioners ask that partnership be required to pay the rates currently being paid in the statewide medi cal program.they also ask that the court review new rates and policies to insure conformance with the requirements of section a.
c.the demurrer and dismissal 
partnership demurred to the petition on several grounds,including that section a does not apply to managed care.the trial court agreed.it concluded partnership is a managed care organization,and as a matter of statutory construction,partnership obligation to insure quality care is governed by section of the social security act,not section a,subd.a a.although granted leave to amend,petitioners chose not to do so,and the court dismissed the writ petition with prejudice.
iii.discussion 
as we have discussed,in managed pharmacy care,the ninth circuit repudiated its decision in orthopaedic hosp.orthopaedic hosp.involved a traditional medi cal program.the circuit court held section a requires state payments to providers to bear a reasonable relationship to an efficient and economical provider costs in providing quality care and to accomplish that mandate,states must undertake responsible cost studies that will provide reliable data as to the provider costs in providing efficient,quality care.orthopaedic,supra,at.
this view was not shared by other circuits,or by the secretary,and in managed pharmacy care,which also involved a program,the ninth circuit reversed course.observing the language of section a is broad and diffuse,the court concluded the secretary interpretation of the amorphous language is entitled in great deference managed pharmacy care,supra,at pp.
accordingly,in managed pharmacy care,the ninth circuit held,as had other circuits,that section a does not require states to consider provider costs in setting rates.managed pharmacy care,supra,at.rather,by its terms section a requires a substantive result reimbursement rates must be consistent with efficiency,and quality care,and sufficient to enlist enough providers to ensure adequate beneficiary access.congress did not purport to instruct the secretary how to accomplish these substantive goals.that decision is left to the agency.id.at.while provider costs might be pertinent,the court observed that also might not be the case,depending on the circumstances of each state plan.each state participating in medicaid has unique,local interests that come to bear.the secretary must be free to consider,for each state,the most appropriate way for that state to demonstrate compliance with section a.ibid.
fairly read,petitioners claims are all predicated on orthopaedic hosp.now repudiated holding that section a requires that provider costs be taken into account in determining payment rates and that states must conduct cost studies before setting rates.in supplemental briefing,petitioners asserted they have also alleged a more generic claim,that partnership payment rates are not consistent with quality care.this excised reading of their allegations,however,requires the reader to turn a blind eye to the vast majority of their allegations,which include express citations to orthopaedic hosp.it also ignores the relief they seek a writ requiring partnership to set new reimbursement rates based on petitioners costs to acquire pharmaceutical products,overhead costs,and service costs,so that rates are reasonably related to costs of pharmacies to furnish quality pharmacy and prescription services.
in further supplemental briefing,petitioners contended they have stated a claim under the third circuit recent decision in christ the king manor,secretary united states department of health and human services cir christ the king manor.christ the king manor also involved a traditional program,for nursing home care.this case arose as a challenge under the federal administrative procedure act to the secretary approval of a supplemental state plan amendment.while the third circuit partially reversed summary judgment for the secretary,it did not back away from its view that section a does not impose any particular method or process on a state as to how it achieves the statute substantive mandate to assure that payments to providers produce four outcomes efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access to providers.id.at,quoting.pharmacists houstoun cir.pharmacists assn rite aid,houstoun cir,rite aid.
rather,the circuit court held the sparse administrative record before it,which contained no studies or analyses of any kind,was insufficient to show that the proposed plan amendment,applying a purported temporary adjustment factor that reduced nursing home reimbursement rates below what would otherwise be paid under the state formula,complied with section a.christ the king manor,supra,at.the court explained that while the reduction might not affect quality of care,the contrary might also be true,particularly after years of utilizing what was supposed to have been a temporary adjustment factor.id.at.what the secretary could not do was simply conclude,without any data,that because prior cuts did not seem too painful,a deeper cut would not hurt.ibid.similarly,the secretary could not rely solely on the fact other statutes pertaining to nursing homes imposed quality care standards or on the state unsupported assertion its plan would continue to meet section a requirements.id.at pp.
unlike christ the king manor,we are not dealing with traditional rate setting,or with a state plan or supplemental plan amendment subject to approval by the secretary,or with an administrative record like that before the third circuit being challenged under the federal administrative procedures act.moreover,the third circuit reaffirmed its view that even in the traditional context,section a does not require any specific rate methodology and the secretary has great discretion in determining how the four outcomes required by section a efficiency,economy,quality of care,and adequate access to providers are achieved.at pp.section a,unlike the boren amendment,does not demand that payments be set at levels that are sufficient to cover provider costs,but instead requires that they be sufficient to meet recipients needs.id.at,quoting.pharmacists,supra,at,italics added.thus,section a allows states to set a rate methodology using any
