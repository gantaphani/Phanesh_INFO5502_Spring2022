carlos gutierrez filed claims for supplemental security income ssi.the commissioner denied the claims by initial determination,and gutierrez requested a de novo hearing by an administrative law judge alj.the alj conducted the sequential evaluation process described in and concluded at the fifth step that gutierrez did not suffer from a disability because he could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy.the alj found that despite gutierrez residual functional capacity,age,education,and work experience,he could make the vocational adjustment to other work as an assembler jobs in the state of california and jobs in the nation or as an almond blancher jobs in the state of california and jobs in the nation.the district court denied his appeal from the commissioner final decision.
gutierrez raises one issue on appeal whether the alj failed to make an adequate showing that a significant number of jobs existed in the region in which gutierrez lived or in several regions of the country.this issue in turn requires us to grapple with the meaning in the controlling statute of the term region,which the commissioner has not yet formally defined.
we have jurisdiction over this timely appeal pursuant to g and,and we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
carlos gutierrez gutierrez,who lives in bakersfield,california,filed claims in and for ssi under title xvi of the social security act,asserting that he had been disabled since september,due to his various recognized medical and mental conditions.
the social security commissioner denied gutierrez claims,concluding that although gutierrez may not have been able to perform his past work,based on his age,education,and past work experience,he could still do other physically less demanding work.thus,gutierrez condition was not severe enough to prohibit him from working.
on april,gutierrez requested reconsideration of the commissioner decision,which was denied.
gutierrez requested a de novo hearing before an alj on august.the alj used the familiar sequential evaluation process outlined in to determine whether gutierrez suffered from a disability under the social security act.gutierrez passed the initial four steps,but his claim foundered on step five.
after considering gutierrez age,education,work experience,and residual functional capacity,the alj concluded that jobs existed in significant numbers in the national economy which gutierrez could perform.relying on the vocational expert ve testimony at the hearing on november,the alj found that gutierrez could work as an assembler,as there were jobs available in california and such jobs available nationally.the alj also found that gutierrez could work as an almond blancher,because there were jobs available in california and such jobs available nationally.thus,because gutierrez could perform jobs in california and jobs in the nation,the alj concluded that gutierrez did not suffer from a disability under the social security act.
the appeals council denied gutierrez request for review.thus,the alj decision became the final decision of the commissioner of social security.
gutierrez brought a civil action in the eastern district of california.the district court determined that the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence and was based on proper legal standards.gutierrez astrue,cv dlb,wl,at.
first,the court addressed gutierrez primary argument that the alj had erred at step five by failing to demonstrate that gutierrez could perform substantial gainful work which exist ed in the national economy.gutierrez asserted that even though a b defined work which exists in the national economy as work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country,the alj erred by considering the state of california to be a region for purposes of a b.
in rejecting gutierrez argument,the court relied on de la cruz astrue,cv dlb,wl,at.may,where the same court had previously rejected similar arguments.gutierrez,wl,at.in de la cruz,the court held that jobs in california was sufficient for purposes of a b.wl,at.the court in de la cruz looked to barrett barnhart,cir per curiam,in which the seventh circuit had acknowledged that vocational experts who testify concerning availability of jobs that the applicant has the physical ability to perform almost always confine their testimony to indicating the number of such jobs that exist in the applicant state,or an even smaller area.id.at quoting barrett,at.after recounting the reasoning in de la cruz,the district court held that positions across california constituted work that existed in significant numbers in the region where gutierrez lived.
second,the court addressed gutierrez contention that the court should adopt the geographical delineations provided by the metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas to define region.according to the office of management and budget,a metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas is an area containing a recognized population nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus.standards for defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.
in rejecting this argument,the court held that the social security act and the social security commissioner regulations adequately defined region.the court explained that a specifies that it does not matter whether work exists in the immediate area where a claimant lives,but that c.b,on the other hand,provides that i solated jobs that exist only in very limited numbers in relatively few locations outside of the region where a claimant lives are not considered work which exists in the national economy.because the court found that the statute and regulation provided sufficient direction to define region,the court declined to define region as one of the metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.as such,the court found that the state of california was a region under a b and that,therefore,the alj had not erred.
standard of review 
the court reviews a district court judgment upholding an alj denial of social security benefits de novo.see berry astrue,cir.however,the court reviews an alj factual findings for substantial evidence.g.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.hill astrue,cir quoting sandgathe chater,cir.the court must consider the record as a whole and weigh both the evidence that supports and the evidence that detracts from the alj factual conclusions.mayes massanari,f d,cir.if the evidence can reasonably support either affirming or reversing,the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commissioner.reddick chater,cir.
nevertheless,a decision supported by substantial evidence will still be set aside if the alj did not apply proper legal standards.bray comm r of soc.sec,cir see also benton barnhart,cir requiring that a commissioner decision be free of legal error.
under the social security act,a claimant is considered disabled if he is unable to engage in substantial gainful activity due to a medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.a a.however,that statutory definition of disability is qualified as follows 
a n individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy,regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives,or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him,or whether he would be hired if he applied for work.
id.a b emphasis added.that same section defines in the national economy 
for purposes of the preceding sentence with respect to any individual,work which exists in the national economy means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.
id.emphasis added.the accompanying regulations reiterate that work exists in the national economy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region where the individual lives or in several other regions of the country.a.
the alj did not err by defining region for purposes of a b as the state of california,and jobs in california constitutes a significant number of jobs in the region.
section a b defines,work in the national economy in the disjunctive.in beltran astrue,this court noted that 
t he statute in question indicates that the significant number of jobs can be either regional jobs the region where a claimant resides or in several regions of the country national jobs 
if we find either of the two numbers significant,then we must uphold the alj decision.
cir.gutierrez argues that the alj erred in the first part of this disjunctive test by equating the state of california with the region where such individual lives,and that the alj erred by finding that jobs qualifies as a significant number.
a.the metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas as a definition of region.
gutierrez contends that we must interpret the region where such individual lives according to the metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas mmsas delineated by the office of management and budget omb for use by the united states census bureau.see appendix.
mmsas are defined by population a metro area contains a core urban area of or more population,and a micro area contains an urban core of at least but less than population.united states census bureau,metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas main,http.each metro or micro area includes the counties containing the core urban area,as well as any adjacent counties that have a high degree of social and economic integration as measured by commuting to work with the urban core.id.the omb establishes and maintains the delineations of the mmsas solely for statistical purposes.office of mgmt.budget,exec.office of the president,omb bulletin,revised delineations of metropolitan statistical areas,micropolitan statistical areas,and combined statistical areas,and guidance on uses of the delineations of those areas at,available at b.the classification of the mmsas is intended to produce nationally consistent delineations for collecting,tabulating,and publishing federal statistics for a set of geographic areas.id.
gutierrez asks us to find that bakersfield delano,one of california metropolitan statistical areas with a population of,qualifies as his region for purposes of a b.at first blush,gutierrez proposal may seem fitting,given that the regulations provide 
when the commissioner determine s that unskilled,sedentary,light,and medium jobs exist in the national economy in significant numbers either in the region where a claimant live s or in several regions of the country,the commissioner will take administrative notice of reliable job information from various governmental and other publications including census reports,also published by the bureau of the census.
however,gutierrez proposed definition of region suffers from two irremediable flaws.first,the mmsas do not account for many areas around the country.the deputy director of management for the omb acknowledged that the mmsas do not account for counties in the united states.office of mgmt.budget,exec.office of the president,supra,at of counties in the united states,will be in the metropolitan statistical areas in the united states,and counties will be in the micropolitan statistical areas counties are outside the classification.moreover,the general concept of a metropolitan statistical area or a micropolitan statistical area is that of an area containing a recognized population nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus.standards for defining metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas,proposed,emphasis added.because the mmsas do not account for areas without a high degree of integration with a recognized population nucleus,superimposing the mmsas onto the concept of region under a b could distort future disability benefit claims for claimants who do not live within the omb circumscribed metropolitan or micropolitan areas.
second,the omb deputy director also explicitly cautioned that the mmsa delineations should not be used to develop and implement f ederal,state,and local nonstatistical programs and policies without full consideration of the effects of using these delineations for such purposes.office of mgmt.budget,exec.office of the president,supra,at.the deputy director added that t hese areas should not serve as a geographic framework for nonstatistical activities id.emphasis added.the task of fully considering the effects of the mmsas for a nonstatistical program like that of the social security administration should fall to congress not to this court.
accordingly,because the mmsas do not account for many areas within the country and are not appropriate for nonstatistical programs like the social security administration,we reject gutierrez proposed definition of region as one of the mmsas.
region does not mean immediate area.
gutierrez next asserts that the statutory reference to the region where a claimant lives means in the immediate area in which he resides.gutierrez also argues that the identification of a region for the purposes of work activity must be limited by a reasonable commuting distance because i t would constitute an unreasonable expectation that gutierrez would drive from bakersfield to san francisco for an unskilled job that pays minimum wage.in determining what would be a reasonable commuting distance,gutierrez would have the commissioner consider how much an applicant would be paid once he arrived at the job site,and presumably also the cost of commuting.
in support of his immediate area argument,which is not without some superficial appeal,gutierrez quotes a,selectively focusing on the word immediate in an explanatory parenthetical in his brief which reads it does not matter whether work exists in the immediate area in which you live.however,the entirety of a states 
work which exists in the national economy.
a general.we consider that work exists in the national economy when it exists in significant numbers either in the region where you live or in several other regions of the country.it does not matter whether 
work exists in the immediate area in which you live 
a specific job vacancy exists for you or 
you would be hired if you applied for work.
a emphases added.as the language of a thus demonstrates,the term region is not equivalent to a claimant immediate area.region is not synonymous with immediate area.
likewise,c reiterates that whether work exists in the claimant local area is irrelevant for purposes of determining whether work exists in the national economy.that section reads 
c inability to obtain work.we will determine that you are not disabled if your residual functional capacity and vocational abilities make it possible for you to do work which exists in the national economy,but you remain unemployed because of 
your inability to get work 
lack of work in your local area 
the hiring practices of employers 
technological changes in the industry in which you have worked 
cyclical economic conditions 
no job openings for you 
you would not actually be hired to do work you could otherwise do,or 
you do not wish to do a particular type of work.
c emphasis added.again,the regulations flowing from the statute are clear that region is not limited by statute or by regulations to the local or immediate area of the claimant.
furthermore,we have held that the relevant job area for purposes of the statutory definition of disability need not be the claimant local area.see torske richardson,cir per curiam.in torske,the district court had held that the inclusion of the portland area miles away from the claimant home as a labor market available to the claimant was unreasonable.id.although we did not define region,we rejected the district court holding,e
