a state administrative agency nonsensical interpretation of the statute here at issue,and the harm it causes people,illustrates why courts do not always defer to an agency interpretation.
since,plaintiff michelle basden,a disabled adult,received medical and personal care in her home through the supportive services program ihss.ihss is a state social welfare program designed to avoid institutionalization of incapacitated persons.it provides supportive services to aged,blind,or disabled persons who can not perform the services themselves and who can not safely remain in their homes unless the services are provided to them.the program compensates persons who provide the services to a qualifying incapacitated person.
plaintiff mother provided care to plaintiff and was compensated for it under the ihss program.the bulk of plaintiff care consisted of protective supervision.
at the same time plaintiff mother provided care to plaintiff,she also provided care to plaintiff brother,andrew,who also was a disabled adult who lived at the home.the ihss program compensated plaintiff mother for the care she gave to andrew.
upon moving to a different county,plaintiff and andrew participation in the ihss program was reassessed as required by law.both sought to have their mother continue providing their care funded under the ihss program,and to do so effectively for each.plaintiff again sought compensation for her mother primarily to provide protective supervision.
the new county approved andrew receiving care from his mother.however,it determined plaintiff was not sufficiently incapacitated to require protective supervision services,and it denied plaintiff those services at ihss expense.
plaintiff appealed the county decision to the state department of social services department,the agency responsible for implementing the ihss program.defendant john wagner,the department director the director,denied plaintiff appeal,but he did so differently than did the county.relying on a statute the county did not reference,the director determined plaintiff did not qualify for any care from her mother,including protective supervision services.
the statute,subdivision e of welfare and institutions code section section e,in general,prevents compensating a parent under the ihss program for providing services to a child unless the parent has left employment to care for the child.the director decided plaintiff mother had not left employment to care for plaintiff as she was already employed under the ihss program caring for andrew.the director denied plaintiff appeal on this ground,concluding plaintiff was not entitled to any compensated service provided by her mother.
plaintiff sought extraordinary relief in the trial court.the trial court,however,agreed with the director and denied plaintiff writ petition.
plaintiff appealed the trial court judgment.before us,she claims the director erred in applying section e to her because section e limitation applies only to parents of minor children,not to parents of adult children such as her.following our request for additional briefing,plaintiff also claims section e does not apply because her mother,care for andrew does not constitute employment for purposes of the statute.
we agree with plaintiff on the latter point and reverse the trial court judgment.section e reference to employment does not include providing,care by a parent to a child so as to bar the parent from being compensated for providing,care to another of her children.to interpret the statute otherwise would frustrate the ihss program very purpose 
statutory background 
in,the legislature enacted the ihss program to enable aged,blind or disabled poor persons to avoid institutionalization by remaining in their homes with proper supportive services.welf,et supportive services are described in discrete categories,such as domestic services,personal care services,and protective supervision,to name a few,subd.b.
the department promulgates regulations that implement the program,and county welfare departments administer the program under the department supervision.counties process applications for ihss,determine the individual eligibility and needs,and authorize services.the county either obtains and pays the provider of the services,or it pays the recipient who hires a provider.miller woods d,miller.
the total amount of services provided to any one person is limited by statute.severely impaired recipients may receive up to hours per month,or approximately hours per week,of supportive services paid through the program.less severely impaired recipients may receive up to hours per month,or approximately hours per week.
the department regulations provide some relief from these strict hour limitations as they may apply to protective supervision services.when two or more ihss recipients are living together and both require protective supervision,the need shall be treated as a common need and prorated accordingly.manual of policies and procedures mpp.this is done to ensure as much as possible of the total common need for protective supervision may be met within the payment and hourly maximums.ibid.at oral argument,counsel for the director admitted this regulation allows one provider to be authorized to provide protective supervision services to more than one person residing in the same home.
the issues before us arise from the department interpretation and application of section e.under section e,a parent will not be paid through the ihss program for providing supportive services to a child unless the parent has left employment to care for her child or is unemployed on account of providing supportive services to her child.the statute reads in relevant part where supportive services are provided by a person having the legal duty pursuant to the family code to provide for the care of his or her child who is the recipient,the provider of supportive services shall receive remuneration for the services only when the provider leaves employment or is prevented from obtaining employment because no other suitable provider is available and where the inability of the provider to provide supportive services may result in inappropriate placement or inadequate care.e,italics added.
plaintiff claims her mother being compensated under the ihss program to provide care to her brother does not constitute employment for purposes of section e.the director disagrees,claiming plaintiff mother and compensated care of her other child constitutes employment for purposes of section e and bars her from being compensated for providing any ihss to plaintiff.
facts and procedural history 
the relevant facts are not in dispute.plaintiff is years old.she is incapacitated.she suffers from mental retardation,asthma,and sleep apnea.she lives in madera county with her parents,james and darlene basden,who serve as her conservators,and with her older brother,andrew,who also suffers from mental retardation.
the family lived in san diego county prior to moving to madera.while in san diego,both plaintiff and andrew received ihss,including protective supervision services.plaintiff received a total of ihss hours per month,or about hours per week.the record does not disclose the number of hours of ihss andrew received,but there is no factual dispute that andrew received more than hours per week of ihss.their mother,darlene,was compensated under the ihss program for providing ihss to both of them.
when the family moved to madera county,the children cases were transferred there,and madera county as required by law reassessed their eligibility for ihss,subds.a,d mmp.madera county authorized andrew to receive a total of hours of ihss per month,or about hours per week,including protective supervision.it designated darlene as the care provider.
regarding plaintiff,madera county proposed reducing her monthly ihss hours from to,or about seven hours per week.in particular,the county determined plaintiff did not require protective supervision services,resulting in a reduction of monthly ihss hours.the county determination was not based on section e,but was rather based on whether plaintiff qualified for protective supervision services.the county said nothing about darlene eligibility to be compensated for providing ihss to both plaintiff and andrew under section e.
plaintiff requested an administrative hearing from the department to contest the county decision not to authorize protective supervision services for her.at the hearing before an administrative law judge,darlene testified that she intended to provide ihss to both plaintiff and andrew and that both required protective supervision.it was undisputed that darlene provides ihss hours to andrew per month,or hours per week,more than a job.
adopting the administrative law judge decision,the director looked beyond the issue of protective supervision and determined plaintiff was not eligible to receive any ihss from her mother,including protective supervision.the director based his decision on section e requirement that the parent provider must leave employment in order to be compensated for providing care under the ihss program.this was the first time section e had been raised in this matter.
first,the director determined section e applied to plaintiff,an adult child,and darlene because the family code imposed on darlene a legal duty to care for plaintiff even as an adult.specifically,family code section imposes on a father and a mother an equal responsibility to maintain,to the extent of their ability,a child of whatever age who is incapacitated from earning a living and without sufficient means,subd.a,italics added.
second,the director determined darlene had not satisfied the unemployment condition imposed by section e for being compensated for providing ihss to plaintiff.the director wrote one of the requirements that must be met under section e is that the has left employment or is prevented from obtaining employment to care for a child.darlene has neither left,nor been precluded from,employment.she is already employed more than full time.she is employed hours per week providing ihss to andrew.unfortunately,plaintiff is not eligible to receive ihss services from her mother.
plaintiff petitioned the sacramento county superior court for a writ of administrative mandate to set aside the director decision.she claimed section e requirement that the must leave employ in order to be paid for providing ihss applied only to parents caring for minor children,not parents caring for adult children.she also contended the evidence established that she required protective supervision services.
the trial court denied plaintiff petition.it agreed with plaintiff that the weight of the evidence established she required protective supervision.however,the court agreed with the director that section e barred the county from paying darlene to provide ihss to plaintiff because darlene was already employed full time providing ihss to andrew and she had not left that employ to care for plaintiff.
plaintiff appeals,claiming the trial court interpretation of section e is wrong.we asked for additional briefing on three issues,the most important of which was whether the director interpretation of the phrase employment in section e,as including being compensated for providing ihss for hours or more per week for one own child,conforms with the legislature intent.plaintiff argues it does not 
discussion 
istandard of review 
the trial court interpretation and construction of a statute is a question of law which we review de novo.coburn sievert th.the rules of statutory interpretation are well known.when construing a statute,we must ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.the words of the statute are the starting point.words used in a statute should be given the meaning they bear in ordinary use.citations.if the language is clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction,nor is it necessary to resort to indicia of the intent of the legislature citation.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,however,the court looks to a variety of extrinsic aids,including the ostensible objects to be achieved,the evils to be remedied,the legislative history,public policy,contemporaneous administrative construction,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.after considering these extrinsic aids,we must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.citation.wilcox birtwhistle cal th.
the department interpretation of section e is one of the extrinsic aids we may utilize when interpreting an ambiguous statute,but it is not conclusive.courts must independently judge the text of the statute,taking into account and respecting an administrative agency interpretation of its meaning,of course,whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal representation.where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue,an agency interpretation is one among several tools available to the court.depending on the context,it may be helpful,enlightening,even convincing.it may sometimes be of little worth.citation.considered alone and apart from the context and circumstances that produce them,agency interpretations are not binding or necessarily even authoritative.to quote the statement of the law revision commission in a recent report,the standard for judicial review of agency interpretation of law is the independent judgment of the court,giving deference to the determination of the agency appropriate to the circumstances of the agency action.judicial review of agency action cal.law revision com,italics added.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th.
meaning of the term employment 
the director interpretation of employment in section d precludes a parent who is not employed outside the home but who is providing,care to one of her disabled children from being compensated for providing any care to any of her other disabled children.
the ihss statutes do not define the phrase employment in section e.the department regulations do not define the phrase.there is nothing in the statute legislative history that offers a meaning to the phrase and there is no evidence the department has ever interpreted the phrase as it did in plaintiff case.
plaintiff asks us to fill this vacuum.she argues the legislature could not have intended employment to have the department interpretation as it runs counter to the ihss program purpose.we agree with plaintiff.
on announcing the ihss program purpose,the courts have been singularly clear.t he legislature enacted the ihss program to enable aged,blind or disabled poor persons to avoid institutionalization by remaining in their homes with proper supportive services.marshall mcmahon th,italics added,fn.omitted.ihss is a state and federally funded program developed to permit persons with disabilities to live safely in their own homes.calderon,supra,th at,italics added see also miller,supra,d at.
although the director asks us to defer to his interpretation of section e,his interpretation thwarts the express legislative purpose.to fulfill that purpose,we can not interpret section e use of employment in a way that could result in plaintiff being required to leave her home in order to obtain the services she needs.yet that is exactly what the director asks us to do.if plaintiff mother is disqualified from providing care to plaintiff because she already provides care to andrew,and no other qualified person is available to provide care to plaintiff,then plaintiff will have to be institutionalized to receive the care she requires even though her mother is in the home and is able to provide the care.this is the thrust of the director interpretation.it obviously is not what the legislature intended.
the director claims the ihss statutes treat providers such as darlene as employees,and he thus concludes their work providing ihss constitutes employment.the director is partially correct.the ihss statutes treat providers as employees for some purposes,but not for all.
ihss providers work pursuant to various arrangements.some are civil service employees of a county
