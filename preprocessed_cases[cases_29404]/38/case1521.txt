syble vaughn and sumner collectively,appellants separately appeal the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court denial of their applications for award of attorney fees and expenses pursuant to the equal access to justice act eaja.the veterans court denied their applications on the ground that neither was a prevailing party.vaughn principi.sumner principi.en banc.because the supreme court decision in buckhannon board care home,west virginia department of health human,d,and this court decision in brickwood contractors,united states,preclude vaughn and sumner from attaining prevailing party status under eaja,this court affirms both decisions.
after the death of her husband in,vaughn applied for various veteran survivor benefits.finding no service connection to the cause of death,the board of veteran appeals bva denied her claims.vaughn appealed the denial to the veterans court.while her appeal was pending,congress enacted the veteran claims assistance act of vcaa,stat.citing the need for in light of the vcaa,the parties filed a joint motion for remand on the issue of service connection to the cause of death and dismissal of the remaining issues.after the veterans court consented to the remand request,vaughn filed an eaja application for attorney fees.the eaja provides,in part,that 
a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the united states fees and other expenses incurred by that party in any civil action,unless the court finds that the position of the united states was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.
d a emphasis added.the secretary of veterans affairs va secretary opposed vaughns eaja application on the grounds that her assertion of prevailing party status was premised on,inter alia,the catalyst theory.
after vaughns eaja application,the supreme court issued its decision in buckhannon.buckhannon addressed the issue of whether a party is entitled to attorney fees as a prevailing party under the catalyst theory.according to the catalyst theory,a prevailing party is one that achieve s the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.buckhannon,at.buckhannon held that the catalyst theory is not a permissible basis for the award of attorney fees under the fhaa fair housing and amendments act of,c,and the ada americans with disabilities act.id.at.
because buckhannon did not explicitly address the catalyst theory as a basis for awarding attorney fees under eaja,the veterans court requested supplemental briefs from vaughn and the va secretary.after considering the supplemental briefs,the veterans court denied vaughn eaja application.the veterans court reasoned that buckhannon precluded vaughn from achieving prevailing party status under the merits,catalyst,or tests based on obtaining a remand solely for in light of the enactment of the vcaa.vaughn.at.
the veterans court similarly denied sumner eaja application.after the bva denied his claim for veteran benefits,sumner appealed to the veterans court.while his appeal was pending,sumner submitted a motion with the bva to reconsider his claim based on newly acquired material evidence.he also filed a motion with veterans court to stay his appeal pending the bva decision on his motion for reconsideration.the veterans court granted the stay and ordered the va secretary to advise the court on whether the bva was inclined to grant the motion for reconsideration and,if so,to file a motion for a cerullo remand.see cerullo derwinski.after advising the appeals court that it was inclined to grant reconsideration,the bva granted sumner motion for reconsideration,stayed the order pending remand from the veterans court,and filed an unopposed motion for remand in accordance with the prior order.after the veterans court remanded,sumner filed an eaja application for award of attorney fees.sumner argued that he was a prevailing party under the merits or catalyst theory.in an en banc decision,the veterans court denied his application,holding that buckhannon precluded sumner from attaining prevailing party status under the merits or catalyst theory.according to the en banc decision,buckhannon and shalala schaefer,d,together hold that granting of prevailing party status requires ultimate receipt of a benefit that was sought in bringing the litigation or,at a minimum,a court remand predicated on administrative error.sumner.at.
vaughn and sumner appealed separately to this court.because the two cases present similar facts and concern the same legal issue,this court addresses both vaughn and sumner appeals with this opinion.
these two cases require this court to determine whether the veterans court applied the proper legal standard in determining whether appellants are prevailing parties under eaja.this court reviews an interpretation of eaja by the veterans court without deference.jones brown.however,this court is precluded from reviewing a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case in the veterans court.d b,halpern principi.
in buckhannon,the supreme court rejected the catalyst theory as a permissible basis for award of attorney fees as a prevailing party.buckhannon board and care home,buckhannon,owned and operated assisted living homes.a state fire marshal inspection found that the buckhannon assisted living homes failed west virginia law requiring all residents to be capable of removing themselves from situations of imminent danger,such as fire.buckhannon,at.buckhannon sued the state in the united states district court for the northern district of west virginia seeking declaratory and injunctive relief that the state law violated the fhaa and the ada.with the case pending in the district court,the state legislature enacted two bills that eliminated the requirement.id.at.as a result,the state moved to dismiss the case as moot.after the district court granted the motion,buckhannon sought attorney fees under the fhaa and ada as a prevailing party based on the theory that the litigation had been the catalyst for achieving ultimate victory outside court.id.at.
in buckhannon,the supreme court drew a bright line distinguishing prevailing parties from plaintiffs not entitled to an award of attorney fees.on one side of the line,an enforceable judgment on the merits and a consent decree permit prevailing party status and an award of attorney fees.id.at.on the other side of the line,achievement of the desired result by the catalyst theory precludes an award of attorney fees as a prevailing party.id.in rejecting the catalyst theory,the court observed a defendant voluntary change in conduct,although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit,lacks the necessary judicial imprimatur on the change.id.at.
buckhannon rejected the catalyst theory as a basis for determining a prevailing party specifically under the fhaa and the ada.in brickwood,at,this court held that buckhannon rejection of the catalyst theory applied to eaja.because brickwood precludes the catalyst theory as a basis for the award of attorney fees under eaja,this court need not address appellant arguments to the contrary.
the issue in the present cases is on which side of the supreme court bright line appellants remands the side with a judgment on the merits and a consent decree that may qualify vaughn and sumner as prevailing parties or on the side in which buckhannon and brickwood preclude an award of attorney fees to mere catalysts.under the catalyst theory,a party achieves the desired result because the lawsuit brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.in both cases appellants received a desired result of their respective remand to allow the bva to reconsider the claim for benefits.and in both cases,appeal of the denial of benefits to the appeals court brought about a voluntary change in the defendant conduct.
in vaughn case,the voluntary change in conduct was the va secretary filing of a motion to remand for based on enactment of the vcaa.in sumner case,the voluntary change in conduct was the va secretary filing of a motion to remand for based on new material
