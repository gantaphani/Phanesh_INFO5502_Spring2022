the social security administration ssa denied newell application for widow disability benefits on april,and again upon reconsideration on june.newell appealed and a hearing was held on february,before administrative law judge alj gerald ryan.on april,alj ryan issued a decision denying her application for benefits.his decision became final on april,after the appeals council denied newell request for administrative review.on june,newell filed a complaint in the district court challenging the commissioner final ruling.the district court affirmed the final decision of the commissioner on december.newell thereafter filed this appeal.
factual background 
newell was born on august,and married robert newell on august.their marriage ended in divorce in june,and she has not remarried.her former husband,a wage earner,died fully insured for social security benefits on august,and newell eligibility for widow benefits based on his earnings terminated at the close of the month seven years after his death,on august,so that her disability had to have commenced by that date for her to be eligible for benefits.see e c 
from through december,newell was doing consulting and craftwork.she estimates that she earned to per year during that time.from december through july,she worked occasionally with a friend who was a carpenter,painting and making stained glass windows.she estimates that she earned per year during that time.in july,newell injured her back when she tripped over a lawn mower.after that incident,she stopped working completely.she also stopped doing yardwork,gardening,washing,and cleaning.
newell contends that she became disabled on july,but could not afford medical care at that time because she was uninsured.beginning on june,however,she did seek medical attention when her father gave her the money to pay for it.accordingly,most of the evidence in her record is comprised of doctors reports dated post august,the date upon which her eligibility for widow benefits expired.newell contends that regardless of the dates on her medical reports,she is entitled to widow benefits because her medical disease,diabetes,and present prior to august.she argues that these conditions are slowly progressive and that they disabled her within the period of her eligibility for benefits.
the medical evidence before alj ryan 
the medical evidence consists of reports from newell family doctor and her orthopedist,reports from the ssa in the form of a residual physical functional capacity assessment and from a consultative examiner,as well as newell testimony regarding her pain and functional limitations.
medical evidence prior to august,
billing records and an emergency room report indicate that newell received services for treatment of an unstable low back and contusion of the wrist in.tr,other billing statements and physical therapy reports from indicate that she was fitted for a custom molded lumbosacral corset,was instructed in home exercises and the use of a hot pack,and was treated for an unstable lower back.tr.prescriptions dated september,and november,indicate that she was prescribed nonsteroidal and tylenol.tr.in december,she was referred for electromyogram emg and nerve conduction studies.tr.another billing statement reflects that she received emergency room services on december,for shoulder joint pain.tr.
medical evidence after august,
most of the medical evidence is comprised of doctors reports dated post august.newell first went to harold chafkin,her family physician,on june.chafkin treated her diabetes and the pain in her knees and back.on august,she began treatment with an orthopedist,alfred greisman.in his notes,greisman mentioned newell liver condition,stating that he was apprehensive about putting her on any nonsteroidals because of her liver condition.tr.his records indicate that newell lost pounds in.tr.the pounds apparently included pounds of muscle.tr.on september,greisman concluded that due to her condition she is unable to drive or travel.tr.in november,newell underwent an emg,which indicated results consistent with peripheral neuropathy.tr.
the medical evidence from the ssa includes a residual physical functional capacity assessment by a physician dated december,and a report from consultative examiner phillip eatough dated march.tr.the residual physical functional capacity assessment indicates that newell occasionally could lift carry pounds frequently lift carry ten pounds stand walk for about six hours in an workday sit for a total of about six hours in an workday and push and pull without limitation.
consultative examiner eatough noted in his report that newell had endured gradual and progressive back problems for approximately seven years neuropathy for approximately two years,possibly related to her diabetes or alcohol excess and diabetes for about two years.he also noted that when she stopped drinking alcohol,she lost about pounds.tr.
eatough impressions included peripheral neuropathy with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and neuropathy of both lower extremities with possible atrophy of the proximal muscle groups diabetes mellitus most probably secondary to chronic alcohol consumption peripheral vascular disease osteoarthritis with low back syndrome,possible sciatica and lumbar neuropathy and liver dysfunction.he found that she occasionally could lift pounds frequently lift ten pounds stand and walk approximately two hours in an workday without a required assistive device and sit about six hours in an workday with periodic standing.he found that her ability to push and pull was limited in the upper and lower extremities secondary to tenderness and neuropathy.he reported that she occasionally could climb,balance,stoop,kneel,crouch,and crawl.he found no manipulative,visual,communicative,or environmental limitations.tr.
less than two months later,on may,newell family physician,chafkin,reported that newell is crippled by severe peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes and alcohol consumption.he noted that her prognosis is poor she has been seen by the neurologists,by the orthopedists and myself and,unfortunately,we have come up with no answer for this poor woman pain which will negate her being gainfully employed in any manner whatsoever.tr.
newell testimony before the alj 
newell testified that at the time of her hearing,she was taking prescription pain relievers,sleep aids,and oral medication for diabetes.she was also taking pain relievers and vitamins.she wore splints for her wrists and a brace for her back.she testified that her pain was severe and that it had prevented her from working or doing any housework since july,when she fell over a lawnmower and hurt her back.tr.she did not seek medical attention until june because she had no insurance.tr.when she went to the doctor,he diagnosed her with diabetes and neuropathy.tr.she testified that she is unable to bathe,dress herself,and drive.tr.
the alj findings 
alj ryan found that newell allegations were not supported by objective medical evidence and were contradicted by her own statements and actions.he noted,for example,that there was no evidence that newell sought or received regular medical treatment from to.nor did she receive treatment for her back injury in.alj ryan also found that it was not until august,a year after she was last eligible for benefits,that she began to experience neuropathy in her lower extremities and that her medical problems worsened.thus,he concluded that prior to august,she did not have a severe impairment that lasted or could be expected to last months or more,which significantly limited her ability to engage in activities.accordingly,he determined that she was not entitled to widow disability benefits.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
we exercise plenary review over the order of the district court,see knepp apfel,cir,but review the decision of the commissioner to determine whether it is supported by substantial evidence.see richardson perales,d.substantial evidence has been defined as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.at.at quoting consolidated edison nlrb.it is more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance.see brown bowen,cir.of course,we exercise plenary review over questions of law.see krysztoforski chater,cir.
statutory and regulatory framework 
in order to establish a disability under the social security act,a claimant must demonstrate that there is some medically determinable basis for an impairment that prevents him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity for a statutory period.stunkard secretary of health human,cir quoting kangas bowen,cir d a.a claimant is considered unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy d a.
the ssa has promulgated regulations incorporating a sequential evaluation process for determining whether a claimant is under a disability.see williams sullivan,cir.the first two steps involve threshold determinations.in step one,the commissioner must determine whether the claimant currently is engaging in substantial gainful activity.burnett comm r soc.sec,cir.if a claimant is found to be engaging in substantial gainful activity,the disability claim will be denied.id.in step two,the commissioner must determine whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.see id.if the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments,the disability claim is denied.see id.in step three,the commissioner compares the medical evidence of the claimant impairment to a list of impairments presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.id.if the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment the disability claim is granted without further analysis.if a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent,the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.id.step four requires the alj to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work.id.the claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to his past relevant work.id.if the claimant does not meet the burden the claim is denied.
if the claimant is unable to resume his former occupation,the evaluation moves to the final step.id.at this stage,the burden of production shifts to the commissioner,who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.id.the commissioner must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform,consistent with his or her medical impairments,age,education,past work experience,and residual functional capacity.id.the alj must analyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant impairments in determining whether he is capable of performing work and is not disabled.id.at.
c.the determination 
as mentioned above,at step two of the sequential inquiry the alj determines whether the claimant has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.see bowen yuckert,d social security ruling ssr,ssr lexis,at ssr,ssr lexis,at.the social security regulations and rulings as well as case law applying them,discuss the severity determination in terms of what is not severe.smolen chater,cir.according to the commissioner regulations,an impairment is not severe if it does not significantly limit the claimant physical ability to do basic work activities.id.quoting c,a.basic work activities are abilities and aptitudes necessary to do most jobs,including,for example,walking,standing,sitting,lifting,pushing,pulling,reaching,carrying or handling.id.quoting b.
the inquiry is a de minimis screening device to dispose of groundless claims.see smolen chater,at mcdonald secretary of health human,cir.an impairment or combination of impairments can be found not severe only if the evidence establishes a slight abnormality or a combination of slight abnormalities which have no more than a minimal effect on an individual ability to work.ssr,ssr lexis,at.only those claimants with slight abnormalities that do not significantly limit any basic work activity can be denied benefits at step two.see bowen yuckert,at.at,concurring.if the evidence presented by the claimant presents more than a slight abnormality,the requirement of severe is met,and the sequential evaluation process should continue.see smolen chater,at.reasonable doubts on severity are to be resolved in favor of the claimant 
the alj denied newell claim at step two on erroneous bases 
according to alj ryan,the objective medical evidence in newell record did not support her allegation of disability and thus he denied her claim at step two of the sequential evaluation.it is true that her record lacks evidence of treatment for liver disease,diabetes,or neuropathy prior to august.nonetheless,this lack of evidence in the particular circumstances of this case did not provide an adequate basis to support a conclusion that newell was not disabled prior to august.we note that several courts have questioned the relevance of infrequent medical visits in determining when or whether a claimant is disabled.for example,the court of appeals for the ninth circuit has held that the fact that a claimant may be one of the millions of people who did not seek treatment for a mental disorder until late in the day was not a substantial basis to reject that an impairment existed.nguyen chater,cir.
in fact,ssr,ssr lexis,at,states that the adjudicator must not draw any inferences about an individual symptoms and their functional effects from a failure to seek or pursue regular medical treatment without first considering any explanations that the individual may provide,or other information in the case record,that may explain infrequent or irregular medical visits or failure to seek medical treatment.here,newell explanation for her failure to seek treatment prior to august,is claims she could not afford treatment until her father gave her money in june.moreover,the record demonstrates that her income during the germane period was very low and that she did not have medical insurance,circumstances that support her claim that she could not afford treatment.accordingly,we disagree with the alj statement that i t is reasonable to assume that if newell was experiencing the degree of pain and functional limitation which she has alleged that she would have sought medical treatment.tr.
it is newell position that her liver disease,diabetes,and neuropathy are slowly progressing conditions that existed well before their documentation in.she argues that her medical record must be studied retr
