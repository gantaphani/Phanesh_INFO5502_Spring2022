appellants ira harvey liss liss and michael spuza spuza appeal their convictions and sentences imposed by the united states district court for the middle district of florida.we affirm in part,vacate in part,and remand for further proceedings.
background 
the community clinical laboratory,ccl was a florida laboratory that conducted blood and urine testing.ccl and its employees developed a scheme to defraud medicare by paying doctors to refer their medicare patients to ccl in return for kickbacks from ccl.in order to pay the doctors for these referrals in a manner that appeared legal,ccl created a scheme of consulting agreements with doctors acting as testing review officers tros.the tro agreements purportedly allowed the doctors to authorize lab work for an individual if his or her own doctor was not available to do so.thus,the tro agreements served to disguise the kickbacks that were given in return for the patient referrals.
in november,ccl entered into a consulting agreement with liss,in which liss agreed to act as a tro in exchange for a month.from november until april,ccl paid liss a total of.liss did not receive any other form of compensation from ccl.medicare reimbursed ccl as a result of liss referrals.the government concedes that all of those referrals were made for legitimate medical reasons.
in august,ccl entered into a consulting agreement with spuza,in which spuza agreed to act as a tro in exchange for a month.from august until april,ccl paid spuza for his tro services.in addition to the tro payments,ccl made equipment sublease payments on behalf of spuza and his mother,felicia spuza,who operated the practice jointly with spuza.these sublease payments totaled.ccl also made office rental payments for the spuzas.these rental payments totaled.the presentence investigation report psi reflects that ccl paid spuza a total of.medicare reimbursed ccl as a result of the referrals made by the spuzas.it is undisputed that those referrals were made for legitimate medical reasons.
a superceding indictment charged liss and spuza with one count of conspiracy to defraud the united states,in violation of,and five counts of receiving remuneration in return for medicare referrals,in violation of b.at liss and spuza joint trial,vincent gepp gepp,a ccl sales representative,testified that the way in which ccl paid the illegal kickbacks included payments for the tro agreements and office and equipment rentals.gepp also testified that ccl made payments for office space and equipment in exchange for spuza referring his patients to ccl for laboratory work.the jury found liss and spuza guilty on all counts.
the psi combined all counts into a single group because the offense level was to be determined by the total amount of harm or loss,pursuant to d.the psi also assigned liss and spuza a base offense level of eight based on,which is the guideline for fraud or deceit.for liss,the psi relied on b e and added four levels to reflect the amount in illegal kickbacks.for spuza,the psi added five levels to reflect the amount in illegal kickbacks,pursuant to b f.the psi then added two levels to both liss and spuza sentences under,asserting that they had breached the trust of medicare by accepting illegal compensation for medicare referrals.the psi assigned another increase to liss for obstruction of justice,contending that liss committed perjury at trial.this resulted in a total offense level of for liss.based on liss absence of a criminal background,the psi did not assess any criminal history points.this resulted in a criminal history category of i and a guideline range of months imprisonment for liss.likewise,based on spuza absence of a criminal background,the psi did not assess any criminal history points.this resulted in a criminal history category of i and a guideline range of months for spuza.pursuant to,the psi set restitution in liss case in the amount of.for spuza,restitution was set in the amount of.
at sentencing,the district court heard extensive arguments on liss objection to the enhancement for abuse of trust.liss asserted that the abuse of trust enhancement should not be applied in his case because,under eleventh circuit case law,he did not occupy a position of trust medicare,and even if he did occupy such a position,his conduct did not constitute an abuse of trust because he did not falsify records or submit fraudulent documents to medicare.the district court overruled liss objection,finding that physicians likely occupy positions of trust with regard to medicare.
the district court sustained liss objection to the obstruction of justice enhancement,concluding that,based on its recollection of liss trial testimony,it was not convinced that liss obstructed justice.the district court overruled liss objection as to restitution.finally,liss offered testimony in support of his motion for a downward departure,alleging that he was entitled to a downward departure on the grounds of physical health,family ties,contribution to the community,and lesser harms.the district court denied liss motion as to each ground,finding that none of the grounds,even combined,warranted a departure.the district court sentenced liss to months imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently,and ordered liss to pay a fine of,and restitution in the amount of.
spuza objected to the psi,claiming that the psi factual account should not include information regarding other individuals offenses.spuza made the same objection as liss concerning the enhancement for abuse of trust,arguing that,under eleventh circuit case law,the enhancement was unwarranted.spuza also contested the inclusion of the office rental and equipment sublease payments as remuneration under.he argued that those payments were legitimate and that he had received no funds from ccl for the equipment sublease because ccl paid the bank directly.spuza further opposed the imposition of restitution,maintaining that medicare did not suffer any loss attributable to his receipt of kickbacks from ccl.finally,spuza claimed that he was entitled to a downward departure under because his conduct did not cause the kind of harm that the statute sought to prevent.
with regard to spuza argument that the office rental and equipment sublease payments should not be included in the calculation under,the district court found that there was sufficient evidence to show that those payments constituted remuneration within the meaning of the statute.spuza then contested the amount of remuneration,contending that even if the equipment sublease payments were remuneration,he should not be accountable for more than half of the total amount because the equipment sublease ran from ccl to his mother,who owned half of the medical practice.the district court overruled spuza objection as to the amount or value of the remuneration for both payments,agreeing with the government position that spuza was liable for the full amount based on the language in the statute.in regard to spuza objection to receiving an enhancement for abuse of trust,the court stated that it had already decided this issue contrary to spuza position when it applied the enhancement in liss case.the district court also overruled spuza objection concerning restitution,reluctantly finding that this circuit decision in united states vaghela,cir,was controlling.
after hearing from spuza,the district court overruled the government objection that spuza should have received an enhancement for his role in the offense,finding that there was no basis for the enhancement.the district court also heard extensive arguments from spuza as to why he was entitled to a downward departure pursuant to.spuza primary argument was based on the proposition that his conduct did not cause the kind of harm contemplated by the statute.spuza also contested the government assertion that the plain language of the statute was aimed at preventing the receipt of kickbacks for patient referrals,which was exactly what spuza had done.the district court denied spuza motion,finding that the statute was clear on its face that you shall not refer for kickbacks.consequently,the district court sentenced spuza to months imprisonment on each count,to run concurrently,and ordered that spuza pay restitution in the amount of.

iii.standards of review 
a claim under rule b of the federal rules of criminal procedure is considered a question of law subject to plenary review.united states castro,cir.a defendant must show actual prejudice through a substantial and injurious effect on the jury verdict before he can obtain a new trial.united states lane,d.
in contrast,we review for abuse of discretion a motion for severance filed under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure.united states schlei,cir.to obtain a reversal on the basis of the denial of a severance motion,the defendant must demonstrate that the joint trial resulted in specific and compelling prejudice to the conduct of his defense.id.at.
this court reviews a district court findings of fact regarding sentencing for clear error and the district court application of those facts to the sentencing guidelines de novo.united states smith,cir.
we review a restitution order for abuse of discretion.united states davis,cir.
this court has no jurisdiction to review a sentencing judge denial of a downward departure unless it was made based upon belief that he or she did not possess the discretionary authority to depart downward.united states calderon,cir.
iv.discussion 
liss and spuza argue that they were misjoined in count one of the superseding indictment,and that the district court should have severed their trials.
federal rule of criminal procedure b is a pleading rule.united states morales,cir.the rule permits two or more defendants to be charged in the same indictment if they are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in the same series of acts or transactions constituting an offense or offenses.b.therefore,joinder under rule b is proper where,as here,an indictment charges multiple defendants with participation in a single conspiracy and also charges some but not all of the defendants with substantive counts arising out of the conspiracy.united states alvarez,cir.the propriety of joinder is to be determined before trial by examining the allegations contained in the indictment.morales,at.
count one of the superseding indictment charged liss and spuza with conspiring with ccl and other defendants to defraud the united states by obtaining kickbacks for the referral of medicare patients.thus,under rule b,liss and spuza were properly charged in the same indictment.see morales,at concluding that joinder of parties was proper under rule b because the indictment named all in a single conspiracy count.
although liss purports to challenge his joinder with spuza in count one,liss does not even refer to the allegations in count one,let alone argue that those allegations do not charge his and spuza participation in the same offense.rather,he argues that the evidence at trial did not support a finding that he and spuza participated in the same conspiracy.the trial evidence,however,may not be used to establish that joinder under rule b was improper.morales,at see also united states dominguez,cir noting that this court looks only to the indictment in order to determine if the appellants initial joinder was proper under rule b.given the allegations in the indictment,we conclude there was no rule b violation in this case,and,even if there had been such a violation,it would have been harmless because the defendants can not show that their joint trial resulted in actual prejudice,that it had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict.see lane,at.
likewise,we conclude that the defendants were not entitled to a severance and that the district court did not err in denying their motions.severance under rule of the federal rules of criminal procedure is warranted only when a defendant demonstrates that a joint trial will result in specific and compelling prejudice to his defense.united states walker,cir.compelling prejudice occurs when the jury is unable to separately appraise the evidence as to each defendant and render a fair and impartial verdict.united states meester,cir.
after reviewing the record,we conclude that neither liss nor spuza suffered compelling prejudice from their joint trial.there was no reasonable likelihood that the jury transferred the applicability of evidence from liss to spuza or.liss and spuza were the only two defendants on trial only two types of charges were at issue conspiracy and receiving kickbacks and the evidence as to each separate charge and defendant was distinct,clear,and uncomplicated.moreover,the district court cautioned the jury to assess the evidence independently for each count and each defendant,thus further ameliorating the possibility of prejudice.indeed,liss and spuza acknowledge that the key witnesses against liss ccl sales representative richard holt and ccl owner james mccowan,were different from the key witnesses against spuza ccl sales representative vincent gepp,and rule b witnesses ethan schlau and jason welles.defendants further acknowledge that the only common witness was the medicare representative who testified about the number of referrals liss and spuza made to ccl.given the virtually distinct evidence as to liss and spuza,they could not have suffered compelling prejudice from being tried jointly.
in conclusion,we see no merit to any of the arguments liss and spuza make concerning this issue.
enhancement for abuse of position of trust 
liss and spuza argue that the district court erred in enhancing their respective offense levels by two levels each.the enhancements were assessed for abuse of a position of trust or use of a special skill,pursuant to.the abuse of trust enhancement presents a question of first impression in this circuit 
in united states garrison,cir,we held that f or the enhancement to apply,defendant must have been in the position of trust with respect to the victim of the crime,and the position of trust must have contributed in some significant way to facilitating the commission or concealment of the offense.id.at internal marks and citations omitted.we went on to hold that the abuse of trust enhancement applies only where the defendant has abused discretionary authority entrusted to the defendant by the victim arm length business relationships are not available for the application of this enhancement.id.at internal marks and citations omitted.
of the other circuits that have addressed whether a physician occupies a position of trust in relation to medicare,or a private insurance carrier,all have answered that question in the affirmative.see united states ntshona,cir upholding abuse of trust enhancement where a physician defrauded medicare by signing false claims united states sherman,cir upholding abuse of trust enhancement based on physician abuse of trust with respect to defrauded insurance company united states adam,cir upholding abuse of trust enhancement for an internist who took illegal kickbacks from a cardiologist in exchange for patient referrals united states iloani,cir upholding abuse of trust enhancement based on chiropractor position of trust with respect to insurance company,where a chiropractor conspired with patients to submit fraudulent bills to insurance compan
