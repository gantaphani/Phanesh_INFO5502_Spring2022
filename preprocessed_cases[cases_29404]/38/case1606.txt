we granted review to examine the lower courts determination that a county bureau of children and family services need not pay for automobile liability insurance for a dependent minor in foster care.we affirm.
corrine was removed from her mothers custody at the age of,declared to be a dependent of the court see welf,and placed in foster care with a friend family.when corrine reached the age of,she was a senior in high school,had completed driver education,passed the written driving test,received a provisional driver permit and begun supervised driving practice.she encountered difficulty,however,in obtaining a driver license.an adult must ordinarily sign a minor license application,and the person who signs thereby assumes civil liability for any damages caused by the minor driving.corrine foster parents and natural mother,unwilling to assume liability or to pay for her automobile liability insurance,declined to sign her application.california law also permits a child protective services worker to sign a foster child application,without assuming personal liability,but only if the minor files proof of financial responsibility,see,et proof of financial responsibility.corrine did not file proof of financial responsibility,and the contra costa county children and family services bureau hereafter the bureau would not pay for her insurance.accordingly,the bureau also declined to sign her license application.
corrine challenged the bureau decision by filing a motion to compel support services,asking the court,in effect,to order the bureau to pay for her automobile liability insurance.in support of the motion,she cited welfare and institutions code section,which provides that f oster care providers shall be paid a per child per month rate in return for the care and supervision of each foster child placed with them,subd.a,and which defines care and supervision as including food,clothing,shelter,daily supervision,school supplies,a child personal incidentals,liability insurance with respect to a child,and reasonable travel to the child home for visitation,subd.b,italics added.the court denied the motion.corrine appealed,and the court of appeal unanimously affirmed.we granted review.
ii.discussion 
corrine offers two arguments in support of her claim that the bureau must pay for her automobile liability insurance.first,she argues the plain language of welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,compels payment.second,she contends the superior court has discretionary power to order payment under various statutes defining the courts powers in dependency cases,subd.a purpose of juvenile court law,subd.a powers of court with respect to dependent children,and.dependent child right to participate in extracurricular,enrichment and social activities,and that the court abused its discretion in not ordering payment.neither argument has merit.
welfare and institutions code section.
the first statute under which corrine seeks payment for automobile liability insurance belongs to a coordinated set of federal and state statutes under which those governments offer financial support to foster care providers.the federal government makes block grants for this purpose to the states,and the states distribute the money to the ultimate recipients pursuant to plans developed jointly by the federal department of health and human services hereafter the dhhs and the responsible state agencies.a.the federal government provides this assistance through the aid to families with dependent care program,established in title iv,part e,of the social security act.et california receives federal block grants,supplements the federal grants with state funds,and distributes these monies through the state department of social services dss and county social services agencies.see welf,et.
to receive federal block grants under the program,a state must,among other things,make foster care maintenance payments.a,a.as relevant here,section a of title of the united states code defines foster care maintenance payments as payments to cover the cost of and the cost of providing food,clothing,shelter,daily supervision,school supplies,a child personal incidentals,liability insurance with respect to a child,and reasonable travel to the child home for visitation,italics added.the legislative history of public law june,stat,which added this language to the united states code in,sheds no light on the meaning of the italicized phrase the california legislature,to meet the state obligations under federal law simply copied verbatim the federal definition of foster care maintenance payments thus,california law provides that f oster care providers shall be paid a per child per month rate in return for the care and supervision of the child placed with them welf,subd.a,and then defines care and supervision,subd.b precisely as federal law defines foster care maintenance payments a.accordingly,c are and supervision includes food,clothing,shelter,daily supervision,school supplies,a child personal incidentals,liability insurance with respect to a child,and reasonable travel to the child home for visitation.welf,subd.b,italics added.
corrine argues the language just quoted requires the bureau to pay for her automobile liability insurance.the argument fails for two reasons.first,corrine has not sued the for setting the basic monthly rate paid to foster care providers.second,the relevant statutes do not in any event compel the dss to include automobile liability insurance in the basic monthly rate.
the legislature has designated the dss as the single organizational unit whose duty it shall be to administer a state system for establishing rates in the program.welf,subd.a.the legislature has also codified the currently established rates,et the bureau argues that,because only the dss can set the basic monthly rate for foster care,the dss is a necessary party to any action seeking to compel a change in that rate.see code civ,joinder of necessary parties.indeed,insofar as corrine motion for support services in effect challenges the basic rate,that the dss is a necessary party appears.in the absence of the dss,complete relief can not be accorded among those already parties,subd.a.furthermore,any judgment invalidating the basic rate would necessarily impair or impede the dss ability to protect its institutional interest ibid.as the agency responsible for setting the rate.finally,because the court can not in the absence of the dss render an effective judgment invalidating the basic rate,the bureau was entitled to raise the claim,as it did,for the first time on appeal.see county of alameda state bd.of control th,fn,d.
corrine seeks to avoid this conclusion by disclaiming any intention to seek a change in the basic rate and by theorizing that the court may order the bureau,rather than the state,to pay for her automobile liability insurance.the bureau,she argues,if ordered to pay may demand reimbursement from the state under welfare and institutions code section she then concludes if this court rules in corrine favor,the same rule and the same statutory scheme that requires the county to reimburse foster parents would require the dss to reimburse the bureau.the argument does not advance corrine position.it concedes,in effect,that a judicial order interpreting welfare and institutions code section,subdivision b,as imposing on the bureau a previously unrecognized financial obligation to foster children ultimately imposes that burden on the dss and,thus,affects the dss ability to carry out its statutory responsibilities.the dss is a necessary party precisely for this reason.in re marriage of lugo d.county providing afdc benefits to a custodial parent is a necessary party to an action seeking to reduce noncustodial parent obligation.
in any event,we do not understand welfare and institutions code section as requiring the dss to pay for automobile liability insurance.the section does not authorize direct claims against the state or the counties for particular expenditures by foster children or foster care providers.instead,the statute directs the dss to administer a state system for establishing rates in the program,subd.a,italics
