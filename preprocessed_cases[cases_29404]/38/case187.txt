opinion of the court 
joyce rutherford rutherford challenges the denial of her application for supplemental security income ssi under title xvi of the social security act,act she filed for benefits in june,claiming an onset date of june,and an ongoing inability to work due to back and arm impairments.after an initial denial by the state agency,she filed a timely request for a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.rutherford then appeared with counsel before alj william reddy on june,and both rutherford and a vocational expert testified.alj reddy issued an opinion on august,that concluded that although rutherford had impairments that qualified as severe,she was not entitled to benefits because she retained the residual functional capacity rfc to perform existing jobs in the workforce and so did not meet the act definition of disability.
in response to a request for review,the appeals council issued a denial of reversal or remand on january,and the alj decision became the final decision of the social security commissioner commissioner reg.and a sims apfel,d.rutherford then exercised her rights under g to seek redress in the federal courts.on march,she filed a civil action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania,and both sides sought summary judgment.on january,the district court granted summary judgment for the commissioner.this appeal followed,and we affirm.
background 
rutherford was years old at the time of her onset date.although she attended school through the grade,she was placed in special classes after sixth grade.in addition,current educational tests similarly reflect only marginal aptitude levels.her employment history indicates experience as a private child care monitor and as an aide in a daycare facility.but she claims that her ability to work has been greatly reduced since a june,slip and fall at her grandchildren school.before the accident rutherford was watching three children from her home and was earning about per week.at the time of her administrative hearing,she testified that she was capable of watching only one addition to her own,activity that generated only a quarter of her previous earnings 
after her fall rutherford consulted with various doctors to assess her condition.in august an initial magnetic resonance imaging examination of her cervical spine revealed moderate degeneration of several vertebrae,significant enlargement of the left thyroid and minimal narrowing of the neural foramina on the right side.but that examination did not show any cord compression or signal abnormalities in either the cord or vertebral bodies.and an electromyogram and nerve conduction study performed in september showed normal results for her right upper extremity.
following those initial exams,rutherford consulted on several occasions with jonathan dissin,a cerebral vascular disease specialist.dissin conducted neurological examinations and found that rutherford could elevate her right arm only to the horizontal position,resulting in some diminished power in that arm.he did not observe any other abnormalities,with no problems in her gait,reflexes or sensations.dissin prescribed various dosages of neurontin and for pain control,and rutherford participated in some physical therapy to address her pain as well.
in anticipation of her hearing rutherford also visited a rehabilitation consultant,who prepared a vocational evaluation on her behalf.in addition to compiling past educational and employment information,that evaluation contained some information related to her physical condition.most of that information was based on observations and interviews with rutherford rather than medical records which were not made available to the consultant,but the report did contain one piece of original physical information that is relevant here the results of a purdue pegboard to assess rutherford manual placed rutherford hand speed at the lowest one percentile for all norm groups.ultimately the evaluator concluded that rutherford educational level and physical conditions contributed to significant vocational deficits.
rutherford was questioned at her hearing by the alj and her counsel,and both focused primarily on rutherford alleged physical limitations.rutherford identified weakness in her right arm and pain in her lower back as impairments that contributed to an inability to work,and responded in the negative when asked directly by the alj whether any additional conditions deterred her from working.she also testified that her various prescribed medications were not alleviating her pain but were contributing to extreme drowsiness.despite the fact that she continued to experience pain,she indicated that she could button buttons,work zippers and lift a gallon of milk albeit with some difficulty on that last score.when the alj inquired about her use of a cane,rutherford said that she needed it because of problems with her left leg,that it had been prescribed for her by a doctor treating a thyroid condition,and that she used it to steady herself while walking and standing but not while ascending or descending stairs.
after rutherford testified,the alj called upon donald millin millin to testify as an independent vocational expert.millin first reviewed rutherford past vocational experience and characterized it as light in terms of exertion and semiskilled,with a specified vocational preparation classification of.he then responded to a number of hypothetical questions posed by the alj based on rutherford physical and educational limitations.those responses assisted the alj in reaching his conclusion that although rutherford past work would be precluded,a number of other jobs existed in the economy that she could perform.examples of jobs cited by the vocational expert include arcade attendant,apparel stock checker being asked to factor in the need for a clerk.
under the act an individual is disabled when unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months section a a.section a b provides additional details regarding the disability determination,and the social security administration has promulgated regulations based on those provisions that set out a sequential analysis to guide its analysis reg.in the first four steps the burden is on the claimant to show that she is not currently engaged in gainful employment because she is suffering from a severe impairment that is listed in an appendix or is equivalent to such a listed condition or that leaves her lacking the rfc to return to her previous employment reg.a to e.if the claimant satisfies step,she is considered per se disabled.if the claimant instead satisfies step,the burden then shifts to the commissioner at step to show that other jobs exist in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant could perform reg.f.advisory testimony from a vocational expert is often sought by the alj for that purpose plummer apfel,cir,and factors to be considered include medical impairments,age,education,work experience and rfc reg.f.
following the analysis described above,the alj found that rutherford did not meet the act definition of disability.specifically the alj reached conclusions adverse to rutherford claim at steps and of the analysis.although the alj found at step that rutherford had not been gainfully employed since she filed her application for benefits and at step that she had severe impairments in her right upper extremity and lower back,he concluded at step that rutherford did not have impairments that would permit a showing of per se disability under reg.d.and although the alj concluded that rutherford could no longer perform her past relevant work at step,he determined at step that she could perform a significant number of other jobs in the economy.in reaching those conclusions,the alj expressly credited the testimony of the vocational expert while discounting rutherford personal testimony on the grounds that it was exaggerated and only fairly credible.
disability analysis 
on appeal rutherford raises both a general objection to the alj analysis on the ground that it did not consider her obesity and some particular objections to the alj step determination.we have jurisdiction under both and g to review final determinations by the commissioner,but the scope of our review is quite limited.like the district court,we must uphold a final agency determination unless we find that it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record g plummer,at.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion the definition quoted,in reefer barnhart,cir.it is more than a mere scintilla but may be somewhat less than a preponderance of the evidence the standard quoted,in ginsburg richardson,cir.in the process of reviewing the record for substantial evidence,we may not weigh the evidence or substitute our own conclusions for those of the williams sullivan,cir.
consideration of obesity 
rutherford first argues that the alj erred by failing to consider her weight throughout the disability determination.although rutherford did not raise obesity as an impairment or limitation before the alj,she points out that the medical records available to the alj indicate her height of and approximate weight of pounds.and she correctly notes that the commissioner has issued a ruling,social security ruling ssr,that requires a consideration of obesity at various points in the analysis from the combination of those factors,rutherford contends that the alj was obligated to consider her obesity explicitly and that his failure to do so requires a remand.we disagree.
skarbek barnhart,cir per curiam has recently considered the precise argument that rutherford now asserts.in rejecting the notion that the alj failure to mention his obesity is reason enough to remand the case id.at,the seventh circuit articulated an analysis that might well have been written for this case id.citations omitted 
an alj is required to consider impairments a claimant says he has,or about which the alj receives evidence.although skarbek did not specifically claim obesity as an impairment either in his disability application or at his hearing,the references to his weight in his medical records were likely sufficient to alert the alj to the impairment.despite this,any remand for explicit consideration of skarbek obesity would not affect the outcome of this case.notably,skarbek does not specify how his obesity further impaired his ability to work,but speculates merely that his weight makes it more difficult to stand and walk.additionally,the alj adopted the limitations suggested by the specialists and reviewing doctors,who were aware of skarbek obesity.thus,although the alj did not explicitly consider skarbek obesity,it was factored indirectly into the alj decision as part of the doctors opinions.
we follow the seventh circuit and conclude that a remand is not required here because it would not affect the outcome of the case.rutherford never mentioned obesity as a condition that contributed to her inability to work,even when asked directly by the alj to describe her impairments.so even if we accordance with common the administrative record evidence of rutherford height and her weight of some pounds sufficed to alert the alj that obesity could be a factor,rutherford has not specified how that factor would affect the analysis undertaken by the alj,beyond an assertion that her weight makes it more difficult for her to stand,walk and manipulate her hands and fingers.that generalized response is not enough to require a remand,particularly when the administrative record indicates clearly that the alj relied on the voluminous medical evidence as a basis for his findings regarding her limitations and impairments because her doctors must also be viewed as aware of rutherford obvious obesity,we find that the alj adoption of their conclusions constitutes a satisfactory if indirect consideration of that condition 
rfc determination 
rutherford next raises several objections related to the alj conclusion at step that she retained the limited functional capacity to perform jobs existing in the workforce.as is normally the case,that conclusion was based in large measure on the testimony provided by the vocational expert.rutherford claims that such testimony can not form the basis of a substantial evidence determination in her case because it was based on responses to hypothetical questions that did not adequately consider her physical limitations.in particular,rutherford relies on language regarding the proper use of testimony by vocational experts in cases such as podedworny harris,cir citations omitted 
testimony of vocational experts in disability determination proceedings typically includes,and often centers upon,one or more hypothetical questions posed by the alj to the vocational expert.the alj will normally ask the expert whether,given certain assumptions about the claimant physical capability,the claimant can perform certain types of jobs,and the extent to which such jobs exist in the national economy.while the alj may proffer a variety of assumptions to the expert,the vocational expert testimony concerning a claimant ability to perform alternative employment may only be considered for purposes of determining disability if the question accurately portrays the claimant individual physical and mental impairments.thus the expert must have evaluated claimant particular impairments as contained in the record.
we have elsewhere characterized the requirement in even stronger terms,warning that a hypothetical question posed to a vocational expert must reflect all of a claimant impairments burns,at quoting and adding emphasis to chrupcala heckler,cir.
but the language should not be misunderstood.we do not require an alj to submit to the vocational expert every impairment alleged by a claimant.instead the directive in podedworny is that the hypotheticals posed must accurately portray the claimant impairments and that the expert must be given an opportunity to evaluate those impairments as contained in the record.burns must also be read in that sense.fairly understood,such references to all impairments encompass only those that are medically established see,for example,reg.b and that in turn means that the alj must accurately convey to the vocational expert all of a claimant credibly established limitations see plummer,at 
our cases have established some guidelines as to when a limitation is credibly established,and the governing regulations have something to say on that score as well see especially regs,c and.limitations that are medically supported and otherwise uncontroverted in the record,but that are not included in the hypothetical question posed to the expert,preclude reliance on the expert response burns,at.relatedly,the alj may not substitute his or her own expertise to refute such record evidence plummer,at.limitations that are medically supported but are also contradicted by other evidence in the record may or may not be found alj can choose to credit portions of the existing evidence but can not reject evidence for no reason or for the wrong reason a principle repeated in mason shalala,cir reg.c.finally,limitations that are asserted by the claimant but that lack objective medical support may possibly be considered nonetheless credible.in that respect the alj can reject such a limitation if there is conflicting evidence in the record,but should not reject a claimed symptom that is related to an impairment and is consistent with the medical record simply because there is no objective medical evidence to support it reg.c.
with this framework in mind,we turn to a consideration of the particular limitations that rutherford claims were improperly disregarded by the alj in his hypotheticals submitted to the vocational expert.rutherford identifies four such limitations extreme drowsiness caused by her medication,lack of manual dexterity,need to use a cane and need for a option.we hold that all of those were reasonably discounted by the alj,so that the hypotheticals submitted to the vocati
