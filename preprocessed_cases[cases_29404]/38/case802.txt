a social security disability benefits claimant is no longer entitled to benefits when substantial evidence demonstrates there has been any medical improvement in the claimant impairment and the claimant is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity.f.to determine whether there has been medical improvement,an administrative law judge alj must compare the current medical severity of the claimant impairment to the medical severity of the impairment at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision that the claimant w as disabled or continued to be disabled.b.this appeal addresses the question of how an alj should determine whether medical improvement has occurred in closed period cases,where the alj finds in a single decision that the claimant was disabled for a closed period of time but has since medically improved.
we conclude that in closed period cases an alj should compare the medical evidence used to determine that the claimant was disabled with the medical evidence existing at the time of asserted medical improvement.although the alj in this case made the appropriate comparison,substantial evidence does not support the alj finding of medical improvement.we therefore reverse the judgment and remand with instructions to remand this case to the alj to calculate an award of benefits.
this appeal concerns an alj award of social security disability benefits to emily attmore,who applied for disability benefits in october.after the agency denied attmore claim for benefits,an alj held a hearing in july and determined that,due to her bipolar disorder,attmore was disabled as of april,but had medically improved to the point she was no longer disabled beginning on march.in making these findings,the alj considered the following medical evidence.
attmore was last gainfully employed on april,when she quit her job after a series of breakdowns that prevented her from getting out of bed.in,she was hospitalized three times because of her bipolar disorder.in may,she was hospitalized for two weeks after a suicide attempt during which she reported hearing voices and hallucinating.although she initially did well after her release,she began to hallucinate and became restless after she reduced her medications or stopped taking them altogether.in august,she was hospitalized again for one week after experiencing hallucinations and extreme paranoia.in october,she experienced situational problems related to a significant other,again went off her medications and stopped sleeping,and was hospitalized a third time after she was found wandering around and responding to voices in her head.upon her release one month later,attmore began seeing psychiatrist robert wolf,as well as one of her former therapists.
wolf treatment notes report mixed progress over the next year.on november,for example,attmore was struggling and expressing some paranoid ideas,but two weeks later said she was doing well,and wolf reported her mental state was fairly stable.similarly,on february,though attmore seemed quite stable,she reported she had been pretty depressed for several weeks,exhibiting social isolation,sleeping a lot.by march,she said she was still somewhat socially isolative,but otherwise feeling much better,and wolf noted she was actually doing well.on march the final day the alj found attmore was disabled she again said she was feeling pretty well with no specific complaints,but one week later she told another therapist she had been staying in her apartment for d ays at a time,not leaving and not getting dressed.she experienced a gradual worsening of her symptoms from august through october as she increasingly struggled with depression.
attmore progress in likewise was mixed.in february,she began working with a clinical social worker who agreed to drive her to appointments because she d id feel comfortable riding public transportation.on february,attmore told her new doctor she was doing well and spoke of starting school,but continued to complain of heightened anxiety when there were other stresses in her life.although she endorse d satisfaction with her life in early march,by late march she said she was getting depressed,and had another episode during which she heard voices and slept for hours.in april,her symptoms flared up two more times,causing increased depression and poor sleep for one week.
based on this medical evidence,the alj determined attmore was disabled between april,and march.at issue here is the alj medical improvement finding,which rested on two conclusions.the alj first detailed wolf treatment notes from march,and concluded attmore had benefited from mental health treatment and medication management and ha d experienced gradual improvement in her symptoms.the alj then cited additional treatment notes and concluded attmore had shown improvement in the area of social functioning.based in part on the medical improvement finding,the alj awarded attmore benefits only for the closed period from april,through march.after the appeals council denied review,attmore filed a civil action seeking review of the alj decision,and the district court granted summary judgment to the commissioner.we have jurisdiction over attmore appeal under and now reverse.
we review the district court decision sustaining the alj denial of social security benefits de novo and can reverse only if the alj findings are based on legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.see molina astrue,cir.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla,but may be less than a preponderance.id.at quoting valentine comm r soc.sec,cir.if the evidence is susceptible to more than one rational interpretation,we are required to affirm.id.at.we can not affirm,however,simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence,but must consider the record as a whole,weighing both evidence that supports and evidence that detracts from the commissioner conclusion.tackett apfel,cir.citation omitted.
attmore raises two challenges to the alj determination that she medically improved as of march.first,she contends the alj erred in making only a general comparison of the medical evidence without reference to a specific point in time.in her view,the alj was required to specifically identify the dates being compared,and the alj failure to do so was legal error.second,attmore argues that even if the alj comparison were proper,substantial evidence does not support a finding of medical improvement.we agree only with her second contention.
we begin with attmore argument that the alj failed to make the appropriate comparison in determining she had medically improved.medical improvement is defined as any decrease in the medical severity of a recipient impairment,b,and requires a comparison of prior and current medical evidence which must show that there have been changes improvement in the symptoms,signs or laboratory findings associated with that impairment s,id.c.the commissioner regulations prescribe a specific baseline for this comparison an alj must compare the medical severity of the impairment s present at the time of the most recent favorable medical decision that is,when the claimant was last found disabled or continued to be disabled to the medical severity of that impairment s at the time of the comparison.id.b.
making this comparison is straightforward in ordinary termination cases where the alj finds a claimant is disabled or continues to be disabled in one decision and,in a later decision,finds the claimant has medically improved.in those cases,the most recent favorable medical decision is an earlier decision,and the severity of the claimant impairment at the time of that decision provides the relevant baseline for comparison.attmore case,however,is a closed period case,meaning the alj found in the same decision that she had been disabled for a closed period of time and had since medically improved.because the alj made its findings of disability and medical improvement in a single decision,there was no most recent favorable medical decision for comparison.the commissioner regulations have no direct application in these circumstances and thus do not neatly prescribe an appropri
