the back pay act waives the government sovereign immunity from liability for interest on back pay awarded to 
a n employee of an agency who,on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination is found by appropriate authority under applicable law to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the employee pay.
b,b a i,b a.this case presents the question whether that explicit waiver of immunity applies to interest on an award of back pay against the federal government for terminating an employee in violation of the age discrimination in employment act adea.we hold that it does.
chester wrucke and james calzia were terminated from their positions as scientists for the geological survey pursuant to a reduction in force.wrucke and calzia filed appeals with the merit systems protection board mspb,and after exhausting their administrative remedies filed a timely complaint in the district court for the northern district of california in the district court conducted a bench trial in july.the district court found that wrucke and calzia were terminated in violation of the adea.after a round of appellate litigation,the details of which are not relevant to the present appeal,the case was remanded to the district court,which entered judgment granting wrucke and calzia back pay,as well as pre and interest.
on may,the government filed a motion for relief from judgment under.b,asking the court to void the pre and interest under the theory that the adea did not expressly waive the federal government sovereign immunity from interest payments wrucke and calzia,in turn,argued that the back pay act waiver of federal sovereign immunity from interest for unjustified or unwarranted personnel action s by the federal government,b,b a,provides for pre and interest on meritorious adea claims for wrongful termination.the district court sided with the government,holding that the back pay act does not expressly waive immunity for interest on back pay under the adea.calzia and wrucke now appeal.
in library of congress shaw,the supreme court held that under the rule,i n the absence of express congressional consent to the award of interest separate from a general waiver of immunity to suit,the united states is immune from an interest award.id.at.the adea waiver of federal sovereign immunity does not expressly waive the federal government immunity from awards of interest.see.the back pay act,however,does explicitly waive the government immunity from interest on back pay awarded for certain types of unjustified or unwarranted personnel action s.b,b a.we therefore must determine whether the back pay act waiver of sovereign immunity from interest on back pay awards against the federal government extends to back pay awarded under the adea.we hold that it does.
the back pay act was passed in with the goal of establish ing a single,general,and comprehensive pay adjustment authority to be applied after an erroneous or unwarranted personnel action is corrected,at.it makes back pay,payable with interest,available to 
an employee of an agency who,on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination is found by appropriate authority under applicable law,rule,regulation,or collective bargaining agreement,to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay,allowances,or differentials of the employee 
b,b a i,b a emphasis added.by its clear terms,this express waiver of sovereign immunity applies to actions,such as this one,in which an agency employee sues the federal government under substantive statutes such as the adea,alleging that a wrongful personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of pay,allowances,or differentials.brown sec y of the army,w e find in the back pay act text no hint of an exclusion of,or exemption for,federal sector title vii adjudications.in so finding,we join with three other circuits that have concluded that the back pay act waiver of immunity from interest awards applies to a federal employee termination or reduction in pay in violation of substantive statutes.see,woolf bowles,cir edwards lujan,cir brown,at.
our conclusion is compelled by the back pay act text.the act waives federal sovereign immunity for both back pay and interest,when the plaintiff is an employee of an agency the plaintiff makes a timely appeal or obtains an administrative determination regarding such a personnel action the plaintiff obtains a favorable ruling under an applicable law,rule,regulation,or collective bargaining agreement from an appropriate authority stating that the plaintiff has been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and the unjustified personnel action resulted in a withdrawal or reduction of the plaintiff pay,allowances,or differentials.see b.
here,plaintiffs,who served as scientists for the geological survey,were clearly employee s of an agency.b plaintiffs also filed a timely appeal as defined by the office of personnel management regulations that interpret the act.those regulations state that the requirement for a timely appeal is met when 
an employee or an employee personal representative initiates an appeal or grievance under an appeal or grievance system,including appeal or grievance procedures included in a collective bargaining agreement a claim against the government of the united states a discrimination complaint or an unfair labor practice charge 
and an appropriate authority accepts that appeal,grievance,claim,complaint,or charge as timely filed.b emphasis added.here,plaintiffs initiated an appeal or grievance under an appeal or grievance system by filing an appeal of their termination with the merit systems protection board mspb,which recognized the appeal as timely filed.moreover,plaintiffs suit in the district court,which was likewise recognized as timely filed,involved both a claim against the government of the united states and a discrimination complaint.b.thus,both the plaintiffs mspb appeal and their district court action satisfy the back pay act requirement for a timely appeal.
furthermore,the district court that rendered judgment for the plaintiffs in this case was,without question,an appropriate authority to make a finding of wrongful termination in this case.though the statute language is quite clear even without reference to the opm interpretation,the agency back pay act regulations confirm this straightforward conclusion,defining an appropriate authority as an entity having authority in the case at hand to correct or direct the correction of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action,including a court.it is quite clear that the back pay act reference to an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action on its face encompasses a termination that violates the adea,and,again,the opm regulations confirm this most reasonable reading of the statute 
unjustified or unwarranted personnel action means an act of commission or an act of omission that an appropriate authority subsequently determines,on the basis of substantive or procedural defects,to have been unjustified or unwarranted under applicable law,executive order,rule,regulation,or mandatory personnel policy established by an agency or through a collective bargaining agreement.such actions include personnel actions and pay actions alone or in combination.
emphasis added.thus,an appropriate authority found that an act of commission plaintiffs termination was unjustified by virtue of substantive violation of plaintiffs rights age discrimination under applicable law the adea.finally,plaintiffs termination indisputably led to a withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the pay,allowances,or differentials of the employee.
moreover,the adea is without question an applicable law for purposes of the back pay act.the opm regulations do not define applicable law,nor is the meaning of applicable otherwise obvious from the text of the statute.however,the house committee report for the back pay act states that the phrase applicable law is intended to cover tho
