in the equal access to justice act eaja,codified in relevant part at,congress mandated that,in defined circumstances,the government pay appropriate attorney fees to private parties who win in litigation against it.the policy is to eliminate for the average person the financial disincentive to challenge unreasonable governmental actions.comm r jean.eaja applies,and its central policy is of particular significance,in the uniquely system for adjudicating veterans claims for benefits,where it helps to ensure that veterans will seek an appeal when the department of veterans affairs has failed in its duty to aid them or has otherwise erroneously denied them the benefits that they have earned.kelly nicholson.
this case involves a delay in actual payment of eaja fee awards for a long period after there was no longer a live dispute about those awards.we hold that the long delay,which undermined the eaja policy as it applies to veterans claims for benefits,was not justified by the only reason given by the court of appeals for veterans claims.this case also involves a later award,which does not involve an issue of payment delay and as to which we affirm the veterans court in its reduction of the request for fees.
background 
in,phillip wagner,who served in the united states navy for years,sought disability compensation for a thyroid disorder that he claimed was contracted or aggravated in the line of duty.the united states department of veterans affairs denied his claim.but in march,when his case was on appeal in the veterans court,he secured an uncontested remand for readjudication,which ultimately established his entitlement to disability compensation.
having prevailed,wagner timely filed an application for in fees pursuant to eaja,which directs a court to award reasonable fees and other expenses to private parties who prevail in litigation against the united states if certain requirements are met.d a.the government conceded that wagner was entitled to an award but challenged the amount.on october,the veterans court granted wagner fee application in part,awarding him,which gave the government all the reductions it sought except for hours of work.wagner shinseki,slip op.at.
twelve days later,on october,wagner filed his first supplemental application,which sought in fees for defending the original application against the government reasonableness challenges.then,on january,before ruling on the first supplemental application,the veterans court entered judgment on the october,award 
the court has issued a decision concerning the application for attorney fees and expenses under the equal access to justice act,in this case.the time allowed for motions under rule of the court rules of practice and procedure has expired.under rule,judgment is entered this date.
but the next day,january,the veterans court revoked the judgment,providing no explanation for its action other than its statement that the previous day judgment was issued in error.
on january,after the veterans court had vacillated on entry of judgment on the october fee award on the original fee application,wagner moved the veterans court to enter judgment on that award.he argued that rule provides that judgment will be issued after the later of several events,all of which had already occurred.the veterans court denied the motion on february,the stamp order simply denied the motion,without giving a rationale.
that same day,february,the veterans court denied wagner first supplemental application,which sought fees incurred defending the original application.wagner shinseki,wl.because it had awarded only of the requested in the original application,the veterans court concluded that wagner original request was,in substantial part,unreasonable and that it can not now conclude that his defense of that request is worthy of pecuniary reward at the expense of the public coffers.id.at.wagner appealed to this court,which reversed the veterans court on april,holding that,because wagner was partially successful in defending against the government challenge to his initial fee application,he was entitled to supplemental fees commensurate with the degree of success he achieved.wagner shinseki.three weeks later,on may,the veterans court on remand granted wagner first supplemental application for.wagner shinseki,wl.may.
days later,on june,the veterans court entered judgment.although the judgment did not specifically say,the government here expressly agrees that the judgment of june,applied to both the october award on the original application and the may award on the first supplemental application.brief for respondent appellee at.
on june,wagner filed an additional eaja fee application,his second supplemental application,seeking for the work required to defend his first supplemental application,including the work done in the successful appeal to this court.
by march,wagner had yet to receive any payment from his original application granted in part in october or from his first supplemental application granted in full in may,so he filed with the veterans court a motion for the issuance of a judgment and mandate.wagner acknowledged that his second supplemental application was still pending and would require further proceedings,but he argued that there is nothing in those subsequent proceedings which can affect the october or may decisions,which found entitlement to reasonable fees.wagner pleaded that,i f the veterans court denies this request,he respectfully requests that it give its reasons and bases for such a denial.
the veterans court issued its most recent decision in this matter and the decision now on appeal on june.wagner shinseki.june.the veterans court first addressed six challenges the government made to the reasonableness of wagner second supplemental application,agreeing with five of the challenges and accordingly granting wagner fees for fewer hours than he requested.id.at.the veterans court then recognized that a lso before the veterans court is wagner motion for issuance of judgment and mandate.id.at.the veterans court denied the motion with the explanation that the secretary of veterans affairs opposes this motion and the veterans court will not circumvent his appellate rights.id.

discussion 
this court jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court is limited.see.we have jurisdiction to decide appeals insofar as they challenge a decision of the veterans court with respect to a rule of law,including the interpretation or validity of any statute or regulation.id.a,d.we do not have jurisdiction to review a challenge to a factual determination or a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case except to the extent an appeal presents a constitutional issue.id.d.
wagner appeals the veterans court refusal to require that the government promptly pay his original and first supplemental eaja applications as well as its reduction of the request for fees on his second supplemental application.because the veterans court has offered only one explanation for denying wagner motions to issue a judgment and mandate,and that explanation is legally erroneous,we vacate its denial of his march motion and remand for further consideration.as to the veterans court ruling on wagner second supplemental application,we see no legal error and therefore affirm.
the sole rationale that the veterans court provided for denying wagner second motion for prompt payment that the secretary opposes this motion and the court will not circumvent his appellate rights misinterprets the laws governing appeals from the veterans court.as of the june,decision that is now on review,indeed as of august,the government had no such appeal rights concerning the october and may fee awards.thus,we vacate the judgment of the veterans court in this respect.
as an initial matter,we note that the correctness of the veterans court june denial of the motion for judgment and mandate is not moot,despite the entry of the october judgment on the june denial that brought this case here.presumably beca
