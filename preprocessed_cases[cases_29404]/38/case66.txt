the town of wellesley town appeals from the judgment of the magistrate judge.the magistrate judge held that gary lapine lapine is entitled to reemployment as a police officer with the town pursuant to the veterans reemployment rights act vrra,supp.ii amended by uniformed services employment and reemployment rights act of,et.supp.v the court awarded monetary damages with prejudgment interest.we affirm.
background 
lapine served as a commissioned officer in the united states army from july,through august.lapine stipulated that,at this time,he became aware of veteran rights to reemployment benefits under the vrra.upon discharge from active duty,he transferred to the united states army reserve in which he served as a commissioned officer until,after twice being passed over for a promotion,he was honorably discharged in.in february,lapine enlisted in the army reserve as a sergeant and was assigned to the military police company in manchester,new hampshire.
after his discharge from active duty with the united states army,lapine joined the wellesley police department in may of.he served with the police department for approximately thirteen years until,on april,in a letter to the of police john fritts,he announced that he was resigning.in the letter he gave may,as the effective date of his resignation.the letter reflected lapine acute dissatisfaction with the working conditions of the department.the letter read in full as follows 
i am writing to inform you of my intent to resign from the wellesley police department.as you may or may not already realize,i have not been satisfied with the working conditions of the department for several years now.only the opportunity to secure other employment prevented me from resigning earlier,and possibly,the hopes that the conditions would change.however,as you know,the conditions have not changed,nor do you or i expect them to in the future.
your mishandling of major incidents in the past few years has been deplorable,and has placed your patrolmen in jeopardy.your handling of the weapons procurement has left half of your department with outmoded service weapons.your continual persecution of certain police officers in your department has led to a hardened polarization between members of your staff and the rest of the department.and finally,your response to my request for an internal investigation into the theft and illegal copying of official wellesley police association documents,and your unauthorized use of these documents in a public forum,is not only inexcusable,but has thwarted any hopes of identifying the perpetrator of the and larceny.as these documents were secured in my locker,i feel that my civil rights have been violated,and that by your inaction on this matter,that you condone such activity.
the effective date of my resignation is may.if there are any vacation or personal days remaining,i am using this opportunity to let the department know,that i would like to be reimbursed for said days.
on april,the day he submitted his resignation letter,lapine also completed and submitted an application to the wellesley retirement board to withdraw his accrued police retirement benefits.the signed application stated,in pertinent part,that lapine had permanently left the police service and that it was not his present intention to accept a position in the service of the commonwealth of massachusetts.when lapine withdrew his accrued retirement benefits totaling,he owed money to the internal revenue service.lapine used the lump sum received from the accrued retirement benefits to pay to the internal revenue service in satisfaction of his outstanding personal tax liability.he used the remainder of the money for daily expenses and to meet his child support obligations.
lapine did not,at any time during this period,disclose to the town that he was in the process of seeking to enter upon active duty with the united states army reserve.at trial,however,he testified that his resignation from the police department was prompted,at least in part,by plans to do just that.lapine testified that,in early april,he had contacted sergeant ronald johnson to determine if there were openings in the active duty guard reserve program agr.his attorney,ronald johnson same names,different people,also testified that on or about april,lapine informed him that he intended to apply for active duty.sergeant albert basile,whose task was to recruit persons for the agr,testified that,prior to the date of lapine resignation letter of april,he spoke with lapine about entering upon active duty.according to basile,he told lapine that he would make an excellent candidate as a recruiter.
lapine completed and submitted an application for the agr on may,six days before the stated effective date of his resignation.six weeks following the april resignation letter,on june,the united states recruiting command at fort sheridan,illinois sent lapine a notice that he was being assigned to active duty.on june,lapine was issued orders to report for active duty training for forty days.on july,lapine was issued orders to report for active duty on september.his term of active duty was to end on august.lapine did not communicate to the town or to the police department that he had enlisted in the agr nor did he indicate that he might wish to return to the police department at some future time.
two years later,in july,lapine contacted the new chief of police of the wellesley police department,thomas,indicating,for the first time,that he might wish to return to the police force.specifically,lapine wrote to explore the opportunity or feasibility of with the wellesley police department.immediately responded to lapine letter stating that he was reluctant to consider the use of the reinstatement process to hire police officers.
a year later,in july,lapine again wrote to requesting to be reinstated.for the first time,he explicitly invoked the vrra as the basis for his reinstatement,giving formal notice that he had been serving with the army reserve on active duty.refused to reinstate lapine stating,among other things,that it was his belief that you are not entitled to the protections you assert.
after his discharge from the agr on august,lapine continued to assert his rights under the vrra through the united states department of labor,office of veterans employment training services.in february,lapine requested that his case be referred to the united states department of justice.as a result,the department of labor ceased representing lapine interest in march.a year later,in march,the united states attorney declined lapine request for representation 
on october,lapine filed with the district court the instant complaint against the town asking the court to order his reemployment as a police officer and to award damages for the town alleged violation of the vrra.two years later,a bench trial was held before chief magistrate judge collings.in its subsequent decision,the court expressly found that lapine had left his job in order voluntarily to enter on active duty with the military that he was eligible for vrra reemployment rights that he was qualified to perform the position of police officer and that he had not waived his right to reemployment.in the end,the court ordered the town to reinstate lapine as a patrolman with a pay grade commensurate with the seniority and status he would have achieved had he not entered upon active duty.further,the court required the town to allow lapine to make whatever payments he would have made into his pension fund had he begun as a new employee on may.in addition,lapine was to receive back pay from august to the date of reinstatement as well as vacation pay with prejudgment interest.judgment for lapine was entered in the amount of,representing wages and vacation pay,with an additional in prejudgment interest.this appeal followed.
ii.did lapine meet the vrra statutory preconditions for entitlement to reemployment rights 
the town of wellesley argues on appeal that lapine does not qualify under the terms and provisions of the vrra for entitlement to reemployment with the wellesley police.it insists that the magistrate judge misinterpreted the vrra as a matter of law and that even on the court own interpretation its factual findings were unsupported.
while the town varies its arguments,the essence of its claim of legal error seems to be that b,the statute then applicable to reservists,like lapine,required that he leave his civilian employment in direct response to an order or call to active duty.since lapine did not receive his order to report to active duty prior to tendering his resignation from the wellesley police department,the town contends that his intent to join the military after resigning,followed by his order for active duty,were insufficient to trigger reemployment rights under the statute.the town also argues that,even if an individual intent to go on active duty is enough to secure reemployment rights under the vrra,the overwhelming evidence demonstrates that lapine did not resign his job as a police officer in order to enter onto active duty,but rather,because he was extremely dissatisfied with his working conditions and wished to withdraw his retirement fund to pay obligations to the irs and his.
the difficulty with the town statutory argument is that it is supported neither by the plain language of the applicable provision of the vrra nor by the provision legislative history.similarly,we disagree that there was insufficient evidentiary support for the court finding that lapine resigned in order to go on active it is unquestionable that dissatisfaction with his police job under the was a major motivating factor.
plain language of the vrra 
we begin with the language of the statutory provision granting reemployment rights to reservists who,like lapine,initiated reemployment prior to december,see brady credit recovery,cir noting statutory language is the starting point for every case involving statutory construction.if statutory language is plain,permitting only one construction,there is no occasion to seek out congressional intent by reference to legislative history or other extrinsic aids.united states meade,cir.the applicable,relevant provision here is section b of the vrra providing as follows 
any person who,after entering the employment on the basis of which such person claims restoration or reemployment,enters upon active duty other than for the purpose of determining physical fitness and other than for training,whether or not voluntarily,in the armed forces of the united states in response to an order or call to active duty shall,upon such person relief from active duty under honorable conditions,be entitled to all of the reemployment rights and benefits provided for by this chapter 
the town argues that the foregoing language allows reemployment rights only to those reservists who left their civilian employment in response to an order or call to duty received while their civilian employment was still in progress.any such express restriction would have to be derived,if at all,from the statute reference to any person who enters upon active duty in response to an order or call after entering the employment on the basis of which such person claims restoration or reemployment.but while the statute speaks of the order or call as occurring after entering the relevant civilian employment,it does not specify that the order or call must necessarily be timed so as to arrive while the civilian employment is still ongoing.it would not be inconsistent with the statutory language if the order or call were to occur after as well as before resignation.the express language of the statute nowhere specifically links an individual entry upon active duty in response to an order or call to his exit from civilian employment.the phrase enters upon active duty not some phrase such as leaves his employment modifies the phrase in response to an order or call to active duty.
it is true the statute was aimed at reservists who leave their civilian jobs in order to enter upon active duty,suggesting the need for a meaningful connection between the resignation and the entry upon active duty.but the statutory language does not spell out the timing and mechanics of the connection.in the following section of this opinion,we conclude that the legislative history,the wording of a companion provision of the statute,and the interpretative case law,provide guidance about the nature of the required nexus.but the plain language of section b of the vrra does not mandate that lapine entry upon active duty had to occur only while he was still in the actual employ of the wellesley police department.at the very least,section b is open to two interpretations that the call or order to active duty will issue during the employment or,alternatively,that it may issue after termination of the employment with appropriate linkage between leaving and entry upon active duty 
we conclude that the plain language of the applicable statute did not render lapine resignation premature as a matter of law so as to prevent him from making a valid claim to reemployment.
statutory history 
when faced with a statutory provision lacking in clarity or one susceptible to more than one interpretation,courts will look to legislative history to determine legislative intent.capen,am.trading prod,cir.cert.denied,d.
section b affording reemployment rights to reservists is rooted in the history and statutory text of legislation that,beginning in world war ii,provided reemployment rights to veterans returning from active duty in the armed forces.hence,section b needs to be read,not in isolation,but in the context of the history and evolution of the entire statute of which it forms a part.king vincent,d relaying the cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole,since the meaning of statutory language,plain or not,depends on context internal citation omitted.
a veteran right to reemployment was first established in the selective training and service act of stsa,stat,formerly codified at app.the stsa was aimed primarily at draftees and voluntary enlistees in world war ii id.this grant of reemployment rights to veterans was premised on congress belief that an individual,obligated,or willing,to serve in the armed forces,should not be penalized by loss of previous employment rights upon reentry into civilian life.see,kelly ford instrument,cir rudisill chesapeake ohio ry,cir.the stsa provided,in pertinent part,that any individual who leaves a position other than a temporary position in the employ of an employer in order to perform military duty has the right to reemployment.hence,to trigger reemployment rights congress required,as a causal nexus between the act of leaving civilian employment and entry into the armed forces,that the employee have left his civilian employment in order to perform the military service,and not for some different object.
over a decade later,in,the universal military training service act umt was enacted,marking the beginning of veterans reemployment rights in the era post wwii,s,stat,formerly codified app.the umt was the genesis of the reserve forces as these are understood today.it instituted active duty training programs and expanded the federal government abilities to call upon the reserves for national defense.for the first time,congress provided civilian reemployment protection to reservists who were called up from their civilian jobs to perform active or training duty.id in so doing,congress intended to provide the same reemployment rights and benefits upon relief as are provided for persons inducted or enlisted in the armed forces,reprinted in.
in extending reemployment rights to reservists in,congress first utilized,in part,the in response to an order or call language that was subsequently incorporated into section b.this section initially provided that a ny person who,subsequent to june,enters upon active duty in response to an order or call to active duty shall be entitled to all the reemployment rights and benefits provided under this chapter,s,stat.as we have stated in footnote,supra,the further phrase after entering the employment on the basis of which such person claims restoration was not a part of the initial reservist statute.it was added in as a part of revisions extending reemployment rights to veterans who extended their military commitment for an additional four years,stat.unexplained in accompanying legislative materials,the new phrase was presumably meant simply to identify more plainly the employer against which reemployment rights could later be asserted.the brief comment relating to the act revised reemployment provisions stated that they were meant to reinforce the reemployment protections already in existence,reprinted in,see also trulson trane,cir the reemployment provisions of this act and its predecessors are substantially identical and the judicial precedents developed under the various acts are largely interchangeable.quoting hanna am.motors,cir.
indeed,the legislative history leads us to two conclusions relevant to the vrra provision at issue in the present case.first,as said,there is nothing in the legislative history to support a reading of section b that would require the reservists covered by that provision to have received their order or call to active duty while still employed,even though all other categories of service persons claiming reemployment rights were not so restricted.second,the language in section a of the vrra affording reemployment rights to who left their civilian positions in order to perform military duty provides a nexus equally applicable to reservists claiming rights under section b.
turning to the first point,the historical evidence is plain,as already indicated,that in framing reemployment rights for reservists,congress meant simply to extend the identical reemployment rights conferred upon other veterans.see,reprinted in,discussing the addition of reemployment rights for reservists to the existing statute and referring to reemployment rights set forth in section of the selective service act of.in this regard,the case law that had developed around provisions of the earlier stsa and the,g,stat,formerly codified as,had allowed for recovery of previous employment and associated rights by veterans who had left their civilian jobs prior to their being drafted,or prior to their voluntary enlisting in the armed forces.see,boston maine hayes,cir w e think congress intended the reemployment provisions of the act to apply to the man who voluntarily quits his job to enlist or to make himself available for induction as well as to the man who is compelled to quit his job because of his induction in the usual course.noble int l nickel,finding a veteran who enlisted in the navy two weeks after quitting his civilian job eligible for reemployment.nowhere in the legislative history is there any suggestion that congress somehow intended,in legislating for reservists,and granting them the identical rights,to impose different restrictions and eligibility standards as preconditions to reemployment.as noted in the previous section,the text of section b is compatible with the issuance of an order or call to active duty following,rather than prior to quitting civilian employment,leaving ample room for application of the above precedents.
our conclusion that,in the vrra,congress had extended to more or same rights as it had provided to others serving in the armed forces is further bolstered by the statutory text and legislative history of the userra userra was created to streamline the laws protecting veterans that had become increasingly complex and cumbersome over the years.indeed,this case illustrates some of those problems.section of the userra establishes reemployment rights for any person whose absence from a position of employment is necessitated by reason of service in the uniformed services regardless of whether his or her service is in the regular or reserve component.there is nothing in the legislative history to indicate that congress,by treating reservists and regular army veterans the same with regards to reemployment benefits under the userra,thought it was departing from the substance of the law as it had existed in the past.indeed,the legislative history accompanying the userra was careful to note changes to the law that represented a deviation from the vrra.see,reprinted in,discussing changes to time limitations and imposition of notice requirement.
we accordingly reject the town argument that lapine right to reemployment was defeated by the fact that his order to active duty did not come until after he had left his job with the wellesley police department.
as for our second point,the statutory history indicates that section b the reemployment provision applicable to subject to the same in order to perform requirement made explicit in section a the traditional reemployment nexus applying to other categories of service personnel.it seems obvious that congress expected section b to require implicitly a connection between the act of quitting one civilian employment and entering upon active duty.otherwise,congress purpose to benefit only those veterans who leave their civilian employment so as to serve their country in the armed forces would be exceeded,and employers would be required to reemploy some former employees for no good reason.courts have held that an employee who quits his civilian employment to forestall being fired,see mccarthy m transp,cir,or who quits for personal reasons unrelated to military enlistment,see riser states power,civil,wl,at,can not,by subsequently joining the armed forces,force his former employer to take him back at the end of his tour of duty.
the nexus requirement first adopted in in the initial military reemployment statute and carried forward up through the period of lapine claim in a,provided simply that one claiming reemployment benefits must demonstrate that he left his civilian employment in order to perform military duty.we think this requirement was also implicit in the case of reservists claiming reemployment benefits under section b even though,unlike section a,the latter statute did not repeat the specific language.the magistrate judge correctly so assumed,making the finding that lapine did,in fact,resign from the wellesley police department in order voluntarily to enter on active duty with the united states army reserve.we discuss below the evidentiary support for that finding.suffice it to say,we hold that the magistrate judge utilized the appropriate legal standard.if properly supported,the finding sufficed to establish lapine compliance with the nexus standard inherent in the reemployment statute.
in this regard we note that courts have concluded that a firm intent to enter the military coupled with actions that promptly effectuated that intent may,in appropriate circumstances,establish the causative nexus.see,trulson,at duey city of eufaula,wl,at,fortenberry owen.packing,noble.at.thus,a veteran may establish that he left his civilian employment in order to perform military duty notwithstanding the timing of the order or ultimate before or after resignation.see trulson,at and cases cited therein.
contrary to the town position,therefore,neither the language of the statute,the legislative history,nor the surrounding case law suggests that congress intended that a veteran,to establish the causative nexus,must have received an induction notice,signed an enlistment contract,or received an order or call to active duty prior to his resignation.the case law is replete with examples of veterans who left their civilian employment in order to serve in the military before they were actually compelled,by receipt of an induction notice or similar order,to do so.see,boston maine hayes,cir noble.at,see also rudisill,at stating rights not limited to persons who are forced to leave their positions,but are extended to all those who leave their positions in order to perform such service.adams mobile county pers,wl at,finding veteran eligible for reemployment because she resigned with the intent of entering upon active duty and did so jennings.office of,wl at,same thompson chesapeake ry,same.
we agree,therefore,with the magistrate judge that if found there were active duty openings and that his chance of being accepted was his job with the wellesley police with the intent to go on active duty as soon as the necessary paperwork could be completed and orders issued,and clearly diligently and successfully carried out this intention,he was entitled to claim reemployment benefits under the vrra.
sufficiency of the evidence 
the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to establish that lapine left the wellesley police department in order to perform military service.in addition to lapine testimony,two other individuals testified,without contradiction,that lapine had spoken with them about his intent to apply for a position with the agr prior to his resignation on april.robert johnson,lapine attorney,testified that on april,lapine informed him that he wished to enter into active duty.albert basile,a recruiter with the army reserves,stated that,in the latter part of april,he contacted lapine about entering the agr.basile testified that he informed lapine he would make an excellent candidate for the agr.immediately following his conversation with basile,lapine submitted his resignation.a week after he submitted his letter of resignation,but before the effective date of his resignation as stated in the letter,lapine interviewed before a panel for a position with the agr.he was selected unanimously and he promptly completed the necessary paperwork.one month later he received an official notice that he was being assigned to active duty.lapine then entered upon active duty,satisfactorily completed his tour of duty,and was honorably discharged in august.
the town argues that lapine resignation was not motivated by his desire to enter the military but rather it was driven by his acute dissatisfaction with the police department.the fact that lapine decision to leave the police and to join the army may have been fueled by more than one motive does not establish that the magistrate judge erred in determining that he resigned from the police department in order voluntarily to enter on active duty with the agr.to be sure,his intent to go on active duty followed by his resignation and subsequent entry on active duty may well have reflected his distaste for continued police employment.lapine letter reflects profound dissatisfaction with working conditions at the police department under its.he apparently regarded the military as a more attractive alternative.but the combination of motives does not preclude a finding that he left his position in order to perform military duty.in the real world,motives are often mixed.this court has long recognized,especially in labor and employment decisions,that an individual actions may be propelled by mixed motives.see,fernandes costa.masonry,cir nlrb smelting and refining,cir it is not unusual for a person to seek and accept another job because of dissatisfaction with a previous job.
the evidence here is persuasive that,before resigning,lapine formed an intent to go on active duty and acted on that intent by speaking with basile before he wrote his letter of resignation.word from basile suggested that his chances of acceptance were good.in his letter of resignation he says that only the opportunity to secure other employment prevented me from resigning earlier and possibly the hope that conditions would change.the implication here is that he believed he had at last found an opportunity to secure desirable other employment,and that,in order to secure that employment,he was now resigning.to be sure,he took some risk by terminating his employment prior to being finally accepted into the agr program.still the evidence indicates his prior intent and that,at the time he resigned,he was diligently doing what was necessary to join the agr program and that he had good reason to believe that he would be accepted as,in fact,he was.the evidence is uncontradicted at all relevant times,both before and after resigning,he intended to join the military if accepted.
we therefore sustain the finding of the magistrate judge that lapine left his position with the town in order to perform military service.
qualified to perform 
next,the town argues that lapine is not qualified to resume the duties of a police officer.the vrra requires that a returning veteran be qualified to perform the duties of such position or able to become requalified with reasonable efforts by the employer a b i.to be qualified to return to a prior position,the veteran must be both physically capable of performing the duties of the job and temperamentally able to work harmoniously with and supervisors.trusteed funds dacey,cir preda nissho iwai am,cir.the town does not dispute that lapine is physically qualified to perform his duties rather the town asserts that he is temperamentally unqualified to work as a police officer.
to support its position,the town relied on several incidences of lapine improper conduct during his tenure as a police officer.the town asserted that lapine conduct exhibited an inability to work harmoniously within the police department.behavior occurring prior to entering upon active duty can be the basis for finding a veteran no longer qualified for reemployment.doane martin,cir.the town presented evidence that lapine was the subject of several disciplinary actions while in the town employ.the most egregious conduct,including a physical altercation with another officer,placing a chemical irritant on a superior uniform,and failing to assist citizens calling the station for help,occurred in and a decade before his resignation.in each instance,lapine was disciplined according to departmental policy but not fired.
the magistrate judge ruled that the conduct in question was too far removed from lapine date of resignation to deem lapine unqualified for reemployment under the vrra.the town had disciplined lapine after each incident and had chosen not to terminate him.moreover,closer to lapine date of resignation,he received favorable employee evaluations in which he was described as definitely above average and conscientious,and was given several service commendations.in addition,chief,the current chief of police,testified that,upon review of lapine personnel file,he would have no basis to terminate him from the police force.
the magistrate judge conclusion is supported by the few cases that have addressed this issue.courts have held that a veteran is not qualified to return to his former position if he demonstrates extreme or dangerous behavior.see,doane,at dacey,at preda,at green,cir winfree morrison.
in dacey there was evidence that,upon his return from service,dacey had threatened to rule or ruin the company and to mow down opposition.at.in addition,he had made unsupported charges regarding the officers and directors.id.likewise,in green,the returning veteran was deemed unqualified when he engaged in fraudulent behavior described as active and gross provocation and wrongdoing.at citing mcclayton cassell.in winfree,a veteran was found unqualified because he brought weapons to work,threatened to kill fellow employees and served liquor to underage patrons.at.
we find no error in the magistrate judge conclusion that lapine was not temperamentally disqualified from continuing his duties as a police officer.to be sure,lapine early conduct during his tenure with the wellesley police department was at times questionable and the tenor of his letter of resignation suggests a short fuse and,quite possibly,an unprofessional manner of dealing with his employer.at the time of his resignation,however,lapine was described by his superiors as an above average and conscientious police officer.given these positive reviews,as well as the fact that the department did not terminate him after his egregious acts but allowed him to stay on for a number of years during which no similar incident occurred,we can see no adequate basis for overturning the magistrate judge finding that he was qualified.nor are we in a position,at this juncture,to sufficiently evaluate the factors surrounding his angry letter of resignation so as to conclude,from the letter alone,that he was temperamentally unsuited.
iii.waiver 
the town argues that even if we were to determine that lapine meets the statutory requirements of the vrra,entitling him to claim a right to reemployment,he nonetheless waived that right by his conduct at the time he resigned from the wellesley police department.the town predicates the waiver on his letter of resignation indicating his profound dissatisfaction with the police department and,by implication,his intention not to return his withdrawal of his pension funds coupled with the signed statement that he had permanently left the police service and his failure to notify the town that he planned to enter upon active duty with the army reserve.to these facts might be added lapine stipulation that he was aware of his reemployment rights under the vrra before he quit the police force and the further fact that he was a mature and experienced veteran when he resigned.
as the magistrate judge noted,the foregoing factors make for a fairly powerful argument that lapine impliedly waived prospectively his vrra reemployment rights.nonetheless,the magistrate judge rejected the argument and so,ultimately,do we.
we begin with the assumption that,while the vrra does not expressly provide for a waiver of reemployment rights,there are circumstances in which valid waivers may occur.after a veteran has completed his military service he may make statements,or engage in conduct,that in effect,surrender his right to be reemployed.see,carmalt motors acceptance,cir concluding veteran waived claim to reemployment where he said all right when informed that he could not be taken back and thereafter entered upon various other employments couture evergreen int l airlines,finding waiver of reemployment right to former position when veteran accepted a different position with same employer upon discharge hayse.dep t of conservation,finding waiver of reemployment rights under the act by accepting a more lucrative position with a construction firm within two weeks of the time he returned from the service aff cir 
it is considerably less clear,however,that an individual at the threshold of entry upon military service can,at that time,prospectively waive his future right to reemployment.see leonard united airlines,w e do not think that congress could have intended that employees would be able to waive their rights before entering military service.while we would not foreclose all possibilities of finding an express or implied waiver in unique situations arising at that time,there are strong reasons of policy for ruling out such prospective waivers in all but the most exceptional circumstances.the united states department of labor dol states i n all but the most unusual circumstances,a veteran can not expressly or impliedly waive his reemployment rights before or during military service.veterans reemployment rights handbook,ed.hereinafter handbook.
rights generally do not mature until the veteran requests reinstatement,and rights not yet matured will not readily be considered to have been waived even if the veteran,before or during military service,voluntarily makes statements or taken sic action clearly indicating an intent not to return to the employer,a waiver will not be implied from such statements or conduct because the statute was intended to keep that possibility open until the veteran returns to civilian life.
the dol is charged with the administration of the vrra.while not controlling upon the courts,the dol views are entitled to some consideration.skidmore swift.stating that the rulings,interpretations and opinions of an administrator of an act constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance see also monroe standard oil,d citing to the handbook in a case under the vietnam era veterans readjustment allowance act.the weight to be given these dol publications is enhanced by the longstanding and consistent nature of the position taken regarding waiver,and its inception so soon after the legislation.skidmore,at sykes columbus greenville,cir.
we think there are ample reasons supporting the dol handbook position,alexander,d concluding there can be no prospective waiver of an individual right to equal employment opportunities.the vrra was a remedial statute that was designed to aid a veteran reentry into civilian life.the statute provided a veteran with a stated time period within which to seek reemployment with his or her former employer.a providing that a veteran must make application for reemployment within days of honorable discharge.upon return,the veteran is not pressed for a decision immediately on his discharge but has the opportunity to make plans for the future and readjust himself to civilian life.fishgold sullivan drydock and repair.thus,both the statute and case law anticipate that a veteran will usually make a decision regarding reemployment when he or she returns from active duty but not before.
the legislative history of the userra,which replaced the vrra soon after lapine asserted his right to reemployment,is consistent with the dol position that ordinarily a veteran should not be held to make a binding decision about whether or not to return to his former employment until after the conclusion of active duty.it is true that userra,unlike vrra,requires a future claimant to preserve his reemployment right in advance by notifying his employer that his absence from a position of employment is necessitated by military service.a.had lapine been subject to userra,his failure to notify the town that he was going on active duty would have defeated his reemployment claim not by waiver but because of noncompliance with this new statutory condition.apart from imposing this condition,however,congress emphasized in the house report accompanying userra that the serviceperson choice whether or not to return to his former job was to remain open until release from active service,reprinted in.the house report quotes from the supreme court decision in fishgold for the proposition that o ne of the basic purposes of the reemployment statute is to maintain the servicemember civilian job as an unburned bridge.thus the house report states 
the committee does not intend that the requirement to give notice to one employer in advance of service in the uniformed services be construed to require the employee to decide,at the time the person leaves the job,whether he or she will seek reemployment upon release from active service.one of the basic purposes of the reemployment statute is to maintain the servicemember civilian job as an unburned bridge.not until the individual discharge or release from service transportation time back home,which triggers the application time,does the servicemember have to decide whether to recross that bridge.see fishgold,supra,at.
we agree with the dol,therefore,that prospective waivers of veterans reemployment not entirely not to be easily inferred and should be reserved for the most unusual circumstances.hence in the instant case,we ask whether the facts reach the level of the most unusual circumstances necessary to support a prospective waiver.we think not.
we note,first of all,that lapine intent to waive his future reemployment rights was less than clearly expressed in his words and conduct.while his letter of resignation spoke of his dissatisfaction with working conditions at the wellesley police department,his complaints were virtually all tied into dissatisfaction with the leadership of fritts.lapine does not attack others than chief fritts.there is no suggestion that lapine would refuse to return under a new administration more to his liking.at no time,moreover,did lapine actually indicate that he was waiving his future reemployment rights.generally,the mere fact of a resignation from civilian employment does not deprive a veteran of reemployment rights.winders people express airlines,and cases cited therein.and two years later,while still on active military duty,lapine wrote the first of several letters indicating a possible wish to return.
it is true that lapine,after he quit,did not notify the town in a timely fashion that he had entered upon active military duty,as would now be required under the userra.see.but the vrra had no such statutory requirement and,for that reason,we are not inclined to weigh the absence of notice as a significant factor indicative of waiver.
perhaps the strongest factor su
