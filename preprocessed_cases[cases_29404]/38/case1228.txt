during the vietnam war era and after having served a period of confinement for being absent without leave,tony robertson was discharged from the army under conditions other than honorable,a character of discharge that can foreclose the receipt of veterans benefits.he subsequently participated in president ford clemency program and received a presidential pardon and a new clemency discharge.despite his pardon and clemency discharge,the department of veterans affairs has continued to deny robertson claim for veterans benefits.we must decide whether the presidential pardon precludes the department of veterans affairs from relying on robertson underlying misconduct in making a benefits decision.because we conclude that the department of veterans affairs properly considered the misconduct underlying his pardoned offense to deny his application for benefits,we affirm.

the pcb was guided by several core principles.for one,the pcb recognized that the president was granting clemency,not amnesty,and that clemency was to be determined on a basis,not through a categorical approach.id.at.accordingly,the pcb made findings and recommendations in each case as to whether the president should grant or deny clemency.executive order.at see also pcb report pcb hearings.among other things,the pcb examined applications for clemency from former servicemen,like robertson,who received undesirable discharges for going absent without leave awol between the date of the gulf of tonkin resolution august,and the date the last american combatant left vietnam march.executive order.at pcb report xi.in total,of approximately servicemen discharged for awol offenses applied.pcb report xiii.
