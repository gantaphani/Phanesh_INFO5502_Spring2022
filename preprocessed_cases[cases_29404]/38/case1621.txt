the department asserted a lien on ashlynn recovery,based on the that it spent on her behalf.the department initially demanded to satisfy its lien.ashlynn filed a special motion to determine the department lien under section.ashlynn supported her motion with declarations from her counsel and two physicians,presenting evidence regarding her life expectancy the care she will need throughout her life the cost of future care lost earning capacity and the value of her pain and suffering.among other things,ashlynn presented evidence that she needs hours per day of licensed vocational nurse lvn attendant care until she reaches the age of,and hours per day lvn attendant care for the rest of her life.rounded to the nearest dollar,she claimed that the full value of her claim was as follows

ashlynn argued the department lien should be.she calculated this lien amount via a methodology used in ahlborn.ahlborn,supra,at.the department presented no evidence in its opposition to dispute this evidence.it argued that no statutory or case authority mandated the rigid mathematical formula used by ashlynn.it claimed its lien was not limited to the past medical care expenses it paid,but extended to ashlynn future care.the department also asserted its lien should not be reduced by the amount of attorney fees and costs expended by ashlynn to obtain the settlement.the department stated it would accept percent of the total settlement to satisfy its lien,or about.
in her reply,ashlynn complained the department failed to provide a rational alternative method for calculating the lien amount,no court has embraced the department arguments and the department plucked the number from the air.the department then filed a supplemental opposition,which adopted the formula used by ashlynn,but eliminated the value of ashlynn future medical expenses from the calculation on the grounds it would be paying those future expenses,resulting in a lien amount of.

discussion 
background law 
medicaid is a cooperative federal and state program that pays for medical services to individuals who can not afford to pay their own medical costs.ahlborn,supra,at see et under the medicaid program,the federal government provides financial assistance to states that voluntarily participate to assist them in providing health care to needy persons.if a state agrees to establish a medicaid plan,the federal government agrees to pay a specific percentage of expenses.participating states must comply with federal medicaid law.one of the laws is that the state medicaid agency must seek reimbursement for medical expenses from liable third parties.branson sharp healthcare,th,branson.california participates in the medicaid program through the california medical assistance program medi cal et.branson,at.
in ahlborn,the united states supreme court held that in seeking reimbursement the state assigned rights extend only to recovery of payments for medical care.ahlborn,supra,at.in response to ahlborn,our legislature amended the california statutes governing claims for reimbursements made by the department for funds expended on behalf of injured parties by the medi cal program.bolanos superior court th,bolanos.namely,from any settlement,judgment or award obtained by an injured party,the department is limited to recovering payments it made for medical expenses,subd.a.in determining what portion of a settlement,judgment,or award represents payment for medical expenses,or medical care,provided on behalf of the beneficiary and as to what the appropriate reimbursement amount to the director should be,the court shall be guided by ahlborn and other relevant statutory and case law.ibid.w hen the settlement,judgment or award does not specify what portion thereof was for past medical expenses,an allocation must be made in the settlement,judgment or award that indicates what portion is for past medical expenses as distinct from other damages.the director recovery is limited to that portion of the settlement that is allocated to past medical expenses.bolanos,at.
settlements,however,are often not allocated between past medical expenses and other damages.this was the situation in ahlborn.ahlborn,supra,at.thus,the parties in ahlborn stipulated to the use of a formula the ahlborn formula as an allocation method.id.at,fn.numerous courts have since accepted the ahlborn formula as an acceptable method of approximating the amount of medical expenses.lopez daimler chrysler th,lopez lima vouis th,lima bolanos,supra,th at see also,in re,idaho dep t of health welfare hudelson idaho,lugo beth israel med.ctr.misc d.the ahlborn formula is the ratio of the settlement to the total claim,when applied to the benefits provided by the department.bolanos,supra,th at.expressed mathematically,the ahlborn formula calculates the reimbursement due as the total settlement divided by the full value of the claim,which is then multiplied by the value of benefits provided.reimbursement due total settlement full value of claim x value of benefits provided.the parties dispute focuses on the variable addressing the full value of ashlynn claim specifically,whether future attendant care and medical care should be included in this variable.
recently,the united states supreme court addressed the division of a settlement between medical and nonmedical expenses for purposes of determining a medicaid lien in wos,d wos.in wos,our high court reviewed a north carolina statute that established a conclusive presumption that when the state medicaid expenditures exceed of a beneficiary tort recovery,that of the recovery represented compensation for medical expenses,even if the settlement or verdict expressly allocated a lower percentage of the judgment to medical expenses.id.at.the court concluded that a n irrebuttable,statutory presumption was incompatible with the medicaid act clear mandate that a state may not demand any portion of a beneficiary tort recovery except the share that is attributable to medical expenses.id.at.the supreme court recognized that in some cases the parties may stipulate to an allocation,but where a stipulation does not exist,fair allocations must be decided by the court at a hearing.id.at.the supreme court cited section as an example of a statute providing for such a hearing procedure.wos,at.
ii.future attendant care and medical care 
additional facts 
the department presented a declaration from one of its employees,rhonda wyatt,an associate governmental program analyst working in the third party liability and recovery division.wyatt summarized the type of benefits available to medi cal beneficiaries.wyatt reviewed the physician declarations presented by ashlynn in support of her motion and confirm ed that the foregoing benefits and services described in paragraph above encompass all of the benefits and services described in those declarations.
ashlynn noted that wyatt cited no statutes or regulations requiring medi cal to pay for attendant care or showing that medi cal paid for these expenses in the past.she complained the department cited no authority to support its conclusion that it would pay these future expenses.the trial court issued a tentative ruling that included the approximately million for ashlynn future attendant care in its calculation.
after the court issued its tentative ruling the department presented a declaration from another of its employees,alberta baral.baral declaration was virtually identical to wyatt declaration,but added the words attendant care by an lvn to the description of the types of therapies for which medi cal pays.ashlynn objected to baral declaration as untimely.the trial court sustained ashlynn objection to the baral declaration.
at oral argument,the attorney general confirmed with the trial court that it accepted the representation of ashlynn counsel that medi cal would not pay for future attendant care services and thus the value of these services should be included in the calculation.the court final ruling on the motion included the value of attendant care services in its calculation.the trial court,however,eliminated from its calculation the cost of ashlynn future medical care,presumably concluding that medi cal would be paying for ashlynn future medical care.
the department does not contest the trial court use of the ahlborn formula to calculate the reimbursement it is due.to the extent the department continues to assert the ahlborn formula is not a formula to be applied in all subsequent cases we note the department failed to suggest an alternative method for calculating its lien.
the department and ashlynn respective appeals focus on the value of one of the variables used in the ahlborn formula namely,they dispute the number used by the trial court for the full value of ashlynn claim.the department asserts the full value of ashlynn claim should not include the amount of her future expenses for attendant care,estimated to be million,as the department will be paying those future expenses for ashlynn through the medi cal program.eliminating those future expenses from the calculation results in a much higher ratio,and thus,a much higher recovery by the department.specifically,the department argues the trial court factual finding that medi cal will not pay ashlynn million in future expenses for attendant care is contrary to the substantial evidence in the record.
ashlynn contends wyatt declaration does not show the department will or can pay all of her future attendant care and medical expenses for the rest of her life and these future expenses should be included in determining the full value of her claim.accordingly,she argues we should affirm the trial court finding that medi cal will not pay her future attendant care expenses.in her appeal,she asserts we should reverse the trial court finding that medi cal will pay her future medical care expenses for the same reasons she argued above,wyatt declaration does not show the department will or can pay all of her future medical expenses for the rest of her life.the department responds that the trial court elimination of the cost of future medical expenses from the ahlborn calculation properly interpreted prevailing law.for ashlynn appeal,both parties essentially incorporated by reference their arguments for the department appeal.accordingly,we discuss both appeals together.additionally,because both appeals focus on whether future attendant care and future medical care should be included or excluded from the ahlborn calculation,where appropriate,we refer to these future expenses together as future health care expenses.
the department asserts the trial court erred when it refused to accept wyatt uncontroverted and sworn declaration attesting that medi cal had approved and would be paying for ashlynn future attendant care.citing mcmillian stroud th mcmillian,the department claims the trial court failed to recognize that as a debtor,ashlynn had the burden of proving the department did not cover and would not pay for her future attendant care.the department asserts the matter should be reversed and remanded with instructions that the trial court accept the department sworn testimony that medi cal will pay about million for attendant care thus,the trial court erred when it excluded these expenses in determining the full value of ashlynn claim.ashlynn asserts the trial court correctly rejected the department purported promise to pay for future attendant care as speculative.for the same reasons,she contends the trial court erred when it found that medi cal will pay for all of her future medical care expenses.
in mcmillian,the court analogized the health care agency to a creditor and concluded that the recipient bears the burden of proof on the affirmative defense that the amount demanded to satisfy the lien exceeds what is permitted by law.mcmillian,supra,th at.here,ashlynn moved to reduce the department lien,arguing that the ahlborn formula applied and presenting evidence regarding the full value of her claim,including the about million for future attendant care.ashlynn satisfied her burden of proving the facts essential to her claim for relief.lopez,lima and bolanos all stand for the proposition that use of the ahlborn formula is a reasonable method for calculating the department lien.ante,part 
in opposition to the motion,the department argued the ahlborn formula did not apply.eventually,in its supplemental opposition,the department adopted the ahlborn formula.the department presented wyatt declaration to support its contention that the about million for future attendant care should be removed from the calculation because it would be paying these future expenses.thus,the question before the trial court was whether the about million for future attendant care should be removed from the calculation based on wyatt declaration.the trial court rejected wyatt declaration as speculative and included future expenses for attendant care in its calculation.the question before us is whether the trial court erred when it rejected wyatt declaration as substantial evidence showing the department would pay ashlynn future attendant care and apparently accepted the declaration as substantial evidence showing the department would pay ashlynn future medical care.
by presenting wyatt declaration,the department tried to avoid the issue it faced in lima.in lima,the department impliedly argued it would be responsible for all or a substantial portion of the plaintiff future medical expenses.lima,supra,th.the lima court stated the department contention in this regard is unsupported by authority ahlborn,supra,does not squarely address the issue,
