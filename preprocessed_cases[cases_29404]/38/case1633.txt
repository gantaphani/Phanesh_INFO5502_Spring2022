this is the third appeal involving payment of disability retirement to plaintiff mary porter by defendant board of retirement of the orange county employees retirement system.as with the previous two,this appeal deals with the effective date of plaintiff disability retirement under of government code section all further statutory references are to this code unless otherwise stated.it arises out of an amended judgment ordering defendant to find plaintiff entitled to disability retirement from the day following her last day of regular employment,without any offset for sick leave or workers compensation temporary disability payments defendant contends the trial court erred in relying on section to find workers compensation benefits did not qualify as compensation within the meaning of section statement that a disabled worker retirement becomes effective on the expiration date of any leave of absence with compensation to which he shall become entitled under the provisions of division commencing with section of the labor code and asserts a variety of reasons why the contrary conclusion is correct.finding none of these arguments persuasive,we grant plaintiff request for judicial notice of portions of section legislative history and affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural history 
we incorporate some of facts from porter board of retirement of the orange county employees retirement system june.porter and insert facts relating to this particular appeal where relevant.
p laintiff was injured while driving a bus for the orange county transportation authority.after she was treated,and received workers compensation,it was determined she was permanently injured and there was no available job for her.she later filed for disability retirement,which was denied.after appeal,a referee recommended defendant be awarded her retirement pay as of the date her application was filed.
after losing her petition for writ of mandate in the superior court,plaintiff appealed to our court,arguing that,under section,the effective date of her application should have been the day following the last day for which she was paid her regular salary,not the date her application was filed some months later.we agreed and reversed and remanded,directing the superior court to determine if plaintiff had elected to retire on the date of her application,and if so,whether she was required to repay her workers compensation and sick leave payments 
the trial court found that plaintiff had elected to retire on the day after her last regular day of compensation.it held that section directs that retirement is not to begin until the expiration of a leave of absence with compensation under division four of the labor code,or after expiration of any sick leave to which plaintiff was entitled.relying on the definition of compensation in division four,which includes every benefit given to an injured employee under the workers compensation scheme,it held that plaintiff was not entitled to have disability retirement benefits begin until after her workers compensation benefits ended.because the record contained insufficient evidence about the period during which plaintiff received workers compensation benefits,the court remanded the matter to defendant to make such a determination and also decide whether plaintiff could repay any workers compensation she had received after the effective date of her retirement.before any such hearing occurred,plaintiff appealed to this court.porter,supra.we dismissed the appeal as premature.
upon remand,the trial court entered a second amended judgment noting defendant concession during oral argument that the only type of payment that it seeks to have plaintiff repay is temporary disability.it then returned the matter to defendant to determine when and how much plaintiff received in temporary disability benefits,and plaintiff ability to repay these benefits.defendant adopted the hearing officer findings that plaintiff received workers compensation temporary total disability payments between february,and june,and that she did not believe she could repay that amount.
plaintiff filed a motion in the superior court seeking to have her disability retirement deemed effective date as of the day after she last received regular compensation,not when her workers compensation temporary disability pay expired.she argued she had not been on a leave of absence with compensation as required by section because she was not a safety employee who would be entitled to full salary for a year with contributions made to her retirement plan under labor code section.to help define compensation as used in section,she cited section,which,among other things,describes an uncompensated leave of absence as one in which the employee receives temporary disability benefits.plaintiff asserted her temporary disability payments could not be deemed a leave of absence with compensation in light of section.
the court agreed,reasoning section reference to an uncompensated leave of absence for which the member receives temporary disability benefits supports a finding that temporary disability benefits do not qualify as compensation.it entered a third amended judgment ordering defendant to set aside its decision denying plaintiff an earlier retirement date and to find her entitled to disability retirement from february,the day following her last day of regular employment,with no offsets for sick leave or workers compensation temporary disability payments.
discussion 
introduction 
under section,the retirement of a permanently disabled member of the retirement system shall be effective on the expiration date of any leave of absence with compensation to which he shall become entitled under the provisions of division commencing with section of the labor code or effective on the occasion of the member consent to retirement prior to the expiration of such leave of absence with compensation italics added.the parties disagree about the meaning of the italicized language,with defendant asserting its plain meaning requires plaintiff disability retirement to begin after her workers compensation benefits expired on june,and plaintiff responding that the phrase applies only to leaves that expressly provide for compensation,the leave granted public safety officers pursuant to section,subdivision a of the labor code 
pursuant to established principles,our first task in construing a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.in determining such intent,a court must look first to the words of the statute themselves,giving to the language its usual,ordinary import and according significance,if possible,to every word,phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.a construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.the words of the statute must be construed in context,keeping in mind the statutory purpose,and statutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized,both internally and with each other,to the extent possible.rodarte orange county fire authority th.any ambiguity or uncertainty in the meaning of pension legislation must be resolved in favor of the pensioner,but such construction must be consistent with the clear language and purpose of the statute.ventura county deputy sheriffs board of retirement cal th.
plain meaning 
defendant contends the plain meaning of the phrase leave of absence with compensation in section shows it applies to plaintiff because compensation is defined broadly under division of the labor code relating to workers compensation to include workers compensation benefits see,c ompensation means compensation under this division and includes every benefit or payment conferred by this division upon an injured employee without regard to negligence and the ordinary meaning of leave of absence is permission to be absent from duty or employment.we disagree.
nothing in section indicates the above definition of compensation is the one to be used in determining the expiration date of any leave of absence with compensation to which he shall become entitled under the provisions of division commencing with section of the labor code section does not so state.for example,it does not read any leave of absence in which the member receives compensation under the workers compensation act.nor does it say any leave of absence in which the member receives compensation as defined under division of the labor code.rather,it limits the leave of absence with compensation to one to which the member shall become entitled under division of the labor code.moreover,as plaintiff notes,t o seek the meaning of a statute is not simply to look up dictionary definitions and then stitch together the results.rather,it is to discern the sense of the statute,and therefore its words,in the legal and broader culture.obviously,a statute has no meaning apart from its words.similarly,its words have no meaning apart from the world in which they are spoken.hodges superior court cal th.
section is part of the county employees retirement law of cerl as codified in et under cerl,compensation is defined as the remuneration paid in cash out of county or district funds,plus any amount deducted from a member wages for participation in a deferred compensation plan but does not include the monetary value of board,lodging,fuel,laundry,or other advantages furnished to a member.see ventura,supra,cal th at citing section and w hen annual leave is taken as time off,the employee simply continues to receive regular salary or wages without the necessity of performing services.receipt of that pay is part of the employee remuneration for past services and is compensation.this definition is distinct from the one used in the workers compensation act.burnelle continental can d,compensation,as used in the workers compensation act,is a technical term and includes all payments conferred by the act upon an injured employee,and does not have the same meaning as does compensation with reference to payment to an employee of wages or salary for services performed.the latter is remuneration for work done,while the former is indemnification for injury sustained.
defendant asserts cerl recognizes different types of compensation and that section in particular references three distinctive forms.the first two are regular compensation disability retirement allowance effective when application filed but not earlier than the day following the last day for which he received regular compensation and sick leave with compensation retirement not effective until the expiration of such sick leave with compensation ibid.in katosh sonoma county employees retirement th katosh,the court held the term regular compensation in section includes compensation received for sick leave and vacation when taken by a member of the retirement system as time off.id.at.although katosh also stated the first sentence of section the one being interpreted here refers to certain temporary disability benefits under the workers compensation law id.at,that was not an issue before it and cases are not authority for propositions not considered cottonwood duplexes,llc barlow th.
according to defendant,the third type of compensation identified in section is compensation to which a member shall become entitled to under the provisions of division commencing with section of the labor code.but this construction reads out the phrase leave of absence,which is modified by the term compensation,in violation of the rule of statutory interpretation that significance should be given whenever possible to every word and phrase in order to avoid making some words surplusage.rodarte orange county fire authority,supra,th at.
the legal definition of leave of absence is a worker temporary absence from employment or duty with the intention to return.black law dict.ed,see also lewis unemployment ins.appeals bd.d,leave of absence means that the employee is given permission to be absent from work for a certain time at the end of which the employee will return to his employment status.when that is modified by section definition of compensation,a leave of absence with compensation under cerl is an absence from work for which remuneration for past services is paid.

legislative intent,objects to be achieved,evils to be remedied,and related statutes
