eddie wayne louthian,was convicted in the western district of virginia of multiple offenses arising from a health care fraud scheme.on appeal,louthian challenges each of his convictions,as well as the district court sentence and forfeiture order of nearly million.as explained below,we are content to affirm.
between and,louthian was president and business manager of the saltville rescue squad,the squad,headquartered in saltville,virginia the squad provided ambulance transport for medical emergencies,plus,inter alia,transportation for dialysis patients.although it was nominally a volunteer organization,the squad had a paid staff,including louthian the squad billed medicare and certain private insurers,including anthem blue shield anthem,for its services.
the medicare system provides insurance coverage for ambulance transportation to and from dialysis centers when conveyance by other means would endanger a patient health.before authorizing payments for recurring,transports,medicare requires the issuance of a physician certification statement,also known as a certificate of medical necessity cmn.once issued,a cmn is valid for a period of up to sixty days.although a cmn is a prerequisite for such transports,the existence of a valid cmn does not definitively establish medical necessity.for that,medicare relies on contemporaneous documentation of the patient condition,as observed by an emergency medical technician emt or paramedic.the ambulance staff fills out a form referred to as a call sheet or trip sheet to provide that documentation.
the medicare system is administered to ensure that claims for dialysis transports are paid to providers as quickly as possible.when such a claim is filed electronically,it must be paid within fifteen days of receipt.if a claim is filed on paper,it must be paid within days.because of the large volume of such claims for medicare payments,little or no inquiry is made into the validity of claims as they are received.if a paid claim is ultimately suspected of having been fraudulently submitted,the authorities will investigate and pursue an appropriate reimbursement,in addition to potential criminal charges a procedure sometimes referred to as pay and chase.
in april,the medicare fraud control unit of the virginia attorney general office the fraud unit or the unit began investigating the squad activities.the fraud unit suspected that the squad was engaged in a scheme to falsely bill medicare and private insurers for services that were not medically necessary.the unit investigation focused on the squad billings for services to three dialysis patients,referred to herein by their initials jr,nh,and bm.the squad provided ambulance transportation for those patients,up to three times per week,between their saltville homes and a dialysis center in abingdon,virginia,about twenty miles away.for each such transport,the squad billed medicare approximately to.the squad would also bill anthem,which was a secondary insurer for each of the three patients 
during the investigation,fraud unit agents conducted video surveillance and interviewed the squad employees and other witnesses.the unit investigation established that jr,nh,and bm could all walk,drive,and engage in other physical activities without difficulty and,as a result,could readily have been transported to dialysis by some less extraordinary means.the unit,working with the united states attorney,also unearthed evidence that louthian and other squad employees had forged,altered,and lied about the three patients medical conditions on documents submitted to support the squad requests for payments.during the investigation,louthian appeared before a federal grand jury in abingdon,where he testified concerning the squad activities.
on january,louthian,squad employee monica hicks,and the squad itself were indicted by the grand jury.louthian was charged in count one with conspiracy to commit health care fraud,see in count two with the substantive offense of health care fraud,see id.and in counts three through six with making false statements for payment by a health care benefit program,see id.counts seven and eight alleged money laundering,see id,and count nine alleged that louthian committed perjury before the grand jury,see id.hicks and the squad were charged with louthian in counts one through six the health care offenses,and the squad was a codefendant with louthian in counts seven and eight.count ten charged hicks and the squad with making false statements for payment by a health care benefit program.see id.finally,the indictment included a notice of forfeiture to each defendant.see id.on june,hicks pleaded guilty to count one,pursuant to an agreement with the united states attorney.louthian and the squad,on the other hand,opted to go to trial.
the jury trial of louthian and the squad,which began in abingdon on september,lasted for about ten days.the prosecution called roughly two dozen witnesses,including medicare and anthem administrators and investigators,law enforcement officers,current and former squad employees,and neighbors and family members of the three dialysis patients.
the prosecutors initially focused on the fraud unit observations of jr,nh,and bm.the evidence confirmed that,despite their need for regular dialysis treatment,the three patients lived relatively active lifestyles that belied their purported immobility.for example,patient jr regularly walked to and from the squad ambulance under her own power,often climbing into the ambulance through its side door.a neighbor saw jr at various times working in her yard,shopping at the grocery store,and walking around at other locations.investigator branson of the unit conducted video surveillance of jr that corroborated the neighbor account.one video clip showed jr being carried on a wheeled stretcher from the squad ambulance to her porch.she then climbed off the stretcher on her own and,showing no distress,got into a car to drive to a local senior center.squad employees confirmed that jr was able to walk to and from the ambulance,step into the ambulance through its side door,and climb onto the stretcher without assistance.
the evidence concerning patient nh was similarly damning.several video clips showed that nh was able to move around rather easily while being transported by the squad,including a clip where nh was allowed to stop at a hardee restaurant for breakfast on the way to a dialysis appointment.investigator darby of the fraud unit described an incident in which nh,immediately after being taken to her porch on a stretcher,stood in her doorway briefly conversing with squad employees,then drove to a nearby town to shop at several stores.as with jr,squad employees confirmed that nh was able to walk and stand,and was not bedridden.in fact,while being transported,nh would often sit in the captain chair in the back of the squad ambulance.nh hardee visits were shown to be regular occurrences,and nh sometimes even walked into the restaurant herself.one squad witness related that nh was a guest of the squad at its holiday parties.
the third patient,bm,passed away before the fraud unit had an opportunity to observe him.bm daughter,however,explained that bm had been her mother primary caretaker.as such,bm did the grocery shopping,administered his wife medicines,and kept up with her medical appointments.bm would drive himself to doctor appointments,work in his garden,and help seal driveways for his son paving business.former squad employees admitted that bm was using ambulance transport notwithstanding their knowledge that he could walk,stand,and drive.the prosecution also introduced bm medical records,along with those of the other two patients.the records were replete with references indicating that each of them could walk,stand,and engage in nearly all the normal activities of daily living.
according to hicks the convicted codefendant,louthian knew that medicare and anthem would not pay the squad for transporting jr,nh,and bm to dialysis if their physical conditions were properly reported.consequently,at louthian direction,squad employees and volunteers engaged in a pattern of forging and altering cmns,recording false information on call sheets,and making other material misrepresentations that louthian hoped would get the transports paid.
because a patient condition is subject to change,medicare regulations require that transportation service providers obtain a new cmn for each patient every sixty days.nonetheless,the squad billed medicare and anthem for almost eighteen months from july to january without obtaining a new cmn for either jr,nh,or bm.instead,louthian and hicks altered the dates of old cmns and submitted them in aid of reimbursement.according to hicks,she and louthian were well aware that the justifications in the old cmns for example,that the patients could neither stand nor walk,or were bedridden were not true.
louthian and his fellow squad employees were even more brazen in their falsifications of call sheets generated for transports.for example,louthian taught hicks to use good word s like in her narratives,regardless of a patient actual condition.tellingly,hicks admitted that she did not then know what meant only that its incantation would help ensure payments.once hicks knew how to fill them out to get them paid,louthian instructed her to prepare call sheets in advance for other squad employees,who would then sign them.id.at.on those sheets,hicks would make notations such as unable to stand,even though she and louthian,who were frequently in ambulances with the patients,knew the representations to be false.
several squad employees acknowledged using call sheets that were prepared in advance,and also being instructed by louthian to embellish call sheets with fabricated details.bunch,an emt,identified several occasions when he placed false information on call sheets at louthian direction.for example,a call sheet dated may,when bunch was the ambulance driver and louthian was the,reported that nh was,stretcher bound,unable to stand,and in need of oxygen in transport.all of these entries were false.see.emt lee conceded that a july,call sheet with her name on it was written by someone else,explaining that the narrative contained false statements about jr health.emt cassel admitted that her statements on two call sheets were untrue.another squad employee,mcallister,testified about call sheets involving patient bm.although the narratives indicated that bm chronic health concerns caused him to fall frequently,mcallister had no recollection of bm ever falling.finally,emt bellinger admitted signing prerecorded call sheets and creating her own false narratives at louthian request.bellinger confirmed that squad employees were instructed to use words like,even when the patients could walk,and that louthian told her to report that nh was partially blind,even though bellinger had seen nh driving her own vehicle.id.at.
after louthian learned that the dialysis transports were under investigation,he caused the squad to alter the manner in which it transported patients,in an effort to cover up the false billing scheme.once louthian realized the squad was being watched by the investigators,he insisted that the patients be kept on stretchers at all times and not allowed to walk to and from the ambulances.the squad minutes of a may,meeting reflected louthian change of procedure and indicated why it was made,stating transports take in and out of house on cots.had followers on transport.
on february,louthian was questioned before the federal grand jury regarding the changes he had made to the squad transport procedures after becoming aware of the fraud unit investigation.that testimony resulted in the perjury charge against him.count nine alleged that louthian answers to the following grand jury inquiries were materially false 
q approximately when was it that the people who were being transported for dialysis were always on a stretcher when did you say this has got ta end,these people have to be on a stretcher 
a i do recall i said that except as far as nh was concerned.i,i told em,i said i do care how much hell she raises,i do care what she says,she either going on a stretcher or she ai going.
q and when was this 
a that been a couple a years ago.
q a couple of years ago 
q and you believe that she was being transported in that manner after that 
a that was my understanding,yes.
q okay.and she was eventually 
a she was always on it when i went.
emphasis in indictment.the questions and answers particularized in count nine were submitted to the jury with the appropriate instructions.the prosecutors argued that louthian perjured himself when he told the grand jury that nh was always transported on a stretcher in his presence,and that things had been done that way for a couple of years.indeed,louthian testimony was directly contradicted by video evidence showing nh walking from the ambulance to her front door,with louthian present,just nine months before his grand jury appearance.
the prosecution rested its case on september.louthian then moved for acquittal under federal rule of criminal procedure,asserting that the evidence failed to make a prima facie showing of fraud.the district court denied the acquittal motion,after which the defense also rested.following closing arguments and instructions,the jury deliberated and returned its verdict.louthian was convicted of the health care offenses in counts one through six,plus perjury as charged in count nine,but was acquitted of the counts seven and eight money laundering charges.the squad was acquitted of all charges.louthian thereafter sought relief on the basis of what he called inconsistent verdicts,that although he had been convicted,the squad was acquitted.the court denied that motion as well.
on november,the district court conducted a hearing on the prosecution request for a criminal forfeiture.evidence was then introduced demonstrating that medicare and anthem paid more than for dialysis transports of jr,nh,and bm the prosecutors also presented evidence establishing the value of real estate and other property owned by the squad,identifying various bank accounts into which fraudulent payments had been deposited.
on february,the district court filed its opinion on the criminal forfeiture issue.see united states louthian,cr,ecf.the court therein concluded that the government was entitled to a money judgment of forfeiture against louthian.id.at.accordingly,the court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture against louthian of.
louthian sentencing hearing was conducted on march.the presentence report psr grouped his seven convictions and calculated a total offense level of with a criminal history category of i.as a result,louthian advisory guidelines range was to months of imprisonment.at the hearing,louthian lodged objections to several aspects of the psr,including his punitive classification as a leader or organizer of the fraud scheme,an enhancement for abusing a position of trust,an enhancement for obstruction of justice,and the loss calculation.
the district court rejected each of louthian objections and adopted the psr.the court also denied louthian request for a downward departure based on his age years,poor health severe bleach allergy,depression,hypertension,osteoarthritis,and diabetes,and lack of a criminal history.the court nevertheless varied downward from the advisory guidelines range and imposed seven concurrent prison terms of months each.on march,the court entered its criminal judgment,incorporating the preliminary order of forfeiture.the forfeiture order was subsequently amended,necessitating amendment of the criminal judgment,which occurred on april.louthian has timely noted this appeal,and we possess jurisdiction pursuant to and a.
louthian contends that myriad errors infected his trial and sentencing.most vigorously,louthian challenges the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him of the health care offenses in counts one through six and of the perjury offense in count nine.louthian asserts further that the jury returned inconsistent verdicts,with the result that the district court should have granted his motion for relief.with respect to the sentence imposed,louthian maintains that the court erroneously denied his request for a downward departure,and that he was improperly subjected to criminal forfeiture proceedings.we assess these contentions in turn.
we first evaluate louthian challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions on the health care offenses.we will sustain a guilty verdict if there is substantial evidence,taking the view most favorable to the government,to support it.united states whitfield,cir internal quotation marks omitted.substantial evidence exists if there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.id.internal quotation marks omitted.in determining whether there is substantial evidence to support a verdict,we defer to the jury determinations of credibility and resolutions of conflicts in the evidence,as they are within the sole province of the jury and are not susceptible to judicial review.see united states lowe,cir.
in order to prove the conspiracy to commit health care fraud count one the government was required to show,inter alia,an unlawful agreement between louthian and at least one other person to commit health care fraud.see.the substantive health care fraud offense count two required proof that louthian had 
knowingly and willfully execute d a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or to obtain,by means of false or fraudulent representations any of the money of any health care benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits,items,or services.
see id.finally,the four false statement charges counts three through six required proof that louthian knowingly and willfully ma de materially false or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits,items,or services.see id.
the common thread sustaining or defeating louthian challenge to all six health care offenses is whether there was sufficient evidence to prove that he made false and fraudulent misrepresentations to a health care benefit program.consistent with his rule requests for acquittal,louthian contends that the prosecution fell short of its burden because it failed to prove that the dialysis transport services provided to jr,nh,and bm were not medically necessary.br.of appellant.in that regard,louthian relies on the regulatory provision in d,which specifies with emphasis added that medicare will pay for ambulance transportation if a patient medical condition,regardless of bed confinement,is such that transportation by ambulance is medically required.predicated on that regulation,louthian argues that,although jr,nh,and bm were not bedridden,the prosecution nevertheless had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the patients could not otherwise have satisfied medicare requirements.
this contention fundamentally misapprehends the nature of the health care offenses.louthian was not convicted of providing services to individuals who did not qualify for insurance reimbursements.his convictions were based upon false and fraudulent statements to medicare and anthem to secure payments for the dialysis transports.louthian and those under his supervision falsely advised medicare and anthem that jr,nh,and bm needed ambulance transportation because they were bedridden.the trial evidence was more than sufficient to support the jury finding that such representations were untrue.the prosecution presented video,photographic,and testimonial evidence illustrating that the squad dialysis transport patients were able to stand,walk,drive,shop,garden,and perform manual labor,among other things.nonetheless,louthian repeatedly caused call sheets to be submitted describing the patients as bedridden,and unable to stand or walk.louthian himself was involved in several of the relevant dialysis transports,and thus was personally aware of the patients actual abilities.and when louthian learned that the squad activities were under scrutiny,he caused the squad to alter its practices in an effort to obstruct the fraud unit investigation and to cover up his fraudulent misdeeds.
even if louthian premise is assumed to be valid that he could not be guilty of the health care fraud offenses unless the prosecution proved that the ambulance transports were not medically required his defense theory would nevertheless fail.employing a definition of medical necessity that suits his purposes,louthian suggests that the health conditions of the three patients were such that,without ambulance transport,there is a likelihood that they could have suffered serious medical issues.br.of appellant.but that argument ignores the facts,that each of the three patients frequently rode in automobiles or even drove vehicles themselves and that,bedfast or not,they did not need an ambulance to get around.viewing the evidence properly,a reasonable jury was entitled to find that ambulance transportation of the three patients from saltville to the dialysis center in abingdon was not medically required by any definition we therefore reject louthian contention that the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions on the six health care offenses.
louthian challenge to evidence sufficiency on the perjury offense in count nine must also be rejected.in order to meet its burden on that charge,the prosecution was obliged to show that louthian knowingly made a false material declaration,under oath,in his testimony before the grand jury.see united states wilkinson,cir.at trial,the prosecution argued that louthian testimony to the grand jury that nh had been transported on the stretcher for a couple of years was inconsistent with the video of louthian watching nh walk from the ambulance to her home just a few months before his grand jury appearance.
blaming the vagueness of the prosecutor questions,louthian contends that his answers were the product of confusion,rather than deception.specifically,he argues,the prosecutor failed to adequately define the word transported in the question and you believe she was being transported in that manner after that according to louthian,if transported referred only to the time that nh was in the ambulance,then the prosecution failed to prove that his response was false.see united states hairston,cir vacating perjury conviction when,despite multiple potential meanings,defendant answer to grand jury inquiry was literally true.
but the hairston decision does not stand for the proposition that we must vacate a perjury conviction whenever a perjurer,on appeal,can stir up some potential ambiguity in a grand jury inquiries.as judge motz recently explained,hairston was predicated on the unique circumstance that the allegedly false statement had an obvious,meaning.see united states sarwari,cir.it does not apply in a situation such as this where the focus is on the ambiguity of the question asked.id.internal quotation marks omitted.
thus,although louthian theory on the perjury offense was appropriate for the jury consideration,it is,as an appellate challenge to evidence sufficiency,without substance.the jury was permitted to conclude,given the context of the prosecutor questions and the nature of the allegations against louthian,that,consistent with the government characterization,he understood the question and lied to avoid criminal liability.it would be inappropriate for us to the verdict in that regard.therefore,we will not disturb louthian perjury conviction.
next,we examine de novo louthian contention that the district court erred in denying his request for acquittal or a new trial based on inconsistent verdicts.see united states green,cir.relying on the supreme court decision in new york central hudson railroad united states for the proposition that a corporation like the squad is criminally liable for unlawful acts committed by its agent in the scope of his employment,louthian maintains that it was legally and logically inconsistent for the jury to convict him of the health care offenses while acquitting his codefendant,the squad itself.see.
put simply,louthian argument is baseless.first,as the government points out,there are a number of reasonable explanations for the verdicts.for example,the jury may not have believed that louthian was
