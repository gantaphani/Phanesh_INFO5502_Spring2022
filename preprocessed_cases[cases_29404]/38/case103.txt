in april,geri krauss was diagnosed with breast cancer.shortly thereafter,she underwent a double mastectomy and bilateral breast reconstruction surgery.the surgical procedures were performed in a single operative session by two different,unaffiliated doctors,neither of whom was a member of the plan provider network.following the operation,krauss received care from nurses.the krausses paid for both the surgery and care themselves and sought reimbursement for those expenses from oxford.oxford refused payment for of the cost of the breast reconstruction surgery and all expenses incurred for nursing.
after exhausting available administrative appeals,the krausses filed this lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york.they allege that oxford denial of full reimbursement for the bilateral surgery and nursing care violated the women health and cancer rights act,whcra,as well as various erisa provisions.they further allege that oxford violated erisa by failing to make certain required disclosures and failing to respond to various grievances in the manner and time periods set forth by their plan.

background 
in april,krauss was diagnosed with breast cancer.her doctors,who were not members of oxford provider network,recommended that she undergo a double mastectomy and bilateral breast reconstruction to be performed in a single surgical session.on may,oxford,approved in advance the portion of the surgery stating that p ayment for approved services would be consistent with the terms,conditions,and limitations of krauss certificate of coverage,the provider contract,as well as with oxford administrative and payment policies.letter from patricia robik to geri krauss dated may.on may,krauss underwent bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction surgery.following the surgery,upon the doctors suggestion and the plaintiffs request,nurses oversaw krauss recovery 
plaintiffs health care plan 
the krausses were at all relevant times participants in an employee health insurance plan called the freedom high ucr the plan.the plan was established and sponsored by krauss employer,and claims for benefits under the plan were administered by oxford.the plan terms are set forth in three summary of benefits,the certificate of coverage for payment of physicians and other providers who were part of the oxford network,and the supplemental certificate of coverage supplemental certificate for care.because the supplemental certificate concerns the use of providers including the surgeons who operated on krauss,it is the document of primary relevance for purposes of this appeal.a plan member utilizing an provider must herself pay a higher portion of her medical expenses from her own pocket than must a member receiving care from providers.

plaintiffs claims history 
mark sultan charged the krausses for krauss breast reconstruction procedure and for a consultation.the nurses charged a total of for her care.
the krausses timely filed for reimbursement for both sets of services from oxford.in response,on june,they received a check from oxford in the amount of for the reconstruction and the consultation fee.the accompanying explanation of benefits eob did not explain why the procedure was not fully reimbursed.it stated only that the maximum allowable benefit was and that t his claim reflects industry standards for payment of services which include two surgical procedures.eob dated june,at.oxford did not explain the absence of reimbursement for the nursing.
on november,the krausses filed a grievance with oxford for the of sultan fee and for the cost for nursing that had not been reimbursed.by letter dated december,oxford denied the krausses grievance as to the bilateral reconstruction surgery fee,as the cpt code was paid at the usual and customary rate,because we have participating providers performing the procedure effectively,and there is no medical reason as to why to grant sic an exception outside the ucr letter from celeste vangilder to geri krauss dated,at.
by letter dated december,oxford notified the krausses that it had referred the claim for the nursing care to its claims department.oxford contends that it thereafter denied the krausses claim for nursing charges on the ground that nursing is not covered by the plan,but the krausses submit that they never received a report of oxford benefits determination in this regard.
on december,the krausses,in two letters,requested additional information in aid of filing their appeal regarding the unpaid portion of sultan operating fee.oxford responded with three additional cursory denial letters dated december,january,and january.these letters stated,respectively,that providers could have performed the surgery and that there is no medical reason to grant an exception outside the ucr,letter from celeste vangilder to geri krauss dated,at that n o additional payment will be forthcoming because oxford had determined the claim was paid correctly at the ucr,letter from lorraine paquette to geri krauss dated,at and that,once again,no additional payment will be forthcoming,this time because oxford medical management department confirmed that participating providers were available to treat your condition,letter from clarissa rodriguez to geri krauss dated,at.oxford did not respond to the krausses request for the details of the cpt code used,how the ucr was calculated,or on which plan terms oxford relied in denying their claim.
on january,the krausses filed a appeal with oxford grievance review board,asserting,among other things,that oxford had not complied with erisa disclosure requirements.some three weeks later,by letter dated february,oxford acknowledged its receipt of the krausses december letters and enclosed various oxford documents that previously had not been disclosed to them,including its bilateral surgery policy.this policy requires providers to identify bilateral procedures with the modifier attached to the standard billing code for the procedure at issue and indicates that procedures so identified would be reimbursed at one and a half times the rate of the single procedure.oxford bilateral surgery policy,effective july,at.the documents also disclosed that oxford had sent sultan,but not the krausses,an eob related to his operating fee for the bilateral breast reconstruction surgery that explained that the full ucr allowance is provided for the primary procedure and of the ucr amount is allowed for the subsequent procedure.explanation of benefits,june,at.
one week later,on february,the krausses responded by letter contending that the bilateral surgery policy was not set forth in their plan terms,had not been disclosed in oxford previous denial letters,violated state and federal laws requiring full compensation for breast reconstruction,and had not been applied in other bilateral surgeries krauss had undergone.
by letter dated march,oxford denied the krausses appeal.oxford asserted,for the first time,that the appropriate ucr under the plan is the level that of all doctors not of all doctors in the location would accept as full payment for the service,letter from karen cofield to geri krauss dated,at,and that the ucr for cpt code was,id.at.the reimbursement the krausses received for the reconstruction surgery represented of the ucr for a single reconstruction.the denial letter further stated that oxford bilateral surgery policy was consistent with industry standards and in accordance with new york state insurance regulations,and was not conceal ed,but rather,had been publicize d in its payment policies and on its explanations of benefits.id.at.oxford further stated that its disclosures far exceed ed what erisa requires,id.at,and that references in earlier letters to the availability of providers referred to its understanding that the krausses were requesting an exception,an exception to regular ucr rates that applies only if,unlike the procedure undergone by krauss,no provider is available to perform it,id.at.
the erisa action 
the krausses responded to the denial of their administrative appeals by instituting this action.their complaint asserts claims for recovery of unpaid benefits under erisa a b,a b,on the grounds that oxford denial of benefits violated the whcra and the terms of the plan breach of fiduciary duty in violation of erisa a,a,on the grounds that oxford failed to provide benefits owed to the krausses and improperly handled their claims for reimbursement and their appeals statutory damages under erisa a b,c,a b,c,in light of oxford alleged failure to make timely disclosures and to provide accurate reasons for the denials of their claims a declaratory judgment barring the application of oxford bilateral surgery policy to breast reconstruction surgeries and costs and attorney fees.
the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted oxford motion in all respects and denied the plaintiffs.it concluded that the bilateral surgery policy did not violate either the whcra or the terms of the plan,krauss,d at,and that the krausses could not recover the costs of the nurses because nursing is expressly excluded from plan coverage,id.at.as for the krausses breach of fiduciary duty claim,the court determined that insofar as it was a demand for unpaid benefits,it was nothing more than a of their claims for statutory damages.id.at.the district court further concluded that erisa statutory disclosure requirements did not apply because oxford was a claims administrator with respect to the krausses claims,not a plan administrator.id.at.it also denied the request for an award of legal fees.
this appeal followed.

ii.claims for unpaid benefits 
erisa section a b,a b,permits a participant or beneficiary of an benefits plan to bring a civil action to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan,id.the krausses seek recovery of the unpaid portion of sultan breast reconstruction surgery fee and the costs of nursing care,benefits they say were owed to them either under the whcra or the terms of the plan.
as a threshold matter,the krausses argue that the district court erred in reviewing oxford benefits determination and their arguments with respect thereto under the arbitrary and capricious standard.because oxford ucr benefit determination was not discretionary,they say,the court review should have been de novo.on the merits,the krausses contend that oxford application of its bilateral surgery policy to krauss breast reconstruction surgery and its refusal to reimburse them for the costs of nursing care violate the terms of the whcra that even if the bilateral surgery policy complies with the whcra,its application to the krausses violates the terms of the plan it is not a ucr determination was not properly disclosed and was based upon an underlying ucr figure derived from a sample size too small to be meaningful and that the refusal to reimburse the costs incurred for nursing was contrary to the plan terms because the service was medically necessary and within the plan description of what it covers under the whcra.
standard of review of oxford actions 
a denial of benefits challenged under erisa a b is to be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan gives the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.firestone tire rubber bruch,d.if the insurer establishes that it has such discretion,the benefits decision is reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard.fay oxford health plan,cir.ambiguities are construed in favor of the plan beneficiary.id.
a reservation of discretion need not actually use the words discretion or deference to be effective,but it must be clear.examples of such clear language include authorization to resolve all disputes and ambiguities,or make benefits determinations in our judgment.in general,language that establishes an objective standard does not reserve discretion,while language that establishes a subjective standard does.
nichols prudential ins.of america,cir quoting kinstler first reliance standard life ins,cir.
we agree with the district court that the plan conferred discretionary authority on oxford to make benefits determinations.two clauses within the plan supplemental certificate governing care provided by providers are relevant.the first appears under the heading general provisions and states that oxford may adopt reasonable policies,procedures,rules,and interpretations to promote the orderly and efficient administration of this certificate suppl.certificate,sec.xi general provisions.the second is within the definition of ucr charges itself.it states that the ucr charge is either t he amount charged or the amount we sic determine to be the reasonable charge,whichever is less id.sec.xii definitions.
despite a lack of clarity in our precedents as to what language conveys sufficient discretion to an administrator to require courts arbitrary and capricious rather than de novo review of its actions,we conclude that the quoted language of the oxford plan does so the ability to adopt reasonable policies,procedures,rules and interpretations to promote the administration of a certificate of coverage has been cited as an example of the requisite discretionary authority by the fourth circuit,see feder paul revere life ins,cir citing bernstein capitalcare,cir.it also seems to us akin to authority to resolve all disputes and ambiguities relating to the interpretation of a benefits plan,language that we have previously characterized as sufficient to trigger arbitrary and capricious,rather than de novo,review.ganton,indus.group pension plan,cir.
moreover,oxford ucr definition,which provides that the ucr charge is the lesser of the amount charged or the amount oxford determine s to be the reasonable charge,confers upon oxford discretionary authority regarding one of the plan terms here at issue ucr charges.to be sure,our opinions regarding the bestowal of discretion by use of the verb determine provide little guidance.compare fay,at concluding that the benefit plan there considered invoke d discretion by defining medically necessary as those services which,as determined by the medical director,meet four listed requirements emphasis in original second alteration in original quoting benefits plan,with nichols,at finding,without citation to fay,that plan language to the effect that a disability exists when the insurer determines that each of several specified conditions was met did not confer discretionary authority because the language required that the insurer decisionmaking power be constrained by objective standards.but we think that where,as here,the terms of a benefits plan grant the defendant the right to determine what constitutes a reasonable charge,and the only source that might bear on what is reasonable is data compiled by hiaa and other recognized but unspecified sources,suppl.certificate,sec.i,subsec.your financial obligations,the plan confers discretion to determine which sources to rely upon in determining the ucr charge in any given circumstance.
oxford exercised that discretion in applying the bilateral surgery policy to the krausses claim for benefits related to sultan fee.accordingly,we will decide whether doing so was arbitrary or capricious,that is,if it was without reason,unsupported by substantial evidence or erroneous as a matter of law.fay,at internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also miller united welfare fund,cir substantial evidence is such evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the conclusion reached by the decisionmaker and requires more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
separately,the krausses challenge under the whcra,see section,below,raises questions of law which we review de novo.see miller,at benefits determination is arbitrary and capricious if it is legally erroneous.
with respect to the krausses claim for reimbursement for nursing care,however,we assume,viewing the facts in the light most favorable to them as we must,that oxford failed to inform them regarding the benefits determination made with respect to the nurses.we previously concluded,based on regulations,that failure to respond to a plan participant claim within the established by the department of labor regulations rendered the claim deemed denied and the participant subsequent erisa challenge to the benefits determination subject to de novo review.see nichols,at,relying on h.although amended regulations have replaced the deemed denied provision with one that,upon a defendant failure to follow regulatory time frames,deems a plaintiff administrative remedies exhausted,see l,and neither we nor any other circuit has,to our knowledge,addressed whether de novo review similarly applies under the revised regulations,we join our sister circuits in delaying resolution of the question for another day.see bard boston shipping ass n,cir gatti reliance std.life ins,cir finley.employee benefits org.income protection plan,cir.for the reasons stated below,even assuming a de novo standard of review applies,we would deny the krausses claim for compensation for the nursing care under erisa section a b.
b.the whcra 
sultan fees.the krausses contend that under the whcra,the plan was obligated to provide full reimbursement to them for sultan fee for krauss bilateral reconstructive surgery.they also argue that the whcra requires reimbursement of the costs associated with the nursing care provided to her because it was pursuant to a medical decision made by her physician regarding the manner in which her breast reconstruction surgery would be carried out.
the whcra provides,in relevant part,that a group health plan that provides insurance coverage for mastectomies must also provide coverage for a subsequent breast reconstruction surgery 
a in general.a group health plan shall provide,in a case of a participant or beneficiary who is receiving benefits in connection with a mastectomy and who elects breast reconstruction in connection with such mastectomy,coverage for 
all stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed in a manner determined in consultation with the attending physician and the patient.such coverage may be subject to annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions as may be deemed appropriate and as are consistent with those established for other benefits under the plan or coverage 
d rule of construction.nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage from negotiating the level and type of reimbursement with a provider for care provided in accordance with this section.
emphasis added.
as to their claim for reimbursement of sultan fee,the gist of the krausses arguments is that the statutory language providing that insurers may limit their coverage by requiring annual deductibles and coinsurance precludes insurers from applying any other mechanisms that would render plan participants responsible for a portion of the procedure costs.because the statutory language of similar legislation provides explicitly for the use of other mechanisms in addition to deductibles and coinsurance,they insist,the statutory maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterious to express one thing is to exclude another applies congress,by omitting the term from the whcra,must have intended to preclude insurers from imposing mechanisms,such as the reimbursement at issue here,to breast reconstruction surgeries.
we agree with oxford,however,that the whcra requires only that insurers cover such surgeries in a manner consistent with the policies established for other benefits under the plan.a.t he canon that expressing one item of a commonly associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned is only a guide,whose fallibility can be shown by contrary indications that adopting a particular rule or statute was probably not meant to signal any exclusion of its common relatives.united states vonn,d.the canon depends on identifying a series of two or more terms or things that should be understood to go hand in hand chevron echazabal,d.
here,the krausses cite the newborns and mothers health protection act and the mental health parity act,stat,codified at,in support of their contention that congress intended under the whcra to preclude insurers from imposing mechanisms apart from deductibles and coinsurance.these two provisions contain rule of construction subsections that specifically refer to,whereas the whcra refers only to annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions,without reference to other devices.
the newborns and mothers health protection act provides that deductibles,coinsurance,or other mechanisms are permissible so long as the mechanism imposed is not greater than such coinsurance or required for the portion of a newborn or mother hospital stay following birth that would have been covered regardless of the act provisions.c nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan or issuer from imposing deductibles,coinsurance,or other in relation to benefits except that such coinsurance or other may not be greater than such coinsurance or for any preceding portion of the hospital stay.the mental health parity act,in turn,references cost sharing,limits on numbers of visits or days of coverage,and requirements relating to medical necessity as examples of the terms and conditions relating to the amount,duration,or scope of mental health benefits,which the act,congress said,should not be construed as affecting.id.b nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the terms and conditions including,limits on numbers of visits or days of coverage,and requirements relating to medical necessity relating to the amount,duration,or scope of mental health benefits under the plan or coverage.similarly,the whcra refers to annual deductibles and coinsurance provisions that may be imposed so long as they are consistent with those established for other benefits under the plan or coverage.id.a.the whcra further provides that the act should not be interpreted to preclude health plans from negotiating with providers regarding the level and type of reimbursement for care provided in accordance with the whcra.id.d.
these provisions are plainly not an associated group or series that would be understood to go hand in hand,such that it is fair to suppose that congress considered the unnamed possibility of other mechanisms and meant to say no to it.barnhart peabody coal,d internal quotation marks and citations omitted see also id.stating that the series must warrant the inference that items not mentioned were excluded by deliberate choice,not inadvertence.each of the subsections the krausses cite does no more than use similar language to express essentially the same idea that the three statutory create a substantive floor for three different types of not be construed to create specific rules regarding the means by which the statutorily mandated categories of services are provided or to permit insurers to impose upon plan beneficiaries additional responsibilities beyond what their plan already requires for similar benefits.
the legislative history of the whcra supports our understanding that congress reference to annual deductibles and coinsurance was intended to be illustrative,rather than exclusionary.the relevant pages of the congressional record do not mention the words,deductible,or coinsurance.see cong.rec.congress enacted the legislation to ensure that women who underwent mastectomies would not be denied coverage for reconstructive surgery on the ground that it was cosmetic.id.at.
the krausses point to the stated congressional goal of making women complete and whole following their mastectomies,see id.at,and argue that this statutory purpose supports interpreting the statutory provision for deductibles and coinsurance to preclude other devices.we do not think that this legislative goal forecloses consistent with other terms of a plan.congress was plainly focused on the question of coverage vel non it was not concerned with the precise details of the coverage to be provided.as the district court noted,congress surely did not contemplate that restor ing a woman wholeness,required insurers to cover percent of the amount billed by the that might only any applicable deductions and coinsurance provisions,regardless of the other terms and conditions of a plan.krauss,d at.the district court succinctly captured the fundamental illogic of the krausses argument nothing in the legislative history affirmatively indicates that the insurer must offer better coverage for breast reconstruction than it offers for the mastectomies that necessitate them i t defies logic to assume that congress would have imposed such a requirement sub silentio,or by negative inference.id.at.
in sum,the whcra includes an express statement of permission as to deductibles and coinsurance and is silent as to other possibilities each of the three similar statutory provisions includes analogous language to ensure that insurers apply the same devices to control costs of mandated benefits that they employ for benefits unrelated to the statutory provisions,but only sometimes uses the inclusive term and the legislative history of the whcra is silent regarding the entire concept of cost control mechanisms.under these circumstances,we can not conclude that congress,in failing to provide explicit permission for insurers to use other devices besides deductibles and coinsurance when providing coverage for breast reconstruction surgery,intended to limit permissible mechanisms to the two specifically mentioned.oxford application of ucr limits and,specifically,the bilateral surgery policy,to krauss surgery therefore did not violate the whcra.
nursing.parallel reasoning applies to the krausses claim under the whcra for reimbursement for nursing care.we see nothing in the statute to support a reading that requires an insurer to pay for nurses where such services are not otherwise covered and where care in a different form could have satisfied the patient medical needs as identified by her doctor.that the whcra requires coverage for all stages of reconstruction of the breast on which the mastectomy has been performed in a manner determined in consultation with the attending physician and the patient,a,does not,we think,categorically override every plan specific exclusion of nursing care in these circumstances.see suppl.certificate,sec.iv exclusions and limitations.we can not reconcile such an interpretation with the whcra focus upon ensuring that breast reconstruction surgeries are covered with other surgeries under a beneficiary plan.
c.the plan terms 
the krausses next argue that application of the bilateral surgery policy to their claim for reimbursement for the reconstruction surgery and the denial of any reimbursement for the nursing care violated the terms of the plan.they contend that the bilateral surgery policy is not a ucr determination,was not properly disclosed,and was derived from an underlying ucr figure that was unreliable.they further assert that the nursing care was a service related to the reconstruction surgery that came within oxford of the procedure.we conclude,however,that oxford decision to apply the bilateral surgery policy is supported by substantial evidence,and that even under de novo review,the explicit exclusion of nursing care by the plan governs the krausses claims.
bilateral surgery policy.we find the krausses assertion that the bilateral surgery policy violates the plan terms to be meritless,largely because it fails to give effect to the breadth of oxford ucr definition and description contained in the supplemental certificate.in section i,paragraph,the supplemental certificate states that ucr fee schedules are calculated by using data compiled by the hiaa and other recognized sources,suppl.certificate,sec.i,subsec.emphasis added.its definition of ucr accords oxford the discretion to employ an amount it deems reasonable for a particular covered service in the geographical area it is performed,sec.xii definitions.nothing in the plan terms forbids oxford from adopting a ucr based not only on hiaa data,but on some other recognized source 
the bilateral surgery policy,while arguably less than generous,comports with,and is based upon,medicare policy.see medicare part b reference manual e,at,available at careservices.com partb refman pdf chapter.pdf last visited,payment for claims reporting bilateral procedures will be based on of the fee schedule amount.certification of david finley,oxford bilateral surgery policy is based upon healthcare industry standards,customs,and practices,including the policies established by medicare.the reimbursement rate of of ucr was based,therefore,on both hiaa data and a recognized source medicare.that the bilateral surgery policy describes hiaa data as the ucr,does not,we think,preclude oxford from treating the bilateral surgery policy as having determined the krausses ucr in this instance.of course,oxford and its members would likely benefit from greater precision and less language in oxford references to what constitutes the ucr,see,letter from karen cofield,grievance associate,oxford health plans,to geri krauss dated,at referring to amount paid under bilateral surgery policy as the ucr
