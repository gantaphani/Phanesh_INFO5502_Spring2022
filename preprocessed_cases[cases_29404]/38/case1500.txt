background 
callebaut,a swiss company,purchased van leer,a chocolate manufacturing plant in jersey city,new jersey,in.in june,callebaut began downsizing the van leer plant,and in april closed the plant altogether.former employees of barry callebaut herman,sec y of labor,d.int l trade.
in july and august,respectively,a group of former van leer employees the former employees petitioned labor under a and b for certification for taa and benefits under and a,respectively,alleging that their job losses resulted from a shift of production to canada id.labor questioned callebaut,which indicated that it had shifted production to other domestic locations and that it did not plan to increase its imports from canada.id.labor then issued negative determinations regarding the former employees eligibility for taa benefits and benefits in december and february,respectively.notice of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance and nafta transitional adjustment assistance.dep t of labor,notice of determinations regarding eligibility to apply for worker adjustment assistance and nafta transitional adjustment assistance.dep t of labor.
in january,a member of the former employees submitted a request for administrative reconsideration,alleging that thirty percent or more of the production from the van leer plant had been shifted or was in the process of being shifted to canada,and that equipment was being dismantled and sent to canada.fmr.empls.i,d at.labor again questioned callebaut,which indicated that it expected to transfer some production to canada,but had yet to do so.id.accordingly,labor affirmed its previous negative determination.barry callebaut usa,incorporated,van leer division,jersey city,new jersey notice of negative determination on reconsideration.dep t of labor.
the former employees then filed a complaint in the court of international trade for review of labor negative determination.fmr.empls.i,d at.labor then requested and was granted a voluntary remand.id.labor questioned callebaut a third time,and received from the marketing director and former vice president of finance of barry callebaut canada,isabelle eysseric,a summary chart showing the allocation of the van leer facility production to other callebaut facilities during the april to january period.id.at.the chart indicated that only a very small percentage of production was transferred to canada,to hyacinthe,qu√©bec and that all other production was transferred to other domestic facilities,namely,pennsauken,new jersey piscataway,new jersey and albans,vermont.id.at.labor then issued a notice of negative determination upon remand.barry callebaut usa,incorporated,van leer division,jersey city,new jersey,and notice of negative determination on remand.dep t of labor.
alleging that labor investigations were all inadequate,that even a very small percentage shift in production to canada would be sufficient to satisfy the taa requirements,and that labor negative determinations were not based on substantial evidence,the former employees returned to the court of international trade for review of labor remand decision.fmr.empls.i,d at.the court held that labor negative determinations were not supported by substantial evidence because the agency had relied on unverified responses from callebaut management and had not taken any measures to ensure the truthfulness of those responses.id.at.the court also pointed out that callebaut annual report stated that the company management had implemented changes to increase efficiency,including transferring higher cost van leer production to more sites in pennsauken usa and hyacinthe canada.as a result,the van leer factory has been closed.id.at.the court concluded that callebaut chart showing that only a very small percentage of production had moved to canada was inconsistent with the annual report,because the chart indicated that a greater percentage of production had been moved to albans,for example,than to canada.id.according to the court,if that greater percentage of production had really shifted to albans rather than to hyacinthe,the annual report would more logically have stated that production had been transferred to pennsauken and albans,rather than to pennsauken and hyacinthe.id.the court then remanded to labor to verify callebaut responses.id.at.the court also warned that it would not remand again if labor again failed to substantiate its decision.id.at.
on remand,labor obtained affidavits from eysseric john lynch,callebaut controller and jacquie dragon,callebaut human resource director.according to eysseric affidavit,the annual report had been prepared before the van leer plant was shut down and thus did not reflect what actually came to pass.fmr.empls.ii,d at.moreover,according to lynch affidavit,although a significant amount of the van leer equipment was transferred to canada,that equipment could be used for numerous purposes and therefore might not be used for the same purpose for which it had been used in the van leer plant.id.at.on the basis of that information,labor again concluded that only a very small percentage of the van leer production had been shifted to canada,and its negative determination.id.at fourth negative determination.
the former employees again sued in the court of international trade.fmr.empls.ii,d at.the court ruled that labor had again failed to follow its remand instructions and that its decision was still not supported by substantial evidence.id.at.as promised,rather than remand again,the court simply ordered labor to certify the former employees for the requested benefits.id.at.
the secretary now appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a and c.
discussion 
section a of title authorizes workers aggrieved by a final decision of the secretary under of that title,regarding eligibility for taa benefits,to commence a civil action in the court of international trade for review of that decision.under b,t he findings of fact by the secretary of labor,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive.the supreme court has defined substantial evidence as such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.universal camera nlrb.quoting consol.edison nlrb.although substantial evidence must be more than a mere scintilla,it is something less than the weight of the evidence,and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency finding from being supported by substantial evidence.consolo fed.comm n,d.in reviewing decisions of the court of international trade on questions of substantial evidence,this court step s into the shoes of the court of international trade and duplicate s its review.taiwan semiconductor indus.ass micron.
on appeal,the secretary argues that the court of international trade erred in finding that labor determinations were not supported by substantial evidence.according to the secretary,all of the administrative record the chart showing the of the van leer facility production to other facilities,supporting statements,and documentary labor conclusion that the shift to canada was only a very small percentage.the secretary also argues that there is no conflict in the evidence callebaut annual report did not purport to be an exhaustive recitation of the business operations of each callebaut entity or facility,but was merely an incomplete forecast of future management actions,without amounts or sales volumes in contrast,the corporate officers statements,upon which the agency relied,described the actual facts as they occurred.significantly,the secretary argues,labor has not received any information that would suggest that callebaut officers had any reason to lie or that the company had any interest in the outcome of this litigation that might have been adverse to its former employees.the secretary also argues that the evidentiary requirements in administrative proceedings are more relaxed than those in judicial proceedings,and that,contrary to the court holding,there is no requirement that any statement upon which labor relies must be verified in accordance with the requirements of.even if there were such a requirement,the secretary contends,the affidavits of eysseric,lynch,and dragon relied on by labor each include an acknowledgement of the potential for punishment if willfully false,and would therefore satisfy.the secretary also argues that,although labor has a duty to investigate,the nature and extent of the investigations are within the sound discretion of the agency.consequently,according to the secretary,the court must defer to the agency,only remanding if the agency technique was so marred that its finding was arbitrary or of such a nature that it could not have been based on substantial evidence.
the secretary also contends that the court of international trade exceeded its statutory authority by ordering labor to certify the former employees despite the fact that neither labor nor the court itself had made any findings that the former employees actually met the requirements of the taa statutes.although b permits the court to remand the case to the secretary to take further evidence,and c confers jurisdiction either to affirm the action of the secretary or to set such action aside,in whole or in part,the secretary argues that there is neither any provision that allows the court,based on its impatience over labor purported failure to conduct an adequate investigation,to then order labor to certify the employees for the requested benefits,nor any provision that authorizes certification by default.according to the secretary,courts can not exercise authority beyond their mandate and there is no constitutional or statutory authority that empowers the court of international trade to order labor to certify the former employees when no finding has been made that the statutory requirements for taa or benefits have been met.the secretary points out that c,which provides that t he court of international trade may not grant an injunction or issue a writ of mandamus in any civil action commenced to review any final determination of the secretary of labor under section of the trade act of,forbids the court of international trade issuance of a writ of mandamus in any civil action commenced to review any final determination of the secretary of labor.
the secretary argues that although the court cited former employees of hawkins oil gas,united states secretary of labor.int l trade,and former employees of general electric united states department of labor.int l trade,in which the court of international trade previously ordered labor to certify employees,the government did not appeal those decisions,and this court has therefore never opined on the legality of that action.the secretary asserts that a plain reading of the statute shows that congress has authorized the award of taa benefits only when the secretary certifies that the statutory criteria set forth in have been met,but no findings have been made in this case that would support certification.the secretary contends that this is not a case in which other available data contradict the data upon which labor relies and in which,if the trial court credits the other data,it implicitly finds that the eligibility criteria have been met.absent such evidence,the secretary argues,the court has ordered labor to act in a manner that is contrary to the purpose of the statute,since it is the aggrieved workers,not the agency,who bear the burden of proof.
the former employees respond that the information upon which labor based its first two decisions reflected callebaut plans as they existed at the time of its acquisition of van leer in,not the company plans or factual circumstances as they actually existed at the time of labor communications with callebaut between october and january.the chart on which labor relied as its most important piece of evidence remains unverified,according to the former employees,and provides no insight as to how the figures included therein were derived.the former employees allege that the chart also conflicts with callebaut annual report,which indicated that the subject plant production had moved to pennsauken usa and hyacinthe canada,suggesting a greater shift to canada than the chart indicates,because if only a very small percentage of production had been shifted from van leer to canada as the chart indicates,it would seem likely that the annual report would have listed another plant instead of or in addition to hyacinthe.the callebaut officials unsworn statements neither adequately explain nor support the chart,according to the former employees,but instead provide unverifiable general statements without evidentiary foundation.
the former employees also argue that,although callebaut officials had no apparent reason to lie,they gave contradictory and admittedly outdated information to labor during the investigation,and under the circumstances it was appropriate and within the court authority to order labor to certify the former employees as eligible for adjustment assistance.if labor were correct that the court of international trade could do nothing other than affirm or remand,the former employees assert,the court would be powerless to do anything more than order a potentially endless series of futile remands,no matter how many times labor failed to perform an adequate investigation,and that would be an absurd result.
we agree with the secretary that labor fourth negative determination was supported by substantial evidence consisting of the summary chart and affidavits supplied by eysseric,lynch,and dragon.labor based its decision on evidence that it deemed creditworthy and that was not contradicted by any other evidence.we disagree with the former employees argument that callebaut annual report is inconsistent with the statements and summary chart provided by callebaut.although that annual report states that a n example of efficiency improvements is the transfer of the higher cost van leer production to more sites in pennsauken usa and hyacinthe canada,there is no indication that the plants listed in the annual report are the only plants to which van leer production was transferred.moreover,the annual report does not state that any particular percentage of production was transferred to hyacinthe,let alone that the actual percentage was greater than a very small percentage.the most that can be surmised from the quoted portion of the annual report is that the pennsauken and hyacinthe plants were more than the van leer plant was,and that the higher cost production was accordingly transferred.that report thus does not vitiate the substantial evidence consisting of the summary chart.
moreover,there is nothing inherently implausible about the explanation provided by the callebaut officers for the differences between the annual report and the summary chart,and we accordingly see no basis for discounting the evidentiary value of the summary chart relied on by labor.finally,the eysseric,lynch,and dragon affidavits submitted to labor each include the following statement i certify that the information set forth herein is true and correct to the best of my knowledge,information and belief.i am aware that if any of the information contained herein is willfully false,i am subject to punishment.we agree with the secretary that those affidavits were sufficiently trustworthy to constitute subs
