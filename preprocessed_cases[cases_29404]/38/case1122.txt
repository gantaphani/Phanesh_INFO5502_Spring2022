steel mining company steel appeals from the final order of the department of labor benefits review board brb affirming the award of black lung benefits to roderick jones jones,a former coal miner.an administrative law judge alj granted benefits to jones on his second claim under the black lung benefits act the act or the blba,after finding that jones was totally disabled by black lung disease that developed as a result of his work in the coal mines of alabama.on appeal,steel says that the alj used the wrong legal standard in evaluating whether there was a material change in jones condition,a prerequisite to jones second claim under the act,and that the alj reached the wrong decision on the merits.after thorough review,we are persuaded by neither argument and,accordingly,affirm the judgment of the brb.
the procedural history,essential background and developed facts are straightforward.the secretary of labor black lung benefits program allows coal miners to file more than one benefits claim under certain circumstances.after the first claim by a miner is denied,the claimant may file a second or duplicate application more than one year after the denial of the first claim in order to file a duplicate claim,the miner must first establish that a material change in conditions has occurred since the earlier denial of the first claim.d.indeed,duplicate claims are feasible under the blba precisely because pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease,from which a miner condition may deteriorate over time.as a result,if a miner condition has materially changed,he may allege a new cause of action based on a very different physical condition.see,coleman director,owcp,cir per curiam because pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease,a miner condition may worsen over time.in recognition of that fact,the labor department regulations permit a miner whose first claim has been denied to pursue a later claim for benefits,provided the miner can establish a change in conditions of entitlement.citation omitted labelle processing swarrow,cir.the director of the department of labor office of workers compensation programs the director,has taken the position that a claimant may establish a material change by proving any element of entitlement in the second claim that the miner failed to show in the first one.
jones filed his original claim for black lung benefits on october.the claim was denied by the department of labor district director district director,who concluded that jones had failed to establish any of the elements of black lung eligibility.jones did not appeal the denial of his first claim.
almost two years later,jones brought this claim on august,seeking benefits for himself,his wife,and four dependent children.because jones second claim was filed more than a year after the denial of the first one,this claim was a duplicate claim governed by d,and,therefore,jones had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that a material change in conditions had occurred since the denial of his initial claim.id.after meeting this threshold requirement,jones also had to establish that he had pneumoconiosis the pneumoconiosis arose out of coal mine employment he was totally disabled and the pneumoconiosis contributed to the total disability.id.d.
the district director denied jones duplicate or second claim on september,after which jones filed a timely request for a hearing on october,a hearing was conducted in birmingham,alabama,before an alj.in a decision and order dated august,the alj determined that jones and his family were entitled to an award of benefits.steel timely appealed to the brb,and,in a decision and order dated may,a panel of the brb affirmed the alj order.
it is undisputed that roderick jones worked for years as a coal miner in alabama,before leaving the mines in,at the age of.at the hearing,jones explained that he quit working as a miner because his body would take it anymore,and that it came to the point that i could breathe and do a job like i should do it.since leaving the mines,jones has not worked,except as a pastor in his church.jones has never smoked cigarettes,pipes,or cigars.besides working as a coal miner,he has never held any employment in which he was exposed to pulmonary irritants.
jones currently suffers from substantial breathing difficulties.he easily becomes short of breath after minimal exertion,such as climbing a single flight of stairs,mowing his lawn,or playing basketball with his children for more than a little bit.he occasionally suffers from uncontrollable coughing,a condition which worsens at night and requires him to sleep propped up on four or five pillows.in the year preceding the alj hearing,jones breathing difficulties forced him to visit a hospital emergency room on multiple occasions,where he was put on a breathing machine.jones has been prescribed prednisone pills and inhalers to help with his breathing,and he also takes medication for atrial fibrillation,or an irregular heartbeat,which was diagnosed in.
because,under the act,the characterization of a coal miner as being totally disabled depends in part on whether the miner is unable to perform his usual coal mine work,b,we examine the work jones engaged in during the last period of his employment.see shortridge beatrice pocahontas coal,blr,u sual coal mine work is the most recent job the miner performed regularly and over a substantial period of time.the last job jones performed regularly and over a substantial period of time was a faceman.
as a faceman,jones was required to build cement block walls inside the mine.this work caused him to regularly lift bags of cement and bags of rock dust,and to lift cement blocks weighing pounds.sometimes jones was required to lift the blocks above his head.his job also required him to lift bundles of pins,which could weigh from to pounds,and to carry these bundles for distances of up to feet.jones also unloaded mining cars which contained approximately to bags of rock dust.jones unloaded the rock dust bags,cut them open,and spread the rock dust within the mine shafts,a dirty and dusty task.in addition,jones shoveled wet coal spillage from the belt line that took the coal out of the mine,requiring him to shovel to loads of wet coal.finally,jones sometimes filled the mine grout machine,which required him to unload to bags of cement and dump them into the machine.
since,a number of doctors have examined jones or his medical records,and come to varying conclusions concerning his medical condition and the causes of that condition.because these differences in medical opinion play a central role in the resolution of this appeal,we describe the range of medical evidence presented in some detail.
goldstein,a pulmonary specialist and examined jones the first time he applied for black lung benefits,in december.goldstein read jones lung as being negative for pneumoconiosis and found no pulmonary impairment.however,goldstein diagnosed a cardiac arrhythmia,chest pain,and a restrictive lung defect.goldstein did not opine on the cause of the restrictive lung defect,simply writing etiology in his report.goldstein found jones to be disabled because of his cardiac arrhythmia.
cohen,another pulmonary specialist,conducted a new pulmonary examination of jones in october in connection with jones second claim.cohen reviewed jones work and medical histories,respiratory symptoms,and physical examination.cohen identified pneumoconiosis,classified as,on an of jones lungs taken on october,determining that the showed signs of pneumoconiosis in jones middle and upper lung zones cohen also conducted a pulmonary function study that revealed mild reductions in jones total lung capacity and a mild diffusion impairment he also conducted blood gas testing,which indicated a reduced capacity of jones lungs to oxygenate his blood.cohen observed that some of the shortness of breath jones experienced was associated with the exacerbation of his arrhythmia,but,notably,that many of jones symptoms were altogether independent of the diagnosed arrhythmia.because of the evidence,as well as the impairment evident in jones pulmonary function test,cohen unambiguously diagnosed jones as suffering from coal miners pneumoconiosis.cohen also concluded that,because of the exertion required in jones last mining job,he was totally disabled.
cohen issued a second report on september,after reviewing the original evaluation by goldstein,as well as the various chest.cohen again concluded to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that jones suffered from coal workers pneumoconiosis,and that the condition was substantially related to jones mining employment.cohen acknowledged that some of the evidence did not indicate pneumoconiosis,but opined that this did not undermine his diagnosis that there was clinical and physiological evidence of pneumoconiosis 
marder,who is in occupational and preventive medicine,reviewed the reports authored by goldstein and cohen and submitted a report of his own on october.he concluded that jones has a restrictive lung defect.unlike goldstein,who declined to opine on the cause of jones lung defect,marder concluded that the defect was actually caused by pneumoconiosis from coal dust exposure.marder further opined that,while some of the chest had been negative for pneumoconiosis,it was well established that the disease could be present even if not apparent from a reading of the.
askew,a internist and jones treating physician since,also issued a report on october,based both on his experience treating jones and his review of the pulmonary function test administered by cohen.askew also concluded that jones restrictive lung impairment had been caused by coal dust exposure and that jones suffered from pneumoconiosis.like marder,askew noted that the presence of negative did not rule out a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis.
the last doctor to weigh in on jones medical condition was fino,a pulmonologist and.fino issued his own report on february,based on his review of the medical records associated with both of jones claims,as well as the reports issued by goldstein,cohen,marder,and askew.fino concluded that jones reduced lung capacity was consistent with a very mild to mild restrictive ventilatory defect.while fino noted that it would be unusual to have a case of simple coal workers pneumoconiosis in the absence of significant,severe evidence of the disease,he did not say that it was impossible to diagnose pneumoconiosis without evidence ultimately,fino concluded that the conditions in jones lungs were not caused by coal dust inhalation,but were likely the result of other factors,including coronary artery disease and an irregular heartbeat.while fino concluded that jones did not suffer from pneumoconiosis,he did determine that jones other ailments rendered him clearly disabled.
in short,cohen,marder,and askew concluded that jones suffered from pneumoconiosis,while goldstein and fino found that he did not.although goldstein and fino agreed with cohen,marder,and askew that jones was totally disabled,they attributed his total disability to causes other than pneumoconiosis.
the alj,at the october hearing,considered the various and the other tests that had been performed on jones,as well as all of the medical opinions presented.the alj first determined that jones had satisfied the threshold requirement of establishing a material change in condition by showing that he now suffered from pneumoconiosis,in contrast with the finding that jones had not suffered from the disease in.having concluded that jones suffered from pneumoconiosis at the time of his duplicate or second claim,the alj also determined that jones pneumoconiosis arose out of his employment in the coal mines of alabama and that it was a substantially contributing cause of his total disability.accordingly,the alj concluded that jones was entitled to,and awarded him benefits.the brb affirmed the award and this appeal ensued.
the standard we employ in reviewing the brb review of an alj decision is by now well established.in lollar alabama,we explained the standard in these terms 
decisions of the alj are reviewable only as to whether they are in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence in light of the entire record.this deferential standard of review binds both the brb and this court.see jordan benefits review,cir stomps director,owcp,cir alabama killingsworth,cir.because this court applies the same standard of review to alj decisions as does the brb,our review of brb decisions is de novo.substantial evidence has been defined as more than a scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d citation and internal quotation marks omitted.
cir footnote omitted.as we observed in lollar,when the brb upholds the alj decision,this court limited review of the alj effectively cloaks the brb decision with the same deference to which the alj is entitled.id.at.thus,although the case comes to us from the brb,we begin our analysis by reviewing the decision of the alj.bradberry director,cir.
the central legal issue presented is whether the alj erred by using the one element standard to evaluate whether jones had established a material change in conditions,a necessary finding to bringing a second duplicate claim.see d.the alj concluded that t o establish a material change in conditions,claimant must prove,by a preponderance of the evidence developed since the denial of the prior claim,at least one of the elements previously adjudicated against him.jones steel mining,decision and benefits at,case dep t of labor office of admin.law judges,alj order.we have not had occasion to rule on the proper legal standard,an issue that has caused a split among our sister circuits.
the director has advocated the one element standard for evaluating whether or not a miner has proved a material change in conditions under this standard,when making a duplicate claim,a claimant can establish a material change in conditions by proving one entitlement requirement that was previously resolved against the miner.after establishing a material change,to be eligible for benefits a miner must then prove that he has pneumoconiosis his pneumoconiosis arose out of his coal mining employment he is totally disabled and the pneumoconiosis contributed to his disability.d i iv see also black diamond coal mining director,owcp,cir.if all of the requirements were resolved against a miner in his first was the case with claimant can establish a material change under the one element test by establishing any one of the four eligibility elements in the second claim.if a miner successfully proves a material change in this way,the entire record is then examined to determine whether,at the time of the second claim,the miner has proven all of the eligibility requirements and,thus,may be granted an award of benefits.
steel urges us to reject the director one element standard and instead to adopt a standard enunciated by the seventh circuit in sahara coal office of workers comp.programs,cir,which steel contends require s a genuine showing of changed conditions.petitioner brief at.under this test,steel argues,to prove a material change,jones must establish either that the disease of pneumoconiosis has manifested itself since the earlier denial or that the disease progress has resulted in total disability although it was not totally disabling at the time of the original application.see also sahara coal,at outlining material change test in which a miner would have to establish that he did not have black lung disease at the time of the first application but has since contracted it and become totally disabled by it,or that his disease has progressed to the point of becoming totally disabling although it was not at the time of the first application.
the essential difference between the director one element test and the standard urged by steel involves the treatment of the evidence presented in the first claim and the decisions reached therein.under the director standard,new evidence proffered in the second claim is compared with the conclusions reached in the final adjudication of the first claim.thus,the first claim is presumed to have been correctly decided,given the miner condition at that time.steel test,in contrast,would require a comparison of the new evidence with the evidence submitted in the first claim,in order to evaluate whether or not the claimant condition had changed over time.rather than accepting the final adjudication of the first claim as correct,steel standard would subject that decision to searching scrutiny,since it requires looking anew at the evidence from that claim.
in evaluating whether to adopt the director standard or the one urged by steel,i t is that courts must defer to an agency consistent interpretation of its own regulation unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.bradberry,at quoting lollar,at adopting director construction of test for disability causation.here,this deference is specifically owed to the director of the office of workers compensation programs,not to the alj or the brb.lollar,at.
the obligation to defer to an agency reasonable interpretation of its own regulations is rooted not only in our case law,but also in binding supreme court precedent.see,chevron,natural res.def.council,d see also pauley bethenergy mines,d granting deference to the department of labor construction of its own black lung regulation,and noting that congress intended to delegate broad policymaking authority to the department of labor when it passed the act mullins coal of director,office of workers comp.programs,d.the supreme court has left no doubt that when an agency has regularly advocated a uniform interpretation of its regulation,the interpretation is deserving of substantial deference unless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.mullins coal,at.at quoting bowles seminole rock sand.
deference to an agency consistent interpretation of its own regulations is due when the agency has consistently maintained a longstanding policy on the subject,mckee sullivan,cir,but not when an agency adopts a mere litigating position.william,pate,cir see also bradberry,at.that is,we do not afford deference to ad hoc positions of agencies adopted in reaction to the exigencies of litigation rather,deference is due when an agency has taken a constant and on the proper interpretation of its regulation.see bradberry,at william,at.
applying these principles to the issue at hand,the department of labor has adopted the one element test as a national rule,and has consistently promulgated a uniform definition of material change in conditions based on the one element standard.as part of an extended process,the department proposed rules designed to make the black lung program fairer and more efficient.the department first published the proposed rules in,modified them in,and finalized them in.these new rules formally codified the one element test as the director national policy.see.
the director has not simply promoted the use of the standard in this case to the contrary,the director has consistently advocated the use of the one element test before the courts of appeals.see,swarrow,at lisa lee mines director,owcp,cir en banc sharondale ross,cir peabody coal spese,cir en banc lovilia coal harvey,cir wyoming fuel director,cir.
the director has formulated the one element standard in these terms 
for purposes of a duplicate miner claim,i the claimant must establish at least one element of entitlement previously rejected in the earlier claim and ii the claimant must prove the elements of entitlement by a preponderance of the new evidence developed in conjunction with the duplicate claim that addresses his present physical condition.if the claimant satisfies the initial burden of proving a material change,then the adjudicator must consider all the evidence from all the claims to determine whether the claimant has proven the remaining elements of entitlement.
federal respondent brief at.because the director one element standard is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation it interprets,and because the director has consistently advocated its use before the federal courts of appeals,we can discern no reason to downgrade the normal deference accorded to the agency interpretation of its own regulation.mullins coal,at.at.
in showing deference to the director uniform interpretation of the agency regulation,we align ourselves with a clear majority of our sister circuits that has adopted the one element test.while one rejected the one element test,see wyoming fuel,at five third,fourth,sixth,seventh and adopted at least some version of the one element test.see swarrow,at lisa lee mines,at sharondale,at peabody coal,at lovilia coal,at.
the third,fourth,and eighth circuits have unambiguously embraced the director one element test.in swarrow,for example,a panel of the third circuit noted that deference to the director interpretation of its own regulations was warranted so long as the director interpretation was a reasonable one.at citing chevron,at.at.the court observed that it would supply its own construction of a regulation only if the agency interpretation were plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation,and concluded that the director construction of the regulation was neither.id.citation omitted.in embracing the one element standard,the third circuit also noted that a doption of the director interpretation accords with the principle that courts should liberally construe remedial legislation,such as the blba,so as to include the largest number of claimants within its entitlement provisions.id.the third circuit concluded that b ecause the director construction of its own regulation is not unreasonable,deference should be given to that interpretation,and adopted the one element test.id.
the fourth circuit,similarly,adopted the one element standard in lisa lee mines,at.the fourth circuit observed that a duplicate claim is not barred,as a matter of ordinary res judicata,by an earlier denial,because the claims are not the same.the health of a human being is not susceptible to adjudication.id.at.thus,given the progressive and degenerative nature of pneumoconiosis,a claim based on a miner health today may be different from a claim based on his health more than a year ago.the court,therefore,recognized the problems inherent in requiring a miner to compare the evidence adduced from the old claim with the evidence presented in the new claim as a condition precedent to filing the second claim.it concluded,instead,that a material change should be assessed by comparing the new evidence with the conclusions reached in the first decision.
accepting the correctness of a final judgment is more than legalistic tunnel vision it is a the only to discern a concrete form in the mists of the past.the ease we might feel at this final judgment ought not tempt us to overestimate our retrospective perspicacity most black lung claims involve a mixed bag of test results and wildly divergent medical opinions.the final decision of the alj or brb or claims examiner on the spot is the best evidence of truth at the time.
id.at.the concern for respecting the finality of the prior denial led the fourth circuit to defer to the director reasonable interpretation of the duplicate claims regulation,id.at,and adopt the one element test.
in also embracing the director standard,the eighth circuit traced the reasoning of the third and fourth circuits before concluding that the director interpretation of d is reasonable,lovilia coal,at,and therefore deserving of deference.the eighth circuit accepted the director argument that the standard promotes administrative and judicial efficiency,while at the same time respects issue preclusion principles,id.at,and concluded that there was an adequate fit between the one element standard and the finality and efficiency policies it is designed to serve.id.at.as a result,the eighth circuit joined the third and fourth in expressly adopting the director standard 
because the director interpretation of the agency own regulation is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulation,we are obliged to approach it with deference and to join our sister circuits that have embraced the one element test.moreover,the deference we accord the director interpretation is particularly appropriate because the rule makes sense.since the one element standard only requires a miner to prove one element that was previously adjudicated against him,it does not require a miner to relitigate the denial of his first claim.in other words,the one element test does not compel a comparison of the evidence associated with the second claim with the evidence presented at the first claim rather,it mandates a comparison of the second claim evidence with the conclusions reached in the prior claim.use of the one element test thus respects the finality of the decision rendered on the first claim,shielding that decision from the second guessing that hindsight inevitably invites.
rather than simply accepting the conclusions reached on the first claim and assuming their correctness,the test urged by steel would subject those conclusions to intense scrutiny and much second guessing.and the test would cause a miner to argue that the first denial was correct,even though he obviously maintained at the time of the first claim that he should not be denied benefits.thus,for example,in jones case,while he argued in his initial claim that he was totally disabled by pneumoconiosis,he would apparently have to argue in the second claim that he was really not so afflicted at the time of the first claim,but had only subsequently become so.by adopting the director one element standard,we avoid forcing a miner to take a position in his second claim that plainly contradicts the one he took in the first claim.
the director also has elaborated on the obvious difficulties inherent in requiring a coal miner,in a second claim,to compare evidence from the first and second claims 
indeed,comparing evidence from the prior and current claims invites the parties to engage in an absurd brand of relitigation involving the old claim.jones claims illustrate this problem.jones failed to prove he had pneumoconiosis in his first claim.in order to prove that his condition has changed with respect to this element of entitlement,jones also would have to prove that he did not have pneumoconiosis when he previously applied for benefits.in effect,jones would have to argue against his own entitlement in the prior claim to prove that his condition has changed since that claim.similarly,steel would have to argue that jones did have pneumoconiosis when he originally applied for benefits to prove that the claimant condition has not changed in the interim.encouraging the parties to assert arguments that contradict the positions they took in the prior litigation distorts the legitimate operation of the estoppel doctrine.
federal respondent brief at.
in urging us to reject the director one element test,steel nevertheless advocates adoption of a standard outlined by the seventh circuit in sahara coal.we are not persuaded for the reasons we have already explained.moreover,even the seventh circuit appears to have least in some director one element standard.it is true that the seventh circuit initially required a miner making a duplicate claim to show that he did not have black lung disease at the time of the first application but has since contracted it and become totally disabled by it,or that his disease has progressed to the point of becoming totally disabling although it was not at the time of the first application.sahara coal,at.since sahara coal,however,the seventh circuit appears to have moved from its earlier position that establishing material change requires a searching comparison of the old and new evidence and has approached some acceptance of the one element test 
because the director one element standard is both reasonable and consistent with,and because using this test will eliminate unnecessary and costly collateral litigation,we adopt the agency one element standard.this standard establishes a simple and uniform approach to material change determinations,protects the integrity of the first denial from the distant,searching eyes of hindsight,and respects the principles of res judicata.the director standard gives full credit to the finality of the original denial,but plainly recognizes that pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease,and that a miner condition can change over time.see c stating that pneumoconiosis is recognized as a latent and progressive disease which may first become detectable only after the cessation of coal mine dust exposure see also coleman,at because pneumoconiosis is a latent and progressive disease,a miner condition may worsen over time.lovilia coal,at same lisa lee mines,at same swarrow,at p neumoconiosis is a latent dust disease congress,in enacting the blba,recognized the perniciously progressive nature of the disease.citations omitted.
after thorough review of the record,we also conclude that the alj properly applied the one element test to the jones case.the alj correctly determined that all four elements were resolved against jones in the denial of his claim,and then concluded that jones established a material change in conditions proving,by a preponderance of the medical evidence,that he suffered from pneumoconiosis at the time of the second,duplicate claim.see alj order at.in short,the alj correctly determined that jones had satisfied the threshold requirement for a duplicate claim embodied in by showing a material change in condition,and,then,properly examined whether jones satisfied the other requirements.
steel also argues that the alj substantive merits jones was in fact eligible for wrong.it says that the alj erred in this case by failing to weigh all of the relevant medical evidence,and that the alj determinations were neither supported by the evidence nor consistent with the law.we remain unpersuaded.
first,steel claims that the alj erred by failing to properly weigh all of the medical evidence together in determining whether a preponderance of the evidence supported a finding of pneumoconiosis.steel urges this court to adopt the reasoning of the fourth circuit in island creek coal compton,cir.in compton,the court concluded that an adjudicator was obliged to weigh,in concert,all of the medical evidence pertaining to the disease,rather than evaluating separately each category of evidence.see id.at.thus,the fourth circuit concluded that the alj in compton erred by failing to weigh and medical opinion evidence,looking at each form of evidence remanded to the alj to do so.id.at.
while compton is not binding authority,even if it were,steel argument would still fail.in the portion of his decision labeled pneumoconiosis,the alj stated that c hest and physician opinion evidence are the means available to claimant to prove the existence of pneumoconiosis.a.alj order at.the alj then went on to review all of the evidence,as well as all of the medical opinion evidence.after weighing the two forms of evidence,in concert,the alj credited some opinions and rejected others 
i find the opinions of medicine specialist marder and claimant treating physician askew the most persuasive.the report of pulmonary specialist cohen supports their conclusions.i find that claimant has met his burden of proof.claimant has proved,by the preponderance of the new physician evidence,the existence of pneumoconiosis at a.
i find physician opinion evidence at a a more probative basis to prove the existence of pneumoconiosis then sic chest evidence at a.chest evidence is one type of isolated evidence whereas physician opinion evidence takes into consideration a totality of factors including evidence of impairment and exposures relevant to the broader definition of pneumoconiosis at.
alj order at.again,before finding that jones suffered from pneumoconiosis,the alj considered both the evidence and the physician opinion evidence.simply put,the alj did not fail to weigh the evidence along with the medical opinion evidence.
steel also says that the alj committed reversible error by finding that jones actually suffers from pneumoconiosis.it claims that the greater weight of the relevant medical evidence does not establish pneumoconiosis.as a preliminary matter,we repeat the deferential standard of review we apply to the alj findings.as an appellate court we will not conduct a de novo review of a
