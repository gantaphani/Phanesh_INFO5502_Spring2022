plaintiffs challenge a pilot program in los angeles county that makes a home visit a condition of eligibility for calworks benefits.they contend the county has created an unauthorized condition the pilot project violates the requirements for early fraud prevention and detection programs the home searches conducted pursuant to the program violate state and federal constitutional requirements for home searches or administrative searches the policy imposes unconstitutional conditions on the receipt of welfare benefits and it violates the right to privacy guaranteed by article i,section of the california constitution.
we find neither a constitutional violation nor a conflict between the home visit pilot program and the calworks statutory and regulatory scheme.we affirm the judgment.
factual and procedural summary 
in,the federal government enacted what is known as the personal responsibility and work opportunity reconciliation act of prwora,united states code section et,which authorized funding to states for programs.prwora replaced two federally funded welfare programs,aid to families with dependent children afdc,which provided monetary assistance to eligible families,and job opportunity and basic skills jobs,which provided employment assistance to adults in families that were receiving afdc benefits.in california,the jobs program was known as gain.in,the california legislature implemented prwora by amending welfare and institutions code section et and replacing california afdc and gain programs with the california work opportunity and responsibility to kids act calworks.calworks consists of two welfare services cash aid to parents and children and the program,which seeks to end families dependence on welfare.the calworks program took effect on january.giles horn th,d.
the calworks program is administered by the counties under the supervision of the state department of social services dss.section provides that the state is responsible for maintaining uniformity in the public social service programs dss adopted regulations and standards to implement the program.these appear in the manual of policies and procedures mpp they are not included in the california code of regulations.section of the mpp sets out the general policies and principles.
section of the statute provides the county shall promptly investigate all applications for public assistance as prescribed by the regulations of the department.mpp section provides applications for public assistance are to be reviewed promptly in accord with regulations prescribed by the state department of social services section provides that the rules and regulations are binding on the county welfare departments.under the mpp,each county is obligated to establish special investigative units sius for the purpose of investigating suspected welfare fraud,particularly during intake.mpp.the siu is to be a separate organization independent of organizations performing eligibility and benefit determination functions.mpp.
the mpp provides that the siu is to c onduct all investigations in compliance with due process of law and so as not to infringe upon the constitutional rights of.home visits for the purposes of investigation may be made during reasonable hours of normal family activity.mass or indiscriminate home visits are prohibited search of premises or removal of physical items of evidence of fraud is prohibited without a valid legal process or the permission of the applicant or recipient upon full appraisal of the applicant or recipient rights.mpp.
section of the mpp also addresses home visits a home visit prior to approval of aid is required when living arrangements or other factors affecting eligibility,or apparent eligibility in cases of immediate need or diversion,can not be satisfactorily determined without such a visit.
in february,following a television broadcast about welfare fraud in los angeles county,the board of supervisors instructed the director of the los angeles county department of public social services dpss to report on the feasibility of implementing a home call visitation program.the program was for the dual purposes of eliminating welfare fraud and identifying additional services that can help with family needs.after dpss reported that such a project was feasible,in april,the board of supervisors voted to implement a program of home visits on a pilot basis.the minutes of the meeting show that the supervisors intended that a successful program in san diego county be used as the model.
the los angeles county grand jury issued a report on welfare fraud.it examined project in san diego county,which employed field calls to the residence of every applicant as a method to verify eligibility.based on that examination,the grand jury recommended that the board of supervisors direct dpss to implement a pilot project in one district office,based on san diego project in order to step up identification of applicants providing false information and deny aid before benefits are issued.after a trial,report back to the board of supervisors with the results of the pilot project.
on september,dpss implemented its home call visitation program in four district offices covering the five supervisorial districts.the program was developed jointly by the district attorney office and dpss,and was approved by county counsel and the chief administrative office.the program called for home visits to all potentially eligible calworks applicants.the purpose of the home visits was to complete the eligibility determination process by verifying information provided by all new applicants prior to granting calworks benefits,as well as to assess and discuss the family need for supportive services,child care,services,literacy training needs,and expedite the family access to these services as appropriate.
the background section of the pilot program noted that both the television program and the grand jury report had generated interest in a home call visitation program.detailed home visit guidelines were to be developed.the initial program provides as part of the home visit,the eligibility worker will request the applicant to accompany on a of the home to verify information obtained during the initial intake interview,see if the child ren are living in a safe and healthy environment,and assess service needs that may be addressed by program resources.the eligibility worker will not open drawers or closets.italics added.shirley christensen,the director of the welfare fraud prevention and investigation section of the dpss,provided a declaration in support of the county.she explained that where an early fraud investigation concludes an applicant has submitted a fraudulent application for calworks benefits,the application is denied but the applicant is not referred for prosecution.
if the eligibility worker is unable to conduct a home visit after two attempts,failure by the applicant to contact the worker within two work days of the second missed visit will result in the denial of cash aid.a third missed appointment will result in the denial of cash aid.applicants were to be notified of the home visit program by posters in district lobbies and through notices given and discussed at the initial intake interview.each applicant will be asked to sign a notice acknowledging that a home visit,which includes a of the home,will be made.failure to consent to the home visit will result in the denial of aid.
applicants were told that the home visit would be made within days of his or her return visit to the district office,and that every effort will be made to conduct the home call so as not to interfere with employment activities.exceptions to the mandatory home visits were made for applicants residing in domestic violence shelters or substance abuse treatment facilities,the homeless,applicants working and away from the home monday through friday,from to,and applicants living with a nonrelative who refused to allow the home visit.
eligibility workers conducting the home visits were given two weeks of training,including training by persons involved in the san diego program.the training included instruction on what to look for in identifying potential fraud,just looking for the obvious things that are just right out in front of you.
dpss prepared a report on the home call visitation pilot program in august,covering the period between september,through march.during that period,home visits were made to households,with additional second and third visits.under the program,cases were denied benefits due to the results of early fraud referrals,unsuccessful home call visits,or other reasons.where there were unsuccessful home visits,approximately percent subsequently reapplied and were granted cash assistance.one hundred seventy applicants were denied aid because they were not home for second or third visits.
on september,debra smith,alma roe and laura bergantino filed a petition for writ of mandate challenging the home call visitation pilot project.they alleged violations of the california constitution,statutes,and regulations.smith and bergantino are recipients of calworks aid roe is an applicant for such benefits.named as defendants were the los angeles county board of supervisors,dpss,and lynn bayer,in her capacity as director of dpss.a first amended petition for writ of mandate and complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief was filed in december.it added a new plaintiff,maria quiles,and bergantino dropped out of the case.
at the beginning of the court trial,plaintiffs dismissed with prejudice all causes of action except for taxpayer claims under code of civil procedure section.the evidence presented was a combination of declarations,deposition excerpts,and the testimony of six witnesses at trial.
the trial court issued a statement of decision in april,ruling for respondent county.the court found that home visits were completed,on average,in minutes,with the inspection usually taking one to two minutes.if the eligibility worker found facts during the home visit inconsistent with the application for benefits,the application was denied and referred to the dpss early fraud unit.if the inconsistency was substantiated,the application was denied,although an applicant could reapply or request an administrative hearing to challenge the denial of benefits.
the court cited calculations by a county economist that savings of million were realized through the home call visitation program by not paying calworks benefits to ineligible applicants.the pilot program identified cases percent of applicants visited in which conditions of ineligibility were found resulting in denial of the application.petitioners disputed these calculations,but both sides agreed there was a significant saving of welfare funds.
the trial court found the home call program does not violate state regulations.a tabulation of the reasons that cases were rejected for benefits,based on information revealed in the home visits,supported the county contention that home visits are an effective means to confirm the representations provided on the application,and to discover inconsistencies.the court ruled that petitioners had failed to offer persuasive evidence of other methods to discover such inconsistencies,particularly those related to incorrect address information or the presence of an undisclosed adult in the home.
counsel for petitioners conceded at trial that home visits could be effective to discover the following ineligibility factors absent parent or other unreported adult in the home aided child not in the home applicant not living at listed address and person living beyond what appears to be their means.the trial court characterized petitioners argument as being not that home visits are ineffective as an investigative tool,but that the home visits discovered fraud in only a small percentage of cases.
the trial court concluded that home visits are an effective and superior means to discover welfare ineligibility quickly,and hence allowed by mpp section.the trial court found it significant that the dss reviewed the home call visitation program and found no violation of mpp section or any other rule.the court also cited evidence from bruce wagstaff,deputy director of the dss,that in the past,home visits had been the norm in the eligibility process.
the court rejected petitioners reliance on mpp section,which provides that m ass or indiscriminate home visits are prohibited.this section in the part of the manual governing fraud investigation procedures by special investigative units,is a limitation on the manner in which special investigative units may operate.the court does not consider this provision,which is contained in the mpp voluminous fraud investigation procedures,to limit procedures that are provided elsewhere in the mpp,and specifically in mpp,for determinations of eligibility for calworks benefits.
the court found that conditioning benefits on a home visit was not intended to deter qualified applicants from seeking calworks benefits nor has it had that effect.only eight of the applicants asked to consent to a home visit during the pilot project declined to do so.in addition,percent of the applicants originally denied aid because no home visit had been completed reapplied and were approved.
the trial court concluded that the county home call visitation program is permitted by state law because a home visits to confirm eligibility are not expressly prohibited by the relevant state regulations,b the county has adequately demonstrated that home visits are effective in discovering information about eligibility that can not be satisfactorily determined without such a visit by current or reasonably available eligibility procedures,and c the home visits do not significantly burden an applicant right to receive calworks benefits.
petitioners challenge under article,section of the california constitution also was rejected.the court ruled that this provision must be interpreted consistently with the united states supreme court fourth amendment jurisprudence and that wyman james,d is controlling.that case upheld home visits to recipients of welfare benefits against a challenge that conditioning of benefits on consent to a home visit violated fourth amendment rights.although the trial court found some differences between the new york program upheld in wyman james and the pilot program in this case,none were constitutionally significant.
the trial court distinguished parrish civil service commission cal d,a case that disapproved entries into the homes of welfare recipients by alameda county personnel.the entries were made for the purpose of discovering unauthorized males.the court found the program violated the fourth amendment.the court concluded that the precedential value of parrish is doubtful in light of the later supreme court decision in wyman james.
petitioners claim that the home visit program violates the california constitutional right to privacy also was rejected.the trial court concluded that in the context of search and seizure,the right to privacy is no broader than the fourth amendment,citing in re york cal th,d.it also held that calworks applicants have a reduced expectation of privacy.
judgment in favor of respondents was entered on april.petitioners filed a timely notice of appeal.
discussion 
the judgment in this case was rendered on a petition for ordinary mandamus under code of civil procedure section.in ordinary mandamus proceedings courts exercise very limited review out of deference to the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary,to the legislative delegation of administrative authority to the agency,and to the presumed expertise of the agency within its scope of authority.citation.the court may not weigh the evidence adduced before the administrative agency or substitute its judgment for that of the agency,for to do so would frustrate legislative mandate.citation.this court has held in reviewing the trial court ruling on a writ of mandate code civ,the appellate court is ordinarily confined to an inquiry as to whether the findings and judgment of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence.citation.however,the appellate court may make its own determination when the case involves resolution of questions of law where the facts are undisputed.saathoff city of san diego th,d caloca county of san diego th,d.redevelopment agency rados brothers th,d.the rados brothers court explained i n a mandamus proceeding,the ultimate question,whether the agency action was arbitrary or capricious,is a question of law and thus t rial and appellate courts perform the same function and the trial court statement of decision has no conclusive effect upon us.citations.redevelopment agency,supra,at,fn,d.
petitioners argue the home visit program is preempted by state statute and regulations setting eligibility standards for calworks.they also argue the program conflicts with two specific regulations adopted by the dss relating to home visits.
we apply the established principles of preemption analysis.article xi,section of the california constitution provides a county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local,police,sanitary,and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws.if a local ordinance or regulation conflicts with state law,it is preempted and is void.city of los angeles cal th,d.in determining whether there is a conflict with state law,we consider whether the local legislation duplicates,contradicts,or enters an area fully occupied by general law,either expressly or by legislative implication.citations.ibid.
petitioners argue,in effect,that the home visit pilot program either contradicts general law or encroaches on an area fully occupied by the calworks legislation.l ocal legislation is contradictory to general law when it is inimical thereto.citation.city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.
petitioners first argue the home visit program illegally imposes a condition of eligibility not authorized by state statute or regulation.they rely on ramos county of madera cal d.in that case afdc recipients attacked the policy of the madera county welfare department requiring recipients years old and older to work in the grape harvest or suffer termination of welfare assistance.the plaintiffs contended that this requirement was contrary to standards of eligibility for aid.
the court was asked to determine whether the defendants had discretionary immunity under the tort claims act,government code section.the supreme court held the welfare and institutions code clearly provides that eligibility standards for afdc are to be determined at the state level,and that counties have the purely ministerial duty of carrying out those decisions.section provides every county shall grant aid to any child eligible therefor,italics added.section sets forth eligibility standards,providing that aid shall be granted subject to the regulations of the department,to families with related children under the age of years,except as provided in section,italics added.ramos county of madera,supra,cal d at.
the supreme court concluded that eligibility is to be determined solely by statute and departmental regulations issued at the state level ramos county of madera,supra,cal d at.it cited sections and.the latter provided then,as it does today,for the department to develop rules and regulations governing the administration of the aid program and that such rules and regulations shall be binding upon the institutions,county welfare departments the ramos court held that the county and its agents may exercise only exceedingly limited powers of judgment in determining whether an applicant meets the eligibility standards established by the legislature and the department.ibid.for example,it concluded that the county had no discretion to require children to seek employment as a condition of receiving afdc benefits,because the basic policy decision regarding their eligibility for aid had been made by the legislature.ibid.
the ramos court concluded the authority given counties to implement the basic policy decisions of the legislature,as here and where delegated of the department of social welfare,is purely ministerial.citation.such authority does not extend to the alleged imposition of radically different standards of eligibility on persons otherwise entitled to aid.ramos county of madera,supra,cal d at,italics added.
the first step in our analysis is to determine whether the local program contradicts the statute and regulations.city of los angeles,supra,cal th at,d.the calworks program provides that the standards of eligibility are to be set by state regulation while the process of verifying eligibility of applicants is delegated to the counties.the regulatory scheme supports respondents argument that the home visit program is a method of verifying eligibility rather than the improper imposition of a new condition of eligibility.the purpose of the home visit program is to provide additional information to the county in determining whether the state standards of eligibility are met.as a method of verifying eligibility under the state standards,the home works program does not conflict with,or duplicate,the statutory and regulatory scheme governing calworks.thus the calworks statutes and regulations do not preempt the home visit program.as we next discuss,this interpretation is consistent with the position taken by the dss.
petitioners argue the home visit program conflicts with two regulations relating to home visits.mpp section provides that m ass or indiscriminate home visits are prohibited.the other regulation,mpp section,provides that a home visit prior to approval of aid is required when living arrangements or other factors affecting eligibility,or apparent eligibility in cases of immediate need or diversion,can not be satisfactorily determined without such a visit.they argue these provisions must be understood to mean that home visits are appropriate only where eligibility can not be determined without a visit.
respondents respond that dss concluded that the home call visitation program does not violate any statute or regulation governing calworks.this is shown by a letter dated september,from dss deputy director wagstaff to lynn bayer,director los angeles county dpss.in the letter,wagstaff concludes that the proposed pilot project does not conflict with any state statute or regulation.it has been suggested that section provides limits on home visitation.on the contrary,that section merely states when such a visit is required by counties.it does not limit the ability of a county to choose to include as part of its eligibility process,including at redetermination,a home visit requirement.furthermore,your proposal to view the children and have specified blocks of time for the home visit as part of the eligibility process does not pose a potential problem with our departmental regulations provided the schedule of the applicant as well as the eligibility worker is accommodated.this includes consideration of the work and school schedules of the applicant and their family members.wagstaff notes that in the past,when caseloads were not so high and budgets not so tight,home visits were the norm in the eligibility determination process.there is nothing in the department regulations that prohibits a county from imposing reasonable home visit requirements on all applicants for calworks benefits as a condition of eligibility.failure to cooperate in that part of the eligibility process,as with any requirement,would be sufficient basis for denial of the application.italics added.
this interpretation is entitled to deference.b ecause of the agency expertise,its view of a statute or regulation it enforces is entitled to great weight unless clearly erroneous or unauthorized.citations.californians for political reform foundation fair political practices com.th,d.in giles horn,supra,the court of appeal concluded that dss approval of a county welfare plan to implement calworks is persuasive evidence that it was not in violation of the governing statute.th at,d.because the dss approval was not clearly erroneous,it was entitled to great weight.id.at,d upholding county use of private contractors for ministerial calworks functions.
the traditional rules of statutory construction apply to our examination of the regulations governing calworks.statutes and administrative regulations are governed by the same rules of construction.farm sanctuary,depa
