when one of the cases of this consolidated appeal was before us seven years ago,we set out some guidance on the law,which the district court either misinterpreted or missed.if the latter,such forgetfulness is understandable because we know that even homer nodded 
we have before us an appeal and several from a preliminary injunction entered in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york block,on december,and from an order modifying it entered on february.the appeals concern the constitutionality of federal restrictions on local legal assistance programs that receive federal funding through the legal services corporation lsc.the restrictions apply regardless of whether the recipients receive funds in addition to lsc funds,and prohibit recipients from,inter alia,participating in class action suits,seeking attorneys fees,and personally soliciting clients.
plaintiffs south brooklyn legal services et include local legal assistance programs which provide legal services to new yorkers,as well as the programs staff attorneys,clients,and donors.defendant lsc is a nonprofit corporation that awards federal funds appropriated by congress to recipient legal assistance programs.congress has charged lsc with ensuring that the federal funds it distributes are not diverted by recipients toward activities congress specifically desired not to subsidize.the united states has joined lsc as in these proceedings to defend the federal statute and regulation challenged by plaintiffs.
in the district court,plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against defendant lsc to prevent enforcement of portions of lsc program integrity regulation,and of the omnibus consolidated rescissions and appropriations act of act,stat.in partially granting injunctive relief the district court reasoned that the administrative and financial costs imposed on plaintiffs by lsc application of the regulation created an undue burden on plaintiffs right under the first amendment to use funds to engage in constitutionally protected activity.
background 
i statutory program integrity regulation 
lsc is a nonprofit corporation created and funded by congress to serve as a conduit for federal funds that are distributed to local legal assistance programs.a see legal services corporation act of lsc act,stat.codified as amended at.these recipient programs,like the ones included as plaintiffs to the present appeal,often receive funds from state and local governments and private sources in addition to funds received from congress through lsc.see,at.
in,facing mounting pressure to curtail some of the more controversial activities conducted by some recipient programs,see id.at,congress enacted of the act,which supplemented,and in some instances reinforced,the restrictions on recipients with more stringent requirements.see also science,state,justice,commerce,and related agencies appropriations act,tit.v,stat,carrying forward restrictions to the present time.for example,three of the act restrictions,which also happen to be challenged by plaintiffs in their,prohibit recipients from participating in class action lawsuits,seeking certain types of attorneys fees,and solicitation of clients.act a,see pts.
shortly following the act enactment,a district court in hawaii enjoined lsc from enforcing the act restrictions to the extent that they relate to the use of funds.legal aid soc y of haw.legal servs.lash.the restrictions,as noted above,apply to recipients regardless of whether they also receive funds.the district court reasoned that because lsc,in implementing the act restrictions,had effectively foreclosed all avenues by which a recipient program could use funds to engage in constitutionally protected activities,the federal corporation had imposed an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of a federal subsidy.see id.at.
to address the district of hawaii injunction,lsc promulgated the program integrity regulation.see use of funds,transfers of lsc funds,program integrity,may,codified at.the new regulation created an avenue by which a recipient may affiliate with an organization that uses funds to engage in activities restricted by the act,and was thus an attempt to cure any constitutional concerns raised by the lash decision.id.
under the regulation,a recipient relationship with an unrestricted affiliate organization is permissible,provided the recipient maintains objective integrity and independence from the organization that engages in restricted activities.a.objective integrity is achieved where the recipient is a legally separate entity from the unrestricted affiliate organization,refrains from transferring lsc funds to the unrestricted affiliate organization,and maintains sufficient physical and financial separation from the unrestricted affiliate organization.id.a recipient uncertain about whether its relationship with a restricted organization satisfies the regulation may submit to lsc all the relevant program integrity information and request a review by lsc of any existing or contemplated relationship with an organization that engages in restricted activities.see.at.
determined to insulate the new rule from challenges such as those the district of hawaii found persuasive,lsc designed the regulation to mirror another such program integrity regulation that had already survived similar constitutional challenges in the supreme court in rust sullivan,d.the endeavor was largely successful,for lsc regulation has been upheld by every court to have encountered a challenge to its this one and the initially dubious district court in hawaii.see velazquez legal servs.velazquez ii,cir,aff g in relevant part.legal aid soc y of haw.legal servs,cir,aff g in relevant part.
ii prior proceedings 
velazquez i 
in,several of the plaintiffs to this appeal,the velazquez plaintiffs,brought challenges on first amendment grounds to the program integrity regulation and to certain of the act restrictions relating to a recipient lobbying and welfare reform activities.velazquez legal servs.velazquez i.the velazquez plaintiffs alleged the program integrity regulation failed to cure the constitutional issues raised by the district court in hawaii because the financial and administrative costs of forming a separate affiliate organization remained an unconstitutional condition on their use of funds.see id.at see also velazquez ii,at plaintiffs constitutional contention is that the program integrity rules unreasonably burden a grantee ability to use funds to engage in restricted activity.the district court disagreed and the plaintiffs appealed to this court.
velazquez ii and iii 
on appeal,we rejected the facial challenge to the regulation,holding that it did not impose an unconstitutional condition on the exercise of free speech rights.see velazquez ii,at.we explained that in appropriate circumstances,congress may burden the first amendment rights of recipients of government benefits if the recipients are left with adequate alternative channels for protected expression.id.because the velazquez plaintiffs had provide d no basis for concluding that the program integrity rule s can not be applied in at least some cases without unduly interfering with a recipient first amendment freedoms,we held that they could not sustain a facial challenge.id.at.
however,we also noted in passing that the velazquez plaintiffs remain free to bring an challenge and demonstrate that the program integrity rules will,in the case of some recipients,prove unduly burdensome and inadequately justified,with the result that the act and the regulations will suppress impermissibly the speech of certain funded organizations and their lawyers.id.
finally,we upheld as viewpoint neutral the act statutory restrictions that the velazquez plaintiffs challenged,with the exception of one proviso,which we found viewpoint discriminatory and invalid on its face under the first amendment.id.at.our invalidation and consequent severance of the proviso were ultimately affirmed by the supreme court in legal servs.velazquez velazquez iii,d,but that court declined to review the rest of our decision,in particular as it related to our judgment on the regulation,d mem.denying certiorari.
iii present proceedings 
following the supreme court decision in velazquez iii,the litigation leading to the present appeal commenced.having returned to the district court from the halls of one first street,the velazquez plaintiffs decided to pursue the challenge to the regulation contemplated by our velazquez ii opinion.meanwhile,a new set of plaintiffs had filed a second,virtually identical action in the same district court,captioned dobbins legal servs,and the two actions were consolidated.
the joint plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against lsc enforcement of both the act and the program integrity regulation,raising the following challenges the challenge to the program integrity regulation under the first amendment that was contemplated by velazquez ii a facial challenge to the regulation and the act on a ground not raised in velazquez they violate fundamental principles of federalism under the tenth amendment and a facial challenge under the first amendment to the act restrictions on class action litigation,attorneys fees,and soliciting clients.the defendant lsc,joined by the united states,moved to dismiss all the claims as legally groundless.in addition,they moved to dismiss the challenge to the regulation for lack of standing because the plaintiffs asserting the challenge had never attempted to comply with the regulation.
to address the standing issue,plaintiffs submitted to lsc a proposal that attempted to comply with the regulation.this clarified proposal described the level of separation that the plaintiffs believed lsc could impose consistent with the first amendment.the clarified proposal would permit the plaintiffs and their affiliate organizations to operate in the same physical premises,utilizing accounting measures to allocate the costs between the plaintiff and its unrestricted affiliate organization.on june,lsc rejected the proposal,stating that the proposed sharing of physical space,equipment and staffs demonstrates that the clarified proposal as a whole fails to provide physical and financial separation as required by the regulation.
following lsc rejection of the clarified proposal,the district court ruled in favor of lsc on all of the plaintiffs with regard to the challenge to the program integrity regulation on first amendment grounds.as to that challenge,the court granted plaintiffs preliminary injunction application,insofar as it requested that lsc be prevented from withholding federal funds if the plaintiffs substantially complied with the clarified proposal.the trial court believed the clarified proposal fully satisfied most of lsc legitimate interests in ensuring that federal funds were not diverted by recipients toward activities banned by congress.moreover,the court reasoned,requiring a separation greater than that contemplated by the clarified proposal would impose,in contravention of velazquez ii,an undue burden on plaintiffs ability to use funds for protected activities,since the financial and administrative costs on plaintiffs of maintaining physically separate offices and personnel would be substantial,while the government interests in imposing them were not.
all parties appealed the district court ruling.
discussion 
with this background in mind,we turn to the appeals before us.in reviewing a district court decision on a motion for a preliminary injunction,we reverse only if there has been an abuse of discretion.where the party seeking the injunction attempts to enjoin application of a governmental regulation,it must demonstrate irreparable harm should the injunction not be granted and a likelihood of success on the merits.see velazquez ii,at able united states,cir per curiam.
i regulation challenge 
lsc appeals the district court order granting the preliminary injunction with regard to the program integrity regulation on two separate grounds first,that plaintiffs challenging the regulation lack standing and second,that the district court erred in adopting the undue burden test,which in lsc view is irrelevant to the analysis of whether the program integrity regulation violates the first amendment.we discuss these two issues in order.
lsc moves first to dismiss plaintiffs complaint pursuant to rule b for lack of standing.lsc also states the plaintiffs challenge is not ripe for review.however,rather than raise distinct arguments pertaining to ripeness,lsc blends into one its ripeness and standing arguments.since the two doctrines are closely related,most notably in the shared requirement that the injury be imminent rather than conjectural or hypothetical,the conflation seems to us neither surprising nor inaccurate.see warth seldin,d abbott labs.gardner,d bach pataki,cir,cert.denied,d berger heckler,cir.
because lsc ripeness arguments concern only that shared,lsc challenges the claim ripeness on essentially the same grounds as those related to the plaintiffs follows that our analysis of lsc standing challenge applies equally and interchangeably to its ripeness challenge.we therefore do not address ripeness separately,but consider it together with,and as part of,the standing inquiry.see charles alan wright,arthur miller,edward cooper,federal practice and procedure ed.the blending of standing and ripeness theories is so important that courts should become more assiduous to recognize the advantages of considering the two as part of a single inquiry.
on a motion to dismiss for lack of standing,we presume the general factual allegations embrace those facts necessary to support the claim,see lujan defenders of wildlife,d,and are constrained not only to accept the truth of the plaintiffs jurisdictional allegations,but also to construe all reasonable inferences to be drawn from those allegations in plaintiffs favor.see warth,at.robinson gov t of malaysia,cir.
a party bringing suit in federal court must establish standing to sue,that is,that the plaintiff is entitled to have a federal court decide the merits of his case.elk grove unified sch.dist.newdow,d.such jurisdiction may be invoked only when a plaintiff has suffered threatened or actual injury that results from a defendant alleged illegal act.warth,at.standing doctrine delimits federal jurisdiction to,among other things,cases involving real injuries to plaintiffs,the requirement.that requirement is a recognition of the policy of the constitution that the federal courts will not adjudicate hypothetical the legal questions presented to the court will be resolved in a concrete factual context conducive to a realistic appreciation of the consequences of judicial action.valley forge christian coll.ams.united for separation of church and state,d.demonstrating injury in fact is thus one indicia that judicial power is not lightly being invoked.
while not easy to define,injury in fact has widely been described as an invasion of a legally protected interest which is a concrete and particularized,affect ing the plaintiff in a personal and individual way and b actual or imminent,not conjectural or hypothetical.lujan,at.quoting whitmore arkansas,d.the plaintiffs must have suffered some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action.warth,at.quoting linda richard,d.in the first amendment context,allegations of a subjective chill of free speech rights will not suffice to satisfy the requirement.laird tatum,d.rather,a plaintiff must demonstrate some specific present or future objective harm that the challenged regulation has inflicted by deterring him from engaging in protected activity.latino officers ass safir,cir.
lsc contends that because plaintiffs have not submitted a genuine proposal to form an affiliate or taken any action that would allow lsc to apply the program integrity rule to them,they have failed to demonstrate standing.this is in essence an argument that the therefore the hypothetical.lsc believes that its decision to reject the clarified proposal could not establish injury in fact with respect to plaintiffs because the proposal was so far outside the scope of what lsc would consider permissible that it was a means of presenting the same arguments to the district court that we had rejected as a facial matter in velazquez ii.underlying lsc view is the premise that its rejection of the clarified proposal did nothing to the plaintiffs except prevent them from forming affiliate organizations that the regulation already and patently prohibited.
that may or may not be the case.but the standing inquiry is not concerned with whether the clarified proposal violated the regulation or even with whether the scope of that violation,if upheld,would effectuate a facial invalidation of the regulation.such questions manifestly go to the merits of the plaintiffs claim that the clarified proposal is justified under the first amendment regardless of the regulation,to which we will turn in a moment.the present question of standing,however,is resolved irrespective of the merits,for standing looks at the party seeking to get his complaint before a federal court and not on the issues he wishes to have adjudicated.flast cohen,d.thus,whether a plaintiff has standing will depend considerably upon whether the plaintiff is himself an object of the government action at issue,and i f he is,there is ordinarily little question that the action has caused him injury.lujan,at.
here,in rejecting the clarified proposal,lsc,through its operation of the regulation,acted upon the plaintiffs by depriving them of the ability to form unrestricted affiliates and thereby to express their putative free speech rights without risking enforcement action by lsc.the rejection put plaintiffs to the choice of either forgoing the exercise of certain constitutional rights they believed they were entitled to,or risking the loss of lsc funding by doing what lsc expressly directed them not to do.
that is hardly a hypothetical injury.see,am.booksellers found.dean,cir finding standing because a statute present ed plaintiffs with the choice of risking prosecution or forgoing purportedly protected first amendment activity.right to life comm.sorrell,cir noting fear of civil penalties can be as inhibiting of speech as facing threatened criminal prosecution,and finding standing.it is unreasonable to assume,as lsc would have us do,that if the plaintiffs actually formed the affiliates described in the proposal,lsc might take no action whatsoever against them,especially given its detailed and unequivocal rejection of the clarified proposal.see dean,at threshold for standing met by demonstrating an actual and fear that the law will be enforced against them babbitt united farm workers union,d a plaintiff who challenges a statute must demonstrate a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury as a result of the statute operation or enforcement but does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.
moreover,nothing in the record suggests the plaintiffs would meretriciously decline to form the affiliates they proposed in their clarified proposal,once lsc approved it.the clarified proposal as such,which is incorporated into the parties stipulated facts,stip.facts,demonstrates its sincerity,and our review in favor of plaintiffs allegations prevents us from questioning their motives.in any event,lsc does not seriously argue that the proposal is hypothetical because it lacks specificity,for the proposal is in fact specific.rather,lsc contends the proposal is hypothetical because it is facially that lsc vigorously disagrees with it and believes upholding it would render the regulation a nullity.as noted above,however,this merits argument is unpersuasive because,in addition to being circular,it is irrelevant to the standing issue.we conclude therefore that the plaintiffs have standing to assert their challenge to the regulation.
lsc next contends the district court applied the wrong legal test in its analysis of whether lsc application of the regulation to plaintiffs violated the first amendment.that court believed that we had adopted in velazquez ii a undue burden test for such challenges.the trial court determined the content for that velazquez ii did not provide,but which the district court found in supreme court be an intermediate form of review,a balancing of the burdens imposed upon the by lsc in the application of the program integrity rules,with its interests in doing so.velazquez legal servs.velazquez iv,d.
applicable law 
as a preliminary matter,we point out that the controlling case in this circuit for plaintiffs challenge to the statute is velazquez ii,despite the difference of the posture.the instant challenge is,in all relevant respects,on all fours with its facial counterpart in velazquez ii.see id.at noting the challenge to lsc program integrity rules flow s from the opening left by velazquez ii.
although the district court may have been under the impression that and facial challenges bear no relation to each other,see,id.at t he second circuit adoption of the undue burden standard was dicta since all that was before the court were facial challenges.id.at initially,each of those cases only entailed facial challenges,invoking the restrictive constitutional principles applicable to such challenges,this understanding is incorrect.facial and challenges differ in the extent to which the invalidity of a statute need be demonstrated facial,in all applications,in a personal application.invariant,however,is the substantive rule of law to be used.in other words,how one must demonstrate the statute invalidity remains the same for both types of challenges,namely,by showing that a specific rule of law,usually a constitutional rule of law,invalidates the statute,whether in a personal application or to all.see abortion fed gonzales,cir walker,concurring facial challenges permit a single injured party to assert the claims of all future litigants by making a showing that each time that a statute is enforced,it will necessarily yield an unconstitutional result,but such challenges provide no more relief than would be obtained over an exhaustive series of challenges.velazquez ii supplied the rule of law for this appeal and the fact of this appeal posture does nothing to alter that rule.
we also think it clear that velazquez ii controls with respect to the regulation despite the supreme court decision in velazquez iii.velazquez iii was a review of a part of our velazquez ii judgment entirely unrelated to our discussion of the regulation.moreover,the supreme court denied the velazquez plaintiffs petition for writ of certiorari concerning the regulation a few days after deciding velazquez iii,but significantly did not vacate and remand our judgment with respect to the regulation for reconsideration in light of velazquez iii.in short,velazquez ii remains good law and controls this appeal.
with that in mind,we think the district court adoption and subsequent application of a separate undue burden test were error.first,the district court misread our decision in velazquez ii.as that court itself recognized,the statement that application of the regulation may,in the case of some recipients,prove unduly burdensome,at,was pure dictum.more importantly,the statement did not purport to set forth a legal rule governing challenges to the fact the district court apparently recognized,but ultimately ignored,when it observed that we cited no legal authority for this dicta,velazquez iv,d at.it is difficult to conceive of our establishing a legal rule to govern future cases yet expressing neither intention nor rationale for doing so,not to mention citation to a single legal authority.see cbs,am.soc y of composers,authors publishers,cir a ppellate courts,endeavoring to rule beyond the precise holding of a case,normally make their intention to afford value to dictum unmistakably clear.
doubtless the undue burden language was a more appealing candidate for divining a legal standard than the other plentiful dicta in velazquez ii because undue burden is a term of art,retaining a substantive meaning articulated by the supreme court independent of its dictionary meaning,see velazquez iv,d at discussing the legal background of the test.but the availability of guidance from this court or the supreme court regarding a particular legal standard is not a reason for choosing that standard.that is rather like choosing a chainsaw to perform delicate surgery because it comes with an extensive user manual.
as described above,nothing in our discussion in velazquez ii suggests adoption of a separate test.and,even if the absence in velazquez ii of an intention to rule beyond the precise holding of the case,cbs,at,was insufficient to warrant caution in adopting the undue burden test,the trial court review of the case law should have convinced it that reliance on the test would be misplaced.the lines of cases articulating the undue burden test and analyzed by the district court concern the direct regulation of conduct in the contexts of the commerce clause,abortion,and voting rights,but plainly not the first amendment.see velazquez iv,d at.
second,in addition to misreading velazquez ii,the district court focused its analysis too heavily upon lsc asserted interests in imposing the physical separation requirement of the regulation.see velazquez iv,d at.the trial court believed lsc interests,which it boiled down to the interests against federal funds intermingling with funds and the appearance of governmental endorsement of restricted activities,could be fulfilled by means less restrictive than the regulation requirement of physical separation.we can not adopt this view for several reasons.
lsc and the federal government interests in these cases can not be subject to the least or mode of,like the undue burden test itself,is more appropriate for assessing the government direct regulation of a fundamental the government creates a federal spending program.see united states am.library ass n,d south dakota dole,d courts should defer to the judgment of congress in considering whether its exercise of the spending power is intended for the general welfare.this is so because while the first amendment has application in the subsidy context,the government may allocate competitive funding according to criteria that would be impermissible were direct regulation of speech at stake.endowment for the arts finley,d.that is to say,congress may through funding encourage a program in the public interest without being required to fund an alternative program.so long as legislation does not infringe on other constitutionally protected rights,congress has wide latitude to set spending priorities.id.at.here,far from granting congress wide latitude to set spending priorities,the district court application of the analysis essentially demanded the government provide a compelling interest for the demand more appropriate for the strict scrutiny analysis that was rejected in velazquez ii and not used in the government subsidies cases we found relevant there.see velazquez ii,at.
to be sure,the government interests are not completely irrelevant.see,rust,at.disclaiming the view that funding by the government is invariably sufficient to justify government control over the content of expression regan taxation with representation twr,d leaving open the question whether requirements that are unrelated to the congressional purpose which effectively make it impossible for a restricted organization to establish an unrestricted affiliate are constitutional velazquez ii,at program integrity rules do not necessarily allow adequate avenues for protected expression where the relationship between the burden and the government benefit may be more attenuated.when the government interests are so attenuated from the benefit condition as to amount to a pretextual device for suppressing dangerous ideas or driving certain viewpoints from the marketplace,then relief may indeed be appropriate.see finley,at.and,as we observed in velazquez ii,some of the act restrictions are directed toward speech on the highest rung of first amendment values,requiring perhaps our closer attention.see at hypothesizing that the supreme court would not tolerate a regulation authoriz ing grants funding support for,but barring criticism of,governmental policy.but that issue goes to the act substantive restrictions that are directed toward speech as example,the statutory restrictions challenged in these cases.the program integrity regulation,by contrast,is not directed toward speech but toward ensuring the fulfillment of congress spending priorities,see,and the fact that it requires recipients to expend their own funds to obtain a governmental subsidy can not effect a per se invalidation of the operative regulation.
more fundamentally,upholding the mode of analysis utilized by the district the plaintiffs interests against those of the wipe out the bulk of the regulation applications and effectively invalidate it on its face,thus making the district court ruling contrary to the holding in velazquez ii which upheld the regulation facial validity.the district court reasoning renders meaningless our statement that it appeared likely that lsc grantees with substantial funding can provide the full range of restricted activity through separately incorporated affiliates without serious difficulty,velazquez ii,at emphasis added,because even an entity with unlimited private funds under the district court rationale need not satisfy the regulation physical separation requirements since less restrictive means of achieving lsc interests exist.it is noteworthy that the supreme court in rust apparently was not concerned that the department of health and human services program integrity regulation,upon which lsc regulation is modeled,required a certain degree of separation in order to ensure the integrity of the federally funded program.at.and citing fcc league of women voters,d,the supreme court rejected the argument that the regulation violates the first amendment by penalizing speech funded with money by requiring that recipients of grants help finance federally funded projects by using matching funds.see rust,at.our holding in velazquez ii,unlike the district court below,was consistent with this view.
thus,the district court,with its focus on the undue burden dictum of velazquez ii,perhaps forgetfully lost sight of the true significance of that case its description of the relevant legal framework for addressing first amendment challenges to the regulation.not only did we state in velazquez ii the governing law for these sorts of challenges we applied it to this very regulation.as a consequence,the district court,instead of mistakenly working from what it perceived was a blank slate of applicable law,should have followed the clear tracks we left in velazquez ii.
in velazquez ii,we upheld the validity of the program integrity regulation under the rubric of unconstitutional conditions,at.our statement of the legal framework for first amendment challenges to the regulation was explicit three supreme court cases provide the framework for evaluating plaintiffs unconstitutional conditions claim.id.those cases,twr,league of women voters,and rust,like this appeal,dealt with the difficult problem of government subsidies and whether restrictions on speech accompanying the subsidy were permissible.our analysis of those cases was thorough and need not be repeated here,and it resulted in a plain and specific standard taking twr,league of women voters,and rust together,we infer that,in appropriate circumstances,congress may burden the first amendment rights of recipients of government benefits if the recipients are left with adequate alternative channels for protected expression.id.at emphasis added.addressing the facial challenge,velazquez ii essentially answered the antecedent clause of the standard in the affirmative.congress may burden the first amendment rights of the plaintiffs pursuant to the regulation.at issue in these cases is the second clause,whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated as a factual matter that the regulation has not left them adequate alternative channels for protected expression.the district court is in a better position to make this fact determination,and we leave it to that court to do so in the first instance utilizing the correct standard.
nevertheless,aware that the standard articulated in velazquez ii might seem too general or even opaque,we point out that velazquez ii did not simply state the standard and leave it
