vicki banks appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the social security administration,affirming the commissioner denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits.we affirm.
vicki banks was born on july.she has been blind in her left eye since she was involved in an auto accident as a baby.the accident also fractured her skull,requiring drainage of a subdural hematoma,which was successfully treated.banks attended school through the eleventh grade.she was enrolled in special education classes throughout her schooling,where she had problems in all subjects.she began working as a janitor during her junior year in high school and kept that job for eight years until.she had no significant work history from until,when she again began working as a janitor.she was laid off from that job on april,her alleged disability onset date.
banks used heroin for approximately years,reflected in the record as a history of opioid dependence.banks told one psychologist that she was laid off because of her drug use.the opioid dependance is now in remission,and banks has been since july when she began group therapy and daily methadone treatments.she still attends the group sessions and receives daily methadone treatments.
banks applied for disability benefits and supplemental security income benefits on september.banks complained of pain in her right hand at her september,disability examination,which was diagnosed as mild carpel tunnel syndrome cts on october.she has never been treated for cts or been restricted from any activity because of that diagnosis,however.banks also complained of headaches during the disability examination.she again complained of headaches during an examination on november,at which time she received a prescription for propranolol.it is unclear from the record how long banks took propranolol for her headaches.according to her outpatient psychiatric records,she was apparently taking it in january,and she listed it as a medication she was currently taking when she completed her application for hearing dated june.she did not mention propranolol at the administrative hearing,however,stating only that she took tylenol for her headaches,which sometimes alleviated her pain 
banks sought psychiatric treatment for depression between january and april and was placed on antidepressants in february.banks reported to two different doctors,in april and june,that the medications improved her depression symptoms.she also reported that the medications permitted her to sleep better and allowed her to be involved in her church.
the social security administration sent banks to paxton small for psychological testing and a wechsler adult intelligence,or iq,examination on november.banks scored on the verbal portion,on the performance portion,and on the full scale portion of the test.although small diagnosed banks in the mild range of mental retardation based on these scores,he noted that s he probably function ed at the low level of the borderline range of intellectual functioning.at.small thought that the iq scores were probably somewhat depressed because of her lack of motivation and agitated depression.id.he also noted that she was unable to reliably repeat the alphabet or count backwards from.
banks underwent a second psychological examination on april,with gregory sisk,again taking the.she received the same overall scores as on the iq test performed by small,although the subscores were somewhat different.banks reported to sisk that she had been depressed all of her life and that the antidepressants helped her moods.like small,sisk diagnosed banks with mild mental retardation,but commented that she does not appear limited intellectually when she is engaged in conversation and that her quickness to give up may have produced scores that underestimated her true abilities.at.sisk also noted that banks subscores were all well below average and consistent with her placement in special education throughout school.sisk observed that banks had spent much of her recent time trying to convince others that she is disabled and that she may be more interested in proving that she can not work than she is in actually obtain ing training and a job.id.at.
banks was initially denied disability benefits and supplemental security income benefits on october,and again on reconsideration on december,following small examination.banks then sought a hearing before an administrative law judge alj.following the hearing,the alj propounded interrogatories to a vocational expert ve,who opined that banks could not perform her prior job or any other job in the national economy.the alj rendered his decision on december,and determined that banks was not under a disability because she did not meet a listed impairment under the regulations and that she could return to her former occupation as a janitor.the alj rejected banks iq scores as invalid and,in so doing,found that banks did not meet the listed impairment at c for mental retardation.see pt,subpt.p,app,c.the alj rejected the ve opinion because the alj believed the ve assumed functional limitations secondary to banks borderline intellectual functioning,which the alj did not feel were supported by banks actual limitations and abilities.the appeals council declined to review the alj decision,making the alj decision the final decision of the commissioner.banks sought further review in the district court,which affirmed the alj decision,including the finding that the iq scores were invalid.the district court found alternatively that even if the iq scores were valid,her other impairments did not meet the second prong of c and that substantial evidence in the record supported the alj determination that banks could return to her prior work.banks appeals.
banks argues on appeal that the alj finding that she does not meet the listed impairment for mental retardation is based on improper legal standards and is not supported by substantial evidence,that the district court erred in finding that the alj did not have to rely on the ve to determine whether she could perform her prior work,and that the alj finding that she does not have any nonexertional limitations is not supported by substantial evidence.we review de novo the district court decision to uphold the denial of social security benefits.we must determine whether the alj decision is based on legal error and determine if substantial evidence in the record supports the denial.lowe apfel,cir.substantial evidence is something less than a preponderance,but enough that a reasonable mind would conclude that the evidence supports the decision.our review ultimately requires us to review the administrative record as a whole,fairly considering the evidence that detracts from the decision as well as the evidence that supports it.bryant apfel,cir johnson chater,cir.as long as substantial evidence in the record supports the commissioner decision,we may not reverse it because substantial evidence exists in the record that would have supported a contrary outcome,or because we would have decided the case differently.roberts apfel,cir.
under the familiar analysis utilized in social security disability cases,the alj must determine,sequentially,the following whether the claimant is employed whether the claimant has a severe impairment whether the impairment meets a listed impairment whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing past work and whether the impairment prevents the claimant from doing any other work.see a f.if the claimant fails at any step,the alj need not continue.the claimant carries the burden of establishing that she is unable to perform her past relevant work,through step four,at which time the burden shifts to the commissioner to establish that she maintains the residual functional capacity to perform a significant number of jobs within the national economy.see singh apfel,cir.the alj determined that banks met the first two steps.it is at step three that banks first takes issue with the alj findings.
if the alj finds that the claimant meets a listed impairment at step three,the alj must make a finding of disability.see d.the relevant listed impairment in this case is,mental retardation.see pt,subpt.p,app.mental retardation is a significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning with deficits in adaptive behavior initially manifested during the developmental period before age.id.the required level of severity is met if the following relevant conditions are found a a valid iq between and,and b a physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant limitation of function.id.c.the alj found the first prong unmet because he found that banks iq scores were invalid based on small and sisk comments.the district court found substantial evidence to support that conclusion,and went on to hold that even if the iq scores were valid,the second prong was not met because the additional alleged disabilities did not significantly limit banks ability to work.
banks first argues that the district court erred by reaching for and making the alternative finding that she had no additional and significant limitations.a reviewing court may not uphold an agency decision based on reasons not articulated by the agency,when the agency has fail ed to make a necessary determination of fact or policy upon which the court alternative basis is premised.healtheast bethesda lutheran hosp.and rehab.ctr.shalala,cir discussing the limitations on the rule made by the supreme court in chenery.our review of the alj decision,in which he analyzed each of banks alleged disabilities,reveals that the alj did in fact make the factual findings necessary for the district court alternative holding.thus,the general limitation on a reviewing court ability to use reasons not utilized by the agency is not applicable to this case.
relying on cook bowen,cir,banks argues alternatively that because the alj found that her impairments were severe at step two,she has met the second prong of c as a matter of law.a closer look at cook and the cases that follow it reveals that this is true only if the finding of severe impairments at step two is based on impairments other than mental retardation.see,bryant,at holding that where a severe impairment is found at step two based on a learning disability and migraine headaches,but the headaches posed no more than a slight limitation of function,the second prong of c was not met.thus,although the district court found that t he medical evidence on the record supports the alj determination that plaintiff had severe impairments at step two add.at,we must look to see what about banks combination of impairments made them severe and whether the impairments other than her mental retardation impose additional and significant limitations.
banks claims that she is additionally limited by depression,headaches,mild carpel tunnel syndrome,blindness in one eye,a history of a childhood skull fracture,and a history of opioid dependence.based on the factual findings made by the alj,the district court found that each of these additional disabilities did not significantly limit banks ability to work.we agree.there is no evidence that banks is limited in any way by the childhood skull fracture.banks has been blind since childhood and has successfully worked for years with that condition.her opioid dependence is in remission and being successfully treated.banks had each of these conditions while she worked as a janitor.she does not allege that any of them made her unable to perform her prior work rather,she told sisk that she was let go because she was strung out on drugs.these alleged limitations are insufficient to satisfy the second prong of c.see buckner apfel,cir noting that the claimant employment history suggested that her ability to work was not more than slightly affected by her physical impairments hinkle apfel,cir following eighth circuit precedent and holding that where there is no evidence that the claimant condition has deteriorated since he last worked,the second prong of c was not satisfied sird chater,cir holding that the second prong of c was met where the claimant had been additionally impaired in the period since he performed past relevant work.
banks remaining limitations include depression,headaches,and mild carpel tunnel syndrome in her right wrist.she reported to sisk that she had been depressed most of her life and that she suffered from a nervous breakdown in after her father was killed.however,she never sought treatment at that time and worked from until at the same job,despite any alleged depression.the record further reveals that to the extent banks depression has worsened since she last worked,it is related to dealing with her drug addiction and being.she stopped taking drugs in july when she began group therapy and daily methadone treatments.she sought psychiatric treatment in january related to childhood abuse she had suppressed with her drug addiction.she was prescribed antidepressants in february.she told her psychologist on march,that she was doing well,was attending church and bible study,and was doing volunteer work by visiting elderly people in a nursing home and working with hiv patients.she reported in april and june that the drugs were helping her depression.she was terminated as a psychiatric patient in april because she missed six sessions,and she apparently has never sought further psychiatric treatment.thus,less than twelve months after taking control of her drug addiction,which apparently precipitated her recent bout of depression,banks depression was controlled with medication.although banks attorney asserted during oral argument that banks depression is still debilitating and it is unclear whether it is treatable,the citations to the record relied upon to support this argument involve records made prior to the time banks received the antidepressants.
the only evidence of disabling depression is banks statement at the hearing,only a few months after she told doctors she was doing better,that she felt so depressed she did not know if she was going to live.the alj discredited her claims of disabling depression as inconsistent with her daily activities,particularly her level of church involvement,and as inconsistent with the her failure to seek additional psychiatric treatment.as noted by the alj,banks depression improved after she started the antidepressants,and she received treatment for her depression for only three months,missing six of her scheduled appointments during that time.we hold that there is substantial evidence in the record to support the alj factual findings upon which the district court relied to conclude that banks depression does not impose significant limitations on her ability to work.see holland apfel,cir holding that lack of evidence of ongoing treatment for depression supported determination that claimant failed to meet the second prong of c gowell apfel,cir concluding that failure to seek psychiatric treatment,coupled with extensive work history,supported finding that claimant alleged depression was not a severe impairment.see also pt,subpt.p,app.a requiring limitations based on mental disorders to last,or be expected to last,at least months.
banks also complains of disabling headaches,which she labels as migraines.banks characterizes them as lifelong and attributes them to the head injury she suffered as a baby,although no doctor has made that etiological finding.banks experienced a brief blackout in when she fell at church,which she attributed to her headaches.there is no evidence that banks suffered from any other blackouts.banks received at least one prescription for propranolol in november,which is prescribed for migraine headaches,see physicians desk reference ed,though as we noted above,it is unclear from the record how long she took that medication.at the hearing,she testified only that she took tylenol,which was sometimes effective and sometimes not.no doctor has ever diagnosed a neurological abnormality related to her headaches.the alj concluded from his review of the record that banks complaints about her headaches,both to medical professionals and at the hearing,were vague and that her failure to follow up on treatment undermined the alleged severity of the headaches.the record evidence supports the alj conclusion that t he evidence simply fails to establish that the claimant headaches result in any more than a slight,if any,limitation in her ability to engage in activities add.at and provides sufficient support for the district court conclusion that banks headaches did not pose a significant restriction on her ability to work.see buckner,at holding that alj finding of no c additional and significant impairment was supported by substantial evidence where medical evidence contradicted claimant complaints of obesity,headaches,dizziness and sore hands.
banks was diagnosed with mild carpel tunnel syndrome in her right wrist on october,after she last worked.however,she has never been restricted by a doctor or prescribed any treatment for the mild carpel tunnel syndrome.the diagnosing doctor noted that tests showed only slight delay in digital latency which is consistent with mild right carpel tunnel syndrome.at.banks has not sought further treatment and does not even report taking medication for the pain in her hands.at the administrative hearing,she testified that she gets sharp pains in her hands,that it is hard to use them sometimes,and that sometimes she can hardly write with her left,nondominant hand because of the pain.the alj discredited banks subjective complaints of pain in her hands,noting that her diagnosis of right carpel tunnel syndrome was mild,surgery had not been recommended,and no doctor had ever placed restrictions on her activities related to the carpel tunnel syndrome.we conclude that substantial evidence in the record supports the alj fact findings and properly forms the basis for the district court conclusion that banks mild carpel tunnel syndrome is not a significant limitation on her ability to work.see holland,at rejecting c claim where doctor released claimant to work following wrist surgery although he found twenty percent permanent disability doctor only recommendation was to use a wrist lacer when lifting heavy objects hinkle,at holding that the second prong of c was not met despite claimant back pain because claimant still had a fair tolerance for activities and his doctors noted no restriction in movement.
having found that none of banks alleged impairments meet the second prong of c individually,we look at whether any of them in combination sufficiently limit banks ability to work.as we have noted,banks worked extensively with all of the alleged impairments to some degree,except possibly the mild carpel tunnel syndrome,which was diagnosed after she last worked.she worked as a janitor for two extended periods of time,first for eight years and most recently for seven years,earning over per year during her most recent employment.her ability to work with these impairments,coupled with evidence that banks is more interested in proving that she can not work than she is in actually obtaining training and a job,at,supports the conclusion that none of banks impairments significantly restrict her ability to work.see buckner,at a lthough there may be some evidence that claimant suffers from a physical or additional mental impairment that limits her ability to work,claimant employment history suggests that her ability to work is not more than slightly affected by any physical impairments that she may have.because we believe none of banks impairments,either individually or in combination,rise to the level of significant limitations,we affirm the district court alternative holding based on the second prong of c.we therefore decline to address the alj finding that banks iq scores were invalid.
banks next argues that the alj was required to rely on the ve testimony at step four in assessing whether she could return to her prior relevant work because she has nonexertional impairments.we begin by noting that it is clear in our circuit that vocational expert testimony is not required at step four where the claimant retains the burden of proving she can not perform her prior work.see gowell,at gaddis chater,cir barrett shalala,cir.vocational expert testimony is not required until step five when the burden shifts to the commissioner,and then only when the claimant has nonexertional impairments,which make use of the guidelines,or grids,inappropriate.see beckley apfel,cir johnston shalala,cir.
we have stated in passing that t he testimony of a vocational expert is relevant at steps four and five of the commissioner sequential analysis gilbert apfel,cir.we have not required it at step four.in gilbert,the alj determined that the claimant impairments were not severe at step two,although he sought the testimony of a ve at the hearing.we relied on the ve testimony that the claimant could not perform prior or any other work,and the alj failure to explain why he rejected the ve opinion,in reversing and remanding for further consideration.our concern was with the alj decision to stop the analysis at step two,noting the social security administration cautionary rulings recommending that analysis should proceed past step two if there is any doubt about the effect of the claimant impairments on her ability to do basic work activities.see id.at.we also recognized,however,that an alj is free to ultimately find fewer or less severe impairments than included in the hypothetical to the ve.id.at.
in this case,the ve based his conclusion that banks could not perform any work in the economy,including her past work,on right dominant hand limitation and job base erosion due to borderline intellectual functioning and occasional interactions.at.the alj rejected the ve opinion because he believed the ve inappropriately assumed secondary limitations from banks borderline intellectual functioning that were not supported by her actual abilities and limitations.the ve assumed limitations in unskilled occupations,which the alj found unsupportable as banks worked for significant periods of time in unskilled positions with borderline intellectual functioning.the alj properly disregarded the ve opinion because it is unclear the extent to which the opinion relied on banks borderline intellectual functioning.see johnson apfel,cir since the vocational expert was basing her opinion upon claimant assertions regarding depression which the alj found unsupported,this portion of the opinion was properly disregarded.because the alj was not required to utilize the services of a ve to begin with,he did not err in failing to further clarify the ve opinion by eliciting further testimony from the ve.like any other proffered evidence,the alj is free to accept,in whole,in part,or not at all,the ve opinion at step four so long as the alj explains why the ve opinion is treated the way the alj treats it.see gilbert,at noting that the alj conclusory finding that some of the claimant alleged impairments were not severe supported his decision to disregard the ve opinion to the extent it relied on those impairments see also barnett apfel,cir holding that the alj properly rejected ve testimony at step four where the hypothetical included limitations not supported by the record.he did so in this case.
banks argues that the alj finding that she did not suffer from any nonexertional impairments is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.using the factors outlined in polaski heckler,cir,the alj determined that banks subjective complaints were not credible.banks does not quibble with any of those findings.rather,she relies on the fact that the alj concluded that she suffered from severe impairments at step two,including borderline intellectual functioning and depression,to leap to the conclusion that she is disabled due to these nonexertional impairments.severe or not,neither impairment prevented banks from holding two jobs for extended periods of time.for the reasons discussed at length above regarding the second prong of c,we conclude that substantial evidence in the record supports the alj finding that to the extent banks suffers from any nonexertional limitations,they do not prevent her from performing her past work as a janitor.
finally,banks argues that the alj was required to rely on the testimony of a ve because borderline intellectual functioning and depression are nonexertional impairments which must be evaluated by a ve.because the alj found that banks could perform her prior work as a janitor,a decision we conclude is supported by substantial evidence in the record,the alj was not required to rely on the expertise of a ve,even though some of banks alleged impairments were nonexertional.see discussion supra.as discussed above,it is only when the claimant satisfies her burden of establishing that her nonexertional impairments prevent her from performing her past work and the burden shifts to the commissioner that the testimony of a ve is required.
for the reasons stated above,we affirm the district court judgment.
i respectfully dissent.the administrative law judge utterly failed in his responsibility to develop the record fully,to state the evidence accurately and completely,and to follow faithfully the social security regulations and precedents of this court.
vicki banks hearing was held on september.it lasted twenty minutes at most,from to admin.tr.at.after banks attorney completed his questioning of her,the alj asked banks no questions and called no additional witnesses.the alj lack of attention to the witnesses testimony and the record is vividly illustrated by the very first statement in the evaluation of evidence section of his opinion that banks was born on april.id.at.the fact is that banks,a black woman,was born in and was years old at the time of the disability hearing.
the alj accepted banks statement in her application for disability benefits that she had been employed by agencies of the united states government from to.the fact is,however,that banks was employed by private contractors that did work for the united states government throughout that time.she was employed by the rehabilitation institute of kansas city in and was paid.she was employed by porsha alexander of america in and and was paid and,in those years,respectively.she was employed by george kim in and and received,and,respectively.in,she was employed by kim for part of the year and riteway magic supply company,for the rest of the year and earned a total of.in,banks was employed by riteway magic supply company,and was paid.in,she was employed by kelly services,of detroit and earned,by riteway magic supply and earned,and by wootens enterprises of kansas city and was paid.id.at.what is not clear from the record is whether,during the to period,banks was participating in the federal program to hire handicapped personnel.if so,she was not working in the competitive economy,and she can not be said to have been gainfully employed during this period of time.this is an issue that can only be resolved at a hearing.that the alj failed to resolve this issue is simply another indication of his lack of attention to the record 
the administrative decision discusses a number of health problems that banks allegedly had 
h eadaches,depression,a history of heroine sic addiction with current methadone treatment,poor sleep and energy,low motivation,blindness in her left eye,nervousness,a tendency to get upset and to feel shaky if someone yells at her,and intermittent pain and pins and needles in her hands.
id.at.banks has had no income since she was last employed.for a time banks lived on the streets and more recently has been housed and fed by friends.id.at.she does not even receive food stamps.
the record also reveals that banks was involved in a serious automobile accident when she was only three months old when she lost the use of her left eye and has remained totally blind in that eye ever since.a scar runs from the front to the back of her head,and she has suffered from headaches most of her life.banks was sexually abused by her father and was introduced to heroin by him at age.id.at.this addiction lasted until banks was introduced to a methadone program.she has continued in this program until the date of the hearing.
the alj discusses at some length the claimant medical reports from the truman medical center.the reports of this center are set forth on pages of the administrative transcript.i have made a conscientious effort to read these records in an attempt to determine whether the alj fairly set forth the claimant medical history.unfortunately,the records are illegible,particularly pages of the administrative transcript where the pertinent information appears to be set forth.if i am unable to read them,i doubt that the alj had any greater success.this is one more reason why this case should,at a minimum,be remanded to the alj for further hearing at which time he could request that the truman medical center prepare readable copies of its records.
whatever the status of the medical history,banks is entitled to a finding of disability pursuant to pt,subpt.p,app,listing c,because she has a valid verbal,performance,or iq score between and and a physical or other mental impairment imposing additional and significant limitation of function.as to the first prong,banks received a psychological evaluation by small and sisk.both doctors tested banks and both reached identical results banks scores in both iq tests were verbal,performance,and full scale.these scores are within the limits established by the regulations as to the second prong,banks clearly met the second requirement of the standard by virtue of the fact that she is blind in one eye.it can not be denied that blindness in one eye is a physical impairment,which imposes additional and significant limitations of function.it is not for the alj or this court to read into the regulation language that changes its meaning.in cook bowen,cir,we held that the second prong of c is met when a claimant has a physical or additional mental impairment that has a more than slight or minimal effect upon the ability to perform work.in warren shalala,cir,we affirmed that test.the question was again presented to this court in sird chater,cir,and we again affirmed our holding in cook.
the alj takes the position that because banks did custodial work at a time when she was blind in her left eye,that she can do that work now.this position,however,is inconsistent with the regulations.
there is an additional reason why banks meets the requirements of c.the alj found,and the district court agreed,that banks had additional severe impairments,which include a depressive disorder and right carpal tunnel syndrome.notwithstanding this finding,the alj found that neither of these conditions was of such significance that they satisfied the requirements of the second prong.i agree that there is not sufficient evidence in the record to support the claimant view that the carpal tunnel syndrome in the right hand satisfied the second prong,but there was some evidence that the depressive disorder was sufficient for this purpose.both the psychiatric consultant,sisk,to whom banks had been referred by the appellee,and the claimant treating physician at the truman medical center assessed banks psychological,social,and occupational functioning pursuant to the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ed as falling within the gaf global assessment of functioning scale of.this scale is defined as follows 
serious symptoms,suicidal ideation,severe obsessional rituals,frequent shoplifting or any serious impairment in social,occupational,or school functioning,no friends,unable to keep a job.
clearly both banks treating physician and sisk believed she fell within this category,and clearly there is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding that banks has a serious impairment in her social,occupational,and school functioning,and reached the point where she was unable to keep a job.if the record was legible,it would be possible to develop their reasons for making this finding.at the very least,an inquiry should have been addressed to both doctors asking them to give their reasons for stating that banks had a serious impairment,an impairment that,independent of her blindness,would satisfy the second prong of c.
the alj failed to perform his duties in another manner.instead of calling a vocational expert to testify as to whether there was work in the national economy that banks could perform,he submitted a written inter
