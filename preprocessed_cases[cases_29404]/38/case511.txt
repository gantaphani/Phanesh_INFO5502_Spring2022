appellant robert schmidt suffers from an anxiety disorder,irritable bowel syndrome ibs,and pain in his back and shoulder.in schmidt applied for social security disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income.following a hearing before an administrative law judge alj,schmidt application for benefits was denied on the grounds that he possessed the residual functional capacity to perform his past relevant work as either a group home manager or a data entry clerk.the denial of benefits was subsequently upheld by both the social security appeals council and the district court.
in this appeal schmidt contends that he was denied the opportunity to be represented by counsel before the appeals council,that he was denied the opportunity to present evidence to the appeals council,that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence,and that new evidence,unheard by the alj,requires remand for a new hearing.we find no merit to any of schmidt requested grounds for relief and affirm the decision of the district court.
background 
schmidt was born in and has a college degree in psychology.his work history includes stints as a group home manager,a data entry clerk,and a department store salesperson.his longest continuous period of employment lasted from october to july,during which time he worked as a sales associate for a department store.between april and june of,schmidt worked as a disability facilitator in a group home.the onset of medical conditions culminating in schmidt alleged disability began in earnest approximately four months after he left the position at the group home.in october he began to experience panic condition that schmidt had apparently encountered in the past but that had only recently returned.these attacks,caused by generalized feeling of anxiety,lasted anywhere from several seconds to five minutes and manifested themselves in the form of chest pain,hyperventilation,rapid heartbeat,and dizziness.schmidt primary care physician prescribed xanax as needed to control his feelings of anxiety.
in february schmidt presented himself at a hospital emergency room complaining of abdominal pain and was diagnosed as suffering from ibs,in the form of chronic diarrhea,and generalized anxiety.in march schmidt again went to the emergency room complaining of hyperventilation,chest pain,and anxiety.an ekg revealed no cardiac abnormalities,and schmidt was advised to continue taking xanax as needed to control his feelings of anxiousness.
on may,schmidt filed his application for social security benefits,alleging that he had been disabled since december,as a result of his anxiety disorder,ibs,and back pain related to a slipped disc.
in may schmidt was evaluated by a psychiatrist,root,who diagnosed him as suffering from panic disorder with moderate symptoms.this doctor prescribed lorazepam in preference to xanax for controlling the symptoms of a panic attack.at a visit with root in june,schmidt reported that lorazepam had been largely successful in controlling the symptoms of his panic attacks and that he had begun taking an herbal medication that had been helpful in controlling his anxiety.
on august,schmidt was examined by bahri gungor at the request of the social security administration.schmidt complained of back pain secondary to a disc problem,ibs,and a history of three major panic attacks since october.gungor examination revealed few physical abnormalities.he noted that schmidt essentially had full range of motion,albeit with some back discomfort accompanying certain movements.a spinal demonstrated undue prominence of the transverse process of,but gungor found the significance of this condition to be questionable.the physician report concluded that schmidt suffered from recurrent panic attacks with hyperventilation,chronic lower back pain,and occasional bouts of severe diarrhea.
on august,two physicians consulting with the social security administration reviewed schmidt medical history and rendered their opinions.a psychiatrist,warrior,concluded that schmidt suffered from a anxiety disorder that only slightly restricted his daily activities and that had never caused any episodes of deterioration in a working environment.another physician completed a residual functional capacity assessment and concluded that although schmidt had spondylolisthesis and ibs,he was physically capable of performing a full range of light work,including lifting up to twenty pounds and sitting,standing,or walking for up to six hours of an workday.
schmidt saw his psychiatrist,root,in october and reported that he had experienced only one panic attack in the preceding period and had been successfully controlling his attacks through the use of lorazepam combined with meditation.
five days after this psychiatric appointment,schmidt took a job as a mail order clerk doing data entry for a gift supply company.he had worked for this company in the past.he continued in this job until he was laid off in february.schmidt then applied for and received unemployment compensation benefits from the state of wisconsin.
the hearing before the alj took place on september.schmidt testified that he was not currently receiving any treatment for his back pain and that he had not seen a mental health professional in the period immediately preceding the hearing.he stated that he had to spend quite a bit of time in the bathroom due to his ibs and that this condition had made it difficult for him to maintain his recent employer minimum production requirements.schmidt was unsure whether the employer intended to rehire him.he informed the alj that he had been hospitalized twice in the preceding six weeks for panic attacks.at the conclusion of the hearing,the alj informed schmidt counsel that the record would be held open for thirty days to allow him to obtain and submit records of these hospitalizations.however,when the records were submitted,they demonstrated only that schmidt had been seen at the hospital for complaints of abdominal pain related to irritable bowel syndrome and a kidney stone.the records made no mention of panic attacks or their related symptoms.
the alj rendered his decision on december.the alj found that schmidt was not disabled for purposes of disability insurance benefits or supplemental security income because he was physically capable of performing his past relevant work as a group home worker or data entry clerk.after comparing the physical requirements of schmidt past work to his residual functional capacity for a full range of light work,the alj concluded that neither of schmidt two most recent jobs would require him to perform any tasks that exceeded his residual functional capacity.
schmidt attorney then petitioned the social security appeals council for review of the alj decision.in a letter dated january,counsel stated his intent to submit additional evidence to support schmidt claim before the appeals council.the appeals council responded with notice to schmidt attorney that it would hold the record open for an additional days for the purpose of allowing the submission of additional evidence or argument.the notice stated that if nothing was received from schmidt within the window,the council will proceed with its action on this case based upon the present record,and that the council will not grant you another extension of time to submit evidence legal arguments in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.
at eastern time on the day the extension expired,a different attorney faxed a letter to the appeals council stating that schmidt original counsel has informed schmidt that he can no longer represent him due to a conflict of interest.this correspondence stated that the new attorney was assuming representation in the case and requested an additional extension to obtain new medical information and to prepare the brief in this matter.no information was provided as to the nature of the supposed conflict of interest,when it arose,when its existence was communicated to schmidt,or when the newly retained attorney had been asked to assume representation.
the appeals council never acknowledged the new attorney letter or the request for a second extension of time and on march,issued a decision denying review.the denial of review converted the alj decision into the decision of the social security commissioner for purposes of judicial review.blakes barnhart,cir.
ii.discussion 
new evidence 
schmidt asked the district court,and he asks this court on appeal,to remand his case back to the social security commissioner for consideration of additional evidence.a reviewing court may order additional evidence to be taken before the commissioner upon a showing that there exists new evidence which is material and that there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record in a prior proceeding.g perkins chater,cir.evidence is new if it was not in existence or available to the claimant at the time of the administrative proceeding.perkins,at.new evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that the alj would have reached a different conclusion had the evidence been considered.johnson apfel,cir.thus,new evidence is material only if it is relevant to the claimant condition during the relevant time period encompassed by the disability application under review.kapusta sullivan,cir.
the new evidence championed by schmidt comes in three forms medical records documenting treatment for his mental and physical impairments that occurred between january and august a mental impairment questionnaire prepared by alpa shah on september,and three job performance evaluations completed by schmidt most recent employer the mail order company dated january,december,and february.
the district court held that none of this material meets the criteria for new and material evidence.we agree.with respect to the medical records and the mental impairment questionnaire,schmidt concedes that the treatment reflected in those records was undertaken anywhere from one to three years after the alj rendered his decision.none of the proffered evidence speaks to schmidt condition as it existed at or prior to the time of the administrative hearing.schmidt argues that this distinction is irrelevant because the records document treatment for the very same ailments alleged to constitute his disability in the proceedings below as opposed to reflecting an entirely new injury or disabling condition that first developed after the hearing.however,this court has held that medical records postdating the hearing and that speak only to the applicant current condition,not to his condition at the time his application was under consideration by the social security administration do not meet the standard for new and material evidence.kapusta,at.see also godsey bowen,cir the evidence here was immaterial since the fact that her condition had deteriorated by does not show that in it was otherwise than found at the administrative hearing.anderson bowen,cir remand is appropriate only where the new evidence is material to the claimant condition during the relevant time period encompassed by the disability application under review b appeals council will consider new and material evidence if it relates to the period on or before the date of the administrative law judge hearing decision.
thus,medical records that document schmidt condition as it existed one to three years after the alj rendered his decision,while new,do not constitute material evidence for purposes of a potential remand pursuant to g.as previously mentioned,evidence is material only to the extent that it could have affected the outcome of the alj decision.medical records documenting schmidt medical condition as it existed in could not have affected the bottom line of a decision rendered in december.
schmidt attempt to characterize the employment records as new and material evidence fails for a different reason.it is undisputed that these records existed and were available to schmidt at the time of the administrative hearing.indeed,the most recent of these evaluations predates the administrative hearing by seven months.schmidt has offered no explanation as to why the records were not submitted to the alj in time for consideration as part of the record in the administrative proceeding.clearly then,this evidence is not new for purposes of our authority to order a remand pursuant to g.
schmidt suggests that the employment records were new evidence because they could have been submitted to the appeals council if the council had granted his request for a extension for the submission of additional evidence.while not stated explicitly in his briefing to this court,we presume that schmidt intends this argument as a vehicle for demonstrating good cause as to why the employment records were never submitted to the social security administration.in essence,schmidt would have us hold that a claimant who fails to submit readily available evidence to an alj,then obtains an extension of time to submit additional evidence to the appeals council but fails to submit any evidence during the extended period,may justify these failures by pointing to a second,request for a second extension of time that was not granted.we decline to so hold.the employment records were in existence and available to schmidt at the time of the administrative proceeding,and he was given ample opportunity to submit them both before and after the hearing.this evidence is not new and no good cause has been demonstrated for the failure to incorporate it into the administrative record.
b.the right to submit evidence 
schmidt contends that the appeals council silence in the face of his new attorney letter requesting additional time to submit evidence and argument worked several egregious harms.to briefly review the pertinent series of events,schmidt counsel wrote to the appeals council in january requesting review of the alj decision.this request was not accompanied by any additional evidence as required by federal regulations.rather,the correspondence merely stated,i intend to submit additional evidence in support of schmidt claim.nineteen months later the appeals council responded by advising schmidt that he would be granted an additional days from the date of the notice to submit evidence,that further extensions would not be granted in the absence of extraordinary circumstances,and that the appeals council would act upon the record as it existed if no evidence was received within the period.
on the very last day of the extended period for submitting new evidence,at four in the afternoon,a different lawyer faxed correspondence to the appeals council stating only that he had assumed schmidt representation,that schmidt original attorney can no longer represent him due to a conflict of interest,and requesting a extension to obtain new medical information and to prepare the brief in this matter.the letter offered nothing in the way of an explanation as to the nature of the alleged conflict of interest,when it arose,when it was communicated to schmidt,or when substitute counsel was contacted or retained.no attempt to shed light on these questions was made before the district court and none has been made before this court.the appeals council did not respond to this correspondence and denied review based upon the record as it then existed.
schmidt contends that the appeals council decision not to further extend the applicable deadline constitutes a denial of his right to be represented by an attorney and his right to submit additional evidence.vague references are made in his briefs to due process,and citation is made to cases discussing the procedures an alj must follow for obtaining a valid waiver of counsel from a claimant who proceeds pro se at an administrative hearing.none of these arguments has any bearing on the situation presented in this case because schmidt was not denied anything other than an additional extension of time to submit evidence there is no evidence in this record that schmidt was ever without the assistance of an attorney or that he desired or attempted to proceed pro se at some point in the proceedings.there is no evidence from which to conclude that schmidt was denied the opportunity to present new evidence or argument to the appeals council stripped of the rhetorical veneer of a disc
