the uniformed services former spouses protection act authorizes states to treat veterans disposable retired pay as community property divisible upon divorce,but expressly excludes from its definition of disposable retired pay amounts deducted from that pay as a result of a waiver required by law in order to receive disability benefits,a b.the divorce decree of petitioner john howell and respondent sandra howell awarded sandra of john future air force retirement pay,which she began to receive when john retired the following year.about years later,the department of veterans affairs found that john was partially disabled due to an earlier injury.to receive disability pay,federal law required john to give up an equivalent amount of retirement pay.by his election,john waived about of his retirement pay,which also reduced the value of sandra share.sandra petitioned the arizona family court to enforce the original divorce decree and restore the value of her share of john total retirement pay.the court held that the original divorce decree had given sandra a vested interest in the prewaiver amount of john retirement pay and ordered john to ensure that she receive her full without regard for the disability waiver.the arizona supreme court affirmed,holding that federal law did not the family court order.
held a state court may not order a veteran to indemnify a divorced spouse for the loss in the divorced spouse portion of the veteran retirement pay caused by the veteran waiver of retirement pay to receive disability benefits.this court decision in mansell mansell,determines the outcome here.there,the court held that federal law completely the states from treating waived military retirement pay as divisible community property,at.the arizona supreme court attempted to distinguish mansell by emphasizing the fact that the veteran waiver in that case took place before the divorce proceeding while the waiver here took place several years after the divorce.this temporal difference highlights only that john military pay at the time it came to sandra was subject to a future contingency,meaning that the value of sandra share of military retirement pay was possibly worth less at the time of the divorce.nothing in this circumstance makes the arizona courts reimbursement award to sandra any the less an award of the portion of military pay that john waived in order to obtain disability benefits.that the arizona courts referred to her interest in the waivable portion as having vested does not help state courts can not vest that which they lack the authority to give.neither can the state avoid mansell by describing the family court order as an order requiring john to reimburse or to indemnify sandra,rather than an order dividing property,a semantic difference and nothing more.regardless of their form,such orders displace the federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of congress.family courts remain free to take account of the contingency that some military retirement pay might be waived or take account of reductions in value when calculating or recalculating the need for spousal support.here,however,the state courts made clear that the original divorce decree divided the whole of john military pay,and their decisions rested entirely upon the need to restore sandra lost portion.

on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arizona 
justice breyer delivered the opinion of the court.
a federal statute provides that a state may treat as community property,and divide at divorce,a military veteran retirement pay.see c.the statute,however,exempts from this grant of permission any amount that the government deducts as a result of a waiver that the veteran must make in order to receive disability benefits.a b.we have held that a state can not treat as community property,and divide at divorce,this portion the waived portion of the veteran retirement pay.see mansell mansell.
in this case a state treated as community property and awarded to a veteran spouse upon divorce a portion of the veteran total retirement pay.long after the divorce,the veteran waived a share of the retirement pay in order to receive nontaxable disability benefits from the federal government instead.can the state subsequently increase,pro rata,the amount the divorced spouse receives each month from the veteran retirement pay in order to indemnify the divorced spouse for the loss caused by the veteran waiver the question is complicated,but the answer is not.our cases and the statute make clear that the answer to the indemnification question is no.
the federal government has long provided retirement pay to those veterans who have retired from the armed forces after serving,years or more.it also provides disabled members of the armed forces with disability benefits.in order to prevent double counting,however,federal law typically insists that,to receive disability benefits,a retired veteran must give up an equivalent amount of retirement pay.and,since retirement pay is taxable while disability benefits are not,the veteran often elects to waive retirement pay in order to receive disability benefits.see et army retirement benefits et navy and marines retirement benefits et air force retirement benefits requiring a waiver to receive disability benefits a exempting disability benefits from taxation.see generally mccarty mccarty,describing the military nondisability retirement system.
in we considered federal military retirement pay alone,not in the context of pay waived to receive disability benefits.the question was whether a state could consider any of a veteran retirement pay to be a form of community property,divisible at divorce.the court concluded that the states could not.see mccarty,supra.we noted that the relevant legislative history referred to military retirement pay as a personal entitlement.at.we added that other language in the statute as well as its history made clear that congress intended that military retired pay actually reach the beneficiary.at.we found a conflict between the terms of the federal retirement statutes and the community property right.at.and we concluded that the division of military retirement pay by the states threatened to harm clear and substantial federal interests.hence federal law the state law,at.
in congress responded by passing the uniformed services former spouses protection act.congress wrote that a state may treat veterans disposable retired pay as divisible property,community property divisible upon divorce.c.but the new act expressly excluded from its definition of disposable retired pay amounts deducted from that pay as a result of a waiver required by law in order to receive disability benefits.a b.a recent amendment to the statute renumbered the waiver provision.it now appears at a a ii.see pub,a,stat.
in we interpreted the new federal language in mansell.major gerald mansell and his wife had divorced in california.at the time of the divorce,they entered into a property settlement which provided,in part,that major mansell would pay mansell percent of his total military retirement pay,including that portion of retirement pay waived so that major mansell could receive disability benefits.at.the divorce decree incorporated this settlement and permitted the division.major mansell later moved to modify the decree so that it would omit the portion of the retirement pay that he had waived.the california courts refused to do
