order and amended opinion 
the opinion filed on august,slip,and reported at,is amended by adding a new footnote,at the end of the fourth sentence first paragraph of part,slip op.at,at,as follows 
we need not decide whether good cause is required for submission of new evidence to the appeals council,as mayes conceded in her briefs that good cause was indeed required.in a petition for rehearing,which we deny,mayes raises for the first time the argument that b requires the appeals council to receive new evidence without regard to the issue of good cause.citing ramirez shalala,cir,mayes belatedly argues that good cause is required only when new evidence is submitted to a district court.mayes misapprehends ramirez.because the parties agreed that the new evidence submitted for the first time to the appeals council should be considered,id.at,ramirez does not address whether submissions to the appeals council are or are not subject to the good cause requirement.
all subsequent footnotes are renumbered accordingly.
with the foregoing amendments,the petition for panel rehearing is denied.
peggy mayes mayes appeals the district court affirmance of a decision by an administrative law judge alj that ended her disability insurance benefits under the social security act.mayes also appeals the district court refusal to remand the case to the alj in light of evidence obtained after the alj issued his decision.
the alj found that,although mayes had numerous medical problems,she could not be deemed disabled if,as required by d c supp,the alj disregarded her alcohol dependence.mayes contends that,had the alj developed the record,he would have discovered her herniated discs,diagnosed after the hearing held by the alj alj hearing.the alj would then have found her disabled and therefore eligible to receive disability insurance benefits,mayes says.mayes therefore asks this court to reverse the district court affirmance of the alj decision and to remand the case to the alj for further consideration of whether she is disabled in light of her herniated discs.
we affirm the alj determination that mayes was not disabled.substantial evidence supports that determination,and the alj applied the proper legal standard.we also affirm the district court refusal to remand the case to the alj for consideration of the subsequent herniated disc diagnosis.on de novo review,we find that this new evidence was not material to the alj disability determination.even if it was material,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to remand the case to the alj because mayes did not demonstrate good cause for having failed to provide that evidence earlier.
procedural history and factual background.
the social security act,a supp,allows certain people with disabilities to obtain disability insurance benefits.mayes initially applied for these benefits on january,listing spinal problems as her disability.after an administrative hearing,mayes was found disabled for purposes of the social security act.although mayes petition for an administrative hearing had been based on alleged back problems,she was found disabled on the basis of severe alcoholism with depression,characterized by suicidal attempts and ideation,inability to eat or sleep,feelings of worthlessness,and blackouts.
about seven and a half years later,on november,mayes was notified that the determination that she was disabled was being reviewed by the social security administration in conjunction with that review,mayes told the social security administration that her disabling conditions were rheumatoid arthritis spine,hips,knees,ankles are worst,a cancer known as bowens disease,lung problems,and a hormone imbalance.the social security administration determined that,as of april,mayes would cease to be eligible for disability insurance benefits.it reasoned that mayes show ed pretty good voluntary control over her drinking.it concluded that mayes depression was mild and that her activities of daily living and social functions were normal.on february,mayes filed for reconsideration,stating that her physical ailments had worsened.
on march,was amended.under the amended section,a n individual shall not be considered disabled for purposes of this subchapter if alcoholism or drug addiction would but for this subparagraph be a contributing factor material to the commissioner determination that the individual is disabled.d c supp.in light of this amendment,the social security administration,on august,notified mayes that it would be terminating her disability benefits as of january.see.stating that the effective date of the amendment for persons already receiving disability insurance benefits was january.this notification appears to have acted as a denial of mayes february,request for reconsideration of the decision to end her disability benefits.
mayes then requested a evidentiary hearing,claiming that she was disabled independent of her alcoholism.on september,the disability hearing officer found that mayes was still disabled,that her disability arose from alcoholism,and that she was not entitled to disability benefits,citing.enacted as d c.the disability hearing officer noted that mayes had been treated for back pain,but her primary condition was alcoholism.
in march,mayes requested a hearing before an alj.at that time,she said that she had rheumatoid arthritis,bronchitis,asthma,a hormone imbalance,bowens disease,blockage somewhere between heart brain that cause d her to stop breathing,peripheral vision problems,and continuing weakness.she noted that,two years earlier,she had seen buehler,an orthopedist,for a growth on her spine that she said was made inoperable by cancer.
the alj held a hearing on may.at that hearing,mayes testified that her most serious problem was her rheumatoid arthritis.in addition,she was congested,her legs went numb,she had bowens disease,she had cataracts and glaucoma,and she had problems bending because her back hurt.mayes testified that,despite these problems,on a normal day,she got up,watched television,and straightened up her house.with some help,she could go shopping and do the laundry.mayes also testified that she painted by numbers,worked on puzzles,listened to music,and tried to exercise every day,and that she and her boyfriend sometimes went out for lunch and dinner.
mayes mother also testified before the alj.she stated that mayes had difficulty breathing,that she was anxious and depressed,and that she frequently got sick.mayes mother did not have any other observations about mayes and did not testify about any back problems.
no medical doctor testified before the alj about mayes physical ailments.mark mozer mozer,a clinical psychologist,told the alj that,absent mayes alcohol dependence,mayes remaining diagnoses did not create significant deficiencies from the standpoint of activities of daily living.mozer did not testify regarding the extent and seriousness of mayes physical ailments.
lawrence rowan,a vocational expert,told the alj that,although mayes could not do her previous work as a dishwasher or waitress,she could be a food and beverage clerk,surveillance system monitor,information clerk,or mail clerk,all positions that were available in all regions of the national economy.
based on the evidence submitted to him,the alj,on june,found that mayes had rheumatoid arthritis,bronchitis,possible glaucoma with right eye cataract,diffuse peripheral neuropathy likely secondary to alcohol ingestion,depressive disorder not otherwise specified,and alcohol dependence.the alj determined that,absent mayes dependence on alcohol,these impairments were not sufficient,either independently or as a whole,to qualify as disabilities under the social security act.accordingly,the alj determined that mayes was not eligible for disability insurance benefits.
in november,after the alj had issued his decision,buehler,mayes orthopedist,examined mayes again and diagnosed her as having a minimal sized disc herniation at a minimal sized disc herniation primarily on the left side.buehler noted that one of the herniated discs protrude d into the left nerve root canal.
mayes appealed the alj decision to the appeals council,which found no basis for granting mayes request for review.the appeals council noted that the additional evidence,presumably buehler november diagnosis,was not relevant to whether mayes had been disabled before the alj issued his decision on june.
mayes appealed the alj decision to the united states district court for the district of montana.the magistrate judge filed findings and a recommendation f r that the alj decision be affirmed.the magistrate judge reasoned that there was substantial evidence supporting the alj conclusions as to the extent of mayes impairments,and that the november diagnosis did not supply good cause to remand the case to the alj.the district judge adopted the f r and affirmed the alj decision in an order filed on january.
mayes filed a timely notice of appeal on february.
ii.denial of disability insurance benefits.
standard of review.
a district court order affirming,reversing,or modifying the denial of disability insurance benefits is reviewed de novo.aukland massanari,cir harman apfel,cir,cert.denied,d.
the findings of the secretary as to any fact,if supported by substantial evidence,shall be conclusive g supp.a court must affirm the findings of fact if they are supported by substantial evidence and if the proper legal standard was applied.aukland,this court may set aside the commissioner denial of benefits when the alj findings are based on legal error or are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole sandgathe chater,cir the district court properly affirms the commissioner decision denying benefits if it is supported by substantial evidence and based on the application of correct legal standards.substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance it is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.sandgathe,at clem sullivan,cir.whether substantial evidence supports a finding is determined from the record as a whole,with the court weighing both the evidence that supports and the evidence that detracts from the alj conclusion.sandgathe,at clem,at.when the evidence can rationally be interpreted in more than one way,the court must uphold the commissioner decision.aukland,sandgathe,at.
b.the alj decision was supported by substantial evidence and was based on the proper legal standard.
mayes bases her argument that the alj decision was not supported by substantial evidence on buehler herniated disc diagnosis reached five months after the alj issued his decision.in social security cases,the alj has a special duty to develop the record fully and fairly and to ensure that the claimant interests are considered,even when the claimant is represented by counsel.tonapetyan halter,cir brown heckler,cir.mayes contends that the alj should have developed the record and determined that mayes had herniated discs even before buehler reached his diagnosis.mayes would improperly shift her own burden to the alj.
it was mayes duty to prove that she was disabled.see d supp an individual shall not be considered to be under a disability unless he furnishes such medical and other evidence of the existence thereof as the secretary may require.accord clem,at clem has the burden of showing that he is disabled.the code of federal regulations explains 
you have to prove to us that you are blind or disabled.therefore,you must bring to our attention everything that shows that you are blind or disabled.this means that you must furnish medical and other evidence that we can use to reach conclusions about your medical impairments s and,if material to the determination of whether you are blind or disabled,its effect on your ability to work on a sustained basis.we will consider only impairment s you say you have or about which we receive evidence.
a.accord c you must provide medical evidence showing that you have impairment s and how severe it is during the time you say you are disabled.mayes did not provide the alj with any medical evidence indicating that she had herniated discs until after the alj hearing.
the alj had no duty to develop the record by diagnosing mayes herniated discs.an alj duty to develop the record further is triggered only when there is ambiguous evidence or when the record is inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.tonapetyan,at.the record before the alj was neither ambiguous nor inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.substantial evidence supported the alj decision that mayes was not disabled.
for purposes of disability insurance benefits,a qualifying disability is the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.see d a supp see also b defining disability as including the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment s.individuals are considered disabled only if their physical or mental impairments are of such severity that they are not only unable to do their previous work but can not,considering their age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work that exists in the national economy.d a supp.
mayes was not engaged in substantial gainful activity.accordingly,the alj had to examine other factors to determine the effect of her impairments.a determination of whether an individual impairments are of a sufficient medical severity to form the basis of eligibility for disability insurance benefits turns on the combined effect of all of the individual impairments.d b supp c.impairments are severe if they significantly limit a person physical or mental ability to do basic work activities.c.federal regulations include a list of impairments sufficiently severe that an individual qualifies for benefits.see appendix to part the listing of impairments describes,for each of the major body systems,impairments which are considered severe enough to prevent a person from doing any gainful activity.the alj determined that,although mayes impairments were severe,they did not meet or equal the severity of any impairment described in the listing of impairments.mayes does not challenge this determination.
when the alj can not make a disability determination based on current work activity or on medical facts alone,and when an individual impairments are severe,the alj must review the applicant residual functional capacity and the physical and mental demands of the work she did in the past.residual functional capacity is what the individual can still do despite her limitations.if the individual can still do the work she did in the past,then the alj should determine that she is not disabled.e.if she can not do the work she did in the past,the alj should consider her residual functional capacity,age,education,and past work experience to determine whether she can do other work.if she can do other work,then she is not disabled.f,f see also social security administrative rulings at if a person has a severe medically determinable impairment which,though not meeting or equaling the criteria in the listing of impairments,prevents the person from doing past relevant work,it must be determined whether the person can do other work.
the alj determined that mayes could not perform her past relevant work,but that she could perform unskilled sedentary work as a food and beverage order clerk and surveillance system monitor,and unskilled light work as a n information clerk and mail clerk,all jobs existing in the national economy.this determination was supported by substantial evidence in the form of testimony by lawrence rowan,a vocational expert,as well as medical notes,mayes own testimony,and mayes mother testimony.the medical evidence did not show that mayes was unable to work.mayes testimony that she could do many daily activities suggested that she could also work.mayes mother testified only that mayes had difficulty breathing,was anxious and depressed,and that mayes was frequently sick.even when pressed
