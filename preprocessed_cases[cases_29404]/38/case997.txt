shirley vertigan appeals the district court affirmance of a final decision of the commissioner of social security commissioner denying her disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act act.on appeal,vertigan contends that there was no substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the administrative law judge alj conclusion that she had the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work.vertigan claims that the alj erred by dismissing her subjective testimony of pain,by concluding that she could perform her past relevant work,and by failing to call a medical expert to determine the onset date of her disability.we reverse and remand for an award of benefits.
the admitted complexity of this appeal focuses upon whether vertigan was disabled and unable to perform substantial gainful activity during her period of insurability.it is undisputed that the date vertigan was last insured under the act was december.it is also conceded that she met the disability insured status on june,the date that she stated she was unable to work,and continued to meet it through december.vertigan brought the present case in at which time the alj concluded that vertigan suffered from severe chronic back pain syndrome.however,the alj concluded that vertigan did not have an impairment or combination of impairments listed in,or medically equivalent to one listed in appendix,subpart p,regulation.the alj further concluded that vertigan was not disabled because she could perform her past relevant work as a cashier and as a receptionist.the district court reviewed the alj decision and concluded that there was substantial evidence to support the alj decision,with the exception that vertigan past relevant work did not include work as a receptionist.
vertigan was born on december,and was years of age on december,the date that she was last insured for disability benefits.vertigan had her initial back surgery in.prior to her surgery in,she worked as a pharmacy clerk,then as a waitress for eight months during,subsequently as a pharmacy clerk for leisure world until the middle of,and finally as a receptionist for brief periods during.her work as a pharmacy clerk encompassed,at brief intervals,duties as a cashier.she has not worked since that time.
since her original surgery in,she has had five other surgeries,but only one occurred during her period of insurability.on october,she underwent an laminectomy,foraminotomy and left fusion it is conceded by both sides that the four surgeries subsequent to december were not relevant to the determination of her condition as of december.we concur with that assessment with one caveat,that her subsequent surgery corroborates the continuing deterioration of her back since the time of her second surgery on october.
the record shows that vertigan saw numerous orthopedic,neurological and psychiatric physicians since her second surgery in october of.space does not permit,nor does it provide much guidance to repeat all of the surgical notes on medical examinations involved during the period from through.suffice it to say that all of the medical reports focused upon vertigan back condition,with differing recommendations as to treatment.however,we highlight certain notes which we find persuasive and corroborative of vertigan claim of disability and the lack of her ability to perform substantial gainful activity.
one of those exams was done in august when vertigan was seen by arthur bunzel on behalf of a workers compensation carrier.bunzel determined as early as august,that based upon his findings t he subjective factors of permanent disability currently do not permit this patient to work as a pharmacy clerk.earlier in that same year,on march,arthur liggett indicated that vertigan was precluded from heavy lifting,repeated bending and stooping,and prolonged sitting and standing.
in,harry marinow,another workers compensation physician,examined vertigan,and based on a ct scan,found that vertigan was suffering from spinal stenosis.following conflicting psychiatric reports,vertigan was admitted to the hospital on october,where she underwent surgery by james roe for an laminectomy,left foraminotomy,and a left fusion.she continued to see roe,who was able to verify her ongoing complaints of low back pain with various neurological examinations.epidural blocks were performed on august,and september,to no avail.as early as december,fernando ravessoud,who had recommended the epidural blocks,indicated that vertigan may have to have another back surgery which would involve an fusion.
on june,the workers compensation physician,marinow,made the following observations 
patient is able to lift no more than five pounds without increased pain of the low back.prolonged walking,standing,and sitting cause increased pain of the low back.patient is able to remain walking or standing for no longer than five minutes.patient is not able to remain seated for longer than minutes.
his report continued that vertigan complained of constant slight low back pain with constant slight radiation of pain to the lower extremities down to the heel,greater on the left.this pain is increased to a moderate degree with bending,stooping,squatting,climbing ladders or stairs,very heavy lifting,prolonged walking,standing or sitting,twisting,turning 
eleven days later,on june,steven graboff,a state agency consultative physician,stated that vertigan had constant,moderate low back pain and loss of motion in the spine.he stated in his report vertigan has disabilities that revolve around the low back she has no difficulty with prolonged sitting,but does have difficulty with prolonged standing,walking,climbing and repeated bending and stooping.claimant argues in her brief that she never made any statements to graboff stating that she could sit for prolonged periods.she cites to her testimony where she repeats that for so many years she has not been able to sit and that her sitting tolerance was only ten minutes before she felt she would have to get up and stand 
vertigan back problems continued to deteriorate after the date she was last insured.she received additional treatment and surgeries,which we will not explain in detail,but as we mentioned earlier these treatments confirm the seriousness of her condition.
we review the district court order affirming the commissioner denial of benefits de novo.smolen chater,cir.we uphold the commissioner decision denying benefits if the commissioner applied the proper legal standard and there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the decision.hoffman heckler,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d.our review of the record convinces us that there was not substantial evidence on the overall record to support the alj decision denying vertigan benefits.
credibility findings by the alj 
vertigan first argues that the alj failed to adequately credit her complaints of pain as reflected in the documentary records,her testimony,and her husband testimony.although it is difficult to perceive the alj reasoning for concluding that vertigan testimony of pain lacked credibility,it appears that he felt vertigan could carry on sufficient daily exertional activities to do light work.
it is clear that it is the responsibility of the alj,not the claimant physician,to determine residual functional capacity.however,absent affirmative evidence of malingering,an alj can not reject a claimant testimony without giving clear and convincing reasons.smolen,at.the alj must specifically identify what testimony is credible and what testimony undermines the claimant complaints.morgan commissioner of the social sec,cir.the fact that a claimant testimony is not fully corroborated by the objective medical findings,in and of itself,is not a clear and convincing reason for rejecting it.see smolen,at.
in evaluating the credibility of claimant testimony,the alj must consider the factors set out in social security ruling ssr.the factors in ssr include daily activities and the adjudicator personal observations of the claimant.see soc.sec.rul,wl,at.with respect to daily activities,this court has held that if a claimant is able to spend a substantial part of her day engaged in pursuits involving the performance of physical functions that are transferable to a work setting,a specific finding as to this fact may be sufficient to discredit a claimant allegations.morgan,at emphasis added.
vertigan testified that she is able to go grocery shopping with assistance,walk approximately an hour in the malls,get together with her friends,play cards,swim,watch television,and read.she also took physical therapy for six months and exercised at home.the alj relied on this evidence to conclude that vertigan daily activities involved physical functions that were inconsistent with her claims of pain.yet,these physical activities did not consume a substantial part of vertigan day.this court has repeatedly asserted that the mere fact that a plaintiff has carried on certain daily activities,such as grocery shopping,driving a car,or limited walking for exercise,does not in any way detract from her credibility as to her overall disability.one does not need to be utterly incapacitated in order to be disabled.fair bowen,cir.in addition,activities such as walking in the mall and swimming are not necessarily transferable to the work setting with regard to the impact of pain.a patient may do these activities despite pain for therapeutic reasons,but that does not mean she could concentrate on work despite the pain or could engage in similar activity for a longer period given the pain involved.as such,we find only a scintilla of evidence in the record to support the alj finding that she lacked credibility about her pain and physical limitations.as revealed by the medical reports,vertigan constant quest for medical treatment and pain relief refutes such a finding.
marinow examined vertigan on several occasions.on may,he noted that her subjective complaints appeared markedly out of proportion with his objective findings.the alj cited this as one of the bases for discrediting claimant testimony.yet,this same orthopedic surgeon found that she should avoid activities involving very heavy lifting,repetitive forward bending,stooping,crouching,twisting,turning,pushing,pulling or climbing activities,in an effort to prevent exacerbations of low back pain and disability.he also explained that 
my opinion remains unchanged from the previous reports of june,and may.again i have reviewed her job analysis of pharmacy clerk,and it is my recommendation that she avoid this type of employment,wherein the patient as a pharmacy clerk may be required to stoop and bend up to fifty times per day,or perform the chores of dusting,cleaning,stocking shelves at various heights from the floor,as well as stooping or bending to gain access to prescriptions at low levels of shelving.twisting and turning activities,while stocking,cleaning shelves and waiting on customers was performed up to times per day.this patient has indicated that these repetitive activities of twisting,turning or bending significantly aggravate her low back condition.on this basis it is my recommendation that she avoid this type of employment,as it is certain to produce significant exacerbations of low back discomfort with it sic attendant disability.
on september,marinow again wrote the compensation carrier my opinion remains unchanged from the report of may,in which a permanent and stationary status had been indicated.emphasis added.this finding was made just before her fusion on october.
as to the alj findings that the testimony from vertigan husband was not credible,the reasoning given by the alj for discrediting the husband is hardly credible itself.the husband had stated that the plaintiff was unable to stand,walk,or sit for any length of time,but according to the alj,he later testified that they did a walking program together because of his heart condition.as we understand it,the alj found vertigan husband lacked credibility because of his conflicting testimony.we hold the husband evidence neither detracts from nor is necessary to support vertigan condition.in sum,we conclude that the alj erred by discrediting vertigan allegations of pain.
past relevant work 
we turn now to the question of whether vertigan could perform her past relevant work.the alj found that vertigan could perform her past relevant work as a receptionist and cashier oddly enough,the record shows that the vocational expert ve found her past relevant work to be that of a pharmacy clerk or sales clerk,not as a receptionist or cashier.the district court addressed the issue of whether vertigan past relevant work included work as a receptionist and cashier.the district court concluded that the alj decision that vertigan had past relevant work as a receptionist was not supported by substantial evidence because she only did the work occasionally,and we agree.however,we disagree with the district court finding that substantial evidence supported the alj finding that vertigan past relevant work included work as a cashier.vertigan asserts that under valencia heckler,cir,her duties as a cashier can not be parsed out from her main job as a pharmacy clerk.vertigan contends that at the hearing she made it clear that her duties as a cashier were a small part of her job as a pharmacy clerk.under questioning from the alj,the ve testified there were no transferable skills from her past relevant work.as to her past relevant work,the ve stated,when considering vertigan testimony,she had never performed work solely as a cashier.
work experience is considered relevant if it was done within the last fifteen years,lasted long enough for vertigan to learn to do it,and was substantial gainful activity.see a.the burden is on the claimant to prove that she can not perform past relevant work.see matthews shalala,cir.
we find no substantial evidence on the record as a whole to support the alj finding that vertigan past relevant work included work as a cashier.the rulings make it clear that broad generic occupational classifications of a job such as delivery job or packaging job are insufficient to test whether a claimant can perform past relevant work.see soc.sec.rul,wl,at.in addition,social security ruling states,in pertinent part finding that a claimant has the capacity to do past relevant work on the basis of a generic occupational classification of the work is likely to be fallacious and unsupportable.id.
while there was some confusion as to whether vertigan had worked as a cashier,based on vocational reports she filled out,the record shows that vertigan testimony made it clear that she had never exclusively worked as a cashier.further,the ve testified that vertigan had past relevant work as a pharmacy clerk or a sales clerk,not as a cashier.the ve also testified that she could not perform work as a pharmacy clerk or a sales clerk.this was in agreement with marinow findings in.as such,we find the alj conclusion that vertigan past relevant work included work as a cashier was not supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.in accordance with this finding,we conclude that vertigan was not capable of performing any of her past relevant work.
transferable skills 
the alj did not make a finding as to whether vertigan had skills transferable to other jobs in the national economy because he determined that vertigan could perform her past relevant work as a cashier.because we concluded that vertigan past relevant work did not include work as a cashier,and the ve found that vertigan could not perform her past relevant work as a pharmacy clerk,we turn now to the question of whether vertigan had transferable skills.
an alj can find a claimant acquired skills are transferable to other jobs when the skilled or work activities the claimant did in past work can be used to meet the requirements of skilled or work activities of other jobs or kinds of work.this depends largely on the similarity of occupationally significant work activities among different jobs.d.
according to the dictionary of occupational titles,vertigan work as a pharmacy clerk is considered.with respect to the transferability of work,the co
