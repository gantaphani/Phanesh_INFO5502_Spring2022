in october of,murphey was placed on workers compensation.he did not return to work until the spring of,when he worked in the finance department for a few hours a day sorting water bills.in the late summer or early fall of,murphey began working in the lands and buildings department doing light janitorial duties.he refused to perform these duties after six to eight weeks because the work irritated his back injury.

in november of,while he was not working for the city,murphey applied for disability benefits from pera as part of the application,murphey physician submitted a medical disability report in which he expressed his opinion that murphey met the pera statute standards for total and permanent disability.murphey application for pera disability benefits was approved on may.the effective date of murphey pera benefits was october,and he received the benefits through august of 
on january,murphey and the city entered into a stipulation of settlement related to his workers compensation claim.as part of the settlement,murphey agreed that he would enter the job bank after completion of a chronic pain management program.murphey completed a chronic pain management program in march of,and was subsequently advised in a letter,dated july,that the city was offering him a temporary position as an engineering aide i.the start of this job on july,marked murphey entry into the job bank.
murphey was able to complete the engineering aide i duties within his medical restrictions,but he worked only four hours per day on october,murphey and his workers compensation attorney met with mary page,nancy ross,murphey workers compensation claims coordinator,and assistant city attorney ed backstrom to discuss murphey status as an engineering aide murphey was told that his supervisors were satisfied with his work and that he was doing an excellent job.the parties also discussed classes murphey could take to enhance his skills.murphey left the meeting believing he had secured a permanent job as an engineering aide i,but he admitted that no one had guaranteed him a job with the city.murphey therefore presumed that because he had found a permanent job within days of entering the job bank,he no longer faced termination under this rule.

ii.discussion 
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standards as the district court and construing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.see cravens blue cross and blue shield of kansas city,cir.
the ada prohibits employers from discriminating against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability of such individual.a.the term qualified individual with a disability is defined as an individual with a disability who,with or without reasonable accommodation,can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires.id.in order to establish a claim under the ada,a plaintiff must show that he is disabled within the meaning of the ada that he is qualified to perform the essential functions of the job either with or without reasonable accommodation and that he has suffered adverse employment action because of his disability.fjellestad pizza hut of,cir.
in granting summary judgment,the district court relied on cleveland policy management systems,d,in ruling that murphey had not met his burden of presenting a sufficient explanation of the apparent inconsistency between his ada claim and his successful application for pera disability benefits.in cleveland,the plaintiff brought an ada suit against her former employer after she had sought social security disability insurance ssdi benefits and one week before the ssdi benefits were awarded to her.id.at.in her application for ssdi benefits,her request for reconsideration,and her hearing with the social security administration,the plaintiff made sworn statements that she was disabled and unable to work due to her disability.id.the supreme court was faced with the question of whether the law erects a special presumption that would significantly inhibit an ssdi recipient from simultaneously pursuing an action for disability discrimination under the ada.id.at.
