anne holohan appeals from the district court grant of summary judgment to the commissioner of social security denying her claim objecting to the termination of her disability benefits,awarded under title ii of the social security act.we reverse and restore her benefits.
background 
on november,anne holohan filed an application for social security disability benefits under title ii of the social security act,the act.she claimed eligibility for the benefits on the basis of disability due to depression,anxiety attacks,alcoholism,coordination problems,memory problems,loss of physical strength,and concentration problems.on march,the social security administration ssa found holohan disabled as defined by the act and eligible to receive disability benefits.in its notice to holohan,the ssa explained that it found that drug addiction alcoholism is a contributing factor material to your disability.this means if we had not considered your drug addiction alcoholism,we would not have found you disabled.
in,congress amended title ii by eliminating drug and alcohol dependency as bases for disability findings.see contract with america advancement act of,d c.in order to implement congress mandate,the ssa sent termination notices to persons receiving disability benefits who had been found to be disabled by virtue of drug or alcohol dependency.the notice informed the recipients that their benefits would terminate unless they had another basis to support a disability finding.holohan received such a notice and requested a redetermination of her claim,asserting that she was disabled within the meaning of the act,even without considering her alcoholism.the ssa reviewed holohan case and concluded that she did not qualify for disability benefits.holohan filed a request for a hearing,which was held on july.
at the hearing,holohan was represented by a law student.holohan testified that she was unable to work due to,among other things,depression and severe anxiety with panic attacks.in his decision,issued on september,the administrative law judge alj reviewed the evidence of holohan medical history and then engaged in the five step sequential evaluation process for evaluating disability claims set forth at.
first,if a claimant is found to be currently working and engaged in substantial gainful employment,she is not disabled under the title ii regulations.id.b.the alj found that holohan was not gainfully employed.
second,in order to qualify as disabled,a claimant must have a severe impairment.id.c.the alj found that while holohan had no severe physical impairment,she did have severe mental impairments,namely,dysthymia,and alcohol abuse in full remission.
third,if a claimant severe impairment meets or exceeds a listed impairment in appendix to part of the regulations implementing title ii,then this is sufficient for finding the claimant to be disabled.id.d.the alj found that holohan mental impairments did not meet or exceed the functional limitations listed in the appendix.in considering holohan functional capacity,the alj specifically found holohan statement that her condition had deteriorated since she began her treatment with oh to lack credibility,stating that oh treatment records indicated improvement.
fourth,if a claimant severe impairment does not qualify as a disability by virtue of meeting or exceeding the requirements of appendix,then the impairment must prevent the claimant from doing past relevant work.otherwise,the claimant is not disabled under the implementing regulations.id.e.giving holohan the benefit of all doubt,the alj found that she could no longer perform her previous work as a newspaper advertising account executive.
finally,in order to be disabled,the claimant impairment must prevent her from doing any other work.in determining whether a claimant impairment prevents her from doing other work,one must consider the claimant residual functional capacity,age,education,and past work experience.id.f.considering these factors and relying on the commissioner guidelines,the alj found that holohan can physically perform work at all exertional levels and mentally she is capable of performing at least simple,repetitive type work.the alj therefore concluded that holohan was not disabled within the meaning of the act and upheld the ssa determination that holohan was not eligible to receive disability benefits under title ii.
in reaching the conclusion that holohan did not meet or exceed a listing in appendix at step three of the evaluation and that she had sufficient residual functional capacity to perform simple,repetitive work at step five,the alj specifically rejected the opinions of james oh,holohan treating psychiatrist,and wynne hsieh,holohan primary care provider,that holohan severe mental impairments prevent her from working.the alj reject ed the opinion of oh concerning holohan functional limitations because he found it to be totally inconsistent with oh own treatment notes and records at san francisco general hospital.he rejected hsieh opinion because she did not have knowledge of holohan impairments and limitations and because,he concluded,it was contradicted by the weight of the most recent evidence in the record.
the appeals council of the ssa denied holohan request for review,making the alj opinion the final decision of the commissioner of the ssa.holohan filed for review of the alj decision in the district court.the district court summarily upheld the alj denial of benefits.with regard to the alj treatment of oh and hsieh opinions,the district court held that the alj gave specific,legitimate reasons,based on substantial evidence in the record and so was entitled to reject the opinions of holohan physicians.with regard to the alj credibility finding,the district court concurred that oh treatment records indicated that holohan was improving with treatment rather than deteriorating as she claimed.
the district court had jurisdiction under g providing for district court jurisdiction to review final decisions of the commissioner of social security.holohan filed a timely notice of appeal.we therefore have jurisdiction under.
standard of review 
we review de novo a district court decision upholding the commissioner denial of benefits.harman apfel,cir.we must affirm the commissioner decision if it is supported by substantial evidence and if the commissioner applied the correct legal standards.tackett apfel,cir.evidence can be substantial if it is more than a scintilla,even though less than a preponderance.id.at.if the evidence can support either outcome,we may not substitute our judgment for that of the alj.id.however,we can not affirm the commissioner decision simply by isolating a specific quantum of supporting evidence.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.instead,we must consider the record as a whole,weighing both evidence that supports and evidence that detracts from the commissioner conclusion.id.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.
discussion 
opinion evidence 
title ii implementing regulations distinguish among the opinions of three types of physicians those who treat the claimant treating physicians those who examine but do not treat the claimant examining physicians and those who neither examine nor treat the claimant but who review the claimant file nonexamining or reviewing physicians.lester chater,cir see d.generally,a treating physician opinion carries more weight than an examining physician,and an examining physician opinion carries more weight than a reviewing physician.lester,at d.in addition,the regulations give more weight to opinions that are explained than to those that are not,see d,and to the opinions of specialists concerning matters relating to their specialty over that of nonspecialists,see id.d.
in disability benefits cases,physicians typically provide two types of opinions medical opinions that speak to the nature and extent of a claimant limitations,and opinions concerning the ultimate issue of disability,opinions about whether a claimant is capable of any work,given her or his limitations.under the regulations,if a treating physician medical opinion is supported by medically acceptable diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record,the treating physician opinion is given controlling weight.d see also social security ruling ssr an alj may reject the uncontradicted medical opinion of a treating physician only for clear and convincing reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.reddick chater,cir internal quotation marks and citation omitted.if the treating physician medical opinion is inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record,t reating source medical opinions are still entitled to deference and must be weighted using all the factors provided in cfr.ssr see id.adjudicators must remember that a finding that a treating source medical opinion is inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in the case record means only that the opinion is not entitled to controlling weight,not that the opinion should be rejected in many cases,a treating source medical opinion will be entitled to the greatest weight and should be adopted,even if it does not meet the test for controlling weight.an alj may rely on the medical opinion of a doctor instead of the contrary opinion of a treating doctor only if she or he provides specific and legitimate reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.lester,at.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.similarly,an alj may reject a treating physician uncontradicted opinion on the ultimate issue of disability only with clear and convincing reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record.reddick,at quoting matthews shalala,cir internal quotation marks omitted.if the treating physician opinion on the issue of disability is controverted,the alj must still provide specific and legitimate reasons in order to reject the treating physician opinion.id.
the alj rejected the opinions of oh,holohan treating psychiatrist,and hsieh,who had recently taken over as holohan primary care physician,in reaching the conclusion that holohan impairment did not meet or exceed a listing in appendix at step three of the evaluation and that she had the residual functional capacity to engage in simple,repetitive work at step five.both doctors opined that holohan impairments presented serious obstacles to her ability to work.instead,the alj relied on the opinions of other examining and reviewing physicians and his determination that holohan testimony was not credible.
oh opinion 
in a letter dated june,oh stated that holohan 
depressive disorder superimposed by a panic disorder,effectively prevent her from pursuing gainful employment.specifically,she experiences spells of terror and panic leading to cognitive.she also experiences anxiety,off and on,all day with grave symptoms of depression,including feeling no interest in things,feeling hopeless,and having difficulty making decisions.with these disabling cognitive and affective symptoms,compounded by the stressor of residing with a physically and verbally abusive spouse,markedly impair her ability to function in a work place like she did for nearly years before her current disability holohan ability to concentrate on work related tasks is markedly impaired due to her anxiety and poor concentration.she is able to maintain rudimentary activities of daily living.
oh letter,in conjunction with his treatment notes,is evidence that holohan qualified as disabled at step three of the five step inquiry.
in order to qualify as disabled at step three of the evaluation,a claimant must meet or exceed the listed impairments in appendix to part of the regulations.d.in order to meet a listing in appendix for a mental disorder,a claimant must satisfy criteria in paragraph a of the listings,which medically substantiate the presence of a mental disorder,and the criteria in paragraphs b or c,which describe the functional limitations associated with the disorder which are incompatible with the ability to work.pt,subpt.p,app.oh has diagnosed holohan with major depression and panic disorder without agoraphobia.she therefore satisfies the paragraph a criteria for both affective disorders and anxiety related disorders.compare pt,subpt.p,app.depressive syndrome with diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,michael first,text criteria for major depressive disorder,and pt,subpt.p,app.panic attacks with,criteria for panic disorder without agoraphobia.
in order to satisfy the criteria in paragraph b,holohan paragraph a impairments must result in at least two of the following 
marked restriction in the activities of daily living or 
marked difficulties in maintaining social functioning or 
deficiencies of concentration,persistence or pace resulting in frequent failure to complete tasks in a timely manner in work settings or elsewhere or 
repeated episodes of deterioration or decompensation in work or settings which cause the individual to withdraw from that situation or experience exacerbation of signs and symptoms which may include deterioration of adaptive behaviors.
pt,subpt.p,app.b see also id.oh opinion letter provides weighty evidence that holohan impairments meet three of the paragraph b criteria.first,oh states that holohan social circle is limited to her aa meetings,otherwise she remains significantly socially isolated.the regulations include as examples of impaired social functioning social isolation and the avoidance of interpersonal relationships.see pt,subpt.p,app.oh statement is evidence that holohan has m arked difficulties in maintaining social functioning.second,oh states that holohan ability to concentrate on work related tasks is markedly impaired due to her anxiety and poor concentration.this is evidence that holohan impairments would cause her to fail to complete tasks in a timely manner.finally,oh states that holohan experiences spells of terror and panic leading to cognitive break up as well as anxiety,off and on,all day with grave symptoms of depression,including feeling no interest in things,feeling hopeless,and having difficulty making decisions.oh concludes that these disabling cognitive and affective symptoms markedly impair holohan ability to function in a work place.the regulations explain that the fourth b criterion refers to repeated failure to adapt to stressful circumstances common to the work environment.id.they specifically identify making decisions as a stress common to work situations.id.oh opinion is,therefore,evidence that holohan satisfies the fourth b criterion 
oh opinion thus provides evidence that holohan qualifies as disabled because she meets the impairments listed in appendix.the alj rejected oh opinion that holohan is markedly impaired with respect to performance of any work activity due to attacks and poor concentration because he found it to be totally inconsistent with oh own treatment notes and records at san francisco general hospital.the alj stated that oh treatment notes indicate control of panic attacks with ativan,and a great improvement in holohan condition.oh in fact noted that holohan panic attack problem increased with inactivity,and that she was happy when she joined the ymca.
holohan argues that the alj committed legal error in rejecting oh opinion concerning the scope of her limitations.her argument has merit.as holohan points out,the alj is selective in his reliance on oh treatment notes,exaggerates in his description of their contents,and misattributes statements to oh.although he makes hopeful comments about holohan attending classes,oh also lists as holohan symptoms demoralization,feeling trapp ed anxiety depressed mood.oh never describes a great improvement in holohan condition as the alj suggests.while he does state on november,that holohan is doing better,he explains that this means less unintelligible panics better but when inactive upward arrow sign,read increase in panic.finally,the alj states that oh described holohan as having infrequent panic attacks.however,it was not oh but some other physician at san francisco general hospital who so characterized holohan attacks 
oh statements must be read in context of the overall diagnostic picture he draws.that a person who suffers from severe panic attacks,anxiety,and depression makes some improvement does not mean that the person impairments no longer seriously affect her ability to function in a workplace see,kellough heckler,cir feels well and normal activity must be read in context the claimant has established that she suffered a severe cardiac impairment in.a note entered in november,just one month before she was hospitalized for open heart surgery,also stated that she feels well.kellough testified without contradiction that her normal activity following her surgery was very limited.
the alj specific reason for rejecting oh opinion was that it conflicted with oh treatment notes.although such a conflict could justify a decision not to give the treating physician opinion controlling weight,see c,d,d,in this case there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the reason the alj gave for rejecting oh opinion.when read in full and in context,oh treatment notes are consistent with his opinion letter.because substantial evidence does not support the specific reason the alj gave for rejecting oh opinion concerning the question of holohan disability,we conclude that the alj erred in rejecting oh opinion.
other medical opinions 
examining physicians 
the record reflects the reports of five examining physicians.the reports of two of the examining physicians,those of johnson and solon,support holohan claim.in a december,report,johnson diagnosed holohan with moderate clinical depression.he stated that holohan prognosis was unclear,but that it was difficult to imagine her functioning effectively in any sustained competitive employment setting in her present condition.in a report of february,solon diagnosed holohan with recurrent chronic depression,and concluded that she would have considerable difficulty maintaining the sustained concentration and persistence necessary to maintain a normal workweek.solon did,however,predict that with appropriate psychiatric treatment,her symptoms will likely remit within six months to a year.
of the remaining three examining physicians,two concentrated only on the physical manifestations of holohan impairments.in a report dated july,a physician whose signature is unintelligible notes a moderate gait disturbance,but does not respond to a question on the form concerning evidence of psychiatric impairment.similarly,in a report dated august,katzenberg,a neurologist,found that holohan suffered from no objective sensory motion deficit which would prevent her from working.he acknowledged that holohan had depression and anxiety,but did not consider whether holohan psychiatric impairments would interfere with her ability to work.these reports shed no light on whether holohan mental impairments do or do not render her disabled.
finally,on july,flach,a psychologist,diagnosed holohan as being mildly anxious and depressed.he reported that he found no history of major depression or psychotic episode and that he believed that holohan might be able to perform some simple work.however,flach statement about holohan psychiatric history is flatly contradicted not only by the record but by his own notation that holohan had reported a history of psychiatric services for depression and anxiety,including twice weekly visits to a psychiatrist between and,and prescriptions for antidepressants.moreover,flach states only that,with her impairments,holohan may be able to perform at least some simple if not detailed tasks 
reviewing physicians 
the record also contains the reports of three reviewing physicians,those of burdan,hansell,and hsieh.doctors burdan and hansell simply checked boxes on form reports and gave no significant supporting explanation for their conclusions.hansell report,dated august,simply states conclusorily that holohan has no severe impairments.in contrast,in a report dated february,burdan found holohan severely impaired,but he indicated that he did not have enough information to determine whether holohan met two of the four category b criteria in appendix burdan report is,therefore,neutral on the question of whether holohan qualified as disabled at step three of the five step inquiry.
unlike burdan and hansell,hsieh wrote a letter explaining her opinions concerning holohan.at the time she wrote on holohan behalf,hsieh had just recently taken over as holohan primary care physician.she explained that she had taken over holohan case from kristen shaeffer,with whom holohan had a long,close relationship.based on a review of holohan file,in a letter dated july,hsieh stated that her 
impression is that holohan has had,and continues to have,illness of great severity.in addition to being a victim of domestic abuse,holohan has diseases that include depression,insomnia,severe anxiety disorder and panic attacks that were described as quite debilitating by a psychologist in the implication from all reports is that holohan continues to suffer from severe psychiatric disease which would hinder her from maintaining a job.
the alj rejected hsieh opinion because hsieh admitted that he sic,she did not have first hand knowledge of holohan impairments and limitations and because the weight of the most recent evidence of record indicates improvement in her mental condition and panic attacks,particularly when separated from her unfortunate marital environment,and the record clearly does not contraindicate performance of work activity.
we conclude that the alj specific reason for rejecting hsieh medical opinion is not supported by substantial evidence.in concluding that the most recent medical evidence indicates that holohan was improving,the alj selectively relied on some entries in holohan records from san francisco general hospital and ignored the many others that indicated continued,severe impairment in addition,the alj relied on the medical opinions of examining and reviewing physicians besides that of hsieh to the exclusion of oh more recent opinion that holohan impairments are quite severe.the only medical opinions in the record that conflict with oh are those of flach,who stated that holohan had only mild anxiety and depression,and hansell,who conclusorily indicated that holohan had no severe impairments.however,these an examining physician who examined holohan only once and a reviewing physician who merely checked boxes without giving supporting insufficient to outweigh the opinion of a treating physician who cared for holohan over a period of time and who provided an opinion supported by explanation and treatment records.see d.when oh opinion is given appropriate consideration,it can not be said that the weight of the most recent evidence of record indicates improvement in her mental condition and panic attacks.therefore,there was not substantial evidence to support the alj reason for rejecting hsieh opinion.
credibility determination 
while an alj is responsible for determining the credibility of a claimant,an alj can not reject a claimant testimony without giving clear and convincing reasons.reddick,at.in addition,the alj must specifically identify the testimony she or he finds not to be credible and must explain what evidence undermines the testimony.id.the evidence upon which the alj relies must be substantial.see id.at.holohan argues that the alj negative credibility finding is not supported by the evidence he cites.she is correct.
the alj found that holohan testimony that her symptoms had gotten worse since she began treatment with oh lacked credibility.he specifically identified oh treatment records as evidence that conflicted with holohan testimony.however,as we discuss above,the alj selectively quoted from oh treatment records and misattributed statements to him.this evidence provides no support for the alj credibility finding.in addition,the alj asserts that holohan apparently sought little mental health or other medical treatment until after receipt of her notice of termination of disability in.the alj cites no specific evidence to support this claim,but,in any case,the claim is belied by the record.there is evidence in the record that holohan had seen a psychiatrist twice weekly from to for depression and anxiety,that she had been in a half way house for recovering alcoholics in,that she saw a psychi
