this petition for review challenges the decision of the merit systems protection board board,sustaining the agency determination that the petitioner was not a law enforcement officer and therefore was not entitled to enhanced retirement benefits under.we affirm.
federal law enforcement personnel may retire under the civil service retirement system at age fifty with enhanced benefits after completing years of service as a law enforcement officer.c.the basic facts relating to hannon service,as set forth in the board decision and the record,are largely undisputed.
hannon was employed as a diversion investigator in the drug enforcement administration agency between and,and as a supervisory and administrative diversion investigator from forward.as the job title suggests,a diversion investigator investigates the diversion of controlled substances from legitimate distribution channels to illegal ones.he inspects and audits manufacturers and distributors of such substances to assure that their products have not been so diverted.the work includes determining compliance with record keeping procedures,security safeguards,and other requirements of the controlled substance act.
diversion investigators also participate in criminal investigations.under agency policy,however,they can not carry firearms,make arrests,execute search warrants,make undercover purchases,control confidential informants,or conduct moving surveillance.the latter functions are performed by the agency special agents.
hannon applied to the agency for enhanced retirement credit as a law enforcement officer.after the agency denied the application,hannon appealed to the board.
in his initial decision,the board administrative judge concluded that hannon had been a law enforcement officer.hannon dep t of justice.the administrative judge stated that hannon testified in great detail that he conducted surveillances of suspect doctors and pharmacists places of business interviewed patients and customers of the suspects and the suspects themselves,giving miranda warnings when necessary attempted consensual telephone calls between a cooperating individual and a suspect to obtain incriminating evidence obtained and executed administrative inspection warrants served as an affiant to obtain search warrants and then participated in searches analyzed records as possible evidence carried out controlled deliveries of marked drug shipments issued administrative subpoenas for telephone records and obtained judicial subpoenas for handwriting exemplars monitored and recorded undercover buys from nearby cars and testified before grand juries and at trials in federal and state courts.he noted that hannon supervisor and illinois state police sergeant rodek,who worked with hannon on some criminal cases,both confirmed that he did that work.the administrative judge concluded that hannon activities show that he was involved in criminal investigations,even though he was prohibited from carrying weapons,making undercover purchases,controlling and paying confidential informants,making arrests and executing search warrants,and conducting surveillances,and was not on call hours a day,and that he did not work extensive amounts of overtime.
the board reversed.hannon dep t of justice.after analyzing hannon duties in light of the standards articulated in our decision in bingaman department of the treasury,which we decided after the initial decision in this case and which we discuss below,the board concluded 
although the evidence shows that the appellant spent a majority of his time during the and period in support of criminal investigations,we find,based on consideration of all the relevant factors,that the appellant primary duties as a diversion investigator did not constitute the frontline law enforcement work,entailing unusual physical demands and hazards,that is required for primary leo service credit.the primary factor supporting such coverage was his work interviewing witnesses and suspects,sometimes in locations that were potentially hazardous.but he did not carry a firearm,did not have the authority to make arrests or execute search warrants,was not on call hours a day,and was not required to maintain a significant level of physical fitness.citation omitted.
a.a law enforcement officer is defined in as 
an employee,the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation,apprehension,or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the united states,including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position.
we strictly construe the definition of law enforcement officer.bingaman,at quoting ryan merit.prot.
in bingaman,we described the six factors that the board had developed to determine whether a particular employee qualified as a law enforcement officer as captur ing the essence of what congress intended.id.at.thus,a law enforcement officer commonly has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects is authorized to carry a firearm interrogates witnesses and suspects,giving miranda warnings when appropriate works for long periods without a break is on call hours a day and is required to maintain a level of physical fitness.id.citations omitted.no single factor,however,is essential or dispositive.id.
the board has placed the further gloss on the definition of law enforcement officer that the critical factor in determining whether a particular position so qualifies is whether it involves frontline law enforcement work,entailing unusual physical demands and hazards.peek office of pers,aff,table.
four of the six indicia of law enforcement officer status specified in bingaman are not present here.hannon concedingly was not authorized to and did not carry a firearm and was not on call hours a day.the board found that two other required to maintain a level of physical fitness and frequent direct contact with criminal not met.it stated that even if the agency physical standards for diversion investigators were applicable here which the government denies,those standards 
were not particularly rigorous.they specified,inter alia,that di must have vision correctable to not less than in at least one eye be able to hear conversational speech at twenty feet have distinct speech and free breathing lift and carry cartons of records and containers of controlled substances do extensive walking and standing and do moderate lifting and carrying.these descriptions are consistent with the appellant testimony.he described sometimes spending a lot of time running around in a warehouse,moving boxes,moving drums around to try and get accurate counts,and s tanding on your feet for long periods of time going through the inventory process to me,that fairly rigorous.we disagree.these activities do not bespeak being required to maintain a significant level of physical fitness,especially when compared to circumstances cited by the board when finding leo status.bremby,slip op.citing testimony that police officers had been removed for physical inability to pursue or grapple with a suspect,and that officers must have the capability to run,walk,and climb over rough and unfamiliar terrain,fences and other obstacles for extended periods of time ferrier,at incumbents had to pass a physical fitness battery.record citations omitted.
the board also found that hannon job activities did not include frequent direct contact with criminal suspects.substantial of it hannon own that finding.the board cited agency guidelines that permitted hannon to conduct only stationary surveillance,which hannon testified involved basically stationing myself with another investigator across the street from a pharmacy or doctor office and watching who came and went hannon description of his work to arrange telephone calls between cooperating individuals and a suspect,which merely involved asking the cooperating individual to call the doctor and place an order for drugs.hannon statement that he obtained and executed administrative subpoenas and inspection warrants but almost never executed a judicial search warrant hannon testimony that he was present at the execution of only
