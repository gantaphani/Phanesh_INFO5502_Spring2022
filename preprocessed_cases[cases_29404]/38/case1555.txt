the court of appeals for veterans claims determined that a department of veterans affairs va regulation setting minimum requirements for a notice of disagreement nod was invalid because the regulation required that an nod express a desire for review by the board of veterans appeals board.after invalidating the regulation,the court of appeals for veterans claims held that a letter submitted by raymond gallegos authorized representative to a regional office was a valid nod even without any expression of a desire for review by the board.because the court of appeals for veterans claims did not properly defer under chevron,natural resources def.council,d,and because is not procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to statute,this court reverses and remands.
in march,raymond gallegos applied for service connection for disability due to diabetes and chloracne eruptions on the face,linked to dioxin exposure.in august,gallegos amended his claim to include a claim for service connection for post traumatic stress disorder ptsd.in september,the regional office ro denied his ptsd claim.gallegos representative,the disabled american veterans dav,submitted a letter entitled memo to rating board to the va on october.this dav letter stated i t is our opinion that denial of the veteran claim for ptsd was a little bit premature.further development,a review of other documents would prove beneficial to fair evaluation of this veteran claim.the record does not indicate what action the va took in response to that letter.
gallegos took no further action on his claim until february,when he filed an application to reopen his disallowed claim for service connection for ptsd.in october,the ro granted that claim effective february,the date of gallegos application to reopen the claim.soon after,gallegos filed an nod disagreeing with the effective date.in that nod,gallegos sought an effective date of august,the date on which he first claimed service connection for ptsd.
in december,the board held that gallegos was not entitled to the earlier effective date.in re gallegos,c,slip op.at.applying,the board reasoned that the dav perhaps questioning the ro denial of not indicate the appellant desire for appellate review.id.at.thus,the board concluded that the dav letter did not constitute a valid nod appealing the september denial of the original ptsd claim.because gallegos did not submit a valid nod in,the board made the september decision final.as a consequence,the board sustained the effective date of february,for gallegos ptsd benefits.
the court of appeals for veterans claims reversed the board decision.specifically,the court of appeals for veterans claims determined that,the statutory nod requirement,needed no interpretation or implementation by regulation.gallegos gober.thus,the court of appeals for veterans claims declined to apply chevron deference to the va regulatory implementation of the statute,namely.relying on the language of,the prior decision of tomlin brown,and the nature of the veteran adjudication system,the veterans court struck from the requirement that an nod express a desire for appellate review.the secretary of veterans affairs now appeals.
when reviewing an agency construction of a statute that it administers,this court first determines whether congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.chevron,at.if the law governs the question under consideration,this court and the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of congress.id.at.if,however,the law does not speak to the issue,this court then asks whether the administering agency properly promulgated an interpretative regulation based on a permissible construction of the statute.micron,united states.
in other words,this court defers to the va reasonable interpretation of a statutory provision when the law does not directly address the precise question at issue,in other words,when the law leaves a gap for an agency to fill.chevron,at.the power of an administrative agency to administer a congressionally created program necessarily requires the formulation of policy and the making of rules to fill any gap left,implicitly or explicitly,by congress.quoting morton ruiz,d emphasis added see also immigration naturalization serv,d.the supreme court chose to emphasize that chevron deference applies unless the statute speaks directly to the precise question.under chevron deference,any ensuing agency regulation is binding in the courts unless procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to the statute.united states mead,d.
under,t he secretary has authority to prescribe all rules and regulations which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the laws administered by the department and are consistent with those laws.emphasis added.the secretary of veterans affairs asserts that the va properly interpreted and implemented by promulgating.specifically,the secretary notes that title does not define a notice of disagreement.the secretary regulation seeks to define that undefined statutory term.in other words,the secretary seeks to fill a gap in the statute.
section a states that appellate review will be initiated by a notice of disagreement and completed by a substantive appeal section b further states,in relevant part 
a notice of disagreement shall be filed within one year from the date of mailing of notice of the result of initial review or determination.such notice,and appeals,must be in writing and be filed with the activity which entered the determination with which disagreement is expressed 
notices of disagreement,and appeals,must be in writing and may be filed by the claimant,the claimant legal guardian,or such accredited representative,attorney,or authorized agent as may be selected by the claimant or legal guardian.
b emphasis added.
this statutory language supplies some requirements for a valid nod.for instance,title requires a written nod.in addition,the claimant or his representative must file this writing with the activity which entered the determination with which disagreement is expressed the regional office in this one year of notice of an initial determination.the statute does not,however,define notice of disagreement or suggest sufficient expressions to make a writing an nod.the statute also does not suggest that its specifications for an,time limit from notice,the only requirements for a valid nod.in sum,does not address directly the precise question under review.in a general sense,the statute does not define an nod.more important,on the precise question under review,the statute does not directly address whether an nod is sufficient without a request for appellate review.therefore,under the standard set by the supreme court,title contains a gap for an agency to fill with regard to the definition of a legally valid nod.chevron,at.
indeed,the veterans department had supplied a regulatory definition of the term notice of disagreement as early as.in that earlier regulatory definition,the former a b,an nod should be in terms which can be reasonably construed as evidencing a desire for review of the va determination.later enactments did not disturb these earlier regulatory definitions of nod.
thus,does not express a complete and unambiguous meaning for the statutory term notice of disagreement.moreover,the statute does not directly address the sufficiency of an nod without a request for appellate precise question posed by this case.in sum,chevron deference applies to the va implementation of.
the va promulgated in to expressly define a notice of disagreement in.as stated in 
a written communication from a claimant or his or her representative expressing dissatisfaction or disagreement with an adjudicative determination by the agency of original jurisdiction and a desire to contest the result will constitute a notice of disagreement.while special wording is not required,the notice of disagreement must be in terms that can be reasonably construed as disagreement with that determination and a desire for appellate review.
thus,under,a valid nod must contain terms that can be reasonably construed as disagreement with that determination and a desire for appellate review.
section is a reasonable and permissible construction of.section does not preclude other requirements for an nod.moreover,merely states that a veteran nod must include terms that can be reasonably construed as a desire for appellate review.this requirement serves administrative efficiency by distinguishing a request for board review from other routine communications in the wake of a va decision.assuming the veteran desires appellate review,meeting the requirement of is not an onerous task.
section d specifies that the regional office must file a statement of the case if the matter remains unresolved after an nod.d.gallegos contends that a veteran can not make an informed decision to appeal without the information in the statement of the case,which the veteran receives only after filing an nod.to the contrary,the va decision itself provides the veteran with information for an informed appeal decision.as required under b,notice of a va decision must include a statement of reasons for the decision and a summary of the evidence considered by the b see also hayre west.such notice,which a veteran receives before the nod filing deadline,see b,provides the veteran with enough information to support an a letter reasonably construed as disagreement with a desire for appellate review.even if still harboring questions,a veteran can easily include his intent to appeal in a letter of disagreement to preserve an appeal option.
although initiating the appeal process,an nod may or may not actually lead to an appellate review.after receiving the nod,the regional office reviews the claim again.if the regional office can resolve the disagreement at that point,no appeal ensues.if the regional office can not resolve the disagreement,it proceeds to prepare a statement of the case.d.the veteran then receives sixty days from the date the statement of the case is mailed to file the formal appeal.d.
in any event,is not procedurally defective,arbitrary or capricious in substance,or manifestly contrary to or any other relevant statute.in reaching this conclusion,this court has considered as well the nature of the veteran adjudication system.this court has already decided that chevron deference may apply in the context of title.see gilpin west,cert.denied,d it is beyond question that the secretary has substantive power with respect to the benefits in question here and thus chevron deference applies.
conclusion 
in sum,the court of appeals for veterans claims erred in not applying chevron deference to the va implementation of.the court of appeals for veterans claims also erred when it invalidated with regard to the requirement that an nod contain terms that can be reasonably construed as a desire for appellate review.this court,therefore,reverses and remands the decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims for a determination of whether gallegos dav letter constitutes a valid nod under.
each party shall bear its own costs.
reversed and remanded.
this court should affirm the court of appeals for veterans claims in gallegos gober.gallegos,because there is no gap in with respect to a notice of disagreement nod.by applying deference under chevron,natural resources defense council,d,through its prismatic view of a gap in a clear statute,the majority upholds a veterans administration va regulation that rewrites congress clearly stated meaning for a nod.the majority establishes an illusory gap by positing questions that the statute clearly answers,and then asserting that these supposedly unanswered questions justify the va regulation whether a nod is sufficient without a request for appellate review,and whether the statute define s a notice of disagreement.op.at 
i believe,however,that the plain meaning and structure of leave no room for an agency to add additional requirements to a nod the inquiry does not pass step one of the chevron test without chevron deference,the regulatory requirement that the nod must express a desire for appellate review as established by the va regulation,can not be upheld.further,relevant precedent and policy dictate that the holding of the court of appeals for veterans claims should be affirmed.therefore,i respectfully dissent.
the plain meaning of the term notice of disagreement does not allow for the addition of procedural requirements,such as expanding the nod definition to require that claimants also express a desire for appellate review,in order for their nod to be valid.the plain meaning is not only clear,but obvious.the term notice denotes giv ing legal notice to or of t o realize or give attention to.black law dictionary ed.the term disagreement specifies the type of notice required in a nod a difference of opinion a lack of agreement.id.at.
thus,by plain meaning,notice of disagreement means giving attention to a lack of agreement.in the context of,this meaning applies to the veteran claim.the claimant advises the va of his or her lack of agreement with the initial review or determination for the claim by filing a nod.b.there is no ambiguity in the concepts of notice and disagreement.these concepts and the plain meaning of these terms do not cover expressing a desire for appellate review as called for by the regulation.
the court of appeals for veterans claims found,and the majority does not contest,that the letter sent on gallegos behalf by the dav expresses notice of disagreement,gives attention to a lack of agreement,with the initial decision on gallegos ptsd claim.gallegos at.thus,but for the additional regulatory procedural requirement erroneously added by the va,the dav actions on gallegos behalf would have entitled him to the earlier effective date for his claim.the alleged gap in does not support stripping gallegos of his right to the earlier date when the va improperly added a technical,formal requirement for a nod.gallegos at citing tomlin brown,because the statute is clear and there is no gap,chevron deference does not apply the supreme court has itself noted that when the statute is clear chevron deference does not apply.see dole united steelworkers of america,d chevron,at.if the intent of congress is clear,that is the end of the matter id.at.if a court,employing traditional tools of statutory construction,ascertains that congress had an intention on the precise question at issue,that intention is the law and must be given effect.
we have more,however,than the plain meaning of notice of disagreement to inform the term nod.in various subsections of,congress has given several clear statements concerning the role of a nod in the process congress specified whereby a claimant initiates appellate review.tellingly,the majority does not discuss these portions of.these provisions describe a process congress set forth to initiate appellate review.they delineate the difference between a nod,the first step,and the later steps,which may eventually lead to a request for review.further,the majority opinion fails to address gallegos arguments concerning the import of the process on the meaning of nod.in the context of this process,clearly articulated by,a nod can not be expected or interpreted to express a desire for appellate review.the court of appeals for veterans claims recognized this and applied structural statutory interpretation to reach the correct the va can not add an additional procedural requirement to the nod.
the relevant sections of are set forth below in greater detail to illustrate the provisions ignored by the majority.
