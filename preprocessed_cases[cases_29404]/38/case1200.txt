background 
sneed husband,reginald sneed,served on active duty from june to june.sneed suffered from numerous disabilities.in january,sneed suffered a spinal cord contusion from a fall,which left him quadriplegic and confined to a wheelchair.in october,sneed was living in a nursing home for paralyzed veterans when a fire broke out,and all of the residents,including sneed,died of smoke inhalation.
following the death of her husband,sneed filed a claim for dependency and indemnity compensation under.sneed disabilities were alleged to have been principal or contributory causes of his death,see,based on the theories that sneed spondylosis and spinal stenosis contributed to his fall and resultant quadriplegia,and that sneed posttraumatic stress disorder,tinnitus,and hearing loss prevented him from leaving the nursing home during the fire.
the regional office of the department of veterans affairs va denied sneed claim,and the board affirmed.the board decision was mailed to sneed on april.sneed notice of appeal to the veterans court was due on august,days after the board mailed its decision.a.
on april,well within the day period,sneed contacted a lawyer,katrina eagle,requesting that eagle represent her in an appeal to the veterans court.according to sneed,at the request of eagle secretary,she transmitted case materials to eagle office by mail and fax,and had several oral communications with eagle office.the record does not describe the exact nature of the material transmitted or the substance of the communications.on august,sneed received a letter from eagle.in her letter,eagle provided an assessment of sneed service connection claim,explaining her view that the claim does not meet the criteria under,and concluded,i do not believe the va erred in denying your claim thus,i will not be able to represent you for any subsequent appeal for entitlement to service connection for the cause of death,and for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits.
eagle further stated,y ou are free to seek another opinion from another attorney,of course.moreover,you are not required to have an attorney to proceed before the court.however,should you decide to appeal the board adverse decision,you must file your notice of appeal no later than august.the august statement was erroneous the correct deadline was august,the next day following sneed receipt of eagle letter.sneed stated that,between august and august,she contacted at least fourteen lawyers,who all turned down her case.having failed to secure a lawyer to take her case,sneed filed the notice of appeal herself on september,days after the deadline.
on september,sneed sent a letter to the veterans court explaining her late filing.on june,the veterans court ordered sneed to file a response discussing whether the circumstances in her case warranted equitable tolling of the day deadline.in september,the veterans court dismissed sneed appeal as untimely filed,finding that equitable tolling did not apply because the circumstances leading up to her late noa are not extraordinary,but rather evidence general negligence or procrastination.sneed shinseki sneed i,wl,at.the veterans court distinguished sneed argument for tolling from circumstances that precluded a timely filing justifying equitable tolling,such as mental illness,reliance on the incorrect statement of a va official,or a misfiling at the regional office or the board.id.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
on appeal we vacated and remanded.sneed shinseki sneed ii.we held that attorney abandonment may justify equitably tolling the filing deadline in appeals to the veterans court.id.we also found,as the government conceded during oral argument in the first appeal,that the veterans court had not made any explicit findings with respect to diligence.id.at.
on remand,sneed argued that the veterans court should find attorney abandonment by eagle,warranting equitable tolling of sneed deadline to file her notice of appeal.in october,the veterans court again held that equitable tolling of the statutory deadline was not warranted.sneed mcdonald sneed iii,wl,at,available at.the veterans court concluded that there was no attorney abandonment absent an agreement between eagle and sneed to represent sneed or file the noa.the veterans court also held that sneed did not act diligently in pursuing her appeal rights.sneed appealed.we have jurisdiction under.
discussion 
section of title provides that we shall decide all relevant questions of law arising from appeals from decisions of the veterans court,but,e xcept to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue,we may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.d,d.though the question whether equitable tolling applies in a particular case often involves,in part,the application of law to fact,when the material facts are not in dispute and the adoption of a particular legal standard would dictate the outcome of the equitable tolling claim,this court has treated the question of the availability of equitable tolling as a matter of law that we are authorized by statute to address.bailey principi,see also santana venegas principi.there is no dispute here as to the relevant facts,so the issue presented is one of law,a matter within our jurisdiction.
in henderson shinseki,the supreme court held that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with the veterans court under a does not have jurisdictional attributes,though t he day limit is nevertheless an important procedural rule,d.although the supreme court did not decide whether equitable tolling of the statutory deadline was available,see id.at,after henderson,we have held that the day deadline in a is subject to equitable tolling.see,sneed ii,at see also checo shinseki.
a litigant seeking equitable tolling bears the burden of establishing two elements that he has been pursuing his rights diligently,and that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.sneed ii,at quoting pace diguglielmo,d see also menominee indian tribe of united states,d explaining that the diligence prong covers those affairs within the litigant control the prong,by contrast,is meant to cover matters outside its control.equitable tolling two components are elements,not merely factors of indeterminate or commensurable weight.menominee indian tribe.at citation omitted.
although attorney abandonment may support equitable tolling attorney negligence is not sufficient to justify equitable tolling.to the contrary,the client is normally responsible for the malfeasance of the attorney,and in such cases has a malpractice remedy,not a tolling remedy.see maples thomas,d u nder principles of agency law,the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent.internal quotation marks and citation omitted.equitable tolling does not extend to a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,such as a simple miscalculation that leads a lawyer to miss a filing deadline.sneed ii,at quoting holland florida,d the supreme court has held,for example,that a litigant failure to file a title vii claim within the statutory period set by c after receipt of an eeoc decision can not be excused based on her lawyer absence from his office at the time that the agency notice was received.irwin dep t of veterans affairs,d.attorney abandonment,under which a client can not be charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who has abandoned him,maples.at,is a narrow exception to the usual rule.
the veterans court found that attorney abandonment had not been established because an relationship did not exist between sneed and eagle.l acking from sneed was any d
