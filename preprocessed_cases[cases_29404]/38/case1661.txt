an administrative law judge ruled that defendant california public employees retirement system calpers had underpaid retirement benefits to clarence alexander and his widow by more than million plus interest.calpers rejected this proposed decision and opted to decide the case itself upon the record,including the transcript.plaintiffs,who are pursuing the claim on behalf of alexander heirs,subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandate,asserting that the proposed decision must be deemed adopted because calpers failed to order a transcript within days of rejecting the proposed decision and did not timely issue its own decision.the trial court agreed that calpers had violated the time lines established by the administrative procedures act,et,specifically,government code section,and issued the requested relief.unspecified section references that follow are to the government code.
on appeal,calpers asserts that the trial court misconstrued the timelines and that its actions were timely.we affirm the judgment.
in order to set the context for this appeal,we outline the relevant provisions of section,the statute that establishes the procedures for deciding contested administrative cases.
under these provisions,cases may be heard before an administrative law judge alj or an agency,subd.a,b.if an agency hears the matter,it must issue its decision within days of submission of the case,subd.b.if the matter is heard before an administrative law judge,a series of time lines come into play,and it is these timeframes that are critical to this appeal.
within days after the case is submitted,the alj must prepare a proposed decision in a form that may be adopted by the agency as the final decision in the case,subd.c.within days of receipt by the agency of the alj proposed decision,the agency may act in one of five ways adopt the proposed decision in its entirety,subd.c a,reduce or mitigate the penalty but otherwise adopt the decision,subd.c b,make technical or minor changes to the decision,subd.c c,reject the proposed decision and refer the matter back to the alj,subd.c d,or reject the proposed decision and decide the case upon the record,include the transcript,or upon an agreed statement of the parties,with or without taking additional evidence,subd.c e.
if an agency elects this last option,the agency shall issue its final decision not later than days after rejection of the proposed decision.if the agency elects to proceed under this subparagraph,and has ordered a transcript of the proceedings before the administrative law judge,the agency shall issue its final decision not later than days after receipt of the transcript.if the agency finds that further delay is required by special circumstance,it shall issue an order delaying the decision for no more than days and specifying the reasons therefor,subd.c e iv.
if within days of receipt of the proposed decision the agency fails to act in the manner outlined for any one of the five possible options adoption,mitigation of penalty,minor changes,reference to an alj,or deciding the matter itself,the proposed decision shall be deemed adopted by the agency,subd.c.
we will discuss these provisions in greater length later in our opinion,but turn now to the chronology of events in the case before us.
facts and proceedings 
as the trial court described,t his action arises out of a dispute regarding the amount of retirement benefits payable by the legislators retirement system lrs to frances alexander as the surviving spouse of clarence alexander.clarence alexander started working for the state of california in.he retired in as the secretary of the california senate with years of service credited under the lrs.upon his retirement,alexander received a monthly retirement allowance until his death in at which time,a monthly death benefit became payable to his then surviving spouse,frances alexander.alexander continued to receive a monthly survivor benefit until her death in late.
in,alexander learned that calpers might have miscalculated her husband retirement benefits.she filed a claim,calpers denied it,and she appealed.since her death,alexander appeal has been pursued by the alexander family trust and karen matus,individually and in her representative capacities as trustee of the alexander family trust,executor of the estate of alexander,and personal representative of and alexander.
after an evidentiary hearing,an alj issued a proposed decision in favor of alexander,awarding her plus six percent interest,a total of more than million.calpers received this proposed decision on may,and on june,well within the limit required by section,subdivision c,voted to reject the proposed decision and decide the matter itself based on the administrative record,including the transcripts.
calpers also decided to seek an opinion from the legislative counsel about the relevant retirement formulas.however,it did not formulate its request and present it to a legislator until october.because it was not sure when the legislator would be able to request that opinion or when the opinion would be issued,and because it knew that the period for a decision would begin to run from the date it received the transcript of the administrative proceedings,calpers intentionally delayed ordering the transcript.
on october,five months after it had received the alj proposed decision and nearly four months after rejecting that decision,calpers ordered a transcript,but mistakenly directed its request to the office of administrative hearings oah.transcripts were to be ordered from the reporter,not oah,and it is unclear why this occurred.in fact,the alj had notified the parties at the conclusion of the hearing that transcripts could be ordered from the reporter and he had given them the relevant contact information.the record indicates that both plaintiffs and calpers communicated with the reporter between may and august of.for whatever reason,calpers did not order the transcript from the reporter until november.
calpers received the transcript one week later,on november,an event that the agency believed triggered the start of the period for its decision,which would be due by february.calpers could not get the matter onto its december meeting agenda,and there was no regularly scheduled meeting in january.due to holidays,the february meeting was scheduled for february,days after the transcript was received.the board therefore passed a resolution on december,citing these special circumstances and ordering a delay of it decision by days as permitted under section,subdivision c e iv.
plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of mandate,seeking a stay of proceedings and asserting that the proposed decision must be deemed adopted.they argued that while an agency has days from the receipt of a transcript to issue its decision and may under proper circumstances be entitled to an additional days,the agency can not delay ordering the transcripts indefinitely.they asserted that the time limits outlined under section require an agency to order the transcript within the initial period and that calpers failure to meet these timelines meant that the alj proposed decision must be deemed adopted.
the trial court agreed.the court reviewed the language of section,subdivision c e iv and determined that this provision contains two alternative provisions.an agency must issue its final decision not later than days after rejection of the proposed decision or,if the agency has ordered a transcript of the proceedings,within days of the receipt of that transcript.
the court then turned to the question of when a transcript must be ordered.it concluded that while a transcript did not have to be ordered before an agency decided whether to accept,modify,or reject a proposed decision,the grammar of the statute and the legislative intent did not give an agency an indefinite period of time of administrative limbo in which to order a transcript.the court stated 
in the court view,the legislature intended agencies to order a transcript no later than days after the rejection of the proposed decision.this conclusion is based on the language and structure of the first two sentences in subdivision c e i
