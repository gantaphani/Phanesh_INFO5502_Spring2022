jurisdiction 
jurisdiction in the district court was proper based upon g and c.jurisdiction on appeal is proper based upon.the notice of appeal was timely filed pursuant to fed.a.
background 
prior to her application for benefits,claimant past work experience consisted entirely of waitressing from july to october,performing janitorial work from october until february,clerking in a retail store from december until december,and parking cars as a valet from august until december.claimant filed for ssi benefits in october alleging an inability to work since october as a result of chronic lower back problems.the ssa initially denied claimant application for benefits,and again denied benefits following a requested hearing before an alj.the ssa appeals council subsequently affirmed the denial of benefits,and pursuant to g,claimant appealed that decision in federal district court.
the ssa record documents claimant treatment for back pain from may until june.over that period,claimant received continuous treatment from her primary care physician as well as several specialists.following injuries in october and december,claimant complained of back and leg pain.claimant complaints continued even after she had back surgery to repair a herniated disc in july.in january,claimant became pregnant,which exacerbated her back pain and prompted difficulty sleeping.during her pregnancy,in august,claimant sought emergency room treatment for elevated back pain after doing strenuous lifting during a move.in september,claimant delivered her baby.at that time,an revealed a slight narrowing of disc space at three places in her spine compared to an taken a year earlier.
throughout the course of claimant medical treatment,she repeatedly was prescribed painkillers as well as physical therapy exercises,which she admitted neglecting.beginning in october,claimant began taking diet pills in an effort to lose weight to alleviate some of her back pain.in december,claimant primary physician noted that claimant was becoming depressed as a result of her inability to lose weight in addition to her chronic back pain,and he prescribed prozac.claimant discontinued the diet pills because they conflicted with the prozac.later,in april,claimant stopped taking the prozac and resumed taking diet pills.
in january,claimant was examined by mcguire,an orthopaedic surgeon,who diagnosed her with mild sciatica.mcguire did not credit claimant pain complaints,believing instead that she inaccurately perceived her pain and magnified her symptoms.in addition,he refused to perform another surgery on the basis of her pain complaints and prescribed physical therapy instead.
in april,eva christiansen,performed a psychological evaluation on claimant at the request of the disability determination service.during the session,she noted that claimant complained of pain and alternated sitting and standing.the test results showed a verbal iq of,a performance iq of,and a full scale iq of,which placed claimant overall level of functioning in the borderline range.christiansen concluded that claimant would be able to adequately remember and understand instructions to perform basic tasks and some routine and modeled concrete tasks,her judgment was adequate for basic tasks and pace was not a problem,changes in the workplace might require additional adjustment time,and claimant attention and concentration might vary depending upon her pain.
in july,claimant consulted allaire,who performed a physical exam and found essentially normal results demonstrating claimant ability to walk on her heels and toes without pain,her ability to perform deep knee bends,full range of motion in her lumbar region,no gross sensory deficits,no muscle atrophy,and normal strength testing in the lower extremities.allaire performed a lumbar caudal epidural steroid injection to reduce inflammation,after which claimant felt significant relief.in september,claimant was examined by hitchon,another back specialist.again,her test results were essentially normal,except for slightly diminished sensory perception on her right side.
in october,claimant began a treatment program at a pain clinic,where she received pain management lessons.in addition,she was injected with pain medication at multiple trigger points and her sleeping pill dosage was increased.her doctor at the pain clinic,blessman,believed that her pain was manageable through medication,although he questioned claimant emotional stability.in january,david boarini,who had treated claimant for back problems since,examined claimant and found no objective medical evidence to account for her pain complaints,and suggested that she exercise and lose weight.
at claimant ssa disability hearing,held in february,claimant testified that she had experienced continuous pain since and that it had become so severe that she could no longer find relief or concentrate on anything.claimant further testified that she was essentially unable to care for her four in age from thirteen years old to seventeen months the help of her husband and the children themselves.she explained that she does drive a car,but prefers not to because she does not like to sit down,and that shopping and housecleaning frequently were done by others.the hearing record reflected that claimant alternated sitting and standing at two to three minute intervals,which she indicated was customary.claimant also testified that she had to lie down up to six hours during each day to relieve her pain.she estimated that she could stand for no more than ten minutes at a time,and asserted that she followed her prescribed physical therapy exercise program.she claimed that she could not lift more than a gallon of milk at a time,and that she could not perform the demands of any of her past work because she could not stand,lift or move about as required.
at the time of the hearing,claimant was years old.claimant testified that she had taken special education classes at school,where she had problems with math.during the hearing she could not perform simple subtraction or division in her head.lois smidt,a family development specialist,testified that she had visited claimant two or three times a month for two years and observed claimant difficulty reading as well as her manifestations of pain,including getting up and down,wincing,and lying down.in early july,smidt saw claimant on the floor in pain and helped her get treatment.
after the hearing,claimant submitted records of her continuing medical treatment,including reports of more trigger point injections in march and april,and mcguire decision to perform the back surgery he had previously refused.on june,the alj issued the decision to deny ssi benefits based upon the lack of credibility of claimant pain complaints coupled with the lack of objective medical evidence in the record to substantiate those pain complaints.on june,the district court affirmed the decision of the ssa,finding sufficient evidence in the record to support the alj credibility determination.this appeal followed.
discussion 
evaluation of subjective pain complaints 
claimant contends that the alj improperly evaluated her subjective complaints of back pain by erroneously requiring objective medical evidence to substantiate the severity of her pain.claimant argues that the alj decision conflicts with this court holding in polaski heckler,cir polaski,which does not require direct medical evidence of the cause and effect relationship between the impairment
