introduction 
in,the state contracted with the university of california,los angeles medical center ucla that ucla be the sole provider of medical services to beneficiaries in los angeles.with the state approval,ucla subsequently delegated to medical center the right to provide inpatient services to certain beneficiaries and to bill the state for those services under ucla contract rate.the delegation contract was later amended to expand the services could provide.for the next four years,instead of billing the state under ucla contract rate,billed and was paid under a higher cost rate for certain patients.later the state audits concluded that should have been paid ucla contract rate for treatment of these patients,and the state recouped more than million in overpayments.
filed administrative appeals of the audit findings,but contended that under welfare and institutions code section it was first entitled to judicial review of the terms of the contracts at issue.the administrative law judge disagreed,proceeded with the hearings,and denied the appeals.
then filed a petition for writ of mandate against the director of the california department of health services and the department itself collectively the department.the trial court affirmed the administrative findings,but reduced the recouped amount by the statutory penalty of ten percent under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d.we affirm.
factual and procedural background 
the reimbursement program 
california program implements the federal medicaid program,which funds medical services for elderly and persons.et welf.the department administers the program and reimburses hospitals for treating eligible patients.welf,tit.the original federal medicaid act required states to reimburse hospitals for their reasonable cost of treating patients,which included the cost of services actually incurred by a hospital provider and otherwise allowable under medicare.robert kennedy medical center belsché cal th,d.in the early,congress limited the reimbursement to the costs that would have been incurred by an efficient and economically operated facility,even if a provider actual costs were greater.id.at,d,tit.
in,the california legislature moved away from a pure system and established a program by which the department could contract with individual hospitals for the exclusive right to treat patients.welf.the california medical assistance commission cmac,acting on behalf of the department,drafted a master contract and negotiated directly with hospitals or held competitive bidding.see welf.to maintain consistency in administration of the program,cmac took the position that material deviations from the master contract would be allowed only in the areas of contractual rates and identified services to be provided by a specific hospital.a hospital awarded a selective provider contract is reimbursed by the department at the negotiated contract rate,which is often a per diem rate.welf.after the department contracts with a sufficient number of hospitals to meet the needs of beneficiaries in a geographic area,it declares the area closed and awards no further contracts.welf.
with limited exceptions,noncontract hospitals in a closed area are generally not entitled to reimbursement for treating patients.these exceptions include providing emergency care to a patient,so long as the patient is transferred to a contract hospital once stabilized welf,providing services to a patient whose eligibility for was unknown at the time of admission patients,tit,subd.b,subd.c f and providing services to a patient receiving prior authorization from california children services ccs patients,tit,health,et.noncontract hospitals treating patients pursuant to one of the exceptions are paid a cost rate,which is generally higher than a contract rate,tit.
noncontract hospitals submit annual reports of their actual costs,which the department uses to generate a tentative settlement statement.robert kennedy medical center belshé,supra,cal th at,d,fountain valley regional hospital medical center bontá th,d.the department then has three years in which to conduct an audit,after which it issues a final audit report and settlement which determines the hospital allowable costs for services to patients for the pertinent fiscal year.welf,et fountain valley regional hospital medical center bontá,supra,at,d.contract hospitals also file costs reports and are subject to audit by the department,but such audits focus primarily on the number of days of care rendered,as opposed to complex cost reporting issues.
the prime contract 
in,the state awarded ucla a selective provider contract to render inpatient hospital services to any eligible beneficiary the prime contract.the prime contract defined beneficiary to include not only a patient who was eligible for at the time of admission,but also persons whose eligibility was not determined until after inpatient services were rendered,patients the definition of beneficiary was standard language in the selective provider contracts and was not negotiable.the prime contract provided that ucla would receive a specified per diem rate for treating patients.no other hospital in los angeles was awarded a selective provider contract.as a result of the prime contract,ucla became a provider,and los angeles was declared a closed area.
the delegation contract 
as a noncontract hospital in a closed area,could not receive reimbursement for patients treated at its outpatient ambulatory care clinic acc who were later admitted for inpatient treatment.was forced to turn away large numbers of patients seeking outpatient treatment at the acc.not only did this negatively impact the patients,it also negatively impacted a teaching program.as a teaching affiliate of ucla,allowed ucla medical students to serve as clinical clerks at the acc and to rotate through patient specialties to provide continuity of care to the acc patients later admitted to.
with the approval of the department,ucla and entered into a delegation contract which allowed to receive reimbursement for treatment of the acc patients under ucla prime contract.the delegation contract became effective august,and was the first of its kind in the state 
the delegation contract provided shall provide acute inpatient care to patients who are registered in the ambulatory care center clinic and determined to require inpatient care in areas of medicine,surgery,pediatrics,neonatology intensive care and intermediate neonatal nursery services and nursery on behalf of ucla,and shall receive payment from ucla pursuant to this agreement only when such patients are prior authorized in writing treatment authorization request or by telephone log number by the department of health services on admission of the patient to.the delegation contract provided that would be paid the same per diem rate that ucla received under the prime contract.
the parties agreed that the delegation contract was to be governed by and construed in accordance with all applicable laws,regulations and provisions of the prime contract,and obligations of ucla under the prime contract.the delegation contract provided that either party could terminate the contract without cause at any time by giving written notice to the other party no later than days prior to the effective date of termination.
and ucla operated under the delegation contract for eight years.although the delegation contract required to bill ucla for reimbursement of inpatient treatment of prior authorized acc patients,apparently billed the department directly under ucla contract provider number and received ucla contract rate.the department continued to pay at the cost rate for its treatment of emergency room,and ccs patients.
the delegation amendment 
by,ucla needed relief from its increased patient load and needed relief from the administrative burden of having to transfer stabilized patients.in response,the cmac drafted amendment to the delegation contract.ucla,and the department signed the amendment,which became effective may,delegation amendment.
the delegation amendment recited that it was negotiated in order to expand the services provided under the contract of delegation to meet the needs of beneficiaries located within the geographic area served by.the delegation amendment provided the following services which are also available at ucla may also be performed at pursuant to the terms of the contract of delegation and this amendment and shall include obstetrical services neonatal intensive care services pediatric services pediatric intensive care services services to beneficiaries in aids program services to beneficiaries admitted through emergency department major organ transplant services 
the delegation amendment further provided that ucla and covenant that the contract of delegation and this amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and ucla obligations under the prime contract and all amendments thereto,and that a ll other terms and provisions of the contract of delegation shall remain in full force and effect except as expressly modified 
the delegation amendment remained in effect from to.in,the department awarded its own selective provider contract and became a provider.
the audits 
in april,the department conducted its first audit of performance under the delegation amendment.the audit covered fiscal period from april,to march,and included ten months of performance under the delegation amendment.was identified as a noncontract provider and the department approved reimbursement for treatment of and ccs patients.
in,the department conducted an audit covering performance during its fiscal period and determined that was entitled to reimbursement for treating and ccs patients rather than the approved in the previous audit.the department took the position that by signing the delegation amendment,had become a de facto contract hospital entitled to receive the same rate that ucla received for treating and ccs patients.the department then reopened the audit and adjusted its findings consistent with its position.the department took the same position in its subsequent audits of the through fiscal periods the department concluded that by paying at the cost rate it had overpaid approximately million.this amount was the difference between the contract rate and the reimbursements had claimed in its cost reports.
the administrative proceedings 
filed administrative appeals from each of the department audit findings.it initially contended that the department office of administrative appeals lacked jurisdiction to interpret the terms of the contracts at issue,and argued that was entitled to judicial interpretation in the first instance under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a.the administrative law judge alj disagreed,and administrative hearings were held on may.
the alj ordered the parties to submit posthearing briefs by august,and rebuttal briefs by september.the parties submitted their final briefs on september.on july,days alj issued his proposed decision,announcing for the first time that the record had been closed on october.the alj denied the appeals and upheld the audits,making the following findings the definition of beneficiary in the prime contract was incorporated into the delegation contract and the delegation amendment the language in the prime contract stating that a beneficiary included a patient was clear and unambiguous because ucla was paid the contract rate for treating patients,should be paid the same rate for treating the same patients and there was no mutual mistake.on july,the department adopted the proposed decision as its final decision.
the trial court proceedings 
filed a petition for writ of mandate and a complaint against the department for declaratory relief,breach of contract and reformation.three years later,prior to any proceedings on the writ petition or complaint,filed a motion for trial de novo,arguing that the administrative tribunal lacked jurisdiction to interpret the terms of the contracts under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a and that was entitled to judicial review under code of civil procedure section without regard to the administrative record.the trial court denied the motion,finding that subdivision a of welfare and institutions code section was not applicable,and stated that it would proceed under code of civil procedure section based on the administrative record.then filed a memorandum of points and authorities in support of its petition for writ of mandate,which the department opposed.
in ruling on the petition for writ of mandate,the trial court stated that because the facts here are not in dispute,this matter presents only questions of law,which are reviewed de novo.the trial court denied the writ petition to the extent it challenged the alj finding that the department was entitled to recoup its overpayment.specifically,the trial court agreed with the alj that the prime contract definition of beneficiary was unambiguous and that it was incorporated into the delegation contract and the delegation amendment.the trial court also concluded that there was no mutual mistake and that the department recoupment was not barred by laches or estoppel because its audits were timely performed.however,the trial court granted the petition to the extent it challenged the amount of the recoupment,finding that the department adoption of the alj proposed decision was untimely,and ordered the recouped amount to be decreased by the statutory penalty of ten percent.in light of its ruling,the court dismissed causes of action for declaratory relief,breach of contract and reformation and entered judgment accordingly.appeals the judgment.in a,the department challenges the trial court imposition of the statutory penalty.
discussion 
contentions on appeal 
contends that it was entitled to judicial review of the contracts at issue under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a prior to any administrative hearings the definition of beneficiary in the prime contract was not incorporated into the delegation amendment and the definition was ambiguous the delegation amendment should be reformed and the doctrines of laches and estoppel bar the department recoupment.
in its,the department contends that the recouped amount should not have been reduced under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision d because the department timely adopted the alj proposed decision.
ii.standard of review 
because pure questions of law were decided by the trial court upon undisputed facts in this mandamus proceeding,a de novo standard will apply on appeal.county of san diego state of california cal th,d,sierra vista regional medical center bontá th,d gai city of selma th,d.this standard is applicable to each of the issues presented here.see,silver los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority th,d statutory interpretation sierra vista regional medical center bontá,supra,at,d contract interpretation.while issues pertaining to the intention of the parties to a contract and laches and estoppel are ordinarily questions of fact,a de novo standard applies where the facts are undisputed.see winet price th,d driscoll city of los angeles cal d.
iii.judicial review of contract terms is not available for recoupment efforts based on an audit 
welfare and institutions code section provides in relevant part 
a notwithstanding any other provision of law,judicial review pursuant to section of the code of civil procedure,shall be available to resolve disputes relating to the terms,performance,or termination of contracts entered into pursuant to this article,or any act,failure to act,conduct,order,or decision of the special hospital negotiator or the commission which violate the provisions of this article.
b subdivision a shall not apply to recoupment efforts based on an audit or review of hospital performance of the terms and conditions of the negotiated contract.these recoupment efforts shall be reviewable pursuant to section.
in statutory construction cases,our fundamental task is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of the statute.citation.we begin by examining the statutory language,giving the words their usual and ordinary meaning.citation.if the terms of the statute are unambiguous,we presume the lawmakers meant what they said,and the plain meaning of the language governs.citations.estate of griswold cal th,d.an interpretation that renders related provisions nugatory must be avoided citation each sentence must be read not in isolation but in the light of the statutory scheme citation and if a statute is amenable to two alternative interpretations,the one that leads to the more reasonable result will be followed citation.lungren deukmejian cal d.at all times,o ur foremost task remains ascertainment of the legislative intent,including consideration of the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.citation.city of long beach california citizens for neighborhood empowerment th,d.
the trial court found that the plain language of subdivision b is that the subdivision a only applies where there are no recoupment efforts based on an audit.contends this finding was error.it argues that in order for an auditor to determine whether a hospital is perform ing the terms and conditions of a contract,the auditor must already know what those terms and conditions are,and that any interpretational dispute must have already been resolved.points out that no statutes or regulations grant auditors the power to interpret contracts 
while there is some logic to argument,we agree with the trial court that the plain language of subdivision b of welfare and institutions code section provides that judicial review is not available for recoupment efforts based on an audit of hospital performance of the terms and conditions of the negotiated contract.subdivision b makes clear that such recoupment efforts must be reviewed administratively prior to any judicial review.the statutory language is unambiguous in this regard.
further argues that because every audit examines the performance of the terms and conditions of the negotiated contract,the department could always avoid judicial review of contractual terms by simply waiting to raise them during an audit,in which case the exception in subdivision b would swallow the rule in subdivision a.we do not agree because it is clear that the department can not control when such an issue is raised.a dispute over contractual terms can arise prior to or outside the context of recoupment efforts based on an audit.indeed,here,the evidence shows that inquired of the department how to bill claims under the delegation amendment,but did not receive any guidance could have pursued the matter further,including filing an action in superior court for declaratory relief.it did not do so and elected to bill at the cost rate for and ccs patients under the delegation amendment.
our conclusion that judicial review is not available for recoupment efforts based on an audit comports with the entire scheme of law of which section is part.for the program to run smoothly and efficiently,there must be consistency in administration.recoupment efforts can involve complex accounting procedures that the department administrative tribunal is better suited to address than a court.additionally,recoupment efforts often take place years after performance under the contract at issue has been completed and can,as in this case,involve many years of performance.it is therefore reasonable that recoupment efforts,which are based on an audit or review of hospital performance of the terms and conditions of a negotiated contract,be reviewed in the first instance by the agency charged with administration of the program.but if there is a dispute between the parties as to terms of the contract involving ongoing or prospective performance outside of the recoupment process,judicial review is immediately available 
we therefore conclude that was not entitled to judicial review in the first instance and that the administrative tribunal had jurisdiction to interpret the contracts at issue.
iv.is limited to payment for and ccs patients 
the primary dispute here is whether is limited to payment for its treatment of and ccs patients under the delegation amendment,pursuant to which was authorized to perform services for beneficiaries admitted through its emergency room and aids program both the alj and the trial court concluded that was limited to payment,finding that the definition of beneficiary in the prime contract was incorporated into the delegation amendment and that the definition unambiguously included patients.in reaching this conclusion,the trial court did not consider extrinsic evidence.contends this ruling is erroneous for two reasons the prime contract definition of beneficiary was not incorporated into the delegation amendment,and the prime contract and the delegation amendment are replete with irreconcilable ambiguities.
principles of contract interpretation 
because resolution of this dispute involves contract interpretation,we begin by reviewing the controlling principles of contract interpretation.the basic goal of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties mutual intent at the time of contracting,bank of the west superior court cal th,d.when a contract is reduced to writing,the parties intention is determined from the writing alone,if possible.founding members of the newport beach country club newport beach country club,th,d founding members.the words of a contract are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense.
when a dispute arises over the meaning of contract language,the first question to be decided is whether the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged by the party.if it is not,the case is over.citation.if the court decides the language is reasonably susceptible to the interpretation urged,the court moves to the second question what did the parties intend the language to mean southern cal.edison superior court th,d oceanside,fidelity federal bank th,d.whether the contract is reasonably susceptible to a party interpretation can be determined from the language of the contract itself or from extrinsic evidence of the parties intent.southern cal.edison superior court,supra,at,d.extrinsic evidence can include the surrounding circumstances under which the parties negotiated or entered into the contract the object,nature and subject matter of the contract and the subsequent conduct of the parties,morey vannucci th,d.when no extrinsic evidence is introduced or the extrinsic evidence was not relied on by the trial court or is not in conflict,we independently construe the contract.founding members,supra,th at,d.
california recognizes the objective theory of contracts citation,under which i t is the objective intent,as evidenced by the words of the contract,rather than the subjective intent of one of the parties,that controls interpretation.founding members,supra,th at,d.the parties undisclosed intent or understanding is irrelevant to contract interpretation.ibid.
b.the delegation amendment incorporated the prime contract definition of beneficiary 
admits that the prime contract definition of beneficiary includes patients,but claims that the delegation amendment does not incorporate this definition.it points out that while the original delegation contract provided that it was to be governed by and construed in accordance with all applicable laws,regulations and provisions of the prime contract,the delegation amendment omits any reference to provisions of the prime contract.according to,such omission can only mean that the prime contract provisions were not incorporated into the delegation amendment and that the prime contract definition of beneficiary no longer controls.we disagree.
the delegation amendment provides in paragraph that it shall be governed by and construed in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and ucla obligations under the prime contract.one of ucla obligations under the prime contract at paragraph was to render specified inpatient services to any eligible beneficiary,including beneficiaries,and to accept a specified contract rate as payment for such services.paragraph of the delegation amendment further provides all other terms and provisions of the contract of delegation shall remain in full force and effect except as expressly modified by this amendment to contract of delegation,the delegation amendment did not expressly modify the definition of beneficiary.nor did the original delegation contract modify the definition of beneficiary,since that agreement only authorized to treat and be paid for a limited category of patients,prior authorized acc patients.the definition of beneficiary otherwise remained unchanged.thus,construing together paragraphs and of the delegation amendment,we conclude that the original definition of beneficiary in the prime contract was incorporated into the delegation amendment.
c.the contracts are not ambiguous 
argues that even if the delegation amendment does include the prime contract definition of beneficiary,its inclusion was at best ambiguous,so the contract must be construed against the department.claims that both contract language and extrinsic evidence support its interpretation that the delegation amendment excludes and ccs patients.
to support its position,points out that the prime contract does not employ the term beneficiary consistently.for example,while the definition of beneficiary includes patients,the prime contract obligated ucla to provide a written questionnaire to the beneficiary at the time of the beneficiary admission and to provide certain grievance procedures to beneficiaries.asserts that a hospital will not be able to comply with these requirements when the patient is because most such patients will have been discharged before their eligibility is determined.according to a literal reading of the contract language makes a single meaning of beneficiary impossible.
again we disagree.while some of the obligations the prime contract imposed on a provider might not have consistently applied to all beneficiaries,there is nothing in the express terms of the prime contract to suggest that a provider would not be paid the contract rate for treating beneficiaries.
also relies on the declaration of james foley,the cmac director of negotiations who was involved in the early development of the master contract form for the selective provider contracts.foley admitted that the beneficiary language of paragraph created unresolved inconsistencies when read in the context of other provisions of the master contract.but ignores foley remaining testimony that cmac negotiating position was that the language would not be changed and that it simply authorized payment to the contracting provider under circumstances in which the patient status was established only after admission.additionally,cmac senior negotiator,james ringrose,testified that while the definition of beneficiary was a sticking point in the early negotiations,it became much less of a problem in the operation of the contract as people became used to it.there is no evidence that ucla or the department ever interpreted the prime contract to exclude patients from reimbursement.
also argues that extrinsic evidence of the negotiations leading to the delegation contract highlight the contract ambiguities.it relies again on foley declaration,in which he stated that during the delegation contract negotiations there was no discussion of the definition of beneficiary that is contained in paragraph of the prime contract,or of the issue whether payment for patients would be governed by the delegation agreement.but,as the department points out,the delegation contract only covered a narrow category of authorized acc necessarily excluded patients.because patients were not covered by the delegation contract,evidence of the lack of any discussion of such patients is irrelevant.
also relies on evidence of the lack of any discussion of patients during negotiations of the delegation amendment.it cites to the declaration of joseph luevanos,who negotiated the delegation amendment on behalf of,in which he stated that he had no recollection of any discussion of patients during the negotiations.he further stated that had there been such discussions,it would have been position that such patients were not part of the delegation amendment since was already entitled to reimbursement for these patients.but a party undisclosed statements regarding intent or understanding of a contract are irrelevant to contract interpretation under the objective theory of contracts.founding members,supra,th at,d.
also relies on the testimony of cmac negotiator ringrose,who confirmed that there were no discussions of patients during the delegation amendment negotiations.but,again,it fails to cite to the remainder of his testimony that if the subject of patients had been raised,i do know what the department position would have been had it come up.thus,the absence of any discussion of patients during the negotiations does not convince us that the use of the term beneficiaries in the delegation amendment is reasonably susceptible of the interpretation urged by.see county coliseum,oakland raiders,d.unexpressed intentions during negotiations can not be used to interpret a contract.
also claims that its course of conduct under the delegation amendment supports its interpretation.a party conduct subsequent to the formation of a contract may be looked upon to determine the meaning of disputed contractual terms.oceanside,fidelity federal bank,supra,th at,d the conduct of the parties after the execution of the contract,and before any controversy arose,may be considered in order to attempt to ascertain the parties intention southern cal.edison superior court,supra,th at,d.according to witkin,the conduct of the parties may be,in effect,a practical construction thereof,for they are probably least likely to be mistaken as to the intent.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.contracts.
points out that for the four years it operated under the delegation amendment,it continued to request and receive payments from the department for treating and ccs patients.made these requests by submitting a treatment authorization request tar or to a field office.for and ccs patients,identified its noncontract hospital provider number and not ucla contract provider number.but sylvester davis,administrator of the los angeles field office,testified that when his office received a tar,b asically,the only issue we concerned with is whether it medically indicated and the administrative requirements are met.davis further testified that a tar authorization is not a guarantee of payment,that a disclaimer to that effect appears on the tar,and that any payment made is subject to later audit by the department.the department audit supervisor,robert gennuso,testified to the same effect.there was also no evidence that the field office was aware of the delegation amendment at the time it was approving the tars or in question.nor was there any evidence that the fiscal intermediary actually handling the payments made any determination as to the correct provider number.thus,routine approval of tars and submitted by under its noncontract provider number,and ongoing payment to under the identified noncontract number,do not support argument that the parties shared the same intent.
also relies on the department first audit of its performance under the delegation amendment.this audit was conducted in and reviewed fiscal period ending in march,which included the first ten months of performance under the delegation amendment.because that audit approved reimbursement for and ccs patients,argues that it is hard to imagine a more unequivocal endorsement of interpretation of the amended delegation contract.
we disagree for two reasons.first,there is no evidence in the record that the audit department was aware of the delegation amendment at the time it conducted the audit covering the fiscal period.second,even if there had been such evidence,the department did not continue to approve reimbursement for and ccs patients in each of its next audits.in its second audit of performance under the delegation amendment the audit,which covered fiscal period ending in march,the department determined that under the delegation amendment was only entitled to receive the same reimbursement ucla received for treating and ccs patients.the department then reopened its first audit and made adjustments for the overpayment.in each of its subsequent audits,the department continued to approve only reimbursement for and ccs patients.once again,we are not persuaded that evidence of the parties performance supports position.
we conclude that neither the language in any of the three contracts at issue nor the extrinsic evidence supports interpretation of the term beneficiary in the delegation amendment.the prime contract definition of beneficiary unambiguously included patients.because this definition remained unchanged and was incorporated into the delegation amendment,was limited to the contract rate for its treatment of patients.all of rights and duties under the delegation contract and the delegation amendment flowed from ucla rights and duties under the prime contract.in essence,is arguing that while ucla was obligated to receive payment for treating a or ccs patient,was nevertheless entitled to receive a higher noncontract rate for providing the very same service for the very same patient.the contract language is not reasonably susceptible of the interpretation urged.
v.there is no basis for reformation 
argues that if the prime contract definition of beneficiary is applicable to the delegation amendment,it fails to reflect the parties intentions and the delegation amendment must therefore be reformed.
a written contract may be reformed when,through a mutual mistake of the parties,or a mistake of one party,which the other at the time knew or suspected,the contract fails to express the intention of the parties.a court may consider extrinsic evidence in determining whether a mutual mistake has occurred.hess ford motor cal th,d.we have already concluded that the extrinsic evidence presented here does not support the parties mutual intention that the term beneficiary excluded and ccs patients.
nor is entitled to reformation of the delegation amendment on the basis of a unilateral mistake.reformation for unilateral mistake is not available unless the mistake of one party was known or suspected by the other party at the time of the execution of the document.city of cypress new amsterdam cas.d.there is no evidence that the department knew or suspected that intended the delegation amendment to exclude or ccs patients at the time the parties entered into the delegation amendment,since these topics were never discussed during the negotiations and never expressed its intention.indeed,ringrose testified that had the issue come up,he was not sure how the department would have responded.thus,there is no merit to claim for reformation.
vi.there is no basis for applying laches or estoppel 
argues that the doctrines of laches and estoppel bar the department recoupment.the trial court rejected these arguments,finding that the audits were timely performed under the terms of the prime contract and t he way the system is set up ensures that such review can only take place after the services have been rendered and reimbursed so that any delay here was not unreasonable.
laches is an equitable defense.it consists of a failure on the part of a plaintiff to assert his rights in a timely fashion accompanied by a period of delay with consequent results prejudicial to the defendant rouse underwood d.delay is not a bar unless it works to the disadvantage or prejudice of other parties.witkin,summary of cal.law ed.equity.under appropriate circumstances,the defense of laches may operate as a bar to a claim by a public administrative agency,such as the department,if the requirements of unreasonable delay and resulting prejudice are met.robert kennedy medical center belshé,supra,cal th at,fn,d,italics added.
we agree with the trial court that failed to establish an unreasonable delay by the department.contrary to argument,the department did not wait years to assert its interpretation of the term beneficiary.the parties performance for eight years under the original delegation contract is not relevant here because that agreement by its terms excluded patients,and no party has ever asserted otherwise.with respect to the delegation amendment,the department first real opportunity to review performance was during the audit process and not through the tar process as noted above,which takes place years after services have been rendered and reimbursed.for each of the audits at issue here,the department conducted its audit two years after the end of the fiscal period that it was auditing,and in some cases less than two years.see footnote,ante.welfare and institutions code section,subdivision a provides that a provider cost reports and related data shall be considered true and correct unless audited or reviewed within three years after the close of the period covered by the report,or after the date of submission of the original or amended report by the provider,whichever is later.has never claimed that these audits were untimely performed.and there is no evidence that the department auditors were aware of the delegation amendment at the time they conducted the first audit for the fiscal period.in connection with the next audit performed the following year,the department reopened the audit and determined that it had overpaid.under these circumstances,we find no unreasonable delay.
because we find no unreasonable delay,we need not reach the issue of prejudice.but were we to do so,we would find that has failed to show prejudice.it simply claims that i f the department had disclosed its interpretation even as late as the audit in,would have had the option of immediately terminating the delegation contract,thereby avoiding some million in recoupment for the and fiscal periods.but presented no evidence that it would have done so.
we also find that the doctrine of equitable estoppel is inapplicable here.the doctrine of equitable estoppel provides that a person may not deny the existence of a state of facts if he intentionally led another to believe a particular circumstance to be true and to rely upon such belief to his detriment.the elements of the doctrine are that the party to be estopped must be apprised of the facts he must intend that his conduct shall be acted upon,or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it was so intended the other party must be ignorant of the true state of facts and he must rely upon the conduct to his injury.citations.killian city and county of san francisco d.there is no basis for applying estoppel here because there is no evidence that the department intentionally misled to believe the delegation amendment did not cover and ccs patients.to argue otherwise,simply points to the tars that were routinely approved by the field offices and the department audit.but such action does not demonstrate intentional conduct on the part of the department to mislead.
vii.the recouped amount must be reduced by ten percent 
in its,the department challenges that portion of the judgment reducing the recouped amount by ten percent for the department failure to timely adopt the alj proposed decision.
under welfare and institutions code section,subdivision e a,a final decision in an institutional provider appeal shall be adopted within days after the closure of the record of the impartial hearing.this time limitation is mandatory.welf,subd.d.if the department fails to adopt a final decision within the deadline,the amount of any overpayment which is ultimately determined by the department to be due shall be reduced by percent for each period,or portion thereof,following the delay.ibid.
as noted above,the alj ordered the parties to submit posthearing briefs by august,and rebuttal briefs by september.both parties submitted their final briefs on september,and filed nothing further.the alj issued his proposed decision days later on july,announcing for the first time that t he record was closed on october.eight days later on july,the department adopted the alj proposed decision as its final decision.
the alj provided no explanation for its statement that the record closed days after the parties final submission of their briefs.without citation to any authority,the department argues that aljs,like any other judge,surely retain some discretion to decide when to close the record and that it was reasonable for the alj to hold the record open for two weeks to review the final briefs and determine that no other material would be needed.
the trial court rejected the department argument,holding that september,constituted the closing of the administrative record,in spite of the alj statement that it closed days later,because that was the last date on which material was admitted into the proceeding,and the department final decision issued on july,was days late.the trial court therefore ordered a ten percent reduction in the department recoupment.
the question to be resolved here is what does closure of the record mean in this context this phrase is not defined in the statute.as previously discussed,in construing a statute we must accord words their usual,ordinary,and common sense meaning based on the language the legislature used and the evident purpose for which the statute was adopted.in re rojas cal d.points to dictionary definitions closure means a bringing to an end,and record is the commitment to writing,as authentic evidence,of something having legal importance,esp.as evidence of the proceedings or verdict of a court.random house unabridged dictionary ed.also points out that similar variations of these definitions appear in regulatory definitions of administrative record,which generally include the presentation of written evidence and argument submitted to an adjudicatory body 
further points out that administrative law in california and other jurisdictions generally defines closure of the record to mean bringing the written record to an end.for instance,under the division of workers compensation rules,a case is submitted upon the closing of the record for the receipt of further evidence or argument,tit,while hearing records before the victim compensation and government claims board close at the deadline for the submission of briefs,tit,likewise the date of final submission of evidence and argument in the context of arbitration constitutes record closure we conclude that the plain meaning of closure of the record is the date of the parties final submissions of written evidence or argument.
but even if we were to find this phrase to be ambiguous,legislative history supports our construction.english ikon business solutions,th,d courts may consult legislative history where statutory language ambiguous.the legislature enacted the deadline in because the administrative appeal process at the department had become unnecessarily lengthy and slow.rules,off.of floor analyses,on bill reg.sess.this resulted in extended uncertainty to providers.ibid.accordingly,the legislature established a deadline that only a provider can extend and that imposes a substantial penalty for department delay.welf,subd.d deadline to accept an alj decision can only be extended by d elay caused by a provider or e xtensions of time granted a provider at its sole request or at the joint request of the provider and the department.
the legislature goal can not be served unless the deadline is fixed and predictable.setting the last date of the parties final submissions as the triggering event for the deadline clock to start running provides that predictability.allowing a hearing officer to retroactively set the triggering event for the deadline clock,as the alj did here,would undermine the legislature stated intent to give providers a remedy for delay.in that case,there would be no way for anyone to know when the deadline clock started and no way for the beneficiary of the deadline to effectively enforce its rights.statutes should be construed consistent with the legislative goals and should not be interpreted to create rights without remedies.in re marriage of dandona araluce th,d.
we recognize that our interpretation means that the department here could never have timely accepted the alj decision because no decision was made within days of the closure of the record.but we believe that as between the department and the provider,the department should suffer the consequences of the alj delay.the legislature established the deadline to protect providers and to impose a duty of diligence on the department.the department is in a better position to address the possibility of delay since the department has the right and duty to establish administrative appeal processes to review grievances or complaints arising from the findings of an audit or examination.welf,subd.a.for example,a amendment to section that was sponsored by the department repealed a clause that had required aljs to provide proposed decisions within days of record closure.compare stats,ch,with stats,ch.we do not believe the legislature could have intended that providers,who have no power to enforce compliance apart from the deadline,should be penalized because the department failed to establish mechanisms to avoid delay.we therefore conclude that the trial court properly imposed the statutory penalty.
