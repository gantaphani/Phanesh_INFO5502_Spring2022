prior to,regulations promulgated by the office of personnel management opm instructed that the appropriate administrative authority of an agency,with the concurrence of opm,shall determine the applicability of retirement credit.see.those regulations did not address how or when an individual should request service credit from his or her employing agency.id.consistent with the regulations then in place,and to assist employees seeking to qualify,the agency at issue in this case,the department of interior,bureau of land management bureau or agency published instruction memoranda regarding enhanced annuity service credit.see bureau of land,dep t of interior,instruction memorandum,special retirement provisions for firefighters july,hereinafter the agency memorandum bureau of land,dep t of interior,instruction memorandum,requests for retirement under pl for law enforcement and firefighter personnel july,hereinafter the agency memorandum collectively the agency memoranda.these agency memoranda prescribe how an employee should request a verification of whether his or her service qualified for such credit,encourage all potentially eligible employees to request a verification of service,adopt forms for making a request for service credit,and urge employees to retain a copy of the request.see agency memoranda.

lengerich began work at the bureau,at its national center fire center in idaho,on may.in late and early,lengerich,along with other bureau employees,met with william mitchell mitchell,a technical representative also employed by the bureau at the fire center,to discuss whether their various past job duties at the bureau qualified for firefighter enhanced annuity service credit.mitchell authority in such matters was limited to assisting employees in providing required information to carmen simonson simonson,the personnel officer at the fire center responsible for fire center firefighter retirement cases.simonson,in turn,was one of several retirement coordinators,all of whom reported to,and provided the retirement information to,mary haugland haugland,the person ultimately in charge of all bureau firefighter enhanced annuity service credit cases.employees were instructed to refer specific questions to haugland.
lengerich contends that the meetings with mitchell took place on december,and in the spring of.mitchell can not recall the dates of the meetings,although he does recall meeting with a group of bureau employees on at least one occasion to discuss service credit toward an enhanced annuity.mitchell asserts that,because he had no direct responsibility for the preparation of claims for enhanced annuity service credit,he had a general discussion with the group of bureau employees.mitchell recalled that the group was seeking information as to what they must do to determine whether they might be eligible for an enhanced annuity and that,at the instruction of his supervisors,he relayed to the group certain information regarding the unlikelihood that their service would qualify.lengerich does not deny these facts,but characterizes the oral discussions as formal requests for enhanced annuity service credit.on august,and may,more than six years after her oral discussions with mitchell,lengerich filed written requests the written requests for enhanced annuity service credit,addressing them to haugland successor,marcia scifres.

at the request of the parties,the administrative judge aj bifurcated the case and,in the proceeding at issue here,considered only the timeliness of lengerich oral discussions and written requests.after a hearing,the aj credited both of lengerich written requests,concluding that she timely requested a determination with respect to service that preceded either of them by no more than one year.initial decision,slip op.at.however,the aj,like the agency,did not credit lengerich oral discussions,holding that requests for firefighter enhanced annuity service credit must be in writing and that lengerich oral discussions were,for that reason,not timely.id.at.the initial decision became the final decision of the board on october.lengerich appeals the timeliness determination of her oral requests to this court.we have jurisdiction under a.
