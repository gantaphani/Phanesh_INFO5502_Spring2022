igor zavalin appeals the district court judgment affirming the social security commissioner denial of supplemental security income disability benefits.the administrative law judge alj found that zavalin retains the residual functional capacity to perform simple,routine,or repetitive tasks.the alj further concluded that zavalin is not disabled because he is still able to perform two occupations,namely,cashier and surveillance system monitor.both of these occupations require the ability to perform level reasoning on the department of labor general education development scale,which is defined as the ability to follow written,oral,or diagrammatic instructions and to deal with problems involving several variables from a standardized situation.we hold that there is an apparent conflict between zavalin limitation to simple,routine,or repetitive tasks,on the one hand,and the demands of level reasoning,on the other hand.this conflict must be reconciled by the alj.because the alj failed to do so,we remand for further proceedings.
background 
zavalin,who was born in russia,has suffered from severe impairments since childhood.his diagnoses include cerebral palsy,a learning disorder,and a speech impairment that causes him to speak in a halting manner.he also has a history of a fracture in his right knee and atrophy of the right leg,which causes balance problems.
when zavalin was years old,he moved with his family to the united states,and he began receiving supplemental security income ssi disability benefits that same year.zavalin attended public schools and had an individualized education program consisting of both special education and mainstream classes with accommodations for his impairments,such as extra time so that he could work at his own pace.he did well,and eventually graduated from high school with a modified diploma in.
after zavalin turned in december,the social security administration ssa conducted a redetermination of his eligibility for benefits under the rules for determining disability for adults.zavalin requested review before an alj after the ssa administratively determined that he was no longer disabled.an alj held a hearing on september,at which she received testimony from witnesses,including a vocational expert who testified about potential occupations for zavalin.
the alj asked the vocational expert an extended hypothetical question in which she described a person with zavalin limitations,including the limitation that he can do simple jobs,and then inquired whether there are jobs in the national economy that such a person can do.the expert opined that a person with such limitations can perform two representative occupations defined by the department of labor dictionary of occupational titles the dot cashier and surveillance system monitor an employee who monitors video surveillance footage.the dot sets forth job requirements for both positions,including the necessary reasoning ability,which the dot measures on a scale.both cashier and surveillance system monitor require level reasoning,which is defined as the ability to deal with problems involving several concrete variables and apply commonsense understanding to carry out instructions furnished in written,oral,or diagrammatic form.however,the alj did not ask the vocational expert to explain how a person who can only do simple jobs because of impairments,including a learning disorder and cerebral palsy,could meet level reasoning requirements.
following the hearing,the alj issued a written decision on october.the alj analysis followed the sequential process for social security and ssi disability determinations.the alj skipped step one,which asks whether zavalin is presently working,because it is not relevant in age disability redeterminations.at step two,the alj found that zavalin suffers from several severe impairments cerebral palsy,a learning disorder,a history of right knee fracture,and atrophy of the right leg.at step three,the alj found that zavalin does not have an impairment listed in ssa regulations.step four,which determines whether zavalin could return to a previous occupation,did not apply.
at step five the only step at issue on appeal the alj analyzed whether zavalin has the capacity to work notwithstanding his severe impairments.the alj first assessed zavalin capability in light of his impairments.based on medical reports from doctors and health care professionals who had evaluated zavalin over the years,as well as zavalin testimony,the alj concluded that his ability is limited to simple,routine tasks and simple,repetitive tasks.the alj also found that he can use his arms with some limitations,has balance problems,can not climb ladders or ropes,and has a speech impairment.the alj then determined whether there are jobs in the national economy that zavalin can perform in light of his limitations,age,education,and lack of work experience.to make this determination,she relied on the vocational expert testimony that a person with zavalin limitations can perform cashier and surveillance system monitor work,and the dot job descriptions and requirements for these occupations.the alj concluded that zavalin is not disabled because he is capable of both identified occupations.in her decision,the alj did not explain whether zavalin possessed the reasoning ability required to perform these occupations,given his residual functional capacity of only simple,routine,or repetitive work.
after the ssa appeals council denied his request for review of the alj decision,zavalin sought judicial review in the district court.the district court summarily affirmed.this appeal followed.
jurisdiction and standard of review 
we have jurisdiction under.we review de novo the district court decision.molina astrue,cir.we review the commissioner disability decision to determine if it is supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole and whether it is based on proper legal standards.nyman heckler,cir.even when an alj commits an error of law,we must affirm if the error is harmless.molina,at.
discussion 
zavalin argues that at step five,the alj failed to reconcile an apparent conflict between his residual functional capacity and the reasoning requirements of the jobs identified by the alj.we agree.
we begin with the legal framework for step five at this step,the commissioner has the burden to identify specific jobs existing in substantial numbers in the national economy that a claimant can perform despite his identified limitations.johnson shalala,cir see also g.the alj first assesses a claimant residual functional capacity,defined as the most that a claimant can do despite physical and mental limitations caused by his impairments and related symptoms.a.the alj then considers potential occupations that the claimant may be able to perform.see.in making this determination,the alj relies on the dot,which is the ssa primary source of reliable job information regarding jobs that exist in the national economy.terry sullivan,cir see also,d.the dot describes the requirements for each listed occupation,including the necessary general educational development ged levels that is,aspects of education formal and informal required of the worker for satisfactory job performance.dot,app.c,wl ed.the ged levels includes the reasoning ability required to perform the job,ranging from level which requires the least reasoning ability to level which requires the most.see id.
in addition to the dot,the alj relies on the testimony of vocational experts who testify about specific occupations that a claimant can perform in light of his residual functional capacity.e valentine comm r soc.sec,cir.finally,to conclude the step five analysis,the alj determines whether,given the claimant residual functional capacity,age,education,and work experience,he actually can find some work in the national economy.valentine,at see also g.
when there is an apparent conflict between the vocational expert testimony and the dot for example,expert testimony that a claimant can perform an occupation involving dot requirements that appear more than the claimant can handle the alj is required to reconcile the inconsistency.massachi astrue,ci
