opinion of the court 
this case arises from the denial of tommaso fargnoli fargnoli application for disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act,act.fargnoli appeals the district court order granting summary judgment in favor of the commissioner of the social security administration the commissioner the district court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to g.our jurisdiction arises under.for the reasons set forth below,we will vacate the district court order and remand the case with instruction to return it to the commissioner for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
factual and procedural history 
fargnoli is an unskilled construction laborer with a fifth grade education.he was born in italy and came to the united states in at the age of seventeen.fargnoli applied for disability insurance benefits on october,alleging that as of may,he was disabled and unable to work due to a back injury.because of his limited work history,fargnoli date last insured was december.he was denied benefits initially and on reconsideration at fargnoli request,a hearing before an administrative law judge the alj was held on february.
fargnoli appeared at the hearing with his counsel and testified,with the assistance of an italian interpreter,about his back impairment.fargnoli testified that he suffers from severe low back pain and radicular pain primarily in the left leg but at times in the right leg.he also testified that he sometimes has problems with numbness in his left arm.when asked how his impairment affects his ability to work around the house,fargnoli testified that he has difficulty going up and down the stairs and is unable to do any household chores.he also testified that he has difficulty dressing because he can not bend over.with regard to work restrictions,he testified that his back injury limits him to lifting approximately five to ten pounds,sitting or standing for only ten to twenty minutes at a time,and walking the equivalent of only one to two blocks.further,he testified that although he occasionally drives,doing so is painful because he can not take his pain medication which makes him sleepy and dizzy.he testified that his medications at the time of the alj hearing were daypro,a nonsteroid,and ultram,a pain reliever.
the medical evidence of record,as developed before the alj,reflects that fargnoli had been continuously treated with two doctors since his may.dennis zaslow,an orthopedic surgeon,and max karpin,a neurosurgeon.zaslow saw fargnoli approximately once a month from september until approximately july.at fargnoli initial visit in september,zaslow diagnosed fargnoli with an acute lower dorsal and lumbar sprain and strain and lumbosacral somatic dysfunction.he stated that fargnoli range of motion in his lower back was poor,his gait was labored and he favored his left leg.further,he noted that fargnoli left shoulder was drooped lower than the right,his trunk was sidebent to the left and paravertebral spasms were seen in the lumbar muscles of the middle to lower back.finally,he indicated that straight leg raising was causing radicular pain in fargnoli left leg.based on his evaluations,zaslow stated that fargnoli could not work as of december,his date last insured.
zaslow treatment notes consistently document objective muscular symptoms associated with fargnoli back impairment,including his inability to perform or difficulty with squatting,bending,leg lifting,changing positions,sitting,standing and walking,his tender ness to palpitation and manipulation,and the often spastic condition of his low back.zaslow treatment notes also document the variability of fargnoli condition,which changed depending on various conditions,improved with prolonged periods of rest or immobilization and favorable weather,and worsened with periods of increased activity or occurrences of poor weather.
in january,fargnoli began treatment with karpin.at fargnoli initial visit,karpin reported that fargnoli had a labored gait,difficulty walking,was favoring the left lower extremity,and had limited flexion and paravertebral spasm.karpin diagnosis was status,low back syndrome,dorsolumbar sprain and strain and left lumbar radiculopathy.karpin reported similar findings until approximately november,when he noted that fargnoli was showing gradual improvement.karpin later treatment notes reflect his opinion that fargnoli suffered from chronic back pain that would improve and worsen periodically according to factors such as activity and weather,but would neither improve nor worsen on a permanent basis from continued medication and physical therapy.over the course of fargnoli treatment,karpin prescribed numerous medications.
the record reflects reports or mention of certain diagnostic tests,including an october emg of fargnoli left lower extremity,an october of his lumbar spine,and a thermogram.in his november,report,zaslow states that the emg was abnormal and notes that the findings were suggestive of radiculopathy at the region.further,he states that the showed degeneration of the disc and a strong possibility of a fracture of the anterior edge of the superior plateau of.finally,he notes that the thermogram was abnormal.a tomogram of the spine was performed in late to confirm the existence of a fracture.it indicated interosseous distal herniation of the lumbar spine,but no evidence of fracture.a february mri was performed that evidenced an abnormal disc intensity between with a high degree of suspicion of herniation and abnormal discs between,and.a january bone scan was reported by zaslow as being normal.although strongly recommended by both zaslow and karpin to confirm disc herniation,fargnoli would not agree to undergo a myelogram because of his fear of needles and invasive procedures.
additionally,the treatment notes of zaslow and karpin reflect that fargnoli has under gone physical therapy,varying from three times a week to one time a week,from after his accident until approximately september,although the treatment notes from his therapists are not included in the record 
on august,the alj issued an opinion denying fargnoli claim for disability insurance benefits,stating that the evidence of record does not reveal that the claimant condition was sufficiently severe to preclude him from performing at least light work the appeals council of the ssa declined further review on october,making the alj determination the final decision of the commissioner.
having exhausted his administrative remedies,fargnoli filed an action in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania seeking judicial review of the alj decision.the parties filed for summary judgment.the district court granted the commissioner request for summary judgment and denied fargnoli request.fargnoli appeals the district court decision.
ii.discussion 
standard of review.
although our review of the district court order for summary judgment is plenary,our review of the alj decision is more deferential as we deter mine whether there is substantial evidence to support the decision of the commissioner.knepp apfel,cir.substantial evidence has been defined as more than a mere scintilla.it means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate.plummer apfel,cir quoting ventura shalala,cir.where the alj findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence,we are bound by those findings,even if we would have decided the factual inquiry differently.hartranft apfel,cir.thus,the general issue before us is whether the alj finding that fargnoli was not disabled,and thus not entitled to disability insurance benefits,is supported by substantial evidence.
determination of disability 
under the social security act,a disability is established where the claimant demonstrates that there is some medically determinable basis for an impairment that prevents him from engaging in any substantial gainful activity for a statutory period.plummer,at quoting stunkard sec.of health human,cir see also a.a claimant is considered unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy d a.this disability determination is made by the commissioner based on a sequential evaluation process promulgated by the social security administration ssa.see.in plummer,this court set out the relevant steps as follows 
in step one,the commissioner must determine whether the claimant is currently engaging in substantial gainful activity.a.if a claimant is found to be engaged in substantial activity,the disability claim will be denied.bowen yuckert,d.in step two,the commissioner must determine whether the claimant is suffering from a severe impairment.c.if the claimant fails to show that her impairments are severe,she is ineligible for disability benefits.
in step three,the commissioner compares the medical evidence of the claimant impairment to a list of impairments presumed severe enough to preclude any gainful work.d.if a claimant does not suffer from a listed impairment or its equivalent,the analysis proceeds to steps four and five.step four requires the alj to consider whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity to perform her past relevant work.d.the claimant bears the burden of demonstrating an inability to return to her past relevant work.adorno shalala,cir.
if the claimant is unable to resume her former occupation,the evaluation moves to the final step.at this stage,the burden of production shifts to the commissioner,who must demonstrate the claimant is capable of performing other available work in order to deny a claim of disability.f.the alj must show there are other jobs existing in significant numbers in the national economy which the claimant can perform,consistent with her medical impairments,age,education,past work experience,and residual functional capacity.the alj must analyze the cumulative effect of all the claimant impairments in determining whether she is capable of per forming work and is not disabled.see.the alj will often seek the assistance of a vocational expert at this fifth step.see,sic podedworny harris,cir.
in this case,the alj undertook the sequential evaluation in determining that fargnoli was not disabled.the alj made the following findings fargnoli had not engaged in any substantial gainful activity since the alleged onset date of disability he suffers from a severe back impairment his back impairment,although severe,does not meet or equal the criteria of the listing of impairments set forth in pt,subpt.p,app.he retains the residual functional capacity to engage in light work,and therefore can not return to his past relevant work as a construction laborer because it is heavy work and based on his age,educational background,work experience,and limitations,the medical vocational guidelines the grids direct a finding of not disabled.see pt,subpt.p,app.the alj erred,fargnoli contends,at step four in determining that he retained the residual functional capacity to do light work.we agree 
step four evaluation residual functional capacity 
residual functional capacity is defined as that which an individual is still able to do despite the limitations caused by his or her impairment s.burnett comm r of soc.sec,cir quoting hartranft,at see also a.in this case,the alj deter mined that fargnoli had the residual functional capacity to perform light work.the ssa defines work as light when it 
involves lifting no more than pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to pounds.even though the weight lifted may be very little,a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing,or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.to be considered capable of performing a full or wide range or light work,you must have the ability to do substantially all of these activities.
b.the ssa has further explained that light work generally requires the ability to stand and carry weight for approximately six hours of an eight hour day.jesurum sec.of health human,cir citing social security ruling.
after reviewing the record,we find it impossible to determine whether the alj finding that fargnoli can perform light work is supported by substantial evidence.we are handicapped by the fact that the alj has failed to evaluate adequately all relevant evidence and to explain the basis of his conclusions and failed to explain his assessment of the credibility of,and weight given to,the medical evidence and opinions from fargnoli treating physicians that contradict the alj finding that fargnoli can perform light work.we therefore vacate the decision of the district court and remand with instruction to remand to the alj for further proceedings 
the alj must evaluate all the evidence and explain the basis for his conclusions.
the alj must consider all relevant evidence when determining an individual residual functional capacity in step four.see e,a,burnett,at.that evidence includes medical records,observations made during formal medical examinations,descriptions of limitations by the claimant and others,and observations of the claimant limitations by others.see a.moreover,the alj finding of residual functional capacity must be accompanied by a clear and satisfactory explication of the basis on which it rests.cotter harris,cir.in cotter,we explained that 
i n our view an examiner findings should be as comprehensive and analytical as feasible and,where appropriate,should include a statement of subordinate factual foundations on which ultimate factual conclusions are based,so that a reviewing court may know the basis for the decision.this is necessary so that the court may properly exercise its responsibility under g to determine if the secretary decision is supported by substantial evidence.
id.at quoting baerga richardson,cir.
the alj discussion of the relevant medical evidence in fargnoli case was limited to the following four paragraphs 
a medical report from zaslow,doctor of osteopathy,dated december,revealed that the claimant complained of increasing pain since his accident in may.zaslow stated a computerized tomography scan of the lumbar spine,done on october,indicated degeneration of the disc.a thermogram done on october,was reported as normal and showed nerve fiber involvement on the left side.an electromyography performed on october,showed evidence of radiculopathy.a medical report from zaslow,dated december,stated that a bone scan per formed on january,was completely normal.the claimant stated that he was able to stand for an hour and sit for several hours.
a report by karpin,dated december,stated that a magnetic resonance imaging showed abnormal disc intensity between,and abnormal disc between and,and to a lesser extent between,and.it was reported that the claimant refused to undergo a myelogram to confirm the findings and chose to continue with the conservative treatments for a while longer.karpin stated that the claimant has to maintain a calorie diet to lose weight in order to reduce the pressure on his back.
a report by zaslow,dated december,stated that the claimant complained about pain over the midline.there was considerable spasm of the back with the inability to flex forward.the claimant stated that he wanted a light duty job,but no light duty work was available for him.
a medical report by karpin,dated february,stated that the claimant was still having difficulty with his lower back,but was able to cope with the pain and discomfort as long as he took his muscle relaxant and.the claimant was maintained on robaxin,feldene and physical therapy 
in the passages quoted above,the alj describes four diagnostic tests and five treatment notes.yet our review of the record reflects over pages of relevant,probative treatment notes from zaslow and karpin detailing fargnoli medical condition and progress.the disparity between the actual record and the alj sparse synopsis of it makes it impossible for us to review the alj decision,for we can not tell if significant probative evidence was not credited or simply ignored.burnett,at quot
