steffan hobbs,by and through his parents as next friends,sued several employees of the new mexico human services department nmhsd following that agency denial of hobbs application for medicaid benefits.nmhsd denial turned on its determination that a certain trust was a countable resource because the trust was not being administered for hobbs sole benefit.hobbs advanced claims under alleging defendants violated his rights under the medicaid act and denied him due process by rejecting his application on the basis of unwritten,unascertainable standards.the district court agreed with defendants interpretation of the relevant statutes,concluded that hobbs rights had not been violated,and granted summary judgment to defendants.
we hold that the statutory provisions upon which hobbs relies do not confer private rights enforceable under.we further hold that defendants did not violate hobbs right to due process,but simply applied a sole benefit standard to the particular facts of his case.exercising jurisdiction under,we affirm the judgment of the district court.
hobbs was severely injured in an auto accident in when he was six years old.he suffered traumatic brain injury that required him to undergo two partial lobectomies.as a result of his injuries,hobbs is prone to seizures and requires significant assistance in daily activities such as eating and bathing.for purposes of the medicaid act,hobbs is disabled.see a.
in,hobbs and his parents entered into a million settlement agreement for injuries related to the accident.under the terms of that agreement,million was set aside for a special needs trust to benefit hobbs.a state court approved the creation of the steffan hobbs medicaid payback trust the trust on may.massmutual trust,serves as trustee,and hobbs is listed as the sole beneficiary.although the trust purports to be irrevocable,the trust agreement permits the trustee and the guardian to revoke this trust or amend the terms hereof.
the trust agreement specifies that it was established pursuant to d a and that its assets should not be deemed to be available to hobbs for purposes of supplemental security income ssi or medicaid eligibility.upon hobbs death,any funds remaining in the trust will be paid to state medicaid agencies,up to the amount hobbs received from those agencies.during hobbs lifetime,trust funds may be distributed for the benefit of hobbs.however,such distributions shall be limited to expenditures which shall not cause ineligibility for medicaid benefits if receiving medicaid or other benefits is in hobbs best interests as determined in the sole discretion of the trustee.the trust agreement further provides 
expenditures may be made directly to any of hobbs family members,or any other person who takes hobbs into his or her home or provides special care or attention to him,to compensate such person for the reasonable value of services provided and to reimburse such person for costs associated with shelter,care,or attention.
from the trust corpus,was used to purchase an annuity,which provides the trust with gradually increasing monthly payments.as of november,the annuity provided monthly income of to the trust.the primary outlay from the trust is payment to hobbs for extraordinary care provided to steffan hobbs.hobbs helps her son with dressing and bathing,and she monitors him for seizures.she also transports him to and from school and has helped train school personnel to deal with hobbs injury.hobbs receives a payment from the trust that,as of november,equaled per installment.trust funds have also been used to purchase a interest in the hobbs land and home,home furnishings,homeowner insurance,home maintenance and improvement,and life insurance on hobbs parents.
in,hobbs applied to medicaid medically fragile waiver program the program.that program provides home care services to medicaid recipients with serious medical needs.at the time he applied,hobbs was receiving supplemental security income ssi and ssi medicaid.new mexico department of health determined that hobbs was medically eligible for the program and reserved a slot for him pending determination of his financial eligibility.joey kellenaers,a management analyst at nmhsd,was responsible for determining whether hobbs trust constituted a countable resource for medicaid eligibility purposes.consistent with nmhsd practice,kellenaers referred the trust to nmhsd office of general counsel,where assistant general counsel marsha zenderman reviewed it.
to be eligible for the program,an applicant must possess no more than in countable resources.certain trust assets,including those in a special needs trust,are not considered countable resources.d.a special needs trust is statutorily defined as 
a trust containing the assets of an individual under age who is disabled and which is established for the benefit of such individual by a parent,grandparent,legal guardian of the individual,or a court if the state will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of such individual up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual under a state plan under this subchapter.
following zenderman review of the trust and related documents,she determined that the trust was a countable resource.on april,zenderman wrote to hobbs personal injury attorney,stating that the use of trust funds has effectively disqualified your client from being eligible for medicaid.in particular,zenderman noted that 
under state medicaid policies,special needs trust funds may not be used,for example,to purchase land and a family home,pay property taxes and insurance on that home,pay for home furnishings unless related to the beneficiary disabilities,purchase farm animals and outbuildings,compensate a parent for taking care of her disabled child,pay the beneficiary personal income taxes,or pay advisory fees to the trustee affiliates.
although hobbs was not then eligible for the program,zenderman advised hobbs lawyer to take whatever legal steps are necessary to remedy these problems and provided a sample trust to assist hobbs in amending the trust so that it would meet state medicaid requirements.
after receiving this letter,hobbs new attorney contacted zenderman,and the two corresponded throughout the summer of.on july,zenderman sent a letter to hobbs counsel detailing her concerns with the trust.zenderman letter discussed specific provisions of the new mexico administrative code,the state medicaid manual,and the social security administration program operations manual system poms,considered several cases to which hobbs counsel had referred zenderman,and identified a number of problems with the trust as written.zenderman relied on sections of the state medicaid manual that require a special needs trust be for the sole benefit of a disabled individual,along with provisions defining that phrase.she also cited to a section of the poms that differentiates between compensation paid to care providers and that paid to family members.
following further correspondence,hobbs counsel requested that nmhsd issue a decision on hobbs application so that hobbs could obtain a fair hearing on the benefits denial.zenderman then conveyed this request to nmhsd officials.on october,nmhsd notified hobbs that his application for the program had been denied because t he value of your resources exceeds the program resource limit of,citing new mexico administrative code.
a hearing to review nmhsd determination began on april and continued on june.hobbs was represented by counsel throughout the hearing and was permitted to submit evidence.at the hearing,nmhsd bore the burden of proof to support its decision by a preponderance of the evidence.after considering the evidence,the administrative law judge alj recommended that the nmhsd decision to deny benefits be affirmed,concluding that the trust payments to hobbs for providing routine ongoing care were not for the sole benefit of hobbs.the alj expressly declined to rule on whether payments to a family member for performing the functions of a physical or other therapist,or perform ing skilled services would render the trust a countable resource.instead,the alj holding was limited to payments for care that hobbs was already legally obligated to provide as a parent.the nmhsd medical assistance division adopted the alj recommendation on december.hobbs then appealed this administrative determination in state court.
in october,the social security administration informed hobbs that his ssi payments would cease in october because he exceeded the resource limit of.because hobbs was no longer eligible for ssi,so too was he ineligible for the ssi medicaid benefits he had been collecting.
hobbs,through his parents as next friends,filed the present suit in the district court for the district of new mexico on october.hobbs successfully moved to stay his state court administrative appeal pending the outcome of this federal suit.in his complaint,hobbs asserted claims against zenderman,kellenaers,and nmhsd secretary pamela hyde in both their individual and official capacities.proceeding under,hobbs alleged that defendants denied him procedural due process,substantive due process,and equal protection,and violated his rights under the medicaid statutes.with respect to these claims,hobbs sought monetary damages,both compensatory and punitive an injunction prohibiting the defendants from treating the trust as a countable resource or requiring amendments to the trust and declaratory relief holding that the trust complies with d,that hobbs is entitled to use trust funds for the purposes challenged by nmhsd,and that hobbs was categorically eligible for medicaid due to his status as an ssi recipient.hobbs also brought a claim against zenderman for chilling his first amendment right to petition for a redress of grievances,seeking compensatory and punitive damages 
both parties moved for summary judgment.in an order granting summary judgment to defendants,the district court concluded that nmhsd may review the manner in which a special needs trust is administered to determine medicaid eligibility and that hobbs had been afforded due process.with respect to hobbs argument that he was categorically eligible for medicaid based on his ssi benefits,the court ruled that hobbs presented no admissible evidence that the social security administration considered his trust a resource.finally,the district court held that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity regardless of the merits determination because there was no clearly established law on point.after the district court dismissed each of his claims,hobbs timely appealed.
before proceeding to the merits,we note that this appeal does not present the primary issue the district court decided.as the district court put it,the key question in this case is whether a state has authority to assess the administration of a trust in determining medicaid eligibility of the trust beneficiary.hobbs argued that under the plain text of d a,nmhsd could review whether the trust had been initially established for hobbs benefit,but could not consider how the trust was later administered.in granting summary judgment to the defendants,the district court rejected this argument,concluding that the statute was ambiguous and that congress intended states to review the administration of special needs trusts.
on appeal,hobbs challenged that ruling in his opening brief,arguing that the district court conclusion that the word established as used in d a meant administered was in error.appellant br.at.the response briefs from the defendants and from several states,as amici,focused on this question of statutory interpretation.in his reply brief,however,hobbs affirmatively concedes the matter,stating 
the issue is not whether states have the authority to evaluate and assess the administration of a special needs trust,or to place restrictions on what special needs funds may be used for,in determining medicaid eligibility.in fact,plaintiff does not contest the states authority to do so in this appeal.rather,the issue presented here involves how the state must carry out its eligibility determinations,and whether it can exercise such authority in the absence of written policies and ascertainable standards in determining plaintiff medicaid eligibility.
appellant reply br.at.given this concession,we are in the somewhat unusual position of assuming without deciding that the statute at issue permits states to evaluate and assess the administration of a special needs trust,and to place restrictions on what special needs funds may be used for,in determining medicaid eligibility.id.
we further note that this case is not an appeal of nmhsd denial of benefits to hobbs.nmhsd is not a party to this case.rather,pursuant to new mexico statutes and,hobbs has a direct appeal of the nmhsd decision currently pending in new mexico state court.hobbs is free to contest the manner in which nmhsd applied d a for the benefit of standard to his its treatment of payments to a minor that case.
rather than challenging states authority to monitor the administration of special needs trusts or appealing the nmhsd denial,hobbs raises several other contentions before us.first,he alleges that his special needs trust met the requirements of d a,excluding it from consideration for medicaid eligibility.next,he asserts that the state violated a because it imposed a standard more restrictive than that applicable to ssi eligibility to determine whether the trust was a countable resource for medicaid purposes.lastly,hobbs argues that nmhsd violated his substantive and procedural due process rights by rendering standardless,ad hoc determinations regarding his medicaid eligibility.
we review a grant of summary judgment de novo,applying the same standard as the district court.weigel broad,cir.summary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,the discovery and disclosure materials on file,and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.c.in making this determination,w e view the evidence and draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.weigel,at quotation omitted.
we consider first whether the statutory provisions at issue provide hobbs a right of action cognizable under hobbs seeks enforcement of three provisions of the social security act d a,a c i,and a.
it is well established that some statutory rights may be enforced via.gonzaga doe,d collecting cases.as in the implied right of action context,the primary question in determining whether a statute will support a claim under is whether congress intended to confer individual rights upon a class of beneficiaries.id.at.we examine three factors in making this determination 
first,congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.second,the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial competence.third,the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the states.in other words,the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory,terms.
blessing freestone,d quotation omitted.a statute embodies congressional intent to benefit the plaintiff only if it is phrased in terms of the persons benefited.gonzaga,at.
regarding hobbs claim under d a,we conclude that this statute can not support a claim because it does not unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the state,blessing,at.hobbs reads this provision as obligating states to exempt special needs trusts when making eligibility determinations and thus conferring a right on medicaid applicants to shield assets held in a special needs trust from being counted as resources.yet,the text of the statute and our case law belie his reading.
section requires states to count certain trust assets as resources available to an individual when determining medicaid eligibility.see d b i if funds from an irrevocable trust could be used for the benefit of the individual,such funds shall be considered resources available to the individual.section d exempts certain trusts,including special needs trusts,from that requirement.see keith rizzuto,cir.
interpreting the intersection of these two provisions,this court concluded in keith that congress required that states generally count trust assets and income for purposes of determining medicaid eligibility,but exempted d trusts from that requirement.thus,congress left the states free to decide whether and under what conditions to recognize such trusts.at.we thus held that states need not count d trusts for eligibility purposes,but nevertheless may opt to do so.id.emphases added.although the statute might have been read in the first instance to require states to exempt special needs trusts,that construction is foreclosed by our opinion in keith 
hobbs cites lewis rendell,d,a case in which the court determined d a does confer a private right of action.id.at.there,the court analogized to c d,which provides that an individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance if the state determines that the denial of eligibility would work an undue hardship.c,c d.noting that an earlier case found a private right of action under c d,the court expanded on that holding,reasoning that d a similarly refers to the eligibility for medicaid and provides that eligibility will not be affected by the existence of a special needs trust.lewis,d at quoting sullivan county of suffolk,d.as discussed above,however,this circuit does not interpret d as a mandatory provision.see keith,at.
hobbs citation to wong daines,d,is unavailing for the same reason.in that case,the district court concluded that d a unambiguously exempted all special needs trusts from eligibility determinations.id.at.based on that reading,the court held that d a is enforceable under.id.at.given this circuit prior holding that states have discretion to count d trusts as resources,keith,at,we are not free to adopt the reasoning contained in wong or lewis even if we were to agree with that approach.see,united states mitchell,cir we are bound by the precedent of prior panels absent en banc reconsideration or a superseding contrary decision by the supreme court.quotation omitted.
finally,hobbs relies on c b,which states that a n individual shall not be ineligible for medical assistance by reason of paragraph to the extent that the assets were transferred to a trust including a trust described in subsection d.c,c b,c b iv.the paragraph reference relates to a provision requiring states to deny medicaid coverage to individuals who dispose of assets for less than fair market value prior to applying for medicaid.c a.although subsection c b contains the type of mandatory language that might create a private right enforceable under,it is not at issue in this case.nmhsd did not deny hobbs application based on a determination that hobbs transferred assets into the trust for less than fair market value it did so because it found the trust was not being administered for hobbs sole benefit and was thus a countable resource.in other words,hobbs can not assert a c b claim because he was not deemed ineligible for medical assistance by reason of c.see c.
we are compelled to conclude that d a does not require states to exempt special needs trusts from medicaid eligibility determinations.see keith,at.it follows that the subsection confers no binding obligation on the states to exclude special needs trusts from medicaid eligibility consideration.accordingly,under the third prong of the blessing test,we hold that d a is not enforceable through.
hobbs claim under a c i and a the methodology provisions,leads to the same conclusion.section a requires that 
a state plan for medical assistance must if medical assistance is included for any group of individuals described in a include a description of the methodology to be employed in determining medicaid eligibility,which shall be no more restrictive than the methodology which would be employed under the supplemental security income program 
a,a c,a c i,a c i iii.a methodology is considered to be no more restrictive if,using the methodology,additional individuals may be eligible for medical assistance and no individuals who are otherwise eligible are made ineligible for such assistance.r b.further,state medicaid plans must 
include reasonable standards for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which provide for taking into account only such income and resources as would not be disregarded or set aside for future needs in determining the applicant eligibility for ssi aid assistance or benefits.
both methodology provisions fail the first prong of the blessing test.gonzaga university explained that the first prong requires an unambiguously conferred right,at,and that statutes must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited rather than speaking only in terms of institutional policy and practice,id.at.quotation omitted.statutes that focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create no implication of an intent to confer rights on a particular class of persons.alexander sandoval,d.
like the statute considered in gonzaga university,the methodology provisions contained in speak only to the administrator of a spending program.see a a state plan for medical assistance must.unlike some subsections of a,the methodology provisions do not phrase their directions to program administrators in terms of the persons benefited.their focus is removed from the interests of individual applicants and they clearly do not confer the sort of individual entitlement that is enforceable under.gonzaga,at.quoting blessing,at.
hobbs cites to numerous circuit cases that have found rights articulated in a enforceable under.each of those cases,however,dealt with a a i,which requires states to make medicaid available to all individuals who meet certain criteria see spry thompson,cir watson weeks,cir ex rel.dickson hood,cir sabree ex rel.sabree richman,cir pediatric specialty care.dep t of human,cir westside mothers haveman,cir miller ex rel.miller whitburn,cir.
hobbs,by contrast,relies on a c and a.unlike subsection a a,these methodology provisions are not phrased with an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.gonzaga,at.quotation omitted.central to subsection a a is its reference to all individuals.the methodology provisions contain no such language focusing on the benefited class.they mention individuals only tangentially.the first reference is included in a condition the methodology requirement only applies if medical assistance is included in the state plan for any group of individuals described in section a.a c.another reference to individuals is implicit in a c i iii because it is contained in the definition of no more restrictive,a term used in that subsection.no more restrictive means that in applying the methodology,no individuals who are otherwise eligible for ssi are made ineligible for medicaid assistance.r b.section a c i also refers to individuals,but merely states that a state medicaid plan must describe the criteria for determining eligibility of certain individuals.finally,a contains similar tangential references to individuals,requiring that a state medicaid plan include reasonable standards for various types of applicants.
none of these passing references provides the necessary language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights.gonzaga,at.the methodology provisions are not phrased in terms of the persons benefited,id.at.quotation omitted they are unmistakably directed not to the benefited class but to the administrators of state medicaid plans.as in gonzaga university,the individual references merely describe the type of policy or practice that a state official must follow.id.at.
our conclusion that the methodology provisions do not provide rights enforceable under comports with the holding in watson,the only other circuit opinion we have found addressing the issue.in that case,although the ninth circuit found an enforceable right in a a,at,it reached the opposite conclusion with respect to a,id.at.the watson court held that the key wording of section a fails to even mention individuals or persons it is not framed in terms of the individuals benefited,which is fatal under gonzaga to the existence of a section right.id.citation omitted see also sanders ex rel.rayl.dep t of soc.rehab,d,a imposes only a duty on the state,and creates no rights in individuals,and thus does not support a right of action under we agree with this analysis.because the methodology provisions are not phrased in terms of medicaid applicants,we can not infer that congress created private rights enforceable under when it passed the methodology provisions.
accordingly,hobbs may not enforce d or the methodology provisions contained in by means of a suit the district court dismissal of hobbs statutory claims was therefore correct.
lastly,we address whether the new mexico officials were entitled to qualified immunity as to hobbs constitutional claims.when a defendant moves for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,the plaintiff must carry a burden for his claims to survive.serna.dep t of,cir.under these circumstances,the plaintiff must show both that the defendant actions violated a constitutional or statutory right and that the right at issue was clearly established at the time of the defendant unlawful conduct.medina cram,cir quotation omitted.
qualified immunity shields government officials from harassment,distraction,and liability when they perform their duties reasonably.pearson callahan,d.this doctrine affords protection to all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.malley briggs,d.the relevant,dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable official that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.saucier katz,d,overruled on other grounds by pearson.at 
hobbs argues that defendants violated his substantive due process rights by determining his eligibility for medicaid benefits under unwritten and unascertainable standards.he relies primarily on morton ruiz,d,and its statement that the determination of eligibility can not be made on an ad hoc basis by the dispenser of the funds.id.at.
in ruiz,the plaintiff challenged a decision by the bureau of indian affairs bia to deny him benefits because he did not live on a reservation.id.at.the statute at issue required that bia shall direct,supervise,and expend such moneys as congress may from time to time appropriate,for the benefit,care,and assistance of the indians throughout the united states.the bia limited benefits eligibility to indians residing on a reservation or otherwise under bia jurisdiction based on a provision in the indian affairs manual,which was unpublished and not generally available to the public.ruiz,at.
the supreme court concluded that congress intended these benefits to extend to indians living near reservations as well as those living on reservations.id.at.it then noted that the bia has placed itself under the structure of the apa procedures and its own internal rules required publication of standards in the federal register and codification in the code of federal regulations.id.at.where the rights of individuals are affected,the court held,it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their own procedures.id.at.
because the bia had repeatedly represented to congress that benefits would be available to indians living near reservations,the court deemed it essential that the legitimate expectation of these needy indians not be extinguished by what amounts to an unpublished ad hoc determination of the agency that was not promulgated in accordance with the bia own procedures,to say nothing of those of the administrative procedure act.id.at.the denial of benefits to these respondents under such circumstances is inconsistent with the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the government in its dealings with these dependent and sometimes exploited people.id.quotation omitted.
we do not read ruiz to require state or federal agencies to promulgate detailed regulations for every conceivable circumstance that may arise in making benefits determinations.see pulido heckler,cir a s a general rule,an administrative agency is not required to promulgate detailed rules interpreting every statutory provision that may be relevant to its action.t he choice made between proceeding by general rule or by individual,ad hoc litigation is one that lies primarily in the informed discretion of the administrative agency.sec chenery.accord nlrb bell aerospace.div.of textron,d t he choice between rulemaking and adjudication lies in the first instance within the agency discretion.rather,the provision at issue in ruiz was invalid because the bia violated its own procedures when it did not publish the rule.the supreme court has subsequently clarified that ruiz held that the bureau failure to abide by its own procedures coupled with the distinctive obligation of trust incumbent upon the government in dealing with indians rendered the provision invalid.lincoln vigil,d.moreover,this court has previously held that ruiz was not decided on due process grounds but as a matter of statutory interpretation.see vigil andrus,cir see also ruiz,at in view of our disposition of the statutory issue,we do not reach the respondents constitutional arguments.we intimate no views as to them.
we recognize that absolute discretion in government invites mischief.see,united states wunderlich.douglas,dissenting absolute discretion is a ruthless master.it is more destructive of freedom than any of man other inventions.holmes city housing,cir a bsolute and uncontrolled discretion in an agency of government vested with the administration of a vast program,such as public housing,would be an intolerable invitation to abuse.further,we are sympathetic to the special needs trust practitioners appearing as amici who seek guidance from nmhsd.yet,we must also acknowledge that a rigid requirement would make the administrative process inflexible and incapable of dealing with many of the specialized problems which arise.chenery,at.united states platte,cir the constitution does not,however,impose impossible standards of specificity.citation and alteration omitted.
balancing these somewhat competing principles,courts have found benefits determinations to be insufficiently guided by standards only when agencies acted absent any ascertainable limit on eligibility.in ruiz,the statute at issue merely provided for the benefit,care,and assistance of the indians throughout the united states,ruiz,at,and the bia did not promulgate any implementing regulations,ruiz,at.similarly,in cammett,a benefits statute simply stated whenever a person in any town shall be poor and unable to support himself he shall be relieved and maintained by the overseers of public welfare of such town,whether he has a settlement there or not.id.at quoting.ann.see also carey quern,cir d efendants neither issued an official bulletin nor utilized any administrative guidelines governing eligibility determinations white roughton,cir per curiam statute providing for f inancial aid in meeting basic maintenance requirements for a livelihood compatible with health and vested virtually unfettered discretion in agency.
these cases upon which hobbs relies establish,at most,a due process right to be free from eligibility determinations made without reference to any standard.as did the fourth circuit in interpreting this line of cases,so do we acknowledge the possibility that an apparent standard might be so vague as to be no standard at all,but we are not aware of any pertinent case so holding.harris lukhard,cir.we need not delineate the precise boundary of the right hobbs alleges because the standards applied by defendants here are a far cry from no standards at all.
eligibility for medicaid is based on an extraordinarily complex set of interlocking statutes,federal and state regulations,and other interpretive documents.in the present case,nmhsd was applying the eligibility standards contained in d and the state medicaid manual,which provides detailed guidance concerning treatment of trust assets as countable resources.see centers for medicare and medicaid services,dep t of health human,state medicaid manual,available at http hereinafter state medicaid manual the state
