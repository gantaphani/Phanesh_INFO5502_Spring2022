introduction 
plaintiffs and appellants,prospect medical group,prospect health source medical group,primary medical group,doing business as sierra medical group collectively prospect,appeal a judgment in favor of defendants and respondents,northridge emergency medical group and saint john emergency medicine specialist,collectively emergency physicians,following an order sustaining separate demurrers without leave to amend.we reverse in part,affirm in part and remand.
this case concerns the relationship of emergency room physicians and health care service plans and delegates of health care service plans.in some cases,emergency room physician groups have contracts with health care service plans or their delegates to provide medical services to patients who are subscribers of the plans.in other emergency situations,health care service plans subscribers are not able to procure the services of contracted emergency physicians,physicians who have contracts with the subscriber health care service plan or its delegate in these cases,the subscribers may procure the services of emergency room physicians,who must treat all patients in emergency situations without regard to ability to pay,pursuant to state and federal law.health,subds.a d.after treatment,the health care service plan or its delegate must reimburse the emergency room physicians for their services,subds.b e.at times,this reimbursement is less than the amount billed by the physicians.
the first issue in this case is whether section prohibits emergency room physicians from balance billing individual for the balance of the physician fee not paid by the health care service plan or its delegate.we hold that section does not prohibit balance billing by emergency room physicians.
the second issue is whether the emergency room physicians must accept the medicare rate as full reimbursement from a health care service plan or its delegate.we hold that the physicians are not required to accept that amount as payment in full.
the third issue is whether the health care service plan or its delegate may litigate the reasonableness of the amount charged by emergency room physicians.we hold that a health care service plan or its delegate has standing to litigate the reasonableness of the amount of reimbursement sought by emergency room physicians.
ii.standard of review 
as this is an appeal from a judgment following the sustaining of a demurrer,we accept as true properly pleaded material factual allegations roman county of los angeles th,d gervase superior court th,d,as well as facts that may be implied or inferred from those expressly alleged.lazar hertz th,d.
in roman county of los angeles,supra,th,d,the court set forth the appropriate standard of review a demurrer tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint,and the granting of leave to amend involves the trial court discretion.therefore,an appellate court employs two separate standards of review on appeal.citations.the complaint is reviewed de novo to determine whether it contains sufficient facts to state a cause of action.citation.where a demurrer is sustained without leave to amend,the reviewing court must determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in doing so.citation.it is an abuse of discretion to deny leave to amend if there is a reasonable possibility that the pleading can be cured by amendment.citation.id.at,d.
iii.factual and procedural background 
a.the parties 
prospect is an independent physician association ipa which manages patient care by executing written contracts with health care service plans prospect provides for medical care to individuals,the of health care service plans,who select a prospect physician.prospect also provides billing services to the health care service plans contracted with prospect.
pursuant to section,subdivision e,prospect is a delegate of the health care service plans.as such,it is statutorily obligated to pay for emergency services provided to of the health care service plans contracted with prospect,subds.b e.
emergency physicians have exclusive licenses at two california hospitals to provide emergency room physician care.emergency physicians are statutorily required to provide emergency room care without regard to an individual insurance or ability to pay,subd.d see also a.
pursuant to section,subdivision i,it appears that both prospect and emergency physicians are providers of health care services the language in the statute governing the issue of balance billing,section,subdivision a,refers to a provider of health care services.for purposes of this opinion,when we refer to a provider of health care services,we are referring to emergency physicians,not prospect.
b.the practice of balance billing 
when of health care service plans schedule medical services in advance,the services may be provided by physicians with whom the health care service plan or its delegate,like prospect,has a contractual relationship.on occasion,as in this case,when of health care service plans need emergency medical care,they may be taken to a hospital where the physicians staffing the emergency room department do not have a contractual relationship with the health care service plan or its delegate,like prospect.
in this case,after emergency physicians provided emergency medical services to the,emergency physicians submitted reimbursement claims to prospect.in some cases,prospect paid to emergency physicians less than the amounts shown on the invoices.in these cases,prospect paid to emergency physicians an amount reflecting what prospect believed was the reasonable amount for the emergency room medical services.emergency physicians then billed the directly for the difference.the parties refer to this practice as balance billing.
the parties,however,have not indicated to this court whether a physician seeking a or deductible amount from a patient constitutes balance billing.for purposes of this opinion,we look to the operative statute,section,for guidance.given an appropriate contractual relationship between a provider of health care services and a health care service plan,or its delegate,section bars providers of health care services from seeking to collect from a patient sums owed by the plan,subds.a b.we therefore assume for purposes of this opinion that the practice of balance billing involves billing a patient only for sums owed by the plan.in contrast,a physician seeking to collect a sum owed by a patient,such as a obligation,would not constitute the practice of balance billing.
prospect files suit 
prospect filed two lawsuits seeking declaratory relief that emergency physicians were entitled only to reasonable compensation for the medical services rendered to the.prospect identified specific emergency room physician services provided by emergency physicians between september and july for which emergency physicians allegedly charged an unreasonable rate.prospect alleged that reasonable compensation for the services provided by emergency physicians was equivalent to percent of the medicare rate.
prospect further alleged that section,subdivision b,prohibited emergency physicians from balance billing for amounts not paid by prospect.prospect alleged that based upon emergency physicians statutory obligation to treat the patients without regard to insurance or ability to pay,and prospects corresponding statutory obligation to reimburse emergency physicians for the emergency care provided,prospect and emergency physicians had an implied contractual relationship in law or fact,which was within the scope of section,subdivision b,thus barring emergency physicians from balance billing the for sums owed by the plan.
prospect alleged that the practice of balance billing constituted an unfair,unlawful,or fraudulent business practice within the meaning of business and professions code section.prospect sought disgorgement,restitution,attorney fees and costs,as well as injunctive relief.
the trial court sustained emergency physicians demurrers without leave to amend and entered judgment accordingly.prospect timely filed notices of appeal.this court consolidated the appeals.
iv.issues presented 
the issues presented are whether section includes within its scope the alleged implied contractual relationship in law or fact between prospect and emergency physicians,and thus bars emergency physicians from engaging in the practice of balance billing whether prospect is entitled to a judicial declaration mandating that emergency physicians must accept the medicare rate as a reasonable rate for the services rendered and whether prospect has standing to litigate whether emergency physicians sought more than a reasonable amount as reimbursement for the medical services rendered.
discussion 
section does not prohibit emergency physicians,who have no contractual relationship with prospect,from balance billing 
prospect argues that section,subdivision b,includes within its scope the alleged implied contractual relationship between prospect and emergency physicians,and therefore prohibits the practice of balance billing.we disagree.
section is contained in the health care service plan act of.the act provides a comprehensive system for licensing and regulating health care service plans.van de kamp gumbiner d.all aspects of the regulation of health plans are covered,including financial stability,organization,advertising and capability to provide health services.ibid.
section provides a every contract between a plan and a provider of health care services shall be in writing,and shall set forth that in the event the plan fails to pay for health care services as set forth in the subscriber contract,the subscriber or enrollee shall not be liable to the provider for any sums owed by the plan.b in the event that the contract has not been reduced to writing as required by this chapter or that the contract fails to contain the required prohibition,the contracting provider shall not collect or attempt to collect from the subscriber or enrollee sums owed by the plan.c no contracting provider,or agent,trustee or assignee thereof,may maintain any action at law against a subscriber or enrollee to collect sums owed by the plan.
prospect claims that,pursuant to subdivision b of section,it has a contract that has not been reduced to writing,an implied contract in law or fact with emergency physicians.prospect bases the assertion of an implied contract upon two statutory obligations.first,under federal law and state law,subd.d,emergency physicians are obligated to provide emergency room services without regard to a patient insurance or ability to pay.second,pursuant to section,subdivisions b and e,as a delegate of health care service plans,prospect is obligated to reimburse providers of health care services,like emergency physicians,for the emergency health services received by the.
as we discuss below,we conclude that section,subdivision b,applies only to voluntarily negotiated contracts and does not include within its scope such implied contracts in law or fact.
when construing a statute,we begin with the words of the statute.if necessary,we look to extrinsic aids.in california emergency physicians medical group pacificare of california th,d,the court explained we review de novo the construction of a statute because it presents a pure question of law.citation.the primary duty of a court when interpreting a statute is to give effect to the intent of the legislature,so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.citation.to determine intent,courts turn first to the words themselves,giving them their ordinary and generally accepted meaning.citation.if the language permits more than one reasonable interpretation,the court then looks to extrinsic aids,such as the object to be achieved and the evil to be remedied by the statute,the legislative history,public policy,and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.citation.ultimately,the court must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the legislature,with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,and it must avoid an interpretation leading to absurd consequences.id.at,d.
we find that the language of section refers to and includes within its scope only voluntarily negotiated contracts between providers of health care services,like emergency physicians,and health care service plans or their delegates,like prospect,based upon traditional contractual principles such as a meeting of the minds.it does not include within its scope the implied contract as prospect argues.
section,subdivision a,does not apply because there is no written contract 
section,subdivision a,requires that contracts between a health care service plan and a provider of health care services shall be in writing and shall set forth that in the event that a health care service plan fails to pay for a health care service,the shall not be liable to the provider of health care services for sums owed by the plan.in this case,there is no written contract therefore section,subdivision a,does not apply.
section,subdivision b,also does not apply because emergency physicians are not contracting providers under the statute 
the language of section,subdivision b,refers to contracting providers.subdivision b of section prohibits a contracting provider,physicians who have contracted with a health care service plan,from attempting to collect from a sums owed by the plan.in this case,pursuant to the plain meaning of the statute,emergency physicians are not contracting providers because they did not contract with the health care service plans or their delegate,prospect.rather,we interpret the term contacting provider as physicians who have freely negotiated a contract with health care service plans or their delegates based upon traditional contractual principles such as a meeting of the minds.
reading subdivisions a and b of section together,they include within their scope only freely negotiated contracts,not implied contracts 
according to the rules of statutory construction,we do not examine statutory language in isolation.instead,we examine statutory language in the context of the statutory framework as a whole in order to determine the scope and purpose of a particular statute and harmonize it with the various parts of the statutory scheme.coalition of concerned communities,city of los angeles cal th,d.in addition,words should be given the same meaning throughout a code unless the legislature has indicated otherwise.hassan mercy american river hospital cal th,d.applying these rules of statutory construction,we conclude that subdivisions a and b of section refer only to voluntarily negotiated contracts based upon a meeting of the minds.
we find that subdivision a of section applies to traditional voluntarily negotiated contracts.subdivision a requires that every contract between a health care service plan and a provider of health care services shall be in writing.requiring a contract to be reduced to writing strongly suggests that the parties must have entered into a freely negotiated contract with a traditional meeting of the minds.
subdivision a of section also states that if the health care service plan or its delegate fails to pay for health care services as set forth in the subscriber contract,the subscriber shall not be liable to the provider of health care services for any sums owed by the plan.the language sums owed by the plan suggests that the health service provider and the plan or its delegate have reached an agreement as to how much the plan will pay for a particular medical procedure in advance of the medical procedure.
in addition,the reference to the subscriber contract is important.it shows that the method of determining sums owed by the plan is to look to the subscriber contracts.prospect has not explained how the alleged implied contracts in this case can reference the subscriber contracts.in other words,prospect has not explained how the subscriber contracts identify the sums owed by the plan for emergency medical services provided by physicians with whom prospect has no contractual relationship.
giving the words of subdivision b of section the same meaning as subdivision a,we conclude that when subdivision b refers to the contract,it must be referring to the same type of voluntarily negotiated contract based upon a meeting of the minds as referenced in subdivision a with one difference.either the contract has not been reduced to writing or the written contract does not contain the prohibition against billing the for sums owed by the plan.thus,when subdivision b,states that i n the event that the contract has not been reduced to writing,and or that the contract fails to contain the required prohibition,it must be referring to the contract referenced in subdivision a,which is a freely negotiated contract,not an implied contract.in addition,when subdivision b uses the phrase sums owed by the plan,we must assume that the phrase in subdivision b has the same meaning as the phrase in subdivision a.we therefore look to the subscriber contract to determine the sums owed by the plan.
based upon the foregoing,we find that the language of subdivision b of section refers to and includes within its scope only voluntarily negotiated contracts between providers of health care services,like emergency physicians,and health care service plans or their delegates,like prospect,based upon traditional contractual principles such as a meeting of the minds.subdivision b does not include within its scope the implied contract as prospect asserts.
interpreting section to include within its scope only freely and voluntarily negotiated contracts based upon a meeting of the minds allows the contracting parties to know their express contractual rights at the time they execute the contract.
a contrary interpretation of section,subdivision b,would be untenable because the parties would be forced to negotiate their contractual rights after the provision of medical services.such an interpretation would mean that every time an emergency room physician provided medical services to a of a health care services plan with which the physician did not have a contractual relationship,the physician would be legally deemed to have entered into an implied contract with the subscriber health care services plan or its delegate 
in ochs pacificare of california th,d ochs,the court explained in dicta that in circumstances like those presented in this case in which the provider of health care services,like emergency physicians,did not have a contractual relationship with a health care plan or its delegate,like prospect,section did not apply to bar the practice of balance billing of the health care service plans.
in ochs,the plaintiff,an emergency room physician,sought declaratory relief that he could directly bill patients pursuant to section.the court of appeal affirmed the trial court order sustaining the demurrer to the declaratory relief cause of action because the plaintiff had not joined the to the lawsuit.ochs,supra,th at,d.on the issue presented in this case,the ochs court explained we observe,however,that section appears only to limit balance billing of insured patients by physicians who have contracted with the patients plans.ochs may have a remedy against the individual patients,and those patients a remedy against pacificare.th at,d.
the department of managed health care recognizes balance billing 
the department of managed health care dmhc,the department charged with protecting plan subscribers and ensuring access to quality health care,has promulgated a regulation requiring health care service plans to advise subscribers in an evidence of coverage document that in the event the health care plan fails to pay a noncontracting provider,the member may be liable to the noncontracting provider for the cost of the services,tit,subd.c.
although not binding,the regulations of the dmhc are entitled to great weight and deference.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization cal th,d.this regulation shows that the dmhc recognizes the practice of balance billing by providers of health care services which do not have a voluntary contractual relationship with a health care service plan or its delegate.
moreover,in this case,the trial court judicially noticed a regulation proposed by the dmhc,which was never adopted.the proposed regulation would have prohibited balance billing under the facts of this case.the proposed regulation,california code of regulations,title,section,provided a with the exception of copayments deemed permissible by the department,an emergency service and care provider who provides emergency service and care to a health plan subscriber may not collect or attempt to collect from the subscriber any amount due the provider and instead must seek reimbursement directly from the health plan for the provision of covered services.
the trial court also took judicial notice of public comments and dmhc responses to proposed regulations concerning claim disputes and dispute resolution mechanisms.there,during the second comment period,which ended december,on the issue of balance billing by physicians,the dmhc stated the prohibition on providers to balance bill has been deleted.cal.of managed health care,comments to,tit,claims settlement pracs.dispute res.mechanisms hereafter comments to title,section,dmhc response to comment.
the fact that the dmhc did not adopt the regulation to prohibit balance billing further indicates that section does not prohibit emergency physicians from balance billing in cases in which the physicians do not have voluntarily negotiated contracts with health care service plans or their delegates.federal national mortgage bugna th,d t he legislature omission of a provision from the final version of a statute which was included in an earlier version constitutes strong evidence that the act as adopted should not be construed to incorporate the original provision.ventura city of san jose d.the courts have repeatedly concluded that when the legislature has rejected a specific provision which was part of an act when originally introduced,the law as enacted should not be construed to contain that provision.
we conclude that section,subdivision b,was not intended to,and does not,prohibit the balance billing practices alleged in this case.emergency physicians have not violated section,and thus there is no violation of business and professions code section.california emergency physicians medical group pacificare of california,supra,th at,d.prospect therefore is not entitled to injunctive relief prohibiting emergency physicians from engaging in the practice of balance billing the of health care plans with which emergency physicians did not have a contractual relationship.
prospect is not entitled to a judicial declaration imposing the medicare rate as the reasonable rate 
section,subdivision b,states that a health care service plan or its delegate shall reimburse providers for emergency services and care provided to its subscribers,until the care results in stabilization of the subscriber.
prospect asserts that it is entitled to a judicial declaration imposing the medicare rate as the rate for reimbursing emergency physicians for the emergency room services.we disagree.
prospect has provided no authority,statutory or otherwise,for this court to conclude that it can set the rates of emergency rooms physicians pursuant to any rate mechanism,whether the medicare rate or any other rate.
the dmhc promulgated a regulation,operative as of august,setting forth six factors to be considered when determining the method for reimbursing providers,like emergency services,for health care services provided to the,tit,subd.a b.the fact that the dmhc adopted a test to determine the rate for reimbursing physicians strongly indicates that employing any sort of rate mechanism,such as the medicare rate,would be inappropriate.as explained above,although not binding,the regulations of the dmhc,which are the product of its,authority,are entitled to great weight and deference.yamaha of america state bd.of equalization,supra,cal th at,d.
prospect concedes that any future fee disputes must be resolved pursuant to this newly promulgated regulation.prospect states,however,that the fees disputes in this case occurred prior to implementation of california code of regulations,title,section,subdivision a b.prospect suggests that it would be appropriate to require emergency physicians to charge the m
