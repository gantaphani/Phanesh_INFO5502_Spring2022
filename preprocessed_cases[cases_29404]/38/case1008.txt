this appeal requires us to decide whether the commissioner of the social security administration properly denied disability benefits to a claimant for whom earnings records showed neither income nor wages for sufficient quarters of coverage.
marion chapman applied for disability benefits when he broke his pelvis in a tractor accident july.social security records indicated that he did not pay in every year and that there were gaps in his earnings record for.his application was denied initially and upon reconsideration.at a hearing before an administrative law judge alj where he was represented by counsel,chapman testified that he was paid by medical center in the dalles,oregon,the company for which he worked as a security guard during,and,and that he filed tax returns for each of those years.chapman did not produce any returns,although he was given five months to do so.instead,he tried to show that he should be credited for income based on irs form filed by.these are information returns which reported payments of nonemployee compensation to chapman in the amount of for,for,and for 
the alj found that chapman worked during these years for as an independent contractor,but did not pay social security taxes.the alj also found that chapman earnings record could not be credited with additional wages or quarters of coverage and that,as he had only of the quarters required for insured status,he was not entitled to disability insurance benefits.the appeals council denied chapman request for review.the district court affirmed.it held that under the applicable statute,c c,and regulation,c,the commissioner earnings records are conclusive evidence that chapman did not receive income because he did not produce income tax returns for the years in question.the court further noted that,even if the forms could be considered,they fail to reflect net income we agree.because chapman alternative argument,that he worked for as an employee instead of as an independent contractor,lacks support in the record,we affirm.
every person claiming disability benefits must show that he is an insured.to have insured status,a claimant must have earned either in wages or in income for at least quarters in the period immediately prior to the date of disability b.the commissioner tracks the social security earnings record of a by taxes paid by the employer,but an individual who is must file a personal income tax return form with a schedule se and a schedule c business profits and loss statement,and pay his own social security taxes.if he does not,the commissioner records will show no income.without a record of income,there will be no coverage for purposes of insured status.
the social security act provides that the commissioner records shall be evidence of the amounts of wages paid to,and income derived by,an individual and of the periods in which such wages were paid and such income was derived.c.however,the act allows for the record to be amended if errors are brought to the commissioner attention within three years,three months and fifteen days of the year in question.c b.here,it is undisputed that the time limit for amending chapman earnings records had expired.after expiration of the time limitation,the records may still be corrected but in different ways and with different effect depending upon whether there is an entry or an absence of an entry in the records,and upon whether the source of earnings was wages or income.
if there is an entry section c a provides that the commissioner changes made pursuant to paragraph of the amount of wages or income derived is conclusive.paragraph permits the commissioner to change or delete any entry with respect to wages or income in his records or include in his records any omitted item of wages or income to conform his records to tax returns or portions thereof including information and other written statements filed with the commissioner of internal revenue.regardless,no amount of income may be included in the commissioner records if a return or statement is filed after the time limit.c f i.thus,if there is an entry of income,that entry may be conformed to a tax return or portion thereof filed before the time limit expired.
if there is an absence of an entry section c b provides that the commissioner records as to wages shall be presumptive evidence that no wages were paid,but c c provides that the records as to income shall be conclusive evidence that no income was derived unless the claimant filed a tax return of income for the year in question before the time limit expired.there is no dispute that the commissioner records have no entry of income for chapman.
chapman argues that the alj erred by failing to consider form as proof of insured status.he contends that these forms,furnished as they were in his case by an independent,eliminate concern over a fraudulent claim and should be considered because c f allows for income to be established from tax returns or portions thereof including information returns.the commissioner maintains that the district court correctly relied on c c instead.in the commissioner view,because the absence of entries in chapman earnings records gives rise to a conclusive presumption that he did not receive income for the three years in question,he had to produce federal tax returns to establish income in order to qualify.having not done so,the commissioner submits,chapman may not rely on forms because they do not satisfy the requirements of c c.
the plain construct of the statute requires the conclusion that chapman derived no income for the years,and.the regulations are to the same effect under both,the absence of an entry of income for,and meant that chapman had to show that he had filed a tax return of income sometime before the limitation period expired.
we so held in singer weinberger,cir.there,too,the commissioner had no record of earnings for the requisite quarters of coverage.we held that the absence of an entry of income in the commissioner records,coupled with an absence of the claimant tax returns showing such income,foreclosed singer attempt to prove income.
chapman,however,points out that we did not explicitly consider c f in singer,nor did we address whether form might suffice as evidence of employment and income this being the case,chapman urges us to follow grigg finch,cir,and hendrickson secretary of health and human services,cir,vacated as moot under settlement agreement,both of which allowed use of form to establish income for quarters of coverage.the commissioner,on the other hand,points out that the grigg rationale was rejected by yoder harris,cir,which held that a claimant account may only be credited with income by proof of a timely filed federal income tax by a form.it was rejected by the commissioner as well 
in grigg,the claimant contended that the commissioner had erroneously failed to credit his records with certain income received,but not reported by him,in the years and.during the years in question,the detroit conservatory of music filed form indicating that grigg had received income from his services at the conservatory.further,grigg filed a form individual income tax return in both and on each of these returns,grigg requested the tax refund due him be credited on estimated tax.the court concluded that grigg was entitled to have his earnings record reflect his income for and because the information transmitted to the commissioner in the information returns and grigg and income tax returns gave the commissioner actual or constructive knowledge under c f that the claimant had sufficient income in the years and to be credited with quarters of coverage for those years.in doing so,the court construed the absence of an entry referred to in c c as an absence which persists even after inclusions in the commissioner records allowed by c f.
in yoder,the claimant social security earnings record contained no entries from,nor had he filed federal income tax returns for the years.both parties agreed that c prohibited use of delinquent income tax returns to credit the account with income for,but yoder relied on form filed by various farm cooperatives which showed patronage dividends paid t
