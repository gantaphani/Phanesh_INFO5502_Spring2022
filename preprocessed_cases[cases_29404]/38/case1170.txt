from until,medicare reimbursed health care providers based upon the reasonable costs of inpatient services furnished to medicare patients.b.under this regime,providers were reimbursed for the actual costs they incurred,provided they fell within certain cost limits.v a.as hospital costs increased,so did medicare reimbursements.
in,in an effort to curtail escalating medicare expenditures,congress revised the reimbursement scheme.congress adopted the prospective payment system pps,which relies upon prospectively fixed rates based upon geographic location and diagnosis for each category of treatment rendered.pps was more restrictive than the reasonable cost system.
since the first medicare regulations were issued in,the secretary has permitted reimbursement for the costs of approved educational activities,later redesignated as,and then as.by regulation,the secretary has defined approved educational activities as formally organized or planned programs of study usually engaged in by providers in order to enhance the quality of patient care.c.this regulation,ever since its origination,has expressed that the costs of educational activities should be borne by the community,but until communities would undertake to bear these costs,the medicare program would share appropriately in the support.see.the regulation has also stated that it was not intended that medicare pay for increased costs resulting from a redistribution of costs from educational institutions to providers.id.
in the early,the hcfa found that the medicare program liability for the costs of educational programs had expanded to include the costs of some programs that were actually run by universities with some support by providers.the hcfa believed that these programs should not be subsidized by medicare.accordingly,in,the hcfa adopted a standard that required that the provider be the legal operator of the education program in order to obtain reimbursement for its associated costs.the hcfa modified this standard following some adverse rulings,including a seventh circuit case which held that does not require that a provider be the legal operator of an educational program in order to qualify for reimbursement.john hickey mem,califano,cir.
following the congressional adoption of pps in,the secretary once again issued new regulations.although pps was stricter that the reasonable cost system that preceded it,congress retained the more lenient reasonable cost system for approved educational activities.a.the costs of approved educational activities pass through pps and are reimbursed under the reasonable cost system.a,d.the new regulations that implemented pps prohibited pass through treatment for c linical training of students not enrolled in an approved education program operated by the provider and activities that do not involve the actual operation of an approved education program.d.as early as,the secretary had stated that only the costs of those approved medical education programs operated directly by a hospital be excluded from pps.medicare program prospective payment for medicare inpatient hospital services,preamble to rule emphasis added.the secretary continued on in the preamble 
if a program is operated by another institution,it must be noted that by far the majority of the costs of that program are borne by that other institution,and not by the hospital.while it is true that the hospital may incur some costs associated with its provision of clinical training to students enrolled in a nearby institution,the hospital also gains in return.for example,it obtains the services of the trainee we do not believe that this type of relationship was what congress intended when it provided for a pass through of the costs of approved medical education programs.rather,we believe that congress was concerned with those programs that a hospital operates itself,and for which it incurs substantial direct costs we are revising d now d to clarify that the costs of clinical training for students enrolled in programs,other than at the hospital,are normal operating costs.
