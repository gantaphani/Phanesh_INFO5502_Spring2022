loretta boiles applied for supplemental security income ssi in march,claiming that she was disabled because she suffered from several maladies,including pseudoseizures.her claim was denied initially,upon reconsideration,and after a hearing before an administrative law judge.the alj found that although boiles had a severe impairment,it did not equal a listed impairment,and that she was capable of working with certain restrictions.because the alj did not adequately support his decision that boiles condition was not equal in severity to a listed impairment,we vacate the decision and remand for further factfinding.
at the time of her hearing,boiles was years old.she has a education and has been employed as a fast food manager,a house cleaner,and a babysitter.none of these jobs lasted more than a few months,and in she stopped working because she could keep a job because of my mental illness.two years later,after her disability claim had been denied initially,she worked briefly as a meat packer but left the job because she was having blackouts and nerve problems.
boiles medical history reveals treatment for a number of physical and psychological problems.in the past decade,she has been treated for conditions including pseudoseizures,severe depression,anxiety,stress disorder,heartburn,high blood pressure,back pain,thyroid disease,and migraines.in addition,boiles was treated for alcoholism in and for prescription drug abuse as late as.the psychological effects of being sexually abused as a child have been cited frequently as a cause or an exacerbating factor of many of boiles health problems.because boiles appeals solely on the ground that her pseudoseizures are medically equivalent to a listed impairment,only her history of treatment for that condition is discussed in detail.

according to her testimony and reports to her neurologist,boiles experienced her first seizure sometime in early,when she arrived at work to find the right side of her car damaged and could not recall how it happened.not long after,she had a seizure at work and an ambulance had to be called.boiles also described a seizure that occurred while she was riding in her sister car her sister rushed her to the hospital after her eyes rolled back,foam came out of her mouth,and she began to bang her head against the car window.after this incident,boiles was put on dilantin,an drug.then in june,boiles had another seizure that prompted her boyfriend to call an ambulance.in addition to these daytime incidents,boiles reported frequent seizures at night.
in the summer of,boiles sought treatment for her seizures and was referred to a neurologist,matthew wallack.she reported experiencing seizures at night that sometimes woke her up or caused bowel or bladder incontinence.after his initial consultation with boiles,wallack opined that pseudoseizures were a significant possibility.he prescribed depakote er as a seizure medication.in october wallack saw boiles again and noted that she reported only four daytime incidents in the prior two months,but that she continued to experience nighttime pseudoseizures,after which she woke up sore and tired.wallack prescribed topamax and noted that if the medication did not alleviate the seizures,he wanted to admit her to an epilepsy monitoring unit.after an appointment in november,wallack reported that boiles had not experienced any daytime seizures since her last appointment,but that she was still having pseudoseizures at night.wallack increased the dosage of topamax but noted that he was not convinced that these are seizures.boiles had another appointment with wallack the following month,after which he reported that her seizures had become less frequent about two seizures per week,and typically occurred while she was asleep.in january boiles was admitted to the hospital for observation for five days,during which time she had one pseudoseizure.shortly afterward,wallack concluded that she need not be treated with drugs for her pseudoseizures.
boiles applied for ssi in march.she claimed that she was disabled due to unspecified mental disorders,arthritis,depression,nerve problems,memory loss,asthma,and bronchitis.her claim was denied,and later that year she sought reconsideration,reporting that her condition had grown worse because she had started having.in february her claim was denied upon reconsideration,and boiles requested a hearing before an alj.
in february boiles had a hearing before an alj at which she testified about her condition.boiles described being disoriented and sore after seizures,and testified that she had been hospitalized a few times.her boyfriend also testified,describing the seizure that led him to call an ambulance.he also corroborated boiles testimony that she sometimes experienced bladder and bowel incontinence in bed during seizures.
in response to a request from the alj,wallack provided a written evaluation of her condition and answered interrogatories regarding the frequency of boiles pseudoseizures and her prognosis.he stated that boiles suffers from pseudoseizures and chronic pain which are secondary to a history of abuse.he noted that although the cause of pseudoseizures can not be identified,they result in genuine suffering and are often accompanied by other debilitating symptoms.wallack estimated that the seizures occurred twice per week,and characterized her prognosis as terrible.he stated that boiles condition was untreatable,that it was his firm belief that boiles could not work,and that he strongly supported the disability application.he added that the reason for her disability was not the seizures in particular but rather the underlying cause of the seizures,namely her sexual abuse as a child,which had devastated her life.
two physicians consulted by the alj testified at the hearing.stump,an internist,distinguished pseudoseizures from epilepsy.an epileptic seizure can be diagnosed by an eeg,he explained,but a pseudoseizure is another form of seizure altogether,and thus a negative eeg does not mean that no seizure took place.he added that patients who experience pseudoseizures can not be treated with medication and therefore benefit little from going to the hospital during an episode.stump also testified that it would be unfair to penalize someone suffering from pseudoseizures by not finding her disabled,because like epileptics,it very difficult for these people to get jobs.stump emphasized that while pseudoseizures are not caused by epilepsy,they are real.
the consulting psychologist,pitcher,agreed with stump,noting that the cause of boiles pseudoseizures was unknown,but there is nothing at all to suggest that she is malingering or faking any seizure.in response to a question from the alj,pitcher testified that alcohol or drug use did not appear to be a material factor in boiles current position,although there may have been a period of time when it was.pitcher also stated that based on boiles testimony and the toxicology reports in the record,there did not appear to be any current substance abuse.both pitcher and stump testified that pseudoseizures could occur in the absence of drugs or alcohol.
the alj then asked a vocational expert ve to determine whether there were jobs in the national economy that boiles could perform.the alj asked the ve to consider an individual with boiles past work experience who required seizure precautions and limited contact with other people,and the ve determined th
