claiming that their patients require atypically dialysis services,three michigan dialysis providers asked the secretary of health and human services to reimburse them at higher rates than medicare normally pays for such services.the secretary denied the requests,the district court granted summary judgment to the secretary,and the providers now appeal.among other things,they argue that the standard the secretary used to assess treatment costs qualifies as an interpretative rule,statement of policy,guideline of general applicability,and therefore should have been published in the federal register under the applicable statute.although we agree,we need not remand two of the providers cases because independent grounds exist to uphold the secretary decision as to them.with regard to the third provider,we reverse and remand for further proceedings.
the secretary of health and human services reimburses facilities providing dialysis services under the medicare program based on a prospective determination of a rate for each mode of care based on a single composite weighted formula.b.this composite rate represents the approximate per treatment cost the secretary expects dialysis providers to incur for various treatments.id.
in unusual circumstances,providers can request exceptions to the composite rate.id.under the regulations in effect at the time of the events at issue here,a facility providing treatment for end stage renal disease esrd could request an exception to the composite rate if it projected it would have higher costs per treatment than the composite rate and showed the higher costs were attributable to certain factors,one of which,central to this case,is a typical service intensity patient mix.b.to qualify for this exception,a facility must demonstrate that a substantial proportion of the facility outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments involve atypically intense dialysis services.id.a.according to the secretary,a facility must show both an atypical patient mix and atypically intense dialysis services,and given that the providers nowhere challenge this interpretation,we accept it as well.the facility bears the burden of proving it has met the criteria and its excessive costs are reasonable.id.g.
appellants are three michigan dialysis dialysis services alpena,northern michigan hospital northern,and chippewa dialysis services chippewa that applied for exceptions to the esrd composite rate.the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms,at that time known as the health care financing administration,reviewed their exception requests.all three providers based their exception requests on atypical patient mix,than average percentages of aged and diabetic patients.consistent with cms provider reimbursement manual prm,each provider sought to show that its patients,due to their special needs,required more hours of nursing services than did patients in other facilities.see prm.
cms denied all three requests.as to atypical nursing services,it stated that n ational audited data for and,the latest available,show that average direct patient care hours were hours per treatment.alpena dialysis,provider reimbursement bd,provider reimbursement bd,chippewa dialysis,provider reimbursement bd.because the per treatment hours of all three providers fell below that hours for alpena,hours for northern,and hours for concluded they had failed to show atypical nursing services and were thus ineligible for the exception.alpena,at,at chippewa,at.
cms also found that northern and chippewa had failed to substantiate atypical patient mix.as to northern,it found that although the provider had a higher than average percentage of patients or older,its percentage of diabetic patients,properly calculated,virtually matched the national average,at.in addition,northern mortality rate and average length of stay both fell below national averages.id.at.as to chippewa,cms found that although the provider served higher than average percentages of diabetic patients and patients or older,its average length of stay,percentage of patients with hypertension,and average age of patients all fell below national averages.chippewa,at.cms made no finding about patient mix regarding alpena,resting its decision instead on the provider failure to demonstrate atypical nursing services.alpena,at.
challenging among other things cms use of the hours per treatment standard,all three providers appealed to the provider reimbursement review board board.at the hearing before the board,a cms health insurance specialist testified as to the source of what the board referred to as the hours per treatment standard.alpena,at,at chippewa,at.according to the witness,the supporting data was primarily obtained from audited cost reports of freestanding esrd facilities for fiscal years and.the data was selected based upon a stratified random sample that was statistically representative of freestanding facilities in the united states.alpena,at,at chippewa,at.relying on various government reports,the witness further testified that hours was a more realistic standard,and that the application of the hours threshold in denying the provider s exception request s was a very generous and liberal standard.alpena,at,at chippewa,at.
the board rejected the providers challenge to the hours per treatment standard,noting that a lthough the provider s cited various deficiencies in the data and methodology employed by cms in establishing the hours per treatment standard,the provider s did not present alternative data which would support the use of another standard.alpena,at,at chippewa,at.by contrast,cms demonstrated that a more realistic contemporary standard for the duration of a dialysis session may have increased to hours.alpena,at,at chippewa,at.
the board also affirmed cms conclusion that northern and chippewa had failed to show an atypical patient mix,explaining that although the providers patient populations may have contained higher than average percentages of aged and diabetic patients,the variations did not reflect a substantial deviation from the national norms,at chippewa,at.according to the board,the providers had also failed to consider other factors cms addressed in reviewing patient mix,mortality rate,length of stay for patients requiring inpatient admission,average age of patient population,and individual patient diagnosis,at chippewa,at.
although the board found that cms erred by failing to determine whether alpena had an atypical patient mix,it went on to make that determination for itself.employing the same language it used in rejecting northern and chippewa appeals,the board found that alpena higher percentages of aged and diabetic patients did not reflect a substantial deviation from the national norms and that the provider had failed to consider other factors,mortality rate,length of stay for patients requiring inpatient admission,average age of patient population,and individual patient diagnosis.alpena,at.accordingly,the board affirmed the denial of alpena request.
the three providers sought review in the district court,and both sides moved for summary judgment.the district court granted the secretary motion for summary judgment as to northern and chippewa,but initially denied it as to alpena.alpena leavitt,slip op.at,wl.the court found that because cms had failed to base its alpena decision on patient atypicality,the board erred by deciding alpena case on the issue of patient atypicality without giving the facility an adequate opportunity to present arguments on that issue.id.at.after the secretary moved for reconsideration,however,the district court granted his motion for summary judgment,finding that regardless of whether alpena had an atypical patient mix,it was unqualified for the exception because it had failed to establish atypical nursing services.see alpena leavitt,slip op.at,wl.r emand would serve no useful purpose,the district court concluded,because independent,legally sufficient ground s for denial of alpena exception request existed.id.
the providers now appeal.all three challenge the board use of the hours per treatment standard,arguing that the medicare act required the secretary to pub
