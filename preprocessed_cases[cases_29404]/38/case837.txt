jennie beltran appeals the district court grant of summary judgment to the commissioner of social security in its review of the commissioner denial of benefits.we have jurisdiction pursuant to,and we reverse.
background 
jennie beltran is a woman suffering from degenerative joint disease of the left knee and wrist,bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,obesity,heel spurs,degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine,status correction of a fractured right distal tibia,depression,and alcohol abuse.she filed applications for both social security disability insurance ssdi benefits and social security income ssi benefits under titles ii and xvi of the social security act on march,and again on november.in her applications,beltran alleged a disability onset date of june.the commissioner denied the request initially and upon reconsideration.beltran appealed to an administrative law judge alj who affirmed the denial of her claim,holding that beltran did not suffer from a disability as defined under the social security act.beltran appealed the alj decision,and her case was remanded to the alj.
during a second hearing on december,the alj concluded that beltran had met her burden to establish that she could not perform any of her past relevant work due to her physical and mental limitations.the burden then shifted to the agency to show that beltran would nevertheless be able to perform other work.thus,the alj asked a vocational expert a series of hypothetical questions given beltran age,education,work experience,and residual functional capacity.the vocational expert testified that,but for beltran ongoing alcohol abuse,she would have been able to work as a surveillance system monitor at all times prior to january.the vocational expert testified that there were regional and national surveillance system monitor jobs available.
the alj denied beltran application for social security disability insurance benefits and partially denied her application for social security income benefits.the alj concluded that there existed a significant number of jobs that beltran could perform prior to january,and therefore found that beltran was not disabled within the meaning of the social security act prior to that date.the alj,however,found that beltran did become disabled on january,her fiftieth birthday because of the deterioration in her medical condition caused by her alcoholism,and because she was now classified as an individual closely approaching advanced age.
beltran appealed the alj decision to the district court.the district court granted summary judgment to the commissioner on november,affirming the alj decision to deny disability benefits to beltran from march,until january.
standard of review 
we review the district court granting of summary judgment de novo.moisa barnhart,cir.we may reverse the commissioner decision only if it was not supported by substantial evidence or was based on legal error.benton barnhart,cir.
discussion 
beltran alleges that the district court was wrong to grant summary judgment to the commissioner because the commissioner erred in concluding that there existed a significant number of jobs in the regional and national economy that beltran could do.because this is beltran only contention,we limit our analysis to answering it.
according to the social security act,
an individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy for purposes of the preceding sentence with respect to any individual,work which exists in the national economy means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.
d a id.a b emphasis added.the burden of establishing that there exists other work in significant numbers lies with the commissioner.tackett apfel,cir.
the alj concluded that jobs regionally and jobs nationally is a significant number of jobs that jennie beltran could do,despite her physical and mental limitations.as the alj established in her decision,jennie beltran suffered from a degenerative joint disease of the left knee and wrists,bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome,obesity,heel spurs,degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine,correction of a fractured right distal tibia,depression and alcohol abuse.all of these limitations existed during the period in question,from march,until january.we consider whether,in light of her limitations,jobs in jennie beltran region,or jobs nationally,constitute a significant number of jobs.
in walker mathews,cir,we held that an alj erred in finding a significant number of jobs where the jobs were very rare or generally unavailable to the claimant due to his limitations.this is precisely the situation in beltran case.the alj found that there existed only jobs regionally or jobs nationally that jennie beltran could perform.although,in walker,we never established what number of jobs qualifies as very rare or generally unavailable,a comparison to other cases shows that this case fits comfortably under walker purview.
we have never set out a rule for what constitutes a significant number of jobs.however,a comparison to other cases is instructive.for example,in barker secretary of health human services,cir,we held that jobs regionally is a significant number of jobs.in jennie beltran case,jobs regionally is about of the jobs found significant in barker jobs regionally is also slightly lower than the jobs nationally available to beltran.in martinez heckler,cir amended,we stated that to jobs or to of the regional jobs available to beltran in the greater metropolitan and orange county area the same region beltran lives in was a significant number of jobs.see also thomas barnhart,cir jobs in oregon region and in the national economy johnson shalala,cir jobs in los angeles county area moncada chater,cir jobs in san diego county and jobs nationwide.in short,when compared to other cases,regional surveillance monitor jobs qualifies as a very rare number.
the statute in question indicates that the significant number of jobs can be either regional jobs the region where a claimant resides or in several regions of the country national jobs.d a.the commissioner argues that if substantial evidence supports finding either of the two numbers significant,the alj decision must be upheld.id.the commissioner,focusing not on the regional jobs,but on the jobs found nationally,argues that a significant number of jobs were available to jennie beltran at a national level.
if we find either of the two numbers significant,then we must uphold the alj decision.d a.having concluded that regional jobs is not a significant number,we turn to the national jobs.however,we can not consider the jobs as a figure rather,as the statute states,we must consider this number in light of the fact that it represents jobs across several regions.id.although jobs might seem a significant number standing alone,distributing these jobs between several regions across the nation shows that it is not significant after all.if jobs available in one of the largest regions in the country is not a significant number,then jobs distributed over several regions can not be a significant number,either.we need not decide what the floor for a significant number of jobs is in order to reach this conclusion.
furthermore,the district court finding that there existed only regional or national surveillance system monitor jobs was solely based on a vocational expert testimony.upon questioning by beltran attorney,the same vocational expert admitted that there are not many of these jobs anymore.she further testified that she was not familiar with the area of southern california the area where beltran resides and that she was not aware of any available surveillance system monitor positions in that area.the vocational expert testimony further indicates that the job of a surveillance system monitor was simply not available to jennie beltran.as we foun
