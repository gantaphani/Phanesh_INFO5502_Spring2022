jane doe i,jane doe ii,and jane doe iii live in district of columbia facilities for the intellectually disabled.they are plaintiffs here,and they represent a class certified by the district court of intellectually disabled persons who live in district of columbia facilities and receive medical services from the district of columbia.these individuals have never had the mental capacity to make medical decisions for themselves.some district of columbia statutes and cases use the term mentally retarded we will use the more common term intellectually disabled.
the district of columbia mental retardation and developmental disabilities administration commonly referred to as the mrdda although the official name has now changed to the department of disability services ensures that those intellectually disabled individuals receive necessary medical services,including necessary surgeries.many of the surgeries mrdda authorizes are relatively routine mrdda also authorizes more significant surgeries when medically necessary.
the district of columbia health care decisions act provides that any individual,including persons who have been determined to be intellectually disabled,shall be presumed capable of making decisions unless certified otherwise in accordance with law.of course,some individuals may not have the mental capacity to make healthcare decisions for themselves.the sets out a procedure to make the mental incapacity determination.the code provides mental incapacity to make a decision shall be certified by physicians who are licensed to practice in the district and qualified to make a determination of mental incapacity.id.a.at least one of the two certifying physicians must be a psychiatrist,and at least one must have examined the individual in question within one day of the certification of incapacity.id.the physicians must apply the following standard a person lacks mental capacity to make healthcare decisions if he or she lacks sufficient mental capacity to appreciate the nature and implications of a decision,make a choice regarding the alternatives presented or communicate that choice in an unambiguous manner.id.all professional findings and opinions forming the basis of the certification shall be expressed in writing and provide clear evidence that the person is incapable of understanding the choice,making a decision concerning the particular treatment or services in question,or communicating a decision even if capable of making it.id.b.
mental incapacity to make a healthcare decision shall not be inferred from the fact that an individual i s mentally retarded.id.in other words,under law,not all intellectually disabled persons lack the mental capacity to make healthcare decisions.the two inquiries are separate.plaintiffs counsel here agrees,however,that all of the class members in this case lack the mental capacity to make healthcare decisions.see tr.of oral arg.at,see also does i through iii district of columbia.
law creates a hierarchy of individuals authorized to make healthcare decisions for persons who have been certified under as lacking mental capacity.see a,d,f.that list includes,in order of priority a guardian or conservator a spouse or domestic partner an adult child a parent an adult sibling a religious superior,if applicable a close friend or the nearest living relative.id.a.the mrdda administrator makes healthcare decisions for an incapacitated patient only if none of the above individuals is available and willing to do so.see in re estate of gillis,providing overview of mrdda statutory authority to make healthcare decisions for intellectually disabled patients.the also explicitly provides that abortions,sterilizations,and may not be authorized,at least absent a court order.
of relevance to this case,law distinguishes between two categories of persons who lack mental capacity i those who once possessed mental capacity,such as those in a coma or who have lost their mental capacity due to age,disease,or an accident and ii those who have always lacked mental capacity,such as certain intellectually disabled persons.for patients who once had mental capacity,the decision must be based on the known wishes of the patient if those wishes can be ascertained for example,as expressed in a durable power of attorney.id.b see also id.c.for those who have never had the mental capacity,the decision must be based on a good faith belief as to the best interests of the patient.id.

for intellectually disabled patients who do not have the mental capacity to make medical decisions,the policy allows the mrdda administrator to authorize medical treatment only when,among other requirements,the patient has been certified as an incapacitated individual and two licensed physicians have certified,in writing,that the health care service,treatment,or procedure is clinically indicated to maintain the health of the patient.id.at.the policy further provides that e fforts should be made to provide information and explanations at the level of patient comprehension.id.at.in other words,mrdda must discuss the proposed treatment with the intellectually disabled patient.the policy also states that family members and guardians should receive notice of recommended medical treatment and be given an opportunity to grant consent.id.at.if there is no family member or other person available or willing to provide consent,however,the mrdda administrator may authorize the surgery.id.
plaintiffs filed suit and alleged that mrdda violated district of columbia law,as well as their due process rights under the fifth amendment,by authorizing surgeries on them without considering their wishes.it is undisputed that plaintiffs have always lacked sufficient mental capacity to appreciate the nature and implications of a decision,make a choice regarding the alternatives presented or communicate that choice in an unambiguous manner.see also does i through iii,at tr.of oral arg.at.the district of columbia has argued that it legally and logically can not consider the wishes of patients who always have capacity to make independent medical decisions because there is no information about what they would want if they were not incapacitated.does district of columbia,d,internal quotation marks omitted emphasis in original.the district of columbia points out that consideration of the wishes of a patient who lacks mental capacity to make healthcare decisions could lead to denial of essential medical care to a patient who purportedly did not want though the patient by law has always lacked the mental capacity to make such a decision.
the district court concluded that e ven a legally incompetent,mentally retarded individual may be capable of expressing or manifesting a choice or preference regarding medical treatment.id.internal quotation marks omitted.the court thus held that the district of columbia is based on the statutory best interests standard rather than the known wishes inconsistent with statutory law,violates plaintiffs and t
