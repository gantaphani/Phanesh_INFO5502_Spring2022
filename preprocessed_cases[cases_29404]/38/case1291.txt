background 
akers is the widow of james akers,a veteran who died on february.akers had service connected stress disorder rated at disabling at the time of his death.akers applied for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits in february.in july,akers claim was denied.in february,akers filed a notice of disagreement and on may,the regional office of the united states department of veterans affairs dva mailed akers a statement of the case in which it informed akers that it was continuing to deny her claim and that she could appeal its decision within sixty days.on september,akers filed an untimely appeal using va form,entitled appeal to the board of veterans appeals.akers checked the box on form corresponding to the statement i want to appeal all of the issues listed on the statement of the case.id.on october,dva informed akers that her appeal was untimely and that the denial of her claim had become final.dva informed akers that her claim could only be reopened if she submitted new and material evidence.
in july,dva received akers submission of a statement in support of claim,along with supporting evidence,which stated that akers wished to reopen her claim for service connection of akers death.dva initially denied akers request to reopen her claim on the ground that akers had not submitted new and material evidence.akers appealed,and submitted additional evidence on the basis of which her claim was eventually reopened and granted effective from july,when dva first received akers request to reopen her claim.
akers filed a notice of disagreement seeking to make her benefits effective as of the date of akers death.dva denied akers request for an earlier effective date and akers appealed to the board.the board found that akers form submission was a substantive appeal and that akers did not attempt to reopen her claim until july.the board found no evidence revealing that akers indicated an intent to apply for dependency and indemnity compensation benefits between the prior final disallowance of the claim in june and the date of the receipt of the claim to reopen on july,slip op.at.
akers appealed the board decision to the veterans court.the veterans court affirmed,quoting the board fact finding set forth above,and further reciting that 
the board stated in fact,the appellant concede d during her hearing that she did not file a claim to reopen until july.see also at november hearing testimony in which akers,when asked was there any claim filed prior to july,other than the original claim that was denied responded,no,no.the board concluded,as the record contains no such communication or action from the appellant until july,there is no factual or legal basis to assign an earlier effective date.id.
veterans court,at.of particular relevance to this appeal,the veterans court also stated that 
while the board did not specifically discuss whether the september,communication constituted a claim to reopen,its statement of reasons and bases was adequate nonetheless.in order for the september document to have constituted a claim to reopen,it would have needed accompanying new and material evidence.see a akers did not attach any evidence to the september submission.it therefore would have been impossible for the board to reopen the claim based on the september,communication.because of this impossibility,it was not error for the board to fail to discuss whether the september communication constituted a claim to reopen.
id.emphasis added.
akers moved for reconsideration and the veterans court denied her motion.akers shinseki,wl.akers timely appealed and asserts that this court has jurisdiction pursuant to.
ii.discussion 
standard of review 
this court reviews legal determinations of the veterans court de novo.if the decision of the veterans court is not in accordance with law,this court has authority to modify,reverse,or remand the case as appropriate.cushman shinseki,citations omitted.
before this court,akers argues that the veterans court misinterpreted a by creating a requirement that a request to reopen a previously adjudicated claim must itself be accompanied by new and material evidence.according to akers,neither the regulation,nor the statute which it implements,requires that new and material evidence actually accompany a claim to reopen.rather,akers argues,both provisions require only that new and material evidence be submitted at some time before the request to reopen can be granted.
akers also argues that the veterans court committed a second error of law by failing to address akers contention that her form submission constituted an informal claim to reopen her previously adjudicated claim pursuant to.according to akers,the veterans court misinterpretation of section caused it to reject akers interpretation of section sub silentio.akers states that it is an undisputed fact that prior to her form submission she had expressed the intent to apply for benefits.akers further argues that it is undisputed that dva understood the identity of the benefit akers was seeking from her form submission.thus,according to akers,it is a question of law based on undisputed facts whether her form constituted an informal claim to reopen her previously adjudicated claim.
dva responds that akers appeal raises factual issues beyond this court jurisdiction.specifically,dva argues that akers asks this court to disturb the board factual determination,as affirmed by the veterans court,that akers never expressed an intent to apply for benefits between the final denial of her original claim and her july request to reopen her claim.dva also argues that the veterans court never purported to interpret either section or in its opinion.according to dva,akers argument boils down to an assertion that the veterans court failed to recite the catechism that the board factual determination that akers never expressed the requisite intent including in her form was not clearly erroneous.thus,according to dva,this appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.
dva argues in the alternative that to the extent that the veterans court interpreted sections and,it committed no reversible legal error.according to dva,the veterans court did not base its holding on a categorical rule that no claim to reopen will ever be recognized absent simultaneous submission of new and material evidence,but rather that such evidence would have been necessary on the facts of this case.dva also argues that the veterans court reference to akers lack of intent to reopen her claim proved that the veterans court had applied the correct interpretation of section.
this appeal therefore requires us to decide whether akers has presented an issue of law which this court has the authority to review and,if so,whether the veterans court correctly interpreted and to preclude the treatment of akers untimely appeal as an informal claim to reopen her previously adjudicated claim for purposes of determining an effective date of benefits.
this court authority 
we begin with dva challenge to this court authority to review akers appeal.this court power to review decisions of the veterans court is limited.d states that e xcept to the extent that an appeal under this chapter presents a constitutional issue,this court may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.see also ellington peake,explaining with regard to an alleged informal claim that the interpretation of the contents of a claim for benefits is a factual issue over which we do not have jurisdiction.citation omitted conway principi,w hile we can review questions of law,we can not review applications of law to fact.
