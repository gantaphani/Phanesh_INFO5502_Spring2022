polly wilson appeals from an order of the district court affirming the commissioner decision denying her applications for social security disability and for supplemental security income benefits ssi.wilson alleged an disability onset date of june.her date last insured was december,thus she had the burden of proving that she was totally disabled on that date or before.see henrie dep t of health human,cir holding the claimant must prove she was totally disabled prior to the date her insured status expired.the agency denied her applications initially and on reconsideration.
on august,wilson received a de novo hearing before an administrative law judge alj.the commissioner follows a sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant is disabled.see williams bowen,cir.
step one requires the claimant to demonstrate that he is not presently engaged in substantial gainful activity.at step two,the claimant must show that he has a medically severe impairment or combination of impairments.at step three,if a claimant can show that the impairment is equivalent to a listed impairment,he is presumed to be disabled and entitled to benefits.if a claimant can not meet a listing at step three,he continues to step four,which requires the claimant to show that the impairment or combination of impairments prevents him from performing his past work.
if the claimant successfully meets this burden,the burden of proof shifts to the commissioner at step five to show that the claimant retains sufficient rfc residual functional capacity to perform work in the national economy,given her age,education,and work experience.if a determination can be made at any of the steps that a claimant is or is not disabled,evaluation under a subsequent step is not necessary.

in his october,decision,the alj determined that wilson was not presently engaged in substantial gainful activity and that she did have a medically severe combination of impairments,including the following severe impairments degenerative disc disease of the cervical and lumbar spine,mitral valve prolapse,history of carpal tunnel,depression,personality disorder,somatoform disorder,and methamphetamine abuse.admin,vol.i at.at step three,the alj determined that wilson combination of impairments did not meet or equal a listed impairment.the alj determined that she retained the rfc to perform a range of light activities and was physically limited to lifting or carrying pounds frequently and pounds occasionally,sitting about hours in an hour work day,and standing or walking about hours in an hour work day.id.at.the alj also determined that wilson mental limitations include moderate limitations in the ability to understand,remember,and carry out detailed instructions maintain attention and concentration for extended periods interact appropriately with the general public and get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes.id.with this rfc,the alj found that wilson could return to her past relevant work as a phlebotomist,and that even if she could not return to her past relevant work,there were a significant number of other jobs which she could perform in the national or regional economy.the alj therefore held that wilson had not been under a disability from the alleged date of onset to the date of the alj decision.the appeals council denied review,making the alj decision the commissioner final decision.
on appeal,wilson raises five points of error the alj failed to properly consider her psychotic disorder in determining her rfc the alj failed to properly consider her myofascial pain syndrome in determining her rfc the alj erroneously evaluated her credibility the alj improperly evaluated several treating source opinions and the district court erred by failing to remand the case to the agency for consideration of new and material evidence.
under the social security act,the social security administration ssa is authorized to pay disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income to persons who have a disability.a person qualifies as disabled,and thereby eligible for such benefits,only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but can not,considering his age,education,and work experience,engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy.
barnhart thomas,d quoting d a,a b.under the social security act,a claimant is disabled if she is unable to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than months.wall astrue,cir quoting a ellipsis in original.we review the commissioner decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.see andrade sec y of health human,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.fowler bowen,cir quotation omitted.we review the district court denial of wilson motion for remand for an abuse of discretion.see clem sullivan,cir.
wilson has a long history of drug addiction and mental illness.her first argument is that the alj failed to properly consider her psychotic disorder in determining her rfc.her psychotic disorder was first diagnosed on october,by cathy shaffer,a therapist for high plains mental health center high plains.admin,vol.i at.the diagnosis was confirmed by evaluations performed by susan harper at high plains on december,january,and january.id.at.the alj did not find her psychotic disorder to be severe at step two of the sequential evaluation.but the alj was still required to give consideration to the disorder because,in determining rfc,an alj must consider the limiting effects of all the claimant impairment s,even those that are not severe.e,e see also,wl,at.
wilson does not argue that the record shows specific limitations caused by her psychotic disorder that should have been included in the rfc.she instead argues that the decision shows the alj ignored her psychotic disorder.she argues that this insufficient consideration is shown by the alj failure to identify which of her limitations were caused by the psychotic disorder,his failure to find the psychotic disorder a severe mental impairment at step two,and his failure to discuss certain evidence concerning the symptoms of her disorder.
when considering mental impairments,the alj must properly apply the special technique required by the regulations.
when there is evidence of a mental impairment that allegedly prevents a claimant from working,the alj must follow the procedure for evaluating mental impairments set forth in a and the listing of impairments and document the procedure accordingly.this procedure requires the alj to rate the degree of the claimant functional limitation based on the extent to which the claimants mental impairment s interferes with the claimant ability to function independently,appropriately,effectively,and on a sustained basis.previously,to record his conclusions,the alj prepared a standard document called a psychiatric review technique form prt form that tracked the listing requirements and evaluated the claimant under the relevant criteria.now,he is only to document application of the technique in the decision.
carpenter astrue,cir quotations,citations,and alterations omitted.
here the alj applied the special technique and rated wilson functional limitations by essentially following the conclusions of charles frantz,a consulting physician,contained in two prt forms from august,prior to the diagnosis of psychotic disorder the alj found that wilson had a severe combination of mental impairments,concluding that claimant has no restrictions in daily activities,moderate difficulties in maintaining social functioning,moderate difficulties in maintaining concentration,persistence or pace without evidence of repeated episodes of decompensation.admin,vol.i at.
in determining wilson rfc,the alj tracked the findings in franz mental rcf assessment,also from august,the alj included the following mental limitations in the rfc moderate limitations in the ability to understand,remember,and carry out detailed instructions maintain attention and concentration for extended periods interact appropriately with the general public and get along with coworkers or peers without distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes.id.at.despite the fact that the alj tracked a mental rfc assessment that was completed prior to wilson psychotic disorder diagnosis,he did take that disorder diagnosis into account.he simply determined that the diagnosis did not affect wilson level of functionality.
first,although franz initially completed the prt forms and the mental rfc assessment,both the forms and the assessment were reconsidered and affirmed by a second doctor,schulman,on march,after the psychotic disorder diagnosis by high plains.the alj was clearly aware of this reconsideration in that,immediately after expressing his agreement with the agency medical consultants,he specifically stated t he undersigned finds that evidence received into the record after the reconsideration did not provide any new or material information that would alter any finding about the claimant residual functional capacity.id.emphasis added.second,in specifically discussing the high plains psychotic disorder diagnosis,the alj noted that,despite the additional diagnosis,high plains did not reduce its rating of wilson global assessment of functioning gaf from id.at.in other words,it is clear that although high plains adjusted wilson diagnosis after franz assessments,the center did not believe that wilson level of functioning was adversely affected by the additional diagnosis.
thus,although the alj did not go into the specifics about the symptoms that led to the psychotic disorder diagnosis,he made the findings required by a,and considered the psychotic disorder diagnosis in doing so.those findings were supported by substantial evidence in that the alj agreed with the findings of the agency medical consultants,including the reconsideration after the psychotic disorder diagnosis,and noted that,according to the clinicians who made the additional diagnosis,it did not have an impact on wilson level of functioning.
in her second point,wilson claims that the alj also failed to properly consider her myofascial pain syndrome diagnosis in determining her rfc on october,wilson underwent a neuromuscular examination by april mcvey.mcvey impression following the examination was 
i believe that this patient has myofascial pain syndrome.i understand that she is filing for social security disability.i did explain to the patient that without any objective abnormalities on her neurological examination or on the electrodiagnostic studies,she probably will not receive approval from social security for disability.
admin,vol.ii at.this diagnosis was noted by the alj in his decision mcvey noted possible myofascial pain syndrome and advised the claimant that without any objective abnormalities on her neurological examination or on the electrodiagnostic studies,she would probably not receive approval from social security for disability,vol.i at.
doctors at the hays orthopaedic clinic hays had also previously diagnosed wilson with myfascial pain syndrome.she had been treated by hays for some time for complaints of back,neck,shoulder,and arm pain.on march,the physician assistant and doctor who had been treating her noted that they had been seeing wilson for several months and had not made any gains with rehabilitation despite her nerve conduction and mri test results being essentially normal for the most part,vol.ii at.they decided to have smith evaluate wilson,which he did on march.
smith stated in his report i believe this lady essentially has a chronic pain syndrome that seems to fit more into a pattern of fibromyalgia.id.at.after another visit,smith decided to have mizra baig examine wilson,because of her claim of severe neck pain,for an opinion to see if there is any other treatment that may be of benefit including surgery.id.at.baig diagnosed wilson with a cervical strain and myofascial pain syndrome.she then returned to smith who noted that baig could not find any good organic reason for her pain and thought it was mostly myofascial.id.at.he also noted that wilson told him that she was diagnosed at one time with chronic fatigue syndrome.id.smith last saw wilson on june,when his final diagnosis was c hronic pain syndrome with multiple musculoskeletal complaints including myofascial pain.id.at.
wilson complains that the alj erred in stating that mcvey considered myofascial pain syndrome a possibility.we see no error with this statement or with the alj treatment of her myofascial pain syndrome.although wilson complained of severe pain in her back and neck,which sometimes radiated to pain in other areas,multiple clinical tests were unable to find a physical cause for that level of pain.thus,the record contains diagnoses of chronic pain syndrome,myofascial pain syndrome,and fibromyalgia.further,she being diagnosed at one time with chronic fatigue syndrome,and she was also diagnosed with the somatoform disorder characterized by p sychological factors contributing to perception of pain,id.at.the fact that the various doctors often qualified their diagnoses with the word believe simply reflects the fact that complaints of severe pain that do not readily lend themselves to analysis by objective medical tests are notoriously difficult to diagnose and treat,and the diagnoses themselves are often overlapping.see boardman prudential ins.of,cir while the diagnoses of chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia may not lend themselves to objective clinical findings,the physical limitations imposed by the symptoms of such illnesses do lend themselves to objective analysis.estok apfel,cir n o one questions that fibromyalgia is very difficult to diagnose,that no objective medical tests reveal its presence,and that it can be completely disabling.sarchet chater,cir f ibromyalgia is also know as common,but elusive and mysterious,disease,much like chronic fatigue syndrome,with which it shares a number of features.sisco dep t of health human,cir at this point there is no dipstick laboratory test for chronic fatigue syndrome.stanistreet chater,d,citing schmidt attorneys dictionary of medicine at ed,in determining that m yofascial syndrome describes a condition very similar to fibromyalgia and fibrositis.
further,wilson argues that the fact that the alj noted mcvey statement that she advised the claimant that without any objective abnormalities on her neurological examination or on the electrodiagnostic studies,she would probably not receive approval from social security for disability,admin,vol.i at,shows that the alj finding of disability was based on the negative neurological testing.this is pure speculation.the alj might have referenced mcvey statement in its entirety simply because the diagnosis was so short.or,more likely,the alj included the reference to the negative neurological testing to provide another example of wilson expressing to a clinician her desire to obtain social security disability benefits,which,as will be discussed further infra,was a factor the alj considered in assessing credibility.it is clear from the decision,taken as a whole,that the alj was aware that a claimant pain may be considered disabling despite the absence of neurological testing objectively showing a reason for such pain.thus,we must turn to wilson credibility argument.
in her third point,wilson claims the alj erred in evaluating her testimony.to the extent wilson is trying to argue that there was not substantial evidence to support the alj determination that she was not entirely credible,we disagree.
credibility determinations are peculiarly the province of the finder of fact,and we will not upset such determinations when supported by substantial evidence.diaz sec y secretary of health human,cir.however,f indings as to credibility should be closely and affirmatively linked to substantial evidence and not just a conclusion in the guise of findings.huston bowen,cir footnote omitted see also marbury sullivan,cir alj must articulate specific reasons for questioning the claimant credibility where subjective pain testimony is critical williams ex rel.williams bowen,cir failure to make credibility findings regarding critical testimony fatally undermines the commissioner argument that there is substantial evidence adequate to support her conclusion that claimant is not under a disability.
kepler chater,cir.
there can be no doubt that wilson testimony was not entirely credible.even the briefest review of the record reveals a number of instances of deception concerning her drug use and other topics.the alj decision points out a number of these instances of misrepresentation,and the record contains many more.we thus hold that there was substantial evidence to uphold the alj general negative credibility determination.
as we read wilson briefs,however,her argument is not so much that her testimony was credible as a whole,but that the alj drew incorrect inferences from her testimony.we must therefore look at the specific credibility findings made by the alj,beginning with his credibility finding as to wilson claims of disabling pain.wilson argues that the alj failed to properly analyze her claims of disabling claims.
the framework for the proper analysis of claimant evidence of pain is set out in luna bowen,cir.we must consider whether claimant established a impairment by objective medical evidence if so,whether there is a loose nexus between the proven impairment and the claimant subjective allegations of pain and if so,whether,considering all the evidence,both objective and subjective,claimant pain is in fact disabling.
branum barnhart,cir quoting thompson sullivan,cir.we have held that,in determining whether the claimant subjective complaints of pain are credible,the alj should consider various factors,such as 
the levels of medication and their effectiveness,the extensiveness of the attempts medical or nonmedical to obtain relief,the frequency of medical contacts,the nature of daily activities,subjective measures of credibility that are peculiarly within the judgment of the alj,the motivation of and relationship between the claimant and other witnesses,and the consistency or compatibility of nonmedical testimony with objective medical evidence.
id.at quoting hargis sullivan,cir.
here the alj found that wilson medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to produce some of the alleged symptoms.however,the claimant statements concerning the intensity,duration and limiting effects of these symptoms are not entirely credible.admin,vol.i at.wilson argues that the alj gave no consideration to the possibility that psychological disorders combine with physical problems when he evaluated her pain.aplt.opening br.at quoting luna,at.she argues that t here were at least two psychiatric disorders that affect her pain,physical functioning,perceptions of her health,and other aspects of her credibility and that a n evaluation of her pain and her credibility without specifically discussing those disorders as they relate to her pain and credibility is fatally incomplete.id.at.
wilson first discusses her psychotic disorder.to the extent wilson is arguing that her lack of credibility may be attributed to a psychotic break with reality,we see no evidence in the record to support such a claim.the few periods in time discussed in the record where an argument might be made that wilson had a loose grip on reality are unrelated to the negative credibility findings made by the alj.further,she was clearly lucid at the hearing before the alj.
it is possible that wilson is arguing that her mental impairments in combination,including her psychotic disorder,led her to experience disabling pain despite the lack objective medical evidence of a medically determinable physical impairment that would cause such pain.it is clear that various clinicians recognized that wilson testable physical impairments were not of sufficient severity to account for her complaints of extreme the diagnoses of somatoform disorder,fibromyalgia,pain disorder.but even if wilson level of pain was greater due to these untestable conditions,the question still remains whether her complaints of disabling pain were credible.in finding they were not,the alj did not rely merely on the absence of a testable physical impairment that would cause such disabling pain.he also relied on evidence showing that some of wilson treating physician thought she was more interested in obtaining disability benefits than in trying to find work she could do,that she at times behaved as if she had no disabling pain,and that her statements were not confined to her complaints of pain.
it is clear that wilson was seeking disability benefits.but it is obvious that seeking benefits does not lead to an adverse credibility finding people who are unable to work need and are entitled to such benefits.while this was wilson third application for disability benefits and she had also filed a medical malpractice claim and workers compensation claims,and while at least one doctor was more than skeptical about her disability claim such evidence standing alone would be insufficient to support an adverse credibility finding as to a subjective pain complaint.
this was not,however,the only evidence relied upon by the alj.he also noted that while wilson did take prescription medications,she did not take prescription strength pain relief medication despite her claims of disabling pain.he also noted that her description of her daily activities did not indicate significant limitations.although she testified that she had severe pain in her back and neck,her description of her activities of daily living indicated the ability to care for herself,her home and her children.admin,vol.i at.wilson stated that she was able to drive,shop,and handle finances that gardening was a hobby and that she visited friends and ate out.
further,the alj noted that wilson statements regarding her limitations were not always credible.she testified that she could not use her hands but also testified that she,at one point,wrote a county attorney a letter.likewise,she testified that she was limited to sitting no longer than thirty minutes or standing no longer than thirty minutes,a claim inconsistent with the stated limitation that she was not allowed to drive for longer than ninety minutes and also inconsistent with the fact that,during the hearing,the alj noticed no position alteration or obvious discomfort by wilson and no appearance of pain when she left the hearing.such evidence undermines wilson claims of a disabling level of pain,no matter the source.
further,wilson testified at the hearing that one of the reasons she wanted to obtain disability benefits was that she wanted to be able to spend time taking care of her youngest son who suffered from night terrors.the record shows that she also provided this reason for seeking disability in her disability filings as well as relating it to various clinicians.this provides another motive for misrepresentation of her disability.finally,the alj noted that the record showed various discrepancies regarding wilson substance abuse.her misrepresentations as to the use of alcohol and exactly when she quit taking drugs was properly taken into account when considering her overall credibility.consequently,the alj determination that wilson testimony of disabling pain was not credible was supported by substantial evidence.
in her fourth point on appeal,wilson claims that the alj improperly evaluated several treating source opinions.she first claims that the alj rfc determination ignored the physical limitations set forth in two work releases given in january and may of by two doctors at hays.while it is true that the releases contained more significant restrictions than did the eventual rfc determination,the releases were also inconsistent with each other.further,the rfc generally agreed with the findings of a later physical rfc assessment performed by an agency consultant on december.in turn,in finding that wilson ha
