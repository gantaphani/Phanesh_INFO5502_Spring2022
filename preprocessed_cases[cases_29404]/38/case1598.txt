wylene nebblett seeks review of the final decision of the merit systems protection board board affirming a reconsideration decision of the office of personnel management.nebblett office of pers.the reconsideration decision denied nebblett application for an immediate retirement annuity under d.we affirm.
on december,nebblett executed a signed written request for personnel action,pursuant to which she resigned,effective december,from her position of secretary in the office of the united states attorney in newark,new jersey.the stated reason for her resignation was vertigo stress.the documentary evidence of her resignation makes no reference to intolerable or adverse working conditions that may have contributed to her condition,or encouraged her resignation instead,her resignation appears on its face to be wholly voluntary.the form that nebblett executed expressly stated that y ou are requested to furnish a specific reason for your resignation failure to provide it may result in your not receiving pay or other compensation due you.at the time of her departure from work,she was years old and had completed approximately years of federal service.
entitlement of federal employees to immediate retirement annuities is governed by the terms of.as of december,nebblett did not qualify for an immediate retirement annuity under subsection a of section.that subsection has an age requirement of years,coupled with a requirement of years of service.nor could nebblett qualify for an immediate retirement annuity under subsection b,which requires years of age and years of service.at the time of her resignation,subsection c pertained to law enforcement officers and firefighters,positions not occupied by nebblett.other subsections of section also deal with job definitions and other requirements that nebblett unquestionably does not meet.
subsection d of section,however,is a source of authority pursuant to which nebblett arguably has a claim to an immediate retirement annuity.that provision reads,in relevant part,that 
d an employee who 
is separated from the service involuntarily,except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency after completing years of service or after becoming years of age and completing years of service is entitled to an annuity 
by its plain terms,this subsection would not appear to be of any comfort to nebblett,because her resignation seemed on its face to be voluntary.this facial disparity between the law and the facts is dissipated,according to nebblett,because,according to her allegations,her resignation was not voluntary at all.instead,nebblett asserts that her separation was coerced,that she was separated from her job against her will as a result of wrongful and intolerable working conditions.as a coerced retiree,nebblett contends that she meets the definition of a an employee who is separated from the service involuntarily.if this contention,which raises an issue of statutory interpretation,is correct,nebblett would fulfill the qualifications for an immediate retirement annuity as of december.
nebblett began her quest to obtain an immediate retirement annuity in,approximately five years after she left her job in newark.the application filed by nebblett on november,made no reference to the reasons for her resignation other than her stated vertigo stress.on february,opm denied nebblett application,and informed her that upon reaching years of age,she could reapply for an annuity.nebblett sought reconsideration of that decision,and opm responded in writing on may.opm decision recited the statutory tests of section for an immediate retirement annuity,and in each case concluded that nebblett facts did not meet the statutory tests.of particular relevance,opm stated that she had not been involuntarily separated from service and thus could not qualify for an annuity under subsection d.opm notified nebblett that she might pursue disability retirement benefits under,or,upon reaching years of age,pursue a deferred retirement annuity under a.
nebblett petitioned the board for review of the unfavorable reconsideration decision by opm.her petition was dismissed for untimeliness.nebblett next returned to opm,on august,with the assistance of counsel,filing a fresh application for an immediate retirement annuity.by separate letter to opm,nebblett counsel asserted that she is entitled to an immediate retirement annuity,because her resignation was involuntary,having been coerced.according to counsel,nebblett had been constructively discharged,against her will.nebblett thus alleged to opm,for the first time,that she is the victim of an unlawful adverse personnel action.
for reasons that are unclear from the record before us,opm did not finally respond to nebblett application until december.in its written rejection of her application,opm reasoned that even if your resignation was coerced,resignations,in any form are not generally deemed involuntary separations.opm further reasoned that nebblett request for personnel action afforded her the opportunity to furnish a specific reason for your resignation,and explained that failure to furnish such information could result in losing entitlement to pay or other compensation due you.in addition,opm stated that since her personnel file showed what could only be considered a voluntary resignation,and since opm relies on the agency certifying official determination of an employee separation,opm felt obligated to conclude that nebblett did not qualify for an immediate retirement annuity as a person who had been involuntarily separated from service.
nebblett returned to the board,seeking review of the final decision by opm.once underway at the board,however,opm rescinded its final decision,thus depriving the board of jurisdiction to hear nebblett appeal.on review in this court,we confirmed opm authority to rescind its reconsideration decisions,and held that if opm did not act within days to reinstate a reconsideration order,nebblett could treat its silence as an implicit negative reconsideration order,and reinitiate proceedings at the board.see nebblett office of pers,table.
within days,opm issued a reconsideration order,denying nebblett application,on the ground that the newly asserted theory of an involuntary separation is barred by the doctrine of administrative res judicata.nebblett then returned,once again,to the board seeking review of the may,opm reconsideration decision.an administrative judge of the board agreed with the agency that nebblett appeal is barred by the preclusive effects of her much earlier appeal to the board.on petition for review,however,the full board elected to hear nebblett challenge to the reconsideration decision.
the full board framed the issue before it as whether,assuming nebblett had been constructively discharged,she could be deemed to have been involuntarily separated,as that term is meant in d.the board referred to the federal personnel manual fpm,which was in effect when nebblett left her job,which defined involuntary separation to include reductions in force,expiration of an incumbent term of office,and other actions,all of which are proper and legal acts taken by an agency that result in an employee involuntary separation.citing allen office of pers,and sanderson office of pers,aff,table,cert.denied,d,the board concluded that resignation coerced by intolerable working conditions is not an involuntary separation for purposes of section d.its conclusion followed board precedent that distinguishes constructive discharges as unlawful adverse personnel actions from involuntary resignations for purposes of section d and holds that the latter must be of the lawful character of the examples cited in the fpm.
nebblett timely sought review of the board decision in this court.we have jurisdiction under a.
we may only disturb a final decision of the board if we determine that it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise contrary to law.c.for purposes of this appeal,we have before us a question of statutory interpretation.the issue is,as framed by the board,whether a coerced resignation is to be treated as an involuntary separation for purposes of sect
