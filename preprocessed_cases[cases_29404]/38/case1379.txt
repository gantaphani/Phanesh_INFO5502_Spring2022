background 
ellington served on active duty in the united states navy from october through september.id.at.during that time,he was exposed to jet fuel solvents and electromagnetic radiation,both of which are carcinogens.in october of,after being diagnosed with leukemia,ellington filed a claim with the cleveland ro for service connection for the condition.id.
the ro twice denied ellington claim for service connection for his leukemia,once in june and again in january.id.following the second denial,on october,ellington underwent a va compensation and pension rating examination to determine the service connectedness of his leukemia.id.as part of that examination,ellington completed a report for medical examination for disability evaluation,known as va form.id.in response to a question on the form asking him to list his symptoms,ellington provided the following information fatigue,skin problems from chemotherapy ear problems,high blood pressure borderline diabetic.id.
in september of,following his appeal,the board concluded that ellington leukemia was service connected and awarded him an effective date for the condition of october,the date his claim was filed.id.
on september,the cleveland ro received a letter from ellington representative purporting to be an an informal claim for service connection for diabetes and hypertension.id.at.an informal claim is a ny communication or action,indicating an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by the department of veterans affairs,from a claimant,his or her duly authorized representative,a member of congress,or some person acting as next friend of a claimant who is not sui juris.a see also rodriguez west.the ro initially denied ellington claim for service connection for these two ailments.ellington ii.at.in march of,however,the board awarded ellington service connection for both diabetes and hypertension as conditions secondary to his leukemia.id.a secondary condition is a disability which is proximately due to or the result of a disease or injury.a.one month later,the ro assigned each disability a september,effective date.ellington ii.at.
ellington appealed the cleveland ro assignment of a september,effective date to the board.before the board,ellington raised numerous arguments,only one of which is relevant to the present appeal.specifically,ellington argued that his secondary conditions,diabetes and hypertension,arose from his original condition of leukemia and must therefore receive an identical effective date.ellington i,slip op.at.the board summarily rejected this argument,concluding that it would be illogical to always extend the effective date for secondary conditions to the effective date for the underlying primary condition when the secondary conditions could potentially arise years after the onset of the primary condition.id.accordingly,the board affirmed the ro decision to assign a september,effective date to the secondary conditions.id.at.
ellington appealed the board decision to the veterans court.on september,the court affirmed the board decision in a decision.ellington ii.at.ellington then moved for panel reconsideration,which the court granted.id.accordingly,the court withdrew the decision and heard ellington appeal as a panel.id.
before the veterans court,ellington raised two alternative arguments,each directed at establishing an earlier effective date for his diabetes and hypertension.first,ellington argued that he was entitled to an october,effective date.id.at.in support of this argument,ellington pointed to a,which provides in relevant part that w hen service connection is established for a secondary condition,the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition.id.ellington maintained that section a must be read literally to provide that a secondary condition be treated completely identically to the original condition,which includes assigning to it the same effective date as the original condition.id.alternatively,ellington argued that he had made an informal claim for service connection for diabetes and hypertension when he listed those two symptoms on va form on october,and that he should therefore have that date as the effective date for his secondary conditions.id.at.
the veterans court rejected both of these arguments.with respect to ellington argument that a requires that a secondary condition receive an effective date identical to that assigned to the underlying primary condition,the court concluded that its decision in roper nicholson,aff,foreclosed such an interpretation of section a.ellington ii.at.in roper,the veterans court held that section a deals solely with entitlement to disability ratings,not with the administrative details of assigning such ratings.at.furthermore,the court noted,roper held that primary and secondary conditions must be afforded the same treatment.ellington ii.at roper.at.thus,the court concluded,the effective dates for both primary and secondary conditions are governed by,which provides that the effective date is the later of the date the condition arose or the date the veteran applied for benefits.ellington ii.at.accordingly,the court reasoned that since ellington applied for benefits on september,and since his diabetes and hypertension likely arose prior to that date,making the application date later than the date the conditions arose,he was properly assigned september,as the effective date for his diabetes and hypertension secondary conditions.id.
in addressing ellington argument that he informally filed for benefits on october,upon completing va form,the veterans court pointed to a.that regulation requires a veteran filing an informal claim to indicat e an intent to apply for one or more benefits under the laws administered by the va.a.while acknowledging its obligation to sympathetically read a veteran filing to determine if it constitutes an informal claim,moody principi,the court nonetheless concluded that,even reading ellington submissions in va form sympathetically,it was unable to conclude that he had expressed a sufficient intent to apply for service connection for diabetes and hypertension in,ellington ii.at.the court stated 
va form is designed to elicit information from a claimant for diagnostic purposes only.va had no reason to the appellant had no reason to an application for benefits was being filed each time he answered a question on the form by providing current medical information.
id.the veterans court did not,however,hold that statements made on va form could never constitute an informal claim.the court observed we de not hold that the submission of a document in connection with a va examination could never constitute an informal claim.id.at.rather,the court concluded that,in ellington case,the va could not properly discern an intent to apply for benefits from his mere listing of symptoms.id.as the court observed,ellington listed five symptoms on va form.id.yet,he only claimed service connection for two of those five symptoms,without providing any methodology by which the va could distinguish symptoms for which service connection was claimed from those for which it was not claimed.id.thus,the veterans court concluded,ellington statements on va form in did not constitute an informal claim,and he therefore could not claim an entitlement date earlier than september,for his secondary conditions.id.at.
discussion 
pursuant to c,we have limited jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court.boggs peake.specifically,we possess exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.c.we also have jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court on issues of law.jordan nicholson.however,e xcept to the extent that an appeal presents a constitutional issue,we may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.d.thus,we have jurisdiction to hear ellington appeal only to the extent that it raises issues of law.to the extent that ellington appeal raises issues of fact or issues of law applied to fact,we do not have jurisdiction to consider his claims.
in considering any issues of law properly raised by ellington appeal,we review de novo the decision of the veterans court.boggs,at summers gober.we set aside the veterans court conclusions on an issue of law if they are found to be a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or d without observance of procedure required by law.d.
on appeal,ellington raises two contentions.first,he argues that he is entitled to an october,effective date for his diabetes and hypertension.as he did before the veterans court,he urges that primary and secondary conditions must be treated identically and therefore must be assigned identical effective dates.alternatively,he argues that he is entitled to an october,effective date for his secondary conditions.he contends that his submission of va form constituted an informal claim and that his effective date should therefore arise upon the submission of that form.we address these contentions in turn.
in arguing for an october,effective date,ellington contends that the veterans court misinterpreted and in determining that a veteran can not receive secondary service connection for a disability until he or she has specifically filed a claim for service connection for that disability.pointing out that section does not distinguish between primary and secondary conditions,he argues that this lack of a distinction implicitly establishes that both types of claims must be treated identically,which includes the receipt of identical effective dates.ellington further argues that section reinforces such equal treatment of primary and secondary conditions.that section provides that secondary conditions are to be considered part of the original condition.for secondary conditions to be treated as part of the original condition,ellington argues,they must receive the same effective date.
ellington also contends that the veterans court erred in its reliance on roper.specifically,ellington maintains that roper presented a different legal issue from the one presented in this case and is distinguishable on the facts.in addition,he states that roper contains language suggesting that original and secondary conditions should receive similar treatment.see.at based on the regulatory history,we find that the plain meaning of the regulation is and has always been to require va to afford secondarily conditions the same treatment no more or less favorable treatment as the underlying conditions for all determinations.this language,ellington asserts,supports his contention that his secondary conditions should receive an effective date identical to that for his primary condition.
the government takes the position that we have jurisdiction to hear ellington claim for the october,effective date,which depends upon the purely legal issue of the proper interpretation of certain regulations.on the merits,the government responds to ellington contentions by arguing that his literal reading of conflicts both with the of and with the veterans court decision in roper.under section,the government argues,the effective date for any disability,primary or secondary,is the date of receipt of claim,or the date entitlement arose,whichever is later.thus,the government contends,the effective date for a secondary condition can not arise any earlier than the date on which a veteran applies for benefits related to that condition.according to the government,because ellington did not submit an application for benefits related to diabetes and hypertension until september,his effective date for those benefits can be no earlier than that date.
the government further notes that roper forecloses a literal interpretation of section that would require secondary and primary conditions to receive identical effective dates.according to the government,in roper the veterans court held that section deals only with entitlement to service connection and leaves to other provisions of the regulations,such as section,the details of assigning effective dates.
we agree with the parties that we have jurisdiction to consider ellington claim.ellington claim to an october,effective date depends entirely upon the interpretation of certain regulations,specifically and.we are thus presented with a purely legal issue,which we have the authority to adjudicate.
ellington correctly notes that section provides that w hen service connection is established for a secondary condition,the secondary condition shall be considered a part of the original condition.however,a requirement that a secondary condition be considered a part of an original condition does not,in our view,establish that the original condition and the secondary condition must receive identical effective dates.indeed,a per se rule requiring identical effective dates for primary and secondary conditions would be illogical,given that secondary conditions may not arise until years after the onset of the original condition.for instance,in the present case,the board noted that the evidence suggested that ellington did not develop diabetes or hypertension until after the effective date of his primary condition leukemia.ellington i,slip op.at.in addition,it is undisputed that ellington did not file a claim for service connection for diabetes and hypertension until september.accordingly,it would be illogical to award ellington an october,effective date for diabetes and hypertension when the evidence indicates that those conditions did not develop until some later date.thus,we agree with the veterans court that the effective date for secondary conditions is governed by section,which establishes the effective date as the date of receipt of claim,or the date entitlement arose,whichever is later.we think this result is consistent with,the statute which governs the effective date of awards.section a provides generally that u nless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter,the effective date of an award based on an original claim shall be fixed in accordance with the facts found,but shall not be earlier than the date of receipt of application therefor.the statute contains no exception to this rule for a claim,such as the one filed in this case,seeking service connection for an alleged secondary condition.
our view is in accord with the veterans court roper decision,which we affirmed without opinion.see.at.in that case,veteran benny roper argued,inter alia,that he was entitled to an increased disability rating for hearing loss and depression resulting from his service.see generally roper.specifically,roper incurred bilateral hearing loss from acoustic trauma caused by friendly gunshot fire during his service in korea.id.at.he received service connection for his hearing loss in november.id.his hearing worsened over the years,however,and he eventually developed depression as a consequence.id.he applied for secondary service connection for the depression,which his ro awarded in april.id.the ro determined that roper was entitled to a disability rating for the hearing loss and a disability rating for the depression.id.pursuant to a table set fo
