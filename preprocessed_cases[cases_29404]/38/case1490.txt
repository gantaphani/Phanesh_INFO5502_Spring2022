background 
sellers served on active duty from december to june.at the time of his discharge,his psychiatric condition was characterized as normal.in june,sellers requested a percent disability rating for ptsd.he underwent a va compensation and pension examination and,in a july rating decision,was initially granted service connection for ptsd that was percent disabling.in a subsequent rating decision in november,the ro continued the ptsd disability rating at percent.sellers appealed the november decision,and in august,the board reversed the ro adjudication and issued a decision increasing the disability rating for ptsd to percent.
in february,sellers filed an application for increased compensation based on unemployability.see after further medical evaluation,the ro continued sellers ptsd disability rating at percent and denied his entitlement to individual unemployability under section.sellers appealed this decision to the board.in connection with his appeal,he submitted additional medical evidence in the form of a physician statement supporting his claim for a total disability rating based on individual unemployability tdiu.the va examining psychiatrist diagnosed sellers with severe ptsd,noting that it affected all aspects of his life,particularly involving interpersonal relationships and including being unable to maintain gainful employment.in june,the ro issued a rating decision granting sellers entitlement to tdiu,but denying a disability rating of greater than percent for ptsd.sellers appealed to the board,which affirmed the ro decision.
by statute,the secretary has the authority to adopt and apply a schedule of ratings of reductions in earning capacity from specific injuries or combination of injuries.pursuant to that authority,the secretary has adopted such a schedule of ratings for mental disorders.the schedule is embodied in the general rating formula set forth at.the board began its analysis of sellers claim by noting that ptsd is a mental disorder and that the severity of ptsd is ascertained,for va rating purposes,by application of the criteria set forth in the general rating formula of section.board opinion,slip op.at see generally.section provides in part as follows 
section schedule of disorders.
the nomenclature employed in this portion of the rating schedule is based upon the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders,fourth edition,of the american psychiatric association.rating agencies must be thoroughly familiar with this manual to properly implement the directives in through and to apply the general rating formula for mental disorders in.the schedule for rating mental disorders is set forth as follows 
anxiety disorders

with the general rating formula before it,the board reviewed the various reports of sellers va medical examinations.board opinion,slip op.at.after considering the record,the board determined that a percent evaluation most closely approximates the veteran current disability level.id.at.
more specifically,the board found that 
the objective evidence of record does not show that he displays any of the symptoms suggestive of a percent schedular evaluation,such as gross impairment in thought processes or communication grossly inappropriate behavior persistent danger of hurting self or others intermittent ability to perform activities of daily living including maintenance of minimal personal hygiene disorientation to time or place memory loss for names of close relatives own occupation,or own name.
id.citing various symptoms from the general rating formula.the board considered other factors as well,such as sellers ability to manage his financial affairs without any assistance.id.the board concluded that i n brief,the totality of the evidence does not support a percent schedular evaluation.id.the board thus affirmed the ro rating decision.id.sellers timely appealed to the veterans court.
before the veterans court,sellers argued that in the va adopted the definition of ptsd contained in the from that,he contended that in relying on the factors listed in the general rating formula in his case,the board erred in interpreting the regulation.veterans court opinion,slip op.at.in other words,according to sellers,because the symptoms listed in the general rating formula are not found in the description of ptsd,the general rating formula should not be applied to ptsd claims.citing t he nomenclature employed in this portion of the rating schedule is based upon the sellers argued that the regulation requires that the va look to the to properly determine whether a veteran has total occupational and social impairment that results from his or her disability.according to sellers,the regulation requires that the va consider the symptoms of ptsd contained in the and make a finding of fact as to whether a veteran suffers total occupational and social impairment as a consequence of the severity of his or her symptoms.
the veterans court rejected sellers argument based on its decision in mauerhan.following its mauerhan precedent,the court held that the symptoms listed in the do not replace,but rather supplement,the criteria listed in the general rating formula as the basis for rating ptsd claims.id.the court further held that the board is not required to find the presence of all,most,or even some,of the enumerated symptoms in the general rating formula in order to justify a particular rating.id.citing mauerhan.at.the veterans court concluded that w hile the board is not restricted to considering only those symptoms listed in the general rating formula and may consider those identified in the,the criteria listed in the general rating formula are the rating formula adopted by the secretary in rating ptsd claims.id.at.the court thus affirmed the board decision in sellers case.
as noted above,hayday also is an army veteran of the vietnam war who suffers from ptsd.he timely appealed to the veterans court from the decision of the board that denied him a rating in excess of percent under for his ptsd.the veterans court affirmed the board decision,rejecting arguments similar to those made by sellers and relying on its mauerhan decision.hayday.
both hayday and sellers collectively,appellants appealed separately to this court.because the two cases present similar facts and concern identical legal issues,they were consolidated.
the veterans court asserted jurisdiction over appellants appeals pursuant to a.that statute provides that the veterans court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to review decisions of the board of veterans appeals.a.section b further provides that the veterans court may not review the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title or any action of the secretary in adopting or revising that schedule.id.b.
our jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court is limited by statute.id.forshey principi,en banc.we have exclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under,and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.c.our authority extends to deciding all relevant questions of law,and we must set aside a regulation or an interpretation of a regulation relied upon by the veterans court when we find it to be a arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or in violation of a statutory right or d without observance of procedure required by law.id.d.we may not review factual determinations or the application of law or regulation to a particular set of facts,unless a constitutional issue is presented.id.d.
no factual issues are presented in this case.rather,appellants challenge the veterans court interpretation of with respect to the relationship between the and the general rating formula.the government makes two arguments.first,it contends that appellants arguments represent a veiled attack on the substance of the ratings matter beyond the jurisdiction of both the veterans court and this court.in the alternative,the government urges that the veterans court made no error in interpreting.we address the jurisdictional argument first.
the government argues that,by asserting that the va should not look to the symptoms delineated in the general rating formula,but rather to the symptoms of ptsd in the,when rating a ptsd disability under,appellants are,in effect,challenging the substance of the rating schedule for mental disorders.according to the government,the statutory scheme makes it clear that congress intended to preclude judicial review of all issues pertaining to the content of the va schedule for rating disabilities,except insofar as constitutional issues are concerned.on this ground,the government challenges the jurisdiction of both the veterans court and this court to hear this matter.
appellants respond that expressly adopts the definition of ptsd contained in the.for this reason,they argue,the regulation requires that the va consider symptoms of ptsd contained in the and make findings of fact as to whether a veteran suffered increased occupational and social impairment as a consequence of the severity of those symptoms.on that basis,appellants argue that their case presents an issue of the correct interpretation of section,a matter within the jurisdiction of the veterans court and this court.
we agree with appellants that the veterans court properly exercised jurisdiction in these cases and that we have jurisdiction over appellants appeals.the government is certainly correct that neither we nor the veterans court may review the content of the ratings schedule at issue here.appellants are not asking us to do that,however.rather,they argue that 
according to the plain language of,the only criteria for a total disability rating for any disability rated in accordance with the va general rating formula for mental disorders are total occupational and social impairment.all that follows the phrase due to such symptoms as,are merely representative examples.va specifically recognized that the symptoms listed in the regulation were only examples and therefore not intended to be treated as rating criteria when it adopted.the denial of a total disability rating for ptsd solely on the ground that the veteran fails to exhibit any of the example symptoms and without making a determination of whether actual ptsd symptoms result in total occupational and social impairment violates the plain language of.
this argument goes not to the content of the rating criteria,but rather to the correct interpretation of section,specifically the relationship between the and the general rating formula.appellants are contending that the veterans court erred in interpreting section because,in sustaining the decision of the board,it gave improper weight to the merely representative examples in the general rating formula as opposed to the symptoms listed in the.in short,appellants claim that the veterans court and the board misread the regulation.appellants are challenging the va interpretation of a regulation.the veterans court,therefore,had jurisdiction under a,and we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
turning to the merits,as just seen,appellants argue that the board erred in its interpretation of section because it failed to consider any of the symptoms of ptsd identified in the.according to appellants,the only symptoms of ptsd recognized by the va are those contained in the.in addition,appellants contend that the manifestations of ptsd set forth in the general rating formula are neither rating criteria nor symptoms of ptsd.accordingly,appellants assert that we should find it impossible to read as providing that a veteran service connected for ptsd will be denied a total disability rating because he does not have symptoms completely unrelated to ptsd,those listed in section and without the least consideration of the symptoms of that disability officially recognized by the va,those listed in.put differently,appellants assert that a veteran who suffers total occupational and social impairment is entitled to a percent disability rating,irrespective of whether he or she has any of the symptom
