when an administrative law judge alj determines that a claimant for social security benefits is not malingering and has provided objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which might reasonably produce the pain or other symptoms she alleges,the alj may reject the claimant testimony about the severity of those symptoms only by providing specific,clear,and convincing reasons for doing so.we hold that an alj does not provide specific,clear,and convincing reasons for rejecting a claimant testimony by simply reciting the medical evidence in support of his or her residual functional capacity determination.to ensure that our review of the alj credibility determination is meaningful,and that the claimant testimony is not rejected arbitrarily,we require the alj to specify which testimony she finds not credible,and then provide clear and convincing reasons,supported by evidence in the record,to support that credibility determination.
here,the alj found generally that the claimant testimony was not credible,but failed to identify which testimony she found not credible and why.we conclude,therefore,that the alj committed legal error.this error was not harmless because it precludes us from conducting a meaningful review of the alj reasoning.we therefore vacate the district court judgment affirming the alj denial of benefits.because we conclude that critical factual issues remain unresolved,and that further proceedings will be useful,we instruct the district court to remand this case to the alj for further proceedings rather than for an immediate award of benefits.
kim brown hunter applied for social security disability benefits and supplemental security income on april.after the social security administration denied her claims initially and again on reconsideration,brown hunter timely requested and was granted a hearing before an alj.
at the hearing,brown hunter provided medical evidence that she suffered from obesity,peripheral neuropathy,lumbar degenerative disc disease,diabetes mellitus,migraine headaches,hypothyroidism,hypertension,and asthma.brown hunter told the alj that until she had worked as a certified nursing assistant,but had to stop working because she could no longer lift the patients or get them out of bed or in bed.she testified that she looked for other work until about,when it just got to the point where she could sit up or stand up or walk a distance.
brown hunter next described her functional limitations.she testified that she could not drive long distances,that she could lift only about ten pounds,and that she was able to sit only for about an hour and to stand only for about minutes.she described her daytime routine as sit ting in the garage for a couple hours,which was often interrupted by the need to lie down like four or five times for about thirty minutes because her feet and legs would swell up when she was on them too much.in the evenings,she stated she would talk,visit,and watch television with her son and daughter,and that if she needed something from the store,her daughter would get it for her.when the alj asked about her ability to do housework,brown hunter stated that she was able to pick up some,but was not able to sweep anymore or mop or vacuum or bend down for the dishwasher.
brown hunter told the alj that her functional limitations were caused in part by severe back and leg pain,coupled with swelling in her lower extremities.when the alj asked if anything alleviated this pain and swelling,brown hunter replied that elevating her feet,as prescribed by her doctors,helped with the leg and feet pain,but that w ith my back i have to l ie down.brown hunter stated that to control the pain and swelling effectively,she needed to elevate her feet twice a week for thirty minutes to an hour,and to lie down three to four times a day for thirty minutes to an hour.brown hunter also provided evidence that she was taking roughly twenty medications,including strong pain medications,such as oxycodone.
after brown hunter concluded her testimony,the alj turned to the vocational expert.the alj asked the vocational expert a series of hypothetical questions to identify the occupations that existed in significant numbers in the national economy that an individual could perform,assuming such an individual had brown hunter same age,education,past work experience,and functional limitations.
the alj began by asking the vocational expert which occupations would be available to such individual limited to a range of light work as defined under the regulations,but with the ability to do no more than occasional pushing and pulling with the upper and lower extremities.the vocational expert identified a handful of possible jobs,including light janitorial or light office cleaning,and an unskilled,light a ssembly position.when the alj asked how his testimony would change if that hypothetical was modified to add that the individual would be off task to percent of the work day,the vocational expert replied that such individual would not be able to sustain the work.
the alj then allowed brown hunter counsel to question the vocational expert.as relevant here,counsel asked the vocational expert to assume an individual with lower extremity swelling who needed to elevate her feet thirty minutes to one hour twice a week 
q if we were to assume those limitations,would such an individual be able to perform claimant past work 
q would there be any other job they could sustain 
a not likely 
q and if an individual needed to rest or lie down two or three times a day for thirty minutes at a time,and it was unscheduled,would that preclude such an individual from performing claimant past work 
q would it allow for any other jobs 
shortly after this testimony the hearing concluded.
several weeks later,the alj issued a written decision denying brown hunter claims.following the social security act procedure for determining disability,see a,the alj concluded at step one that brown hunter had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since the date of the alleged onset.at step two,the alj concluded that brown hunter suffered from the severe impairments of obesity,peripheral neuropathy,lumbar degenerative disc disease ddd,diabetes mellitus dm,and migraine headaches.however,at step three,the alj concluded that those impairments did not either in isolation or in combination meet or equal a listed impairment.see,subpart p,app x.this conclusion required the alj to then determine brown hunter residual functional capacity rfc in preparation for step four.
the alj began her discussion of the rfc with her conclusion that brown hunter had the rfc to perform light work except she can perform no more than occasional pushing and pulling with the upper and lower extremities.the alj then acknowledged her duty to evaluate the intensity,persistence,and limiting effects of the claimant symptoms to determine the extent to which they limit the claimant functioning,and,where appropriate,to make a finding on the credibility of the statements based on a consideration of the entire case record.she went on to paraphrase brown hunter testimony regarding the chronology of her back pain,followed by a summary of the treatments and prescriptions for that pain,the symptoms pertaining to brown hunter diabetic peripheral neuropathy,as well as brown hunter height,weight,smoking habits,and ability to drive short distances,sit for one hour and stand for minutes.
following that summary,the alj concluded that although brown hunter medically determinable impairments could reasonably be expected to cause some of the alleged symptoms,her statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment.
finally,after devoting the next eight paragraphs to summarizing the medical evidence in the record,the alj stated 
after careful consideration of the entire record,including the medical evidence and the testimony at the hearing,i find the functional limitations resulting from the claimant impairments were less serious than she has alleged while the medical evidence supports a finding that the claimant impairments impos e some restrictions,they did not prevent her from engaging in all work related activities.
consequently,the alj proceeded to step four and concluded that brown hunter limited rfc precluded her from performing any past relevant work.but at step five,the alj determined that,considering brown hunter rfc,age,education,and work experience,she was able to do other work that existed in significant numbers in the national economy.citing the vocational expert testimony that a hypothetical individual with the same age,education,and past relevant work experience as brown hunter could perform occupations such as light janitorial and assembly,the alj concluded that brown hunter was not disabled under the social security act.
the alj decision became final when the social security appeals council denied review.brown hunter then appealed from the alj decision to the district court.she argued that the alj erred by fail ing to provide clear and convincing reasons for rejecting her symptom testimony.the district court rejected her argument,holding that the alj gave clear and convincing reasons to support her determination that brown hunter impairments were less serious than she has alleged.the district court pieced together medical evidence identified by the alj that it found inconsistent with an allegation of excess pain,and stated therefore that the alj identified several inconsistencies between brown hunter testimony and the record,and gave clear and convincing reasons to support her determinations that brown hunter impairments were less serious than she has alleged.the district court affirmed the alj decision,and brown hunter timely filed this appeal,over which we have jurisdiction pursuant to.
we review de novo a district court order affirming an alj denial of social security benefits.hill astrue,cir.on de novo review,we must bear in mind that a federal court review of social security determinations is quite limited.for highly individualized determinations like a claimant entitlement to disability benefits,congress places a premium upon agency expertise,and,for the sake of uniformity,it is usually better to minimize the opportunity for reviewing courts to substitute their discretion for that of the agency.treichler comm r of,sec,cir,quoting consolo fed.comm n.to ensure that we adhere to this principle,we follow three important rules in our analysis of the alj decision.
the first is that we leave it to the alj to determine credibility,resolve conflicts in the testimony,and resolve ambiguities in the record.treichler,at.the second is that we will disturb the commissioner decision to deny benefits only if it is not supported by substantial evidence or is based on legal error,quoting andrews shalala,cir.the third is that e ven when the alj commits legal error,we uphold the decision where that error is harmless,meaning that it is inconsequential to the ultimate nondisability determination,or that,despite the legal error,the agency path may reasonably be discerned,even if the agency explains its decision with less than ideal clarity.at internal quotation marks and citations omitted.
that said,our precedents have been cautious about when harmless error should be found.marsh colvin,wl,cir.june.ever mindful of our duty not to substitute our own discretion for that of the agency,we have emphasized that the decision on disability rests with the alj and the commissioner of the social security administration in the first instance,not with a district court.id.at.thus,although we will not fault the agency merely for explaining its decision with less than ideal clarity,treichler,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted,we still demand that the agency set forth the reasoning behind its decisions in a way that allows for meaningful review.a clear statement of the agency reasoning is necessary because we can affirm the agency decision to deny benefits only on the grounds invoked by the agency.stout comm r,sec,cir.
a reviewing court may not make independent findings based on the evidence before the alj to conclude that the alj error was harmless.see also marsh,wl,a district court may not find harmless error by affirm ing the agency on a ground not invoked by the alj.rather,w e are constrained to review the reasons the alj asserts.connett barnhart,cir.if the alj fails to specify his or her reasons for finding claimant testimony not credible,a reviewing court will be unable to review those reasons meaningfully without improperly substitut ing our conclusions for the alj,or speculat ing as to the grounds for the alj conclusions.treichler,at.because we can not engage in such substitution or speculation,such error will never be harmless.
where,as here,an alj concludes that a claimant is not malingering,and that she has provided objective medical evidence of an underlying impairment which might reasonably produce the pain or other symptoms alleged,the alj may reject the claimant testimony about the severity of her symptoms only by offering specific,clear and convincing reasons for doing so.lingenfelter astrue,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.the commissioner disputes that standard of review.relying primarily on bunnell sullivan,cir,the commissioner argues that although the court reviews the alj credibility finding for adequate specificity,clear and convincing reasons are not required.we recently rejected this argument in burrell colvin,cir holding that the clear and convincing requirement actually predated bunnell and was not excised by it.burrell therefore forecloses the commissioner argument.
a finding that a claimant testimony is not credible must be sufficiently specific to allow a reviewing court to conclude the adjudicator rejected the claimant testimony on permissible grounds and did not arbitrarily discredit a claimant testimony regarding pain.bunnell,at citation and internal quotation marks omitted.general findings are insufficient rather,the alj must identify what testimony is not credible and what evidence undermines the claimant complaints.reddick chater,cir citation and internal quotation marks omitted.see also holohan massanari,cir the alj must specifically identify the testimony she or he finds not to be credible and must explain what evidence undermines the testimony emphasis added.the governing social security rulings,which are binding on all components of the social security administration,and are to be relied upon as precedents in adjudicating cases,orn.astrue,cir,quoting.at,are clear on this point 
it is not sufficient for the adjudicator to make a single,conclusory statement that the individual allegations have been considered or that the allegations are not credible.the determination must contain specific reasons for the finding on credibility,supported by the evidence in the case record,and must be sufficiently specific to make clear to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the individual statements and the reasons for that weight.
social security ruling,wl at july,emphasis added.
following these principles in treichler,for example,we held that the alj erred by making only a single general statement that the claimant statements concerning the intensity,persistence and limiting effects of these symptoms are not credible to the extent they are inconsistent with the above residual functional capacity assessment,without identifying sufficiently specific reasons for rejecting the testimony,supported by evidence in the case record.at.the alj here made the identical conclusory statement and likewise failed to identify specifically which of brown hunter statements she found not credible and why.instead,the alj stated only that she found,based on unspecified claimant testimony and a summary of medical evidence,that the functional limitations from the claimant impairments were less serious than she has alleged.
we disagree with the district court that the alj identified several inconsistencies between brown hunter testimony and the record,and therefore gave clear and convincing reasons to support her determination.our review of the alj written decision reveals that she
