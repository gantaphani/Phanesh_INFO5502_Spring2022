the false claims act fca,authorizes private parties to bring qui tam actions on the government behalf alleging fraud on government programs.although such actions can be powerful weapons for rooting out chicanery shrouded in darkness,the fca forbids private suits once the sun has shone on the essential features of the alleged misconduct.thus,courts generally must refuse to entertain fca suits if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action were already publicly disclosed through certain enumerated sources.id.e a.
applying this provision,known as the public disclosure bar,the court below determined that the complaint in this action rested on allegations that were already in the light of day.see united states ex rel.winkelman cvs caremark,supp.consequently,it dismissed the relators suit.see id.after careful consideration,we affirm.
background 
we draw the essential facts from the relators second amended complaint and other documents,described infra,that may be considered at the stage.
the relators,myron winkelman and stephani martinsen,brought this qui tam action under the fca and in its current form the analogous statutes of eleven states.in it,they challenged particular billing practices of cvs caremark and certain affiliated companies collectively,cvs.the main target of their complaint was cvs conduct with respect to a program that the company had instituted in.that program was known as the health savings pass hsp.a consumer could join the hsp program by paying a nominal enrollment fee originally and later increased to.hsp membership entitled a consumer,among other things,to purchase a range of generic prescription drugs from cvs at discounted prices either or for a supply.
the relators assert that the hsp framework was a carefully constructed artifice that allowed cvs to fraudulently overbill medicare part d and medicaid.both of these federal healthcare programs contain conditions designed to control the cost to the government of prescription drugs.one such condition is of particular pertinence here that condition bases payments for prescription drugs by medicaid and medicare on the lowest of several potential metrics,one of which is the usual and customary price charged by a pharmacy for a given drug.see d medicare part d id.b medicaid.for medicare part d,the federal government has promulgated a single definition of the price the price that an pharmacy charges a customer who does not have any form of prescription drug coverage for a covered part d drug.id.medicaid is a program that is jointly administered by the federal government and the several states,so each state provides its own definition of the price 
the relators allege that cvs designed the hsp program to circumvent the applicable requirements that the hsp prices reflect the actual prices charged by cvs under all the relevant federal and state statutes and regulations and that cvs defrauds the government by not reporting the hsp prices as its prices.they offer examples of drugs for which the price reported by cvs was higher than the price charged to participants in the hsp program,allegedly leading to overpayments by medicaid and medicare part 
but the filing of the relators action did not mark the first occasion that cvs hsp pricing came under scrutiny.in february of,a coalition of labor unions under the banner change to win issued a report comparing the hsp drug prices charged by cvs with prices charged by cvs for the same drugs to federal employees enrolled in the federal employee health benefits program fehbp.the report concluded that in its role as the fehbp pharmacy benefits manager,cvs overcharged by hundreds of millions of dollars.this conclusion rested primarily on the report finding that the prices charged by cvs to the fehbp were higher than the counterpart hsp prices for of generic drugs available in both programs.news outlets pounced upon the change to win report and reported its findings extensively.
the allegations attracted attention in washington as well a change to win representative testified before congress in late february of and advocated revising the fehbp prescription drug program.in november of,a congressional research service crs report rehearsed some of change to win allegations.
meanwhile after the issuance of the change to win report but before the issuance of the crs report connecticut altered its statutes to explicitly require cvs to take its hsp prices into account in its dealings with the state medicaid program.cvs responded by threatening to end the hsp program in connecticut.battling back,the attorney general of connecticut announced that he had subpoenaed cvs to obtain details related to the administration of the hsp program.in a press release,issued in june of,the attorney general vouchsafed that 
cvs caremark actions are at odds with other pharmacies that have extended their discount program drug pricing to the state medicaid program and may be inconsistent with cvs caremark actions in other states.
under the health savings pass program,consumers pay a year to fill a prescription of one of generic drugs for and receive other benefits.state law requires pharmacies to charge medicaid the lowest drug price they offer consumers,which the state says obligates cvs to provide the health savings pass discount,potentially saving taxpayers millions of dollars.
cvs disagreed,prompting the general assembly to approve a law in the last session clarifying the requirement.cvs responded by threatening to end its health savings pass program in connecticut.
the press release highlighted the fact that cvs was continuing to offer the hsp program to consumers in other states.it declared that cvs has an obligation to charge the state of connecticut the same discounted price for drugs for connecticut medicaid recipients that cvs caremark charges to customers enrolled in the hsp pharmacy discount program.the ensuing subpoena sought information about how hsp prices compared to those billed connecticut medicaid program,cvs costs for those medications,the details of hsp enrollment in connecticut,and information about states in which the program operated.
the attorney general activities attracted appreciable media attention,and all of the significant information contained in the press release was replicated in the ensuing media coverage.the media also reported cvs response,including the company assertion that connecticut medicaid regulations did not require cvs to pass on hsp prices to the state medicaid program.
it was not until august of over a year after the outpouring of publicity regarding cvs refusal to give connecticut the benefit of its hsp pricing that the relators brought this suit.the relators filed an amended complaint in march of,and a second amended complaint in june of.these various iterations of the complaint were kept under seal while the federal government and the designated states considered whether to intervene.see b.
once the united states and all the states named in the second amended complaint had declined to intervene,the district court unsealed the action on august.see id.cvs then moved to dismiss.see fed.civ.b.its flagship claim was that the publicity surrounding the change to win initiative and the actions of the connecticut attorney general triggered the fca public disclosure bar.the relators opposed the motion.after briefing and argument,the district court found the public disclosure bar dispositive and dismissed the action.see winkelman,supp.at.this timely appeal followed.
ii.analysis 
on appeal,the relators insist that the disclosures surrounding the change to win report and the connecticut controversy do not suffice to trigger the public disclosure bar.we divide our treatment of their asseverational array into three segments.first,we clear some procedural underbrush affecting the scope of the relevant record.second,we determine whether a public disclosure occurred and,if so,whether that disclosure limned a fraud substantially similar to the one alleged in the complaint.finally having concluded that the public disclosure bar is in place we analyze whether the relators qualify for an exception to that bar as original sources.
a.the scope of the record.
our standard of review is clear we engage in a de novo canvass,accepting as true the facts and drawing all reasonable inferences in the favor.see mccloskey mueller,cir.what is less clear,however,is the scope of the relevant record.we briefly explain this quandary and craft a solution.
the fca contains qui tam provisions that allow private persons,called relators,to bring civil suits on behalf of the united states against those alleged to have knowingly submitted false claims to the federal government.see b.if such a suit succeeds,the relator earns a share of the proceeds.see id.d.though this statutory paradigm has the salutary purpose of encouraging the disclosure of fraudulent schemes,it also creates perverse incentives for opportunists to seek compensation based on fraud already apparent from information in the public domain.although not every application of the public disclosure bar involves this sort of opportunistic behavior,the bar is an especially apt means of foreclos ing qui tam actions in which a relator,instead of plowing new ground,attempts to by merely repastinating previously disclosed badges of fraud.united states ex rel.ondis city of woonsocket,cir.
the contours of the public disclosure bar underwent some alterations during the period covered by this action.prior to,the pertinent provision stated that n o court shall have jurisdiction over an action under this section based upon the public disclosure of allegations or transactions from any one of several enumerated sources.e a.this explicit language spoke directly to the subject matter jurisdiction of the court.see rockwell int l united states.consequently,motions to dismiss premised on the public disclosure bar were adjudicated under rule b.see united states ex rel.poteet bahler,cir.ondis,at.
this approach was made questionable by the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca,pub,j,stat,which reshaped the contours of the public disclosure bar to provide in pertinent part that t he court shall dismiss an action or claim under this section,unless opposed by the government,if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed.e a.
here,the parties dispute whether the reconfigured public disclosure bar is jurisdictional.the district court,citing decisions from several of our sister circuits,concluded that it is not.see winkelman,supp.at citing,inter alia,united states ex rel.osheroff humana,cir.united states ex rel.may purdue pharma,cir,cert.denied.the court noted that the supreme court has cautioned against reading statutes as jurisdictional in the absence of a clear legislative statement to that effect,see sebelius auburn reg l med,that congress deliberately removed language from the reconfigured public disclosure bar and that the amended provision permits the government,for the first time,to block a dismissal despite earlier public disclosures a circumstance that if the public disclosure bar remained jurisdictional would contravene the cardinal principle that parties can not confer jurisdiction on a district court by acquiescence,trenkler united states,cir.
although we find the district court analysis impressive,we recognize that appellate courts should not rush to resolve questions of statutory interpretation when it is not necessary to do so.that maxim is especially appropriate where,as here,the statutory change straddles the relevant events and,thus,presents potential retroactivity concerns.see may,at.at any rate,we need not resolve this jurisdictional question.the parties note only two aspects of the case that might turn on whether or not the public disclosure bar is jurisdictional.
the first aspect hawked by the relators is a red herring.they suggest that if the public disclosure bar is no longer jurisdictional,then it must be viewed as an affirmative defense.building on this foundation,they argue that an affirmative defense can not be resolved at the stage.but even accepting the premise of the relators suggestion,their conclusion is wrong an affirmative defense may serve as a basis for dismissal under rule b.see banco santander de in re colonial mortg.bankers,cir.
second,cvs contends that a determination as to whether the public disclosure bar is jurisdictional may affect the scope of the relevant record.this concern affects two declarations submitted by the relators as part of their opposition to the motion to dismiss,which could be considered in evaluating the existence of jurisdiction under rule b.see aguilar ice,cir.however,the relators decision to attach these declarations to their opposition to a motion to dismiss leaves them outside the scope of the pleadings and,thus,outside the compass of the record under rule b.see rodi new england sch.of law,cir.but there is no need to let the tail wag the dog rather than deciding the jurisdictional question in order to determine whether these two documents are part of the relevant record,we assume favorably to the relators that these declarations are properly before us.indulging this assumption permits us to bypass the jurisdictional question and the assumption is practicable because,in the end,the declarations make no difference to the result that we must reach.
we add a coda.the press release,news articles,crs report,and record of congressional testimony are properly before us regardless of whether the public disclosure bar is jurisdictional.after all,even within the rule b framework,a court may consider matters of public record and facts susceptible to judicial notice.see in re colonial mortg.bankers,at.here,the district court,at cvs request and without objection,took judicial notice of the proffered press release,news articles,crs report,and record of congressional testimony.see winkelman,supp.at.this praxis is fully consistent with the approach of our sister circuits,which routinely have considered undisputed documents provided by the parties in connection with rule b motions based on the public disclosure bar.see united states ex rel.moore majestic blue fisheries,llc,cir.osheroff,at,united states ex rel.kraxberger.city power light,cir.
b.the public disclosure bar.
as we already have noted,the public disclosure bar forecloses a qui tam action if substantially the same allegations or transactions as alleged in the action were publicly disclosed in a list of enumerated sources.e a.in applying this provision,we examine whether the allegations or transactions identified in the relators complaint have already been publicly disclosed.see ondis,at.if so,we then examine whether that disclosure occurred through one of the statutorily prescribed methods.see id.and if these two queries yield affirmative answers,we proceed to examine whether the allegations or transactions on which the relators suit rests are substantially the same as the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions see id.
the relators do not contest that the materials cited by cvs appeared in statutorily enumerated sources.they argue,however,that there was no public disclosure of the relevant allegations or transactions and that the disclosures upon which cvs relies did not reveal allegations or transactions that were substantially the same as those that anchored their complaint.their fallback position is that,in all events,their action evades the public disclosure bar because they meet the statutory definition of original source.e b.
as a general matter,a public disclosure occurs when the essential elements exposing the particular transaction as fraudulent find their way into the public domain.ondis,at.this type of disclosure can occur in one of two ways either through a direct allegation of fraud or through the revelation of both a misrepresented state of facts and a true state of facts so that the listener or reader may infer fraud.poteet,at.these sets of facts may originate in different sources,as long as they lead to a plausible inference of fraud when combined.ondis,at.the ultimate inquiry,of course,is whether the government has received fair notice,prior to the suit,about the potential existence of the fraud.see dingle bioport,cir.
in the relators words,the true state of affairs was that cvs was illegally refusing to charge the medicaid and medicare programs its true lower prices,in multiple states,and was hiding that fact.the misrepresented state of affairs,they allege,grew out of cvs false assertion that it was giving its prices to the medicaid and medicare programs.they add that,prior to the institution of their suit,no public disclosure of either set of facts occurred.
this disclaimer rings hollow when the connecticut publicity is factored into the mix the attorney general press release,parroted in the subsequent news articles,made manifest the state belief that its regulations mandated that cvs provide medicaid with the lowest drug price that cvs was offering to consumers,which the state contended was the hsp price.this cutting of corners,the attorney general contended,meant that taxpayers missed out on savings potentially amounting to millions of dollars.nor was cvs stubborn refusal to treat hsp prices as prices in doubt.the press release and resulting media coverage dwelt,with conspicuous clarity,upon cvs persistent practice of not giving medicaid the hsp price.indeed,once the connecticut legislature amended its medicaid statutes to mandate that cvs provide the hsp prices to the state medicaid program,cvs threatened to end the hsp program entirely.
on this record,it requires hardly an inferential step to connect the allegedly true and allegedly misrepresented facts.the publicly disclosed materials revealed,quite plainly,that cvs was not providing its hsp price as its price to connecticut medicaid program.that is precisely why the connecticut legislature essayed a statutory fix.see.stat.so,too,those materials revealed connecticut belief that the hsp prices should have been provided to the state medicaid program even before the statutory change.the allegations and transactions that comprised the essential elements of the claimed fraud were in plain sight after these disclosures.
in an effort to resist this conclusion,the relators submit that the connecticut disclosures showed only a price gouging scheme,not a scheme to defraud medicaid and medicare part d.this quibbling is unavailing the public disclosure bar contains no requirement that a public disclosure use magic words or specifically label disclosed conduct as fraudulent.see united states ex rel.advocates for basic legal,able bank,cir.a relator ability to recognize the legal consequences of a publicly disclosed fraudulent transaction does not alter the fact that the material elements of the violation already have been publicly disclosed.united states ex rel.findley emps.club,cir.accord ambul,california,cir.enough was revealed in the connecticut disclosures to put the government on notice of the potential fraud without the aid of these relators.
the relators next asseverate that the earlier disclosures do not unmask substantially the same allegations or transactions as the scheme identified in their complaint.this asseveration,too,lacks force.
in evaluating substantial similarity,an inquiring court should bear in mind the core purpose of the fca to encourage suits by individuals with valuable knowledge of fraud unknown to the government.see ondis,at.the public disclosure bar safeguards this interest because w hen the material elements of a fraud are already in the public domain,the government has no need for a relator to bring the matter to its attention.id.it follows logically,we think,that a complaint that targets a scheme previously revealed through public disclosures is barred even if it offers greater detail about the underlying conduct.see poteet,at.
these principles control here.the relators describe their complaint as focus ing on the cvs retail pharmacies and alleg ing that when cvs submitted claims to medicaid and medicare part d it illegally and knowingly did not give the hsp discount prices to the governments and did not report the hsp prices as the prices.but this was not new ground the anatomy of this scheme was comprehensively revealed in the connecticut disclosures.those disclosures openly discussed the hsp program,its inexpensive pricing arrangement,cvs unwillingness to provide the hsp prices in its dealings with connecticut medicaid,and the state belief that cvs was required to do so.
the relators labor to distinguish their complaint from the public disclosures by emphasizing its breadth the medicare part d program was never mentioned in the connecticut disclosures,nor did those disclosures aver that cvs was allegedly playing fast and loose with the medicaid program in other states.this argument elevates form over substance.when it is already clear from the public disclosures that a given requirement common to multiple programs is being violated and that the same potentially fraudulent arrangement operates in other states where the defendant does business,memorializing those easily inferable deductions in a complaint does not suffice to distinguish the relators action from the public disclosures.
so it is here.the public disclosures spelled out the workings of the alleged scheme in the context of the connecticut medicaid program.the relators complaint described the same alleged scheme and the scheme worked in essentially the same way under both medicare part d and the range of other state medicaid programs.because the complaint targets the same fraudulent scheme that was laid bare in the connecticut disclosures,the identification of additional government programs does nothing more than add a level of detail to knowledge that was already in the public domain.see united states ex rel.bogina medline,cir.that is not enough to duck the public disclosure bar.
the relators attempt to gain traction from our decision in united states ex rel.estate of cunningham millenium laboratories of california,cir,does not get them very far.cunningham turned on the entirely unremarkable proposition that allegations of fraud distinct from previous disclosures are not blocked by the public disclosure bar.that proposition is inapposite where,as here,the fraud alleged is substantially the same as the one previously disclosed.
to say more on this point would be supererogatory.we hold that the essential elements of the transactions and events underlying the relators allegations were publicly disclosed in the course of the earlier connecticut dispute and that the scheme depicted in those earlier disclosures was substantially the same as the scheme depicted in the relators complaint.thus,unless an exception applies a question to which we next turn the public disclosure bar pretermits the relators action.
c.the original source exception.
the relators claim that their action nevertheless survives under the original source exception to the public disclosure bar.see e a b.congress altered the definition of original source as part of the ppaca amendments in for the first time,the statute provides alternative original source definitions based on the timing of the public disclosure.first,a relator who prior to a public disclosure has voluntarily disclosed to the government the information on which allegations or transactions in a claim are based is considered an original source.id.e b i.the relators do not contend that they meet this definition.instead,they seek refuge in a narrower second category of original sources individuals who,despite not having provided their information to the government prior to a public disclosure,nonetheless possess knowledge that is independent of and materially adds to the publicly disclosed allegations or transactions and have voluntarily provided the information to the government before filing an action under this section.id.e b.
it follows that relators who do not come forward until after a public disclosure has occurred face additional hurdles to original source status.in this instance,the relators attempt to assume the mantle of original source status can not clear the materially adds hurdle and,thus,we do not address the independent knowledge hurdle.
the meaning of the materially adds language in the original source exception is a matter of first impression for this court.at its most abecedari
