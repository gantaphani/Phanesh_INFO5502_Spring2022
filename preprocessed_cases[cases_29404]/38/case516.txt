background 
born june,is a child,who was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at an early age.his parents enrolled him in private and elementary schools through the early part of.on february,during kindergarten year,he was dismissed from a parochial school after the school determined that it did not have the resources needed to properly educate him.the parochial school offered to refer to the local public school for services,but at that time his parents refused to allow the parochial school to make the referral.
a week after was dismissed from the parochial school,his parents took him to the university of chicago hyperactivity,attention,and learning problems clinic for an independent evaluation.that evaluation recommended,inter alia,that attend a school with a low teacher student ratio and noted that the best setting for would likely be a private,therapeutic day school.
in march and april of,mother spoke at various times with the public school district director of special ed,mary ann cusick.during these conversations.mother sought information about the school district programs and apparently expressed some reluctance to enroll in the school district,based on older brother experience there.at some point during this period,mother visited the local public school that would attend.during this visit,she met with the principal and the kindergarten teacher,and the school provided her with further information about the services that would be available to within the context of the regular classroom setting.at no point during march or april of,did the school district request written consent to conduct a evaluation of to determine his potential eligibility for various programs.
in september,parents enrolled him in the first grade at acacia academy,a private therapeutic day school.acacia,however,would only allow to attend if his parents hired a aide to accompany him.after a short period of attending only,parents hired an aide and thereafter attended.
due process administrative proceedings 
on august,approximately five months after mother first contacted the public school district officials,parents requested,through their attorney,a due process hearing before a state administrative hearing officer as provided for by f of the idea.in their hearing request,parents alleged that the school district had i fail ed to evaluate despite actual notice that he may require services ii fail ed to notify them that the school district had decided not to conduct a case study evaluation iii fail ed to consider their independent evaluation and iv fail ed to appropriately advise them of the placement options for within the public school setting other than full inclusion placements,in a regular classroom setting.parents claimed that as a result of these failures the school district had denied the free,appropriate public education guaranteed by the idea.
part of the relief requested by parents was that the school conduct an evaluation to determine eligibility under the idea for services.on october,the hearing officer conducted a conference on this issue,after which the hearing officer determined that a evaluation was necessary and ordered the school to conduct the evaluation.following this order,on november,the school conducted the evaluation and convened an individualized education program iep conference,as required by the idea.as a result of the evaluation and conference,was determined to have an disorder and a speech language impairment,and was found eligible for services from the school district.the school district recommended that be placed at the local public school in a classroom,with supplemental services to address special needs.parents rejected the recommended placement.
the administrative due process hearing commenced on december.the parents sought i reimbursement for their placement of at acacia for the academic year ii reimbursement for the aide to assist at the private school iii reimbursement for transportation to and from acacia and iv reimbursement for the independent evaluation they had obtained from the university of chicago.
in a ruling rendered on december,the hearing officer made findings that as of the last week of march,the school district knew that might require services and should have requested the parent written consent to conduct a evaluation of at that time.further,pursuant to the case study,the school should have identified the student needs and formulated program and service options.it was not until the hearing officer ordered the evaluation that these things were accomplished.the hearing officer found that the school district failings contributed to the parents need to place in the private school and to obtain a aide.therefore,the hearing officer ordered the school district to reimburse parents for their costs for the aide,a cost of about per month and for the costs of transportation to the school,a cost of about per ride,from september until the school district could provide the appropriate services.as to educational placement,however,the hearing officer found that the private school in which was enrolled could not adequately meet his needs.therefore,he denied reimbursement for the private school tuition,and he ordered that be transferred to a regular mainstream classroom at the local public school with supplemental services.
district court proceedings and settlement 
appealed to federal district court,seeking reversal of the proposed placement in a regular classroom,asking instead for continued placement at the private day school.further,he sought reimbursement of the tuition already paid by his parents for the day school.he also asked for the relief already granted by the hearing officer,namely the reimbursement of the aide cost and transportation costs.finally,he sought attorney fees and costs.
both parties moved for summary judgment,but before the district court ruled,the parties settled.the settlement agreement provided that would be placed in a behavior disordered program as opposed to a regular classroom in a public school.the school district agreed to reimburse parents for tuition and all costs in any way resulting from or relating to attendance at the private day school,a total of.the parties did not reach an agreement regarding attorney fees,specifically leaving the issue for decision by the district court.
the district court rendered its decision on attorney fees on october,holding that was a prevailing party and therefore was entitled to attorney fees under the idea provision.in finding that was a prevailing party,the district court noted that he had succeeded on a significant issue when he obtained the evaluation,which determined that he was eligible for services.the court went on to state 
i rrespective of how much parents prevailed in the hearing or in my court,i find that parents obtained through settlement the balance of what they desired and td needed.td placement in a behavior disordered classroom in a public school is the direct result of parent litigation on the issue of td placement and the settlement represents a significant departure from la grange proposal to educate td in a regular mainstream classroom with a aide.
importantly,the district court held that the supreme court recent decision in buckhannon did not apply to the idea.the district court expressly stated that it was not deciding whether attorney fees would be appropriate under the strictures of buckhannon.
the district court awarded in attorney fees and costs.the school district now appeals that decision.
ii.analysis 
buckhannon and the idea 
the idea,like many other federal statutes,provides that courts may award attorney fees to a prevailing party 
in any action or proceeding brought under this section,the court,in its discretion,may award reasonable attorneys fees as part of the costs to the parents of a child with a disability who is the prevailing party.
i b.in buckhannon,the supreme court limited the meaning of the term prevailing party,by rejecting the catalyst theory as a method of attaining status under the americans with disabilities act ada and fair housing amendments act fhaa.at.under the catalyst theory,which had been accepted by many courts before buckhannon,a plaintiff could prevail,if the plaintiff suit was a catalyst that prompted the change that the plaintiff sought.buckhannon,however,held that a party could not be a prevailing party without receiving some sort of judicial imprimatur on the charge.id.at.central to the court conclusion was its finding that the term prevailing party was a legal term of art,which signified that the party that had been granted relief by a court.id.at.as examples of the type of relief necessary to attain prevailing party status,the court cited a judgment on the merits and a consent decree.id.at.
the school district argues that since this case was ultimately resolved through a private settlement,without a judicial imprimatur,does not qualify as a prevailing party under the supreme court explanation of that term in buckhannon.counters that buckhannon rules are inapplicable to the idea.therefore,the threshold issue in this case is whether buckhannon limitations on the meaning of the term prevailing party apply.
although buckhannon involved only claims under the prevailing party provisions of the ada and fhaa there is little doubt that the buckhannon court intended its interpretation of the term prevailing party to have broad effect upon similar statutes.the court observed that congress has passed many statutes that authorize courts to award attorney fees to the prevailing party,such as,and that the court has interpreted those provisions consistently across the federal statutes.buckhannon,at.citing hensley eckerhart,d,which held that the standards used in interpreting the term prevailing party are generally applicable in all cases in which congress has authorized an award of fees to a prevailing party.moreover,as noted above,the court described the term prevailing party as a legal term of art,with the relatively fixed and accepted meaning of a party in whose favor a judgment is rendered.id.at.citing black legal dictionary ed.therefore,one would conclude that if a statute contains this legal term of art that has been interpreted consistently across statutes,we should exercise great caution before we give that term a different meaning.see me.sch.admin.dist.v,cir because the idea employs the phrase prevailing party a term of must be interpreted and applied in the same manner as other federal statutes that use the same phraseology.
given these considerations,at least one circuit has interpreted buckhannon as applying to all prevailing party statutes.see smyth rivero,cir holding that buckhannon applies to and stating t he term prevailing party,as used in b and other provisions,is a legal term of art,and is interpreted is,without distinctions based on the particular statutory context in which it appears.quotations and citations omitted.while there is some appeal to the simplicity of this position,this court has not yet gone that far.rather,we have left open the possibility that if the text,structure,or legislative history of a particular statute indicate that the term prevailing party in that statute is not meant to have its usual defined in buckhannon strictures may not apply.
we reiterate,however,that because prevailing party is a legal term of art that is interpreted consistently across statutes,there is a strong presumption that buckhannon applies to each statute that awards fees to prevailing parties.consequently,for this court to find that buckhannon does not apply to the idea,a prevailing party statute,the text,structure,or legislative history would have to clearly indicate that in the idea,congress did not intend to use the term prevailing party in its traditional term of art sense.
the district court below held that the text of the idea set it apart from other statutes.we acknowledge that the idea text and structure is somewhat more complex than other prevailing party statutes because the idea not only states that attorney fees are available to prevailing parties,but it also contains limiting provisions in i d g,which specify certain situations where attorney fees are unavailable or must be reduced.for instance,i d i provides that a party may not receive attorney fees incurred subsequent to a settlement offer if the court or hearing officer determines that the relief finally obtained by the plaintiff is not more favorable than the settlement offer.section i d ii provides in relevant part that attorney fees may not be awarded at the discretion of the state for work done in mediation conducted before the filing of a formal request for a hearing.and i f g instructs district courts to reduce an attorney fee award when the plaintiff has unreasonably protracted the final resolution of the controversy.
argues that these provisions create an implication that congress intended the term prevailing party as used in the idea to include more than just parties that obtain judicially sanctioned relief.the arguments are quite strained,however,as none of these provisions clearly indicate a congressional intent about anything related to the prevailing party requirement.john.county intermediate unit,cir.rather,i d through g define situations in which attorney fees may be prohibited or reduced even for prevailing parties.id.for instance,if a plaintiff rejects a settlement offer and eventually receives a judicially sanctioned victory that is less beneficial than the settlement offer was,the plaintiff,though being a prevailing party,may not get the fees incurred after the settlement offer.i d i.or,as i d ii provides,if a party pursues an unsuccessful mediation and eventually obtains a victory with judicial imprimatur,then he may receive attorney fees for the unsuccessful mediation if it occurred after the filing of a complaint.or,if a plaintiff who eventually obtains judicially sanctioned success unreasonably protracted the resolution of the case,the court may reduce the attorney fee award to account for the unreasonable delay.id.i g.
the bottom line is that these limiting provisions do not clearly indicate that the term prevailing party was intended to encompass anything more in the idea than in any of the other prevailing party statutes.in fact,these provisions do not inform anything about the meaning of the term prevailing party in the idea because they are relevant only after a plaintiff has been deemed a prevailing party.
we turn next to the legislative history.as both the second and third circuits have recognized,the legislative history of the idea seems to indicate that congress did not intend the idea to be interpreted any differently from other prevailing party statutes.see john,at reg l sch.dist,cir.when congress added the provision to the idea predecessor statute,the education of the handicapped act,the senate committee on labor and human resources provided that it is the committee intent that the terms prevailing party and reasonable be construed consistently with the supreme court decision in hensley eckerhart,which involved,at,reprinted in,footnote omitted.we have followed this principle by interpreting the idea consistently with.see,bd.of educ.steven,cir prevailing party has the same meaning under e as.and importantly,buckhannon made clear that its strictures applied to.see,at.from the legislative history then,it appears that buckhannon should be applied to the idea.
in addition to the textual and legislative history arguments,makes essentially two policy arguments,which he claims show that buckhannon should not be applied to the idea.we approach these arguments with caution because the buckhannon court itself,in analyzing the policy arguments made in that case,stated given the clear meaning of prevailing party in the statutes we need not determine which way these various policy arguments cut.at.consequently,it is not clear that the supreme court has left any room for this court or any other to interpret anew the term prevailing party in light of the idea policies.john,at.
contends that the statute is designed to facilitate early,informal resolution of controversies between schools and students.according to,this is an important goal of the idea because delay in finding an appropriate school setting can be detrimental to a child development.maintains that this goal would be undermined if we found that private settlements do not entitle plaintiffs to attorney fees because parents and attorneys would have an incentive to reject settlement offers and thereby delay the final resolution of the proceedings.
we recognize the importance and benefit of quick resolution to any litigation particularly,litigation that involves the educational placement of a child.but many of the same factors that make quick resolution through settlement beneficial under the idea apply to the statutes that were at issue in buckhannon as well.for instance,there are surely strong policy reasons for quickly resolving a disabled person claims under the ada.nonetheless,buckhannon held that ada plaintiffs may receive attorney fees only upon receipt of some judicially sanctioned victory.in other words,buckhannon simply has closed the door on this argument.john,at,at.moreover,in response to the same policy argument that makes settlement is to be encouraged under the idea and therefore we should allow attorney fees for second circuit noted 
i t is difficult to reconcile the policy argument for awarding fees pursuant to informal settlements with the fact that,even before buckhannon,congress deliberately chose not to allow the recovery of attorneys fees for participation in iep proceedings that were not convened as a result of an administrative proceeding or judicial action.i d ii.the iep team is a mechanism for compromise and cooperation rather than adversarial confrontation.this atmosphere would be jeopardized if we were to encourage the participation of counsel in the iep process by awarding attorneys fees for settlements achieved at that stage.
second policy argument centers around the stated purpose of the idea to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education to meet their unique needs.d a.contends that if the idea prevailing party provision is interpreted to preclude the award of fees to parties that settle,then students who must hire an attorney and whose claims are ultimately resolved through private settlement will be denied the free appropriate education promised by the idea because they will be saddled with large legal fees.
while this is probably strongest argument,we are still not persuaded.we note that the idea only guarantees the right to a free education it does not explicitly guarantee the right to attorney fees incurred in pursuit of that education.edie river falls sch,cir clearly parents have a right to champion their child cause,but the right to have their attorneys fees picked up by the taxpayers is more circumspect.therefore,it is not clear that it would be against the purpose of the idea to require plaintiffs who do not achieve judicial imprimatur on their victory to bear their own attorney fees.furthermore,in light of buckhannon,which made explicit that prevailing party has a clearly established meaning that overrides various policy arguments,we are constrained to reject contention on this point.
moreover,we do not take lightly the fact that virtually every court to have decided the issue has determined that buckhannon applies to the idea.for instance,the only two federal appellate courts,the second and third circuits,that have squarely addressed the issue have both held buckhannon applicable to the idea see john,at,at see also smyth rivero,cir stating that buckhannon applies to all prevailing party provisions,regardless of the particular statutory context.john leigh iowa of,cir assuming that buckhannon applies to the idea but not discussing the issue.today,we join the second and third circuits in holding that buckhannon is applicable to the idea.
status as a prevailing party under buckhannon 
as noted above,buckhannon held that to be a prevailing party a litigant must have obtained a judgment on the merits,a consent decree,or some similar form of judicially sanctioned relief.at.in buckhannon,the court specifically noted that p rivate settlement agreements do not entail the judicial approval and oversight involved in consent decrees.and federal jurisdiction to enforce a private contractual settlement will often be lacking unless the terms of the agreement are incorporated into the order of dismissal.at.therefore,the court left the clear impression that private settlements do not involve sufficient judicial sanction to confer prevailing party status.see christina bloomberg,cir smyth,at.
the merits of this case were ultimately resolved through a settlement between the parties.we agree with the fourth circuit recent conclusion that some settlement agreements,even though not explicitly labeled as a consent decree may confer prevailing party status,if they are sufficiently analogous to a consent decree.smyth,at.for instance,w here a settlement agreement is embodied in a court order such that the obligation to comply with its terms is,the court approval and the attendant judicial oversight in the form of continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement may be functionally a consent decree.see also john,at stating that a stipulated settlement could confer prevailing party status where it contained mandatory language,was entitled order,bore the signature of the district court judge,not the parties counsel,and provided for judicial enforcement emphasis omitted citation omitted.
the settlement agreement in this case does not bear any of the marks of a consent decree.it is not embodied in a court order or judgment.it does not bear the district court judge signature,and the district court has no continuing jurisdiction to enforce the agreement.rather,it was merely a private settlement agreement between the parties.argues that because the district court was actively involved in the settlement negotiations,having conducted a settlement conference in his chambers and made certain settlement suggestions,that we should find that there was sufficient judicial imprimatur on the settlement to confer prevailing party status.
mere involvement in the settlement,however,is not enough.there must be some official judicial approval of the settlement and some level of continuing judicial oversight.buckhannon,at.smyth,at.therefore,we find that the settlement agreement reached in this case did not confer prevailing party status upon 
asserts that even if he can not be said to have prevailed via the settlement,that he was the prevailing party in the due process hearing and therefore should be compensated at le
