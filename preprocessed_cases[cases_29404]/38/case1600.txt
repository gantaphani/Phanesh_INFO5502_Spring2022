this case raises an important question regarding the eligibility of federal civilian employees for disability retirement.the office of personnel management opm and the merit systems protection board ruled that an employee is ineligible for disability retirement as long as the employee is retained at the same grade and pay,even if the employee is unable to perform the duties of his official position,and even if he is not transferred to a vacant position within the agency.because that ruling is contrary to the language of the governing statute and regulations,we reverse.
petitioner bruce bracey was a civilian employee of the navy at the naval aviation depot in norfolk,virginia,where he held the position of electronics worker.in,he suffered several injuries.as a result of his injuries,the navy assigned bracey to the shop at the facility where he worked.he worked there between and,and again between april and september,when the navy separated him as a result of a reduction in force that accompanied the closure of the naval aviation depot.while he was assigned to the shop,bracey retained the grade and pay of his electronics worker position,but the tasks he performed were not those of an electronics worker.
on september,before the facility was closed,bracey filed an application for disability retirement.opm,however,denied the application.it found that although his injuries prevented him from performing the duties of his electronics worker position,he was not entitled to disability retirement because his employing agency had accommodated his medical condition by providing him with work that was within his medical restrictions and was not temporary in nature.
bracey appealed opm decision to the merit systems protection board.after a hearing,an administrative judge ruled that bracey application should have been granted.the administrative judge found that bracey assignment to the shop was not an accommodation that would preclude disability benefits,because the duties of his assignment were not those of an electronics worker,but instead were those associated with the position of material examiner and identifier.the administrative judge accordingly concluded that bracey was eligible for disability retirement benefits.
on opm petition for review,the full board reversed the administrative judge decision by a vote.the board majority acknowledged that the duties bracey performed in his assignment were not the duties of his official position,but nonetheless concluded that because he had retained the grade and pay of his electronics worker position,he was not eligible for disability retirement.the board held that it was sufficient that the agency could gainfully employ bracey,even if it could not do so in his official position of record or within the confines of another officially established position description.
vice chair slavet dissented.she explained that under the governing statute,a,a disabled employee is eligible for disability retirement unless the employee is able to render useful and efficient service in the employee position or is qualified for reassignment to an existing vacant position in the agency at the same grade or level.in her view,bracey was not rendered ineligible for disability retirement because he was not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position within the agency and he was not rendering useful and efficient service in his electronics worker position,as the work he was assigned was not within the duties of that position.
the statute governing entitlement to disability retirement under the civil service retirement system provides that an employee is eligible for disability retirement if he becomes disabled after completing five years of civilian service.a.the statute defines disability as follows 
any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the office of personnel management to be unable,because of disease or injury,to render useful and efficient service in the employee position and is not qualified for reassignment,under procedures prescribed by the office,to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.
id.the pertinent opm regulation elaborates on the statutory definition by providing that an employee is eligible for disability retirement only if the disabling medical condition is expected to continue for at least one year the condition results in a deficiency in performance,conduct,or attendance,or is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in the employee position and the agency is unable to accommodate the disabling condition in the employee position or in an existing vacant position.a.the regulation defines accommodation to mean an adjustment made to an employee job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the position,and it defines useful and efficient service to mean acceptable performance of the critical or essential elements of the employee position.read together,the statute and regulation provide that an employee is ineligible for disability retirement in two specific circumstances if the employee,with appropriate adjustments to the job or work environment,can perform the critical or essential elements of his own position or if the employee is qualified for reassignment to a vacant position in the agency at the same grade or level as the employee current position.
before the board,opm argued that a assignment constitutes a position for purposes of the disability retirement regulations,even if it is not a formally established position,and even if the employee can not perform the duties of his or her position of record or any established position within the agency.accordingly,opm argued that even though bracey was not able to perform the duties of his electronics worker position and even though he was not reassigned or qualified for reassignment to a vacant established position within the agency at the same grade and pay,he was not eligible for disability retirement because the agency was able to find work for him and was willing to retain him at his former grade and pay level.
in this court,opm has refined its legal argument.it does not contend,as it did before the board,that bracey has been assigned to a new,albeit unclassified,position in the agency.instead,opm argues that bracey has been accommodated in his original electronics worker position by being given a assignment,and that he occupies the accommodated position of electronics worker,even though he is not performing the official duties of the electronics worker position.for the reasons set forth below,we conclude that bracey can not be denied the relief he seeks either on the theory that his assignment constitutes an assignment to a vacant position at the same grade and pay,or on the theory that his assignment constitutes an accommodation of his disability in his electronics worker position.
in response to opm argument before the board that his position could properly be viewed as a vacant position within the meaning of a,bracey argues that his assignment was not a position and therefore not a vacant position because it was not formally described,classified,or graded.we agree with bracey that opm argument fails,because the term vacant position in section refers to an officially established position that is graded and classified,not to an informal assignment of work that an agency gives to an employee who can not perform the duties of his official position.
a position in the federal employment system is required to be classified and graded in accordance with the duties,responsibilities,and qualification requirements associated with it.the resulting system is used in all phases of personnel administration.we are aware of no setting in the federal employment system in which an employee is considered to hold a position consisting of a set of ungraded,unclassified duties that have been assigned to that employee on an ad hoc basis,and the government has not called our attention to any instance in which the term position is used in that manner.as vice chair slavet pointed out,
