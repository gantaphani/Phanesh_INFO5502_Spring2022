william allen appeals the order of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court vacating a november,board of veterans appeals board or bva decision which denied increased disability compensation and remanded the case for further proceedings.in its order,the veterans court instructed the board that its interpretation in barela west,of,as amended by a of the omnibus budget reconciliation act of obra,stat,was binding precedent and barred recovery to the extent that allen sought increased compensation for his alcohol abuse disability,either as secondarily or as evidence of the increased severity of his post traumatic stress disorder ptsd.we hold that we have jurisdiction over this remand order because the veterans court interpretation of the statute will affect the remand proceeding,and our future review may be evaded.we further hold that,when read in light of its legislative history,does not preclude a veteran from receiving compensation for alcohol or disabilities arising secondarily from a disability,or from using alcohol or disabilities as evidence of the increased severity of a disability.therefore,we reject the veterans court statutory interpretation of and to that extent reverse the court order,and remand for proceedings in accordance with the interpretation of as set forth herein.the part of the order remanding to the board for proper application of the rating criteria is affirmed.
background 
allen served on active duty in the united states marine corps from september to september.allen alleges that he suffers from ptsd resulting from his service.he also alleges that he suffers an alcohol abuse disability that arises as a symptom of his ptsd.
allen seeks increased monetary compensation for both his ptsd disability and for his alcohol abuse disability.he argues that the existence of his alcohol abuse disability should be considered in determining his disability rating and his compensation level.
on august,the boston,massachusetts veterans administration regional office ro of the department of veterans affairs va granted allen a percent disability rating for ptsd effective from june.in october,allen filed a claim for an increased rating.the ro issued a rating decision in june,refusing an increase but confirming the percent disability rating.on august,victoria russell conducted a va compensation and pension examination to determine the severity of allen ptsd and to ascertain whether there was a relationship between allen ptsd and his alcohol abuse.russell wrote that t he reason for allen alcohol admissions had to do with his rapidly accelerating symptoms of ptsd.the doctor diagnosed allen with severe ptsd along with chronic alcohol abuse and dependence,in remission,as secondary to ptsd.in november,the ro issued a rating confirming the percent disability evaluation for ptsd and again declining an increased rating.
on june,however,following a psychiatric hospitalization,the ro increased allen disability rating to percent,effective from october.the rating also included a temporary total disability rating under for a period of days prior to april.although the ro considered allen prior hospitalizations in determining his rating,the ro did not consider the august compensation and pension examination in evaluating whether allen was entitled to an increased rating above percent.
allen appealed the denial of a rating higher than percent to the board.on november,the board upheld the ro and denied a higher rating.the board said that alcohol abuse may not be service connected,on either a direct or secondary basis,and impairment from substance abuse may not be considered when evaluating the severity of the ptsd.in order to receive a percent rating,the next available step above percent,the board required allen to demonstrate both occupational impairment and social impairment.in considering all of the evidence,the board found that the record demonstrates that the veteran employability has been seriously undermined by his history of alcohol abuse and dependence,but that allen ptsd was not the only factor influencing his industrial occupational impairment.the board also found that allen failed to produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate social impairment.on march,allen filed a timely appeal to the veterans court.
on july,the veterans court vacated the board decision and remanded for a further evidentiary hearing.both allen and the secretary of veterans affairs the secretary agreed that a remand was required in light of the veterans court opinion in barela,which had been issued subsequent to the board november,decision.barela held that precludes a veteran from receiving compensation for disabilities due to alcohol or drug abuse.barela.at.the barela court,however,added that does not bar an award of for alcohol or drug abuse.id.an award of would entitle a veteran to benefits such as educational assistance to a veteran dependents,or housing loan benefits for the veteran.see,a,a,b.it would not entitle the veteran to any increase in disability compensation.
in allen case,the veterans court remanded in order for the board to apply the court interpretation of as set forth in barela.allen had argued that barela was wrongly decided to the extent that it held that the law prohibits the payment by va of compensation for alcohol abuse either on a basis or as evidence of an increase in the severity of a disability.the veterans court,however,rejected allen interpretation of and stated that barela was binding precedent to the extent that allen seeks compensation based either on alcohol abuse secondary to ptsd or an increase in his rating for ptsd based on manifestations of ptsd symptomatology,alcohol or drug abuse.if,on remand,the board found,allen or his relatives could still receive educational or housing benefits under title.allen could not,on remand,under the veterans court interpretation of in allen case and in barela,recover additional disability compensation pursuant to an increase in his schedular rating due to his alcohol abuse disability secondary to his ptsd,or as evidence of the increased severity of his ptsd.
the veterans court also remanded for the board to correctly apply the secretary rating criteria.the court concluded that the board erred in its application of diagnostic code dc by requiring allen to exhibit both occupational industrial and social impairment.see setting forth criteria for percent rating johnson brown,remanding to see if veteran met one criterion.on remand,the court ordered the board to consider whether allen meets any one of the schedular criteria for a percent schedular rating for his ptsd and if not to consider whether he meets any one criterion for a percent schedular rating for his ptsd.the veterans court issued its order on august.allen filed a timely notice of appeal to this court on september.
allen believes that his alcohol abuse disability should be considered in determining his proper rating level for his ptsd disability which was already held to be.he only seeks disability compensation he does not seek any benefits to which veterans and their relatives may be entitled to under title.allen seeks additional disability compensation because of his alcohol abuse disability under two alternative theories.the first theory concerns whether allen alcohol abuse disability is secondary to his ptsd.the second theory is based on the premise that even if allen alcohol abuse disability is not secondarily,allen should still be able to obtain an increase in his rating level by relying on the alcohol abuse as evidence of the increased severity of his ptsd.
jurisdiction 
the veterans judicial review act,div.a,stat,grants this court jurisdiction to hear appeals from the veterans court.the act was codified in title of the united states code.section a states in pertinent part that a fter a decision of the united states court of appeals for veterans claims is entered in a case,any party to the case may obtain a review of the decision with respect to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof.u.a.under our case law,however,our jurisdiction is limited to the review of final decisions of the veterans court,which usually does not include remands.see travelstead derwinski,dambach gober.this final judgment rule ordinarily limits our jurisdiction to appeals from a decision or order that ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.firestone tire rubber risjord,d internal citation omitted.there are,however,exceptions to the final judgment rule.thus,the critical issue raised by this appeal is whether such an exception applies in this case.
our precedents have broadly stated that our jurisdiction over a veteran case is proper when the remand disposes of an important legal issue that would be effectively unreviewable at a later stage of the litigation.grantham brown,travelstead,at.in travelstead,the secretary,not the veteran,appealed a veterans court decision,remanding to the board for a proper adjudication of travelstead entitlement to a release of liability.id.at.this court held that despite the final judgment rule,our jurisdiction was proper,noting that the veterans court rendered a decision interpreting a statute and compel led action of the secretary,on remand,contrary to the secretary prior ruling.id.at.the court said that the veterans court remand order was unquestionably a judgment,as it terminated the civil action challenging the secretary final determination set aside that determination and finally decided that the secretary could not follow his own regulations in considering the disability issue.id.the court added that there would be grave doubt as to whether the secretary could appeal his own order if on remand the secretary undertook the inquiry mandated by the veterans court.see also jones west,holding that this court had jurisdiction over the secretary appeal of a statutory interpretation in a remand order.
in dambach,this court applied travelstead to find jurisdiction when a veteran appealed the veterans court interpretation of a statute in a remand order.dambach,at.the veteran in dambach argued that b was applicable to his case.see id.section b requires the va to accept satisfactory lay or other evidence as sufficient proof of for any illness or injury alleged to have incurred in combat,when official service medical records proving such incurrence do not exist.the veterans court held that the statute did not apply to any illness incurred during combat when there is such a record documenting at least one illness.id.at.dambach appealed the veterans court remand order to this court,arguing that the veterans court erred in affirming the board interpretation of b and that the veterans court decision was a final decision on the b issue that must be resolved before remanding the case to the b oard to establish the parties evidentiary burdens.id.at.on appeal,this court held that jurisdiction was proper when there is a statutory interpretation that will affect the remand proceeding and that legal issue might evade our future review.id.in dambach case,this court said that because the veterans court interpretation of the statute would alter the evidentiary burdens on proving in the remand proceeding and thus affect the remand proceeding,the circumstances of the remand might make unreviewable the determination that b can not be applied to a veteran with a service medical report.id.
our decision on jurisdiction here is governed by dambach.the dambach court held that we have jurisdiction when the veterans court interpretation of a statute will affect the remand proceeding,and that legal issue might evade our future review.dambach,at t he remand may make unreviewable the determination that the statute can not be applied to a veteran emphasis added.in allen case,the veterans court interpretation of clearly will affect the remand proceeding.although the evidentiary burden will not shift here,as in dambach,the veterans court reliance upon its prior interpretation in barela of effectively forecloses the board from considering whether allen alcohol abuse disability could be used in evaluating his proper rating level and thus in determining compensation due for his disability.
this case is thus distinguishable from winn brown.in winn,the veteran challenged the validity of a regulation.id.at.although the veterans court stated that the regulation was valid,without relying on the regulation,it remanded winn claim to the board for further fact finding on the merits of his particular asserted disorder.id.on remand,winn could have won or lost on the facts of his case without regard to the regulation he challenge d.id.this court held that we did not have jurisdiction,because the veterans court remand decision was not a final judgment.id.unlike winn,however,allen can not win on remand,because no matter what facts the board finds on the issue of secondary,allen can not rely on his alcohol abuse disability to increase his rating level,either by demonstrating secondary or as proof of the increased severity of his ptsd.see winn,at i f the regulation had been relied upon by the veterans court in reaching its decision,then winn may have proper standing to challenge its validity before this court.thus,the veterans court order,here,will unquestionably affect the remand proceeding,as the veterans court erroneous interpretation of the statute,on which it plainly relied,completely precludes allen from using his alcohol abuse disability to increase his rating level.
it is also possible that we would not have the opportunity to review the statutory interpretation issue later in the litigation.on remand,the board will apply barela,a case that issued subsequent to its november,decision,to the facts of allen case.although allen would be entitled to submit additional evidence in the remand proceeding,he only seeks to submit additional evidence relating to his alcohol abuse he does not plan to submit any additional evidence on the increased severity of his ptsd symptoms.the board,on remand,could decide that allen is not secondarily for his alcohol abuse.the board on remand will also reapply dc to determine whether allen is entitled to an increased rating for his ptsd.if his claim is denied,allen could then appeal to the veterans court which would review under a clearly erroneous standard the factual issues of whether allen is secondarily and the application of the criteria under dc for ptsd.see a.the issue of whether alcohol abuse can be used as evidence of the increased severity of ptsd might not be reviewable,because the board decision might not include a statutory interpretation issue that the veterans court could review pursuant to a.this court,in turn,might not be able to review the veterans court decision because we can not review appeals challenging factual determinations or the law as applied to the facts of the particular case,unless there is a constitutional issue present.see d.none is presented here.in essence,then,the factual issues of this case could become entangled so as to defeat our future review of the statutory issue.
indeed,it would be a grave injustice to the veteran to decline jurisdiction where it may not be possible for us to review the case at a later date,and where future appeals below would be futile and burdensome.the remand on secondary,as mandated by the veterans court,is utterly moot,because allen could only receive benefits for himself or his relatives,benefits that he is not seeking.since allen plans to submit no additional evidence relating to any ptsd symptoms,there is grave doubt as to whether he would be entitled to a higher rating for his ptsd.further,it is burdensome to the veteran to undergo needless and futile additional proceedings when the veterans court erroneously interprets a statute.future proceedings may last for years.in the meantime,those veterans erroneously denied compensation to which they are entitled and who depend on such compensation as a substitute for lost wages are severely harmed by the delay.
that the veterans court also remanded to the board for a correct application of the secretary rating criteria for evaluating allen rating for ptsd also does not render the challenged decision.in theory,on remand,allen could get a percent rating.however,the fact that allen could receive a total disability rating is belied by the fact that allen will not introduce additional evidence on any disability,and is precluded from introducing evidence of his alcohol disability.the board already found that allen failed to demonstrate occupational or social impairment.this renders the remand proceeding meaningless.further,under s,a veteran with a disability rated as total and who is permanently housebound as a result of the veteran disability or disabilities can recover compensation in excess of the amount specified for a percent schedular rating.although such recovery is rare,it is still conceivable that allen could recover additional compensation.
we would also note that we decline the invitation implicit in allen citation as supplemental authority to extend the jurisdictional holding of elkins gober,to the facts of this case.in elkins,we held that the veteran neck argument and headache claim,which the veterans court remanded,were separable from the veteran back claim,which it denied.id.at.in deciding that our jurisdiction was proper over the back claim,we noted that our court has consistently recognized that the various claims of a veteran overall case may be treated as distinct for jurisdictional purposes.id.at.the holding of elkins does not control the outcome of this case since allen case does not consist of separate and distinct claims.
interpretation of 
this court has jurisdiction to review any decision of the veterans court regarding the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof that was relied on by the court in making the decision.a.we review interpretations of a statute by the veterans court de novo.prenzler derwinski.
the starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.madison galleries,united states.the court will then look to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.see,blum stenson,d where resolution of a question of federal law turns on a statute and the intention of congress,we look first to the statutory language and then to the legislative history if the statutory language is unclear.section,when read in light of its legislative history,does not preclude a veteran from receiving compensation for an alcohol or drug abuse disability acquired as secondary to,or as a symptom of,a veteran disability.because the veterans court interpretation of is contrary to law,we overrule its interpretation of and remand for proceedings in accordance with the interpretation as set forth herein.
the veterans court interpretation of in barela 
section precludes compensation for disabilities arising from the veteran own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.section reads emphasis added 
for disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,or for aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,in the active military,naval,or air service,during a period of war,the united states will pay to any veteran thus disabled and who was discharged or released under conditions other than dishonorable from the period of service in which said injury or disease was incurred,or preexisting injury or disease was aggravated,compensation as provided in this subchapter,but no compensation shall be paid if the disability is a result of the veteran own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.
the previous version of the statute,stat.repealed,stated that no compensation shall be paid if the disability is a result of the veteran own willful misconduct.in amending the statute,congress added the phrase or abuse of alcohol or drugs.the amendments also added the same phrase to a,defining the term line of duty referred to in.see,b,stat.codified as amended at a.
the veterans court in barela interpreted to prohibit compensation for a disability in any way related to alcohol or drug abuse.see barela.at.barela sought entitlement to for his alcohol and drug abuse disabilities secondary to his ptsd.id.at.the board denied his claim,and stated that payment for any disability that is the result of a veteran abuse of alcohol or drugs is statutorily prohibited by.id.at.the board noted that under a,w hen service connection is established for a secondary condition,the secondary condition is considered a part of the original condition.id.the board then referred to the opinion of the va general counsel regarding how a applied to a situation like barela.see prec.in o,the va general counsel stated that a does not reflect prohibition on the payment of compensation for a disability whatever its origin.id.accordingly,the board found that since the authority to compensation for a secondarily disability under derives from,determinations regarding secondary are also subject to the prohibition against payment for alcohol and substance abuse disabilities.barela.at see also prec.june,d isability compensation,which for a disability is prohibited outright under can not be paid for a substance abuse disability which is service connected on either a direct or secondary basis.as a result,the board said that s ervice connection for alcohol or drug abuse,claimed as secondary to ptsd is prohibited by law.barela.at.
on appeal,the veterans court agreed with the board that prohibits compensation for alcohol or drug abuse disabilities.the veterans court held that the clear and unambiguous language of bars compensation for disabilities which are the result of alcohol or substance abuse whether the claim is based on direct service connection or,under a,on secondary service connection.id.at.the court said that t he word no is clear and unequivocal it brooks no exceptions or limitations.as this court has stated previously and often,w here a statute language is plain,and its meaning clear,no room exists for construction.there is nothing to construe.id.at internal citations omitted.in allen case,the veterans court applied barela and held that it was binding precedent to the extent allen sought compensation based either on alcohol abuse secondary to ptsd or an increase in his rating for ptsd based on manifestations of ptsd symptomatology,alcohol or drug abuse.
textual analysis of 
we disagree with the veterans court interpretation of in barela and as restated in its remand order in this case.we think the best interpretation of the statute is that it precludes compensation only in two situations for primary alcohol abuse disabilities and for secondary disabilities such as cirrhosis of the liver that result from primary alcohol abuse.by primary,we mean an alcohol abuse disability arising during service from voluntary and willful drinking to excess.we do not think that the language of precludes compensation in the third,allen alleged an alcohol abuse disability arises secondarily from or as evidence of the increased severity of a misconduct,disorder.by using the terms disability resulting from or disability that is a result of,we think that congress intended the cause of the disability to be determinative in assessing whether,under,a disability qualifies for either authorization for compensation under the provision or whether it fits within the language of express exclusion from compensation.for purposes of determining whether a veteran is entitled to compensation,in its first line,refers to disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty,and aggravation of a preexisting injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty.the last line of contains an express exclusion from recovery no compensation shall be paid if the disability is a result of the veteran own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.the final six words were added by the amendment.thus,compensation is authorized if the disability is caused by an injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty.compensation is precluded if the disability is caused by the veteran own abuse of alcohol or drugs.
section words of authorization f or disability resulting from,as well as its words of express exclusion,clearly preclude a veteran from receiving compensation for a primary alcohol abuse disability.section requires that a disability resulting from personal injury or disease be contracted in line of duty emphasis added.section a,which was also amended by the act,defines line of duty as follows 
an injury or disease incurred during active military,naval,or air service will be deemed to have been incurred in line of duty and not the result of the veteran own misconduct when the person on whose account benefits are claimed was,at the time the injury was suffered or the disease contracted,in active military,naval,or air service,whether on active duty or an authorized leave,unless such injury or disease was a result of the person own willful misconduct or abuse of alcohol or drugs.
a emphasis added.section a thus expressly provides that an injury or disease incurred during active service is not deemed to have been incurred in line of duty if the injury or disease is a result of the person own abuse of alcohol or drugs.consequently,a primary alcohol abuse disability would not be deemed to have been incurred in line of duty.in adding the same phrase or abuse of alcohol or drugs to the final clause in both and a,congress made clear that a primary alcohol abuse disability does not fit within words of authorization for compensation f or disability resulting from personal injury suffered or disease contracted in line of duty emphasis added.a primary alcohol abuse disability,moreover,is included within and a express exclusion from compensation disability that is a result of the veteran own abuse of alcohol or drugs.
in situation number,the language of also precludes compensation for a disability such as cirrhosis of the liver arising as a secondary result of primary alcohol abuse for two reasons.first,such a disability does not satisfy words of authorization.section only allows compensation for disabilities resulting from injuries suffered or diseases contracted in line of duty.a disability,such as cirrhosis,necessarily results from a primary alcohol abuse disability,and a explicitly precludes a primary alcohol abuse disability from being considered in line of duty.second,like the primary alcohol abuse disability,a secondary disability arising from a primary alcohol disability is not compensable,because it fits within the words of exclusion,as it too is a result of the veteran own abuse of alcohol or drugs,primary alcoholism acquired in service.
allen alleged disability,situation number,is quite different from one in which the veteran consumes alcohol willfully causing a primary alcohol abuse disability or one where a veteran later develops a disability as a result of the willful consumption of an alcoholic beverage,a secondary disability arising from a primary alcohol abuse disability.in contrast to these two other situations,an alcohol abuse disability arising as a direct result of a psychiatric condition fits within words of authorization for compensation f or disability resulting from disease ptsd contracted in line of duty emphasis added,and does not fit within express exclusion from compensation a disability that is a result of the veteran own abuse of alcohol or drugs.in this case,according to the opinion of one va doctor,allen alcohol abuse disability resulted from ptsd,a disease contracted in line of duty.if so,his disability can not result at the same time from an abuse of alcohol or drugs.therefore,if,on remand,the va finds that allen alcohol abuse is in fact a disability resulting from a disease contracted in the line of duty ptsd,then it can not be found to be a disability resulting from alcohol or drug abuse.the two categories of causation are mutually exclusive.this is clear from the terms of both and a,each of which in the very same words a result of distinguishes essentially between willful and involuntary causative acts.if the phrase disability resulting from as a key to determining a disability cause is intended one way for purposes of authorization for compensation,it would be incongruous for congress to have meant for it to be defined inconsistently for purposes of the va determining whether the disability fits within the express exclusion from compensation.
we would stress that the language of seems to only permit compensation in the third situation,where there is indeed a causal relationship between a disability,such as ptsd,and an alcohol or drug abuse disability.it is up to the va to determine how to assess whether an alcohol or drug abuse disability is actually caused by a disability.the fact that a veteran both has ptsd and an alcohol or drug abuse disability does not mean that the veteran can always use the alcohol or drug abuse disability to increase his or her rating by establishing secondary for the alcohol or drug abuse disability or by using the alcohol or drug abuse disability to show the increased severity of a disorder.even if a veteran has ptsd,or some other disorder,the va could conclude that the alcohol or drug abuse disability was due to willful action,and did not result from the disorder.if this is the case,we would not be able to review that factual determination,and the va conclusion would stand.the language of only seems to permit compensation in the limited case where an alcohol or drug abuse disability results from a disease contracted in the line of duty precludes compensation in all other cases where the va determines that the alcohol or drug abuse disability is a result of the veteran own abuse of alcohol or drugs.
va interpretation of willful misconduct and legislative history of 
the va past interpretation of willful misconduct as well as the limited legislative history of and,support,at least inferentially,our interpretation that in defining the disability for purpose of the exclusion,congress intended an element of scienter,so as to distinguish between willful and involuntary causative acts.prior to the addition of the phrase or abuse of alcohol or drugs,the statute merely disallowed compensation for acts of willful misconduct.va regulations defined willful misconduct 
willful misconduct means an act involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action.
i.it involves deliberate and intentional wrongdoing with knowledge of or wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.
ii.mere technical violation of police regulations or ordinances will not per se constitute willful misconduct.
iii.willful misconduct will not be determinative unless it is the proximate cause of injury,disease or death.
n see also a person of unsound mind is incapable of forming an intent mens rea or guilty mind,which is an essential element of willful misconduct emphasis added.in interpreting the phrase,the va construed the term willful misconduct to refer to an act of conscious wrongdoing,involving elements of intent and voluntariness.see prec,may,applying a definition of willful misconduct as referring to an act proceeding from a will done of a purpose impl ying not only a knowledge of a thing,but a determination with a bad intent to do it or to omit doing it.prec,finding of willful misconduct requires something in the nature of conscious wrongdoing,that is,the intentional doing of something either with the knowledge that it is likely to result in serious injury or with a wanton and reckless disregard of its probable consequences.the va incorporated this definition of willful misconduct into va regulations in former c defining willful misconduct as being malum in se or malum prohibitum if involving conscious wrongdoing or known prohibited action.
consistent with this definition of willful misconduct,the va established that only primary alcohol or drug abuse unrelated to an underlying psychiatric disorder could be considered willful misconduct.alcoholism secondary to and a manifestation of an acquired psychiatric disorder was not characterized as willful misconduct.administrator decision,veterans administration,interpretation of the term willful misconduct as related to the residuals of chronic alcoholism,app.in misconduct determinations,however,with respect to mental disorders where the use of alcohol as a beverage has been involved,a distinction has heretofore been recognized between alcoholism as a pr
