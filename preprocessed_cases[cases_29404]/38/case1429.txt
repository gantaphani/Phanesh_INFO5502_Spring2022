pursuant to,the coalition for common sense in government procurement coalition petitions for review of the october,letter the dear manufacturer letter of the department of veterans affairs va the coalition is a association representing over companies,including pharmaceutical companies,which provide products and services that are procured by the federal government.the dear manufacturer letter requires manufacturers of drugs covered by the health care benefits program of the department of defense dod to refund to dod the difference between the drugs wholesale commercial price and their federal ceiling prices.
for the reasons set forth below,we hold that the dear manufacturer letter comprises a substantive rule as defined in,and that the va did not comply with the procedural requirements for substantive rulemaking set forth in the administrative procedure act apa,ch,stat.codified as amended at et,before issuing the letter.we therefore grant the coalition petition for review,set aside the dear manufacturer letter,and remand the matter to the va for compliance with the procedures required by the apa.
background 
by way of background,we begin with a discussion of dod health care benefits program and the veterans health care act of vhca,stat.codified as amended at and scattered sections of,which applies to the program and which is administered by the.
dod provides a health care benefits program called tricare to active duty service members,retired service members,and their dependents.tricare is administered by the tricare management activity tma within dod.see pgba,united states,summarizing the tricare program.
the present action concerns just one aspect of tricare,the current tricare pharmacy benefits program,which was put in place on may.see,april,noting that the final rule would become effective may.like the tricare pharmacy benefits program,the current tricare pharmacy benefits program covers at least a portion of a beneficiary cost of prescription drugs when the beneficiary acquires the drugs from one of four sources a military treatment facility mtf a network retail pharmacy a retail pharmacy or the tricare mail order pharmacy tmop h.under i,the amount of between beneficiaries and dod varies depending on the source of the prescription drugs obtained.beneficiaries have no when they obtain drugs from an mtf.id.i i.however,beneficiaries must pay a when they obtain drugs from a retail pharmacy,id.i ii,although the is smaller when a beneficiary purchases drugs at a network pharmacy rather than at a pharmacy.compare id.with id.i iii.similar to the pharmacy benefits program,when drugs are purchased through tmop,beneficiaries pay a to the tmop distributor.id.i v.
however,unlike the version of the tricare pharmacy benefits program,the current program utilizes a pharmacy benefits manager pbm.the pbm is responsible for overseeing the distribution and payment for prescription drugs throughout the retail pharmacy network.when a tricare beneficiary purchases covered drugs at a network retail pharmacy,the pharmacy transmits data concerning the beneficiary to the pbm.the pbm then relays this beneficiary information to dod and requests authorization to pay dod portion of the for the drugs to the network pharmacy.after receiving this information,dod pharmacy benefits office checks beneficiary eligibility and potential drug interactions.dod then authorizes the pbm to approve the transaction,accept the beneficiary,and pay the pharmacy the difference between the beneficiary and the retail price of the drugs.most of this information exchange between the network pharmacy and the pbm occurs in real time before the beneficiary prescription is filled.however,dod payment to the pharmacy only occurs after a hold period.notably,the pbm does not provide these services for retail pharmacies.
the dear manufacturer letter concerns the application of the vhca to the tricare pharmacy benefits program.the vhca was enacted in to reduce the cost of prescription drugs used in the va health care benefits programs.as seen,the vhca is codified at scattered sections of title.the vhca includes,which provides in relevant part 
a each manufacturer of covered drugs shall enter into a master agreement with the secretary of the va under which 
beginning january,the manufacturer shall make available for procurement on the federal supply schedule of the general services administration each covered drug of the manufacturer 
with respect to each covered drug of the manufacturer procured by a federal agency described in subsection b on or after january,that is purchased under depot contracting systems or listed on the federal supply schedule,the manufacturer has entered into and has in effect a pharmaceutical pricing agreement with the secretary under which the price charged during the period beginning on the date on which the agreement takes effect may not exceed percent of the average manufacturer price less the amount of any additional discount required under subsection c during the period ending one month before such date or,in the case of a covered drug for which sufficient data for determining the average manufacturer price during such period are not available,during such period as the secretary considers appropriate,except that such price may nominally exceed such amount if found by the secretary to be in the best interests of the department or such federal agencies.
thus,section a limits the price that manufacturers of covered drugs may charge for drugs procured by a federal agency.section b lists dod as a federal agency to which section a applies.accordingly,section a requires that manufacturers charge dod a percentage of the average manufacturer price for covered drugs.this price limit is also called the federal ceiling price fcp.
as seen,section limits covered drugs to those obtained through one of two sources the drugs must be listed on the federal supply schedule or purchased under depot contracting systems.the federal supply schedule fss of the general services administration authorizes the va to award and manage contracts with pharmaceutical companies in order to obtain low prices.see b.the statute does not provide a definition of a depot contracting system.however,section h defines the term depot,as used in depot contracting system in section a,as follows 
the term depot means a centralized commodity management system through which covered drugs procured by an agency of the federal government are 
a received,stored,and delivered through 
i a federally owned and operated warehouse system,or 
ii a commercial entity operating under contract with such agency or 
b delivered directly from the commercial source to the entity using such covered drugs.
examination of procurement by mtfs and the tmop illustrates the features of direct procurement via listing on the fss and procurement through a depot contracting system.under section a,fcp pricing is available for both mtfs and for the tmop because they operate either through direct procurement by va facilities or a prime vendor arrangement in which a merchant middleman distributes drugs to va facilities.direct procurement from the fss expressly falls under section a.fcp pricing is available for the prime vendor arrangement because the prime vendor arrangement falls under the definition of a depot contracting system in section.in contrast to mtfs and the tmop,prior to may of,dod could not obtain drugs at low fcp prices for its tricare pharmacy benefits program because the program did not utilize either direct procurement from the fss or a depot contracting system as required by section.
on october,a policy group composed of representatives of the various interested components of the va authored the white paper for the office of the secretary tricare and federal ceiling prices the white paper.the white paper described the history of the tricare pharmacy benefits program and how dod had sought from its inception to obtain section coverage for tricare.the white paper noted,however,that the va previously had found that the tricare pharmacy benefits program did not fall under section.the paper then explained how dod responded by proposing that the tricare pharmacy benefits program be restructured to include a pbm.this proposed restructured tricare is referred to in the white paper as the new tricare pharmacy benefits program even though it was not implemented as of october of.the white paper concluded that covered drugs purchased in the form of dod beneficiary prescriptions under the retail portion of the new tricare pharmacy benefits program do qualify for federal ceiling prices because,under the plan submitted to us,such purchases will be a procurement by dod under a depot contracting system as defined in h.dod new tricare pharmacy benefits program was eventually implemented on may.see part i,supra describing the new tricare pharmacy benefits program as implemented may.in other words,as of may,the retail pharmacy portion of dod tricare pharmacy benefits program was deemed to be subject to the price limits of the vhca.
on october,the va issued the dear manufacturer letter,which is the subject of the present dispute.the letter was authored by the acting director of the va national acquisition center.the dear manufacturer letter is addressed to manufacturers of covered drugs and states that applies to the tricare pharmacy benefits program as it was restructured effective may.the letter explains that the va had considered in october of whether dod restructured tricare pharmacy benefits program met the definition of a depot contracting system under section.the dear manufacturer letter makes no mention of the white paper,which was written on october,but states instead that the secretary of the va secretary had determined on october,that the restructured tricare pharmacy benefits program would fall under the statute.based on the secretary determination,the letter reasons that dod is entitled to the benefits of the lowered fcp prices established under section.the letter states that although tma was entitled to refunds as of june,no refunds would be demanded until after september.the dear manufacturer letter also asserts that the secretary has the authority to determine whether dod had established a depot contracting system within the meaning of a.because the secretary exercised that authority by finding that the tricare pharmacy benefits program was a depot contracting system,the letter states that dod is entitled to fcps for covered drugs distributed through network pharmacies.the letter asserts,no published notice or rulemaking is required to make effective the policy and requirements already established by statute and written agreements.
in addition to stating that the tricare pharmacy benefits program falls under section,the dear manufacturer letter provides detailed instructions as to how manufacturers should pay the.the letter states 
because tma retail pharmacy network covered drug purchases will be made initially at commercial prices,tma will obtain federal ceiling pricing for these purchases by forwarding detailed purchase data to manufacturers each month and then requesting refunds on a quarterly basis to achieve federal pricing.
the letter contains instructions for calculating refunds as well as fcps under the new system.to this effect,the letter references a website for information about transmitting data and collecting refunds.further,the va attached six pages of sample calculations to aid manufacturers in calculating fcps.
the effect of the dear manufacturer letter is to require that manufacturers calculate and pay refunds for covered drugs purchased at network pharmacies.manufacturers are also required to adjust their sales data for the purposes of calculating.although the dear manufacturer letter states that tma would begin demanding refunds as of september,the va has agreed to stay enforcement pending judicial review.however,in its agreement to stay enforcement,the va explicitly states that it does not purport to speak on behalf of dod.as noted,the coalition has petitioned us for review of the dear manufacturer letter.
discussion 
as noted above,the coalition cites as the basis for our jurisdiction to review the dear manufacturer letter.section provides in relevant part as follows 
an action of the secretary to which section a or of title or both refers other than an action relating to the adoption or revision of the schedule of ratings for disabilities adopted under section of this title is subject to judicial review.such review shall be in accordance with chapter of title and may be sought only in the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit.
thus,section gives us exclusive jurisdiction over a n action of the secretary of veterans affairs to which section a or of title or both refers.
sections a and are part of the apa.both section a and section govern procedures for agency rulemaking.section a provides in relevant part as follows 
a each agency shall make available to the public information as follows 
each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the federal register for the guidance of the public 
d substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law,and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency and 
e each amendment,revision,or repeal of the foregoing.
section sets forth guidance as to when notice and comment procedures are required and specific procedures for conducting notice and comment rule making.section provides in relevant part as follows 
b general notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the federal register,unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law.the notice shall include 
a statement of the time,place,and nature of public rule making proceedings 
reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed and 
either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.
except when notice or hearing is required by statute,this subsection does not apply 
a to interpretative rules,general statements of policy,or rules of agency organization,procedure,or practice or 
b when the agency for good cause finds and incorporates the finding and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the rules issued that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable,unnecessary,or contrary to the public interest.
c after notice required by this section,the agency shall give interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data,views,or arguments with or without opportunity for oral presentation.after consideration of the relevant matter presented,the agency shall incorporate in the rules adopted a concise general statement of their basis and purpose.when rules are required by statute to be made on the record after opportunity for an agency hearing,sections and of this title apply instead of this subsection.
d the required publication or service of a substantive rule shall be made not less than days before its effective date,except 
a substantive rule which grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction 
interpretative rules and statements of policy or 
as otherwise provided by the agency for good cause found and published with the rule.
e each agency shall give an interested person the right to petition for the issuance,amendment,or repeal of a rule.
both sections a and require that specific procedures be followed with regard to substantive rules.in contrast,neither section a nor section refers to orders.because section only gives us jurisdiction to review agency actions to which sections a or refer,we therefore lack jurisdiction to review orders under section.in contrast,we have jurisdiction to review rules because both sections a and refer to an agency rule.this jurisdiction extends to both substantive rules,to which both sections a and apply,lefevre sec y,dep t of veterans affairs,evaluating the merits of a challenge to a substantive rule,and interpretative rules,to which section a applies,org.of veterans advocates,at exercising jurisdiction to evaluate the merits of a challenge to an interpretative rule.
section provides definitions of agency substantive rules and orders as used in the apa.section states that a rule means 
the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement,interpret,or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization,procedure,or practice requirements of an agency and includes the approval or prescription for the future of rates,wages,corporate or financial structures or reorganizations thereof,prices,facilities,appliances,services or allowances therefor or of valuations,costs,or accounting,or practices bearing on any of the foregoing.
an order is defined in section as 
the whole or a part of a final disposition,whether affirmative,negative,injunctive,or declaratory in form,of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing.
in those cases where we have jurisdiction under section,we review the merits of a petition for review under according to the apa.disabled am.veterans gober.under the apa,we decide all relevant questions of law,interpret constitutional and statutory provisions,and determine the meaning and applicability of the terms of an agency action.we will uphold an agency rule unless it is 
a arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law 
b contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity 
c in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations,or short of statutory right 
d without observance of procedure required by law 
the coalition argues that we have jurisdiction to review the dear manufacturer letter under section because it comprises a substantive rule to which sections a and refer.the coalition asserts that the letter is a rule because it does more than clarify the manufacturers existing obligations.instead,the coalition contends,the letter reverses agency policy in that it i changes the va position as to whether the tricare pharmacy benefits program is covered by the vhca and ii requires that manufacturers pay refunds.it therefore is substantive.the coalition argues that the va recognized the dear manufacturer letter represents a reversal of policy because it makes statements concerning the policy ramifications for affected industries.the coalition also contends that the agency action affected individual rights and obligations by requiring affirmative actions from all manufacturers and is therefore a substantive rule.thus,the coalition argues,the dear manufacturer is more than a mere interpretative rule.
with respect to the content of the dear manufacturer letter,the coalition contends that the letter must be set aside on two grounds.first,the coalition argues that the letter is substantively invalid because it relies on erroneous constructions of procure,covered drug,and depot as used in section.second,the coalition contends that the letter is procedurally defective because the government did not comply with sections a and before issuing the letter,and therefore it must be set aside.
the government characterizes the dear manufacturer letter as an order,which is not referred to in a or and is therefore not reviewable under.in support of this characterization,the government points out that,in its opening brief,the coalition frequently characterizes the dear manufacturer letter as an order.the government also argues that the dear manufacturer letter does not actually represent a decision to require refunds in actuality,the secretary decided in october of to require the refunds.the dear manufacturer letter merely implements that decision or provides public notice of that decision 
in the alternative,the government argues that even if the dear manufacturer letter is a rule rather than an order,it is an interpretative rule for which no notice and comment procedures are required.the letter is interpretative,the government urges,because it merely interprets the vhca.the government argues that the fact that the letter is binding does not make it a substantive rule because interpretative rules are binding interpretations of federal statutes.thus,the government asserts that the binding nature of a rule does not make it substantive.even if the dear manufacturer letter is a substantive rule,the government contends,we lack jurisdiction under section because the statute only gives the federal circuit the authority to review the va actions and not dod actions,which are at issue in the present case.according to the government,this is because dod is seeking refunds under the dear manufacturer letter and,if notice and comment procedures were necessary,it would have been dod responsibility to promulgate regulations in the code of federal regulations.
in the event that the case is not dismissed for lack of jurisdiction,the government defends the dear manufacturer letter as being substantively valid.thus,the government defends the letter interpretation of the terms procure,covered drug,and depot in section.
we first address whether the coalition claim for review of the dear manufacturer letter is ripe for judicial review.it is appropriate for us to consider ripeness even though it is not raised by the parties because ripeness is a jurisdictional consideration that the court may address sua sponte.park hospitality ass dep t of the interior,d the ripeness doctrine is drawn both from article iii limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction,but,even in a case raising only prudential concerns,the question of ripeness may be considered on a court own motion.quoting reno catholic soc,d.
ripeness involves a inquiry.first,we must determine whether the issue is fit for judicial review.abbott labs.gardner,d org.of veterans advocates,sec y of veterans affairs.second,we must consider whether withholding judicial review would work hardship on the parties.abbott,at.
turning first to the question of fitness,we find that the issues presented by the parties deal largely with legal issues of statutory construction,which we have previously held fit for judicial review.see org.of veterans advocates,at.second,we find that hardship would be incurred by both parties if we were to forego judicial review.the va has agreed to stay enforcement of the dear manufacturer letter pending judicial review.the government is losing out on hundreds of millions of dollars in refunds from manufacturers annually as a result of the stay.if the parties end the stay,the manufacturers represented by the coalition will be forced to pay millions.further,we have recognized that review under is ripe under abbott laboratories.id.at.therefore,we find that the coalition petition for review of the dear manufacturer letter is ripe for review.
we next address the proper characterization of the dear manufacturer letter.there are three possible ways to view the dear manufacturer letter as an order,as defined in section as a substantive rule,as defined in section or as an interpretative rule.our characterization of whether the dear manufacturer letter is an order or a rule will determine whether we have jurisdiction under section.that is because section gives us jurisdiction over those categories of agency actions to which either section a or section refers.thus,we have jurisdiction under section to review substantive and interpretative rules,but not orders.the determination of whether the letter is a substantive rule or an interpretative rule will determine whether the agency was required to comply with the publication requirement of section a and the notice and comment procedures of section.
we begin with the government argument that the dear manufacturer letter is an order.as seen,section defines an order as the whole or a part of a final disposition,whether affirmative,negative,injunctive,or declaratory in form,of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing.notably,adjudication is defined under the apa as agency process for the formulation of an order.thus,an order is issued as part of an adjudicatory process.see labor relations bd.sears,roebuck,d noting that an order is part of adjudication under the apa.in contrast to an order,the dear manufacturer letter was not written a
