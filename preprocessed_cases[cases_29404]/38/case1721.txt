petitioners and appellants petitioners are three beneficiaries of california program,a participant in the federal medicaid program.petitioners asher schwarzmer and kevin conlan requested and received fair hearings at which each asked an administrative law judge alj to order the state department of health services dhs or the department to reimburse him directly for covered expenses that he had paid while his application was pending.petitioner thomas stevens requested a fair hearing to recover reimbursement for copayments he had erroneously paid his provider.although there is no dispute as to whether each of the petitioners is entitled to reimbursement,their claims were dismissed on the ground that reimbursement must be obtained from the provider of the services and that there is no procedure under which a recipient may obtain reimbursement directly from dhs.the petitioners application for a writ of mandate in the superior court,sought under code of civil procedure sections and,was denied on much the same ground.we conclude that the state has failed to establish a reasonable procedure by which recipients may obtain prompt reimbursement for covered services for which they paid during the three months prior to applying for coverage,as required by federal law,and that dhs therefore should have been ordered to take appropriate measures to ensure that at least two of the petitioners receive their reimbursement.
petitioner asher schwarzmer applied for supplemental security supplementary program in august,and benefits were granted to him in august.he was then granted benefits retroactive to may.from to,while awaiting a decision on his application,schwarzmer paid for office visits with his provider.after schwarzmer was granted retroactive benefits,the provider wrote multiple letters to dhs seeking payment for the services for which schwarzmer had paid,so that schwarzmer could be reimbursed,but despite persistent appeals has not been entirely successful in obtaining these payments and therefore has not fully reimbursed schwarzmer schwarzmer sought direct reimbursement from dhs.after a hearing,the alj denied his request for direct reimbursement on the ground that the department lacked jurisdiction.the alj stated that schwarzmer remedy was to have the provider pursue the provider appeal process.the alj reasoned that s tate hearings are limited in jurisdiction to disputes between applicants and recipients of aid and the dhs or county welfare departments.the claimant primary complaint concerns reimbursement from a provider and that provider problems with the fiscal intermediary nor is there any authority in state law or state regulation to order the state to circumvent the fiscal intermediary and pay the claimant directly for his out of pocket expenses.
in,petitioner kevin conlan applied for aid to families with dependent children afdc,a form of benefit conlan applied for these benefits as the father of an unborn child.he was not eligible for the benefits until the child was born so the application was not processed immediately.the child was born in october,and the application was granted in april.once granted,conlan benefits were retroactive to october.after he received his card,he presented it to his medical provider and requested that the provider bill dhs for the services that conlan had already paid for,but the provider refused to do so.conlan requested a hearing with dhs to seek reimbursement for in medical bills that he had been required to pay while his application was pending.conlan testified at the hearing that he did not wish to file a complaint against the provider for fear of jeopardizing their relationship.as of the date of the hearing,conlan had not requested direct reimbursement from dhs,but before the alj issued a decision,he contacted both dhs fiscal intermediary and dhs itself to request reimbursement.both indicated that they would not directly reimburse conlan and insisted that he seek reimbursement through his medical provider.conlan was told that if his provider refused to cooperate,the only remedy was to file a complaint with the department.thereafter,his request for direct reimbursement was dismissed by the alj on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to order dhs to pay conlan directly.the alj ruled it is undisputed that there is currently no procedure available to the claimant to request or obtain direct reimbursement from dhs or the county for the medical payments made by the claimant.therefore,the county is correct in not assisting the claimant with obtaining reimbursement directly from dhs.
from august through june,petitioner thomas stevens made approximately in copayments for prescription medications.during this time,he was insured by a blue cross health maintenance organization and participated in the health insurance premium payment program hipp.under hipp,pays insurance premiums for individuals who had private insurance prior to becoming eligible for benefits.recipients thus avoid a disruption in benefits.as a participant in hipp,stevens was not obligated to make drug copayments of more than one dollar.he did not become aware of this fact,however,until june,when he called a information line.on june,stevens requested a hearing,asking that dhs reimburse him directly for the copayments he erroneously made.dhs argued that stevens had notice of the copay provisions in the booklet,what it means to you and that the pharmacy had been issued guidelines explaining coverage of copayments and refunds of copayments erroneously collected.the alj denied stevens request for direct payment on the ground that his dispute was with his provider,not with dhs,and that there is no authority for ordering direct payments to a recipient 
procedural history 
after denial of their fair hearing claims,petitioners jointly brought a petition for writ of mandate in san francisco superior court.the petition was framed as one for both administrative mandamus under code of civil procedure section and ordinary mandamus under code of civil procedure section.in their petition under section,petitioners asked the court to order dhs to directly reimburse them for the covered expenses they paid.under section,petitioners asked the court to compel respondents to ensure that recipients who incur medical expenses during the period of time covered by their eligibility and which are eligible for coverage by are able to secure reimbursement of these costs by means of corrective payments.
the trial court concluded that t he exclusive remedy to attack the legality of the decisions is pursuant to ccp and that petitioners are not entitled to ordinary mandamus review.the court denied the petition,holding that the failure to provide direct reimbursement did not violate the promptness requirement of welfare and institutions code section,the amount of aid provisions of section,the fair hearing provisions of section,or the corrective payment provision of code of federal regulations section.the court further held that welfare and institutions code section,which provides that in cases such as these,the recipient shall be entitled to a refund from the provider,requires that reimbursement be made by the medical provider and satisfies the department statutory mandate to make medical assistance available.
discussion 
petitioners are entitled to seek appropriate relief under both code of civil procedure sections and 
although this petition was properly presented under code of civil procedure section,relief is also available under section for reasons that will be explained in the discussion that follows.administrative mandamus under section is appropriate to inquire into the validity of any final administrative order or decision made as the result of a proceeding in which by law a hearing is required to be given,evidence is required to be taken,and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal code civ,subd.a.by comparison,a writ of mandate under section is available where the petitioner has no plain,speedy and adequate alternative remedy the respondent has a clear,present and usually ministerial duty to perform and the petitioner has a clear,present and beneficial right to performance.unnamed physician board of trustees of saint agnes medical center th,d payne superior court cal d,barnes wong th,d san gabriel tribune superior court d.where a petition challenges an agency failure to perform an act required by law rather than the conduct or result of an administrative hearing,the remedy is by ordinary mandate pursuant to code of civil procedure section,not by administrative mandate pursuant to section.wellbaum oakdale joint union high school dist.d.
the petition in this case challenges both the results of the administrative hearings denying petitioners the direct reimbursement they seek,and the agency practice of refusing to directly reimburse recipients under circumstances in which dhs assertedly is required to do so.there is no question that the petition is appropriate under code of civil procedure section.welfare and institutions code section provides that applicants or recipients may file a petition with the superior court,under the provisions of section of the code of civil procedure,praying for a review of the entire proceedings in the matter,upon questions of law involved in the case the nature of a petition under section is to challenge a specific decision in an administrative hearing as to a particular individual.lewin joseph hospital of orange d.while this may be the appropriate remedy to review the fair hearing decision id.at,section does not preclude a broader challenge to agency conduct or procedures alleged to breach the agency statutory obligations timmons mcmahon d.it is not inconsistent to award relief under both sections and of the code of civil procedure.see,fry saenz th,d.the petition in this case was properly framed as one for ordinary mandamus because petitioners allege that the agency has failed to act as required by law in failing to establish procedures for direct reimbursement of amounts owed recipients for covered services obtained prior to acceptance into the program.
as to the standard of review,as the court in mcintosh aubry th,d observed distinctions between traditional and administrative mandate have little impact on this appeal because the material facts were undisputed,raising a purely legal question we exercise independent judgment in that situation,no matter whether the issue arises by traditional or administrative mandate.
schwarzmer and conlan are entitled to recover reimbursement from dhs.
medicaid is a cooperative program established by congress in with the enactment of title xix of the social security act,united states code section.the program is designed to provide necessary medical services to poor people who had previously been denied access to medical care.like private insurance,medicaid furnishes coverage to eligible individuals and pays providers of health care for services rendered.salazar district of columbia,fn.california medicaid program is called,and is administered by dhs.welf,et state participation in medicaid is voluntary but if a state participates,it must comply with the federal statutes and regulations governing the programs.wilder virginia hosp,d.
among the many requirements of federal law,states that participate in medicaid must provide qualifying individuals coverage for services received during the three months prior to applying for benefits if the individual was eligible for benefits during that period.a.this is called the retroactivity period.for a variety of reasons,qualifying individuals often will obtain covered services during that period.if they pay for those services,they become entitled to prompt reimbursement once they receive their card and are accepted into the program.although there are no reported california cases on the subject,decisions in several other jurisdictions make clear that the state programs must include provisions to ensure that these individuals are able to recover the reimbursement to which they are entitled.blanchard forrest cir blanchard salazar district of columbia,supra.greenstein by horowitz bane.greenstein cohen by cohen quern.kurnik of health rehab.serv.dist so d krieger krauskopf,lustig blum.
it is not sufficient for the state to rely on the providers to reimburse the medicaid recipient voluntarily.blanchard,supra.doing so would violate the comparability provision of federal law.a state that participates in medicaid must provide comparable medical services to every participant.t he medical assistance made available to any individual shall not be less in amount,duration,or scope than the medical assistance made available to any other such individual a b.if reimbursement by the provider were voluntary,not all program recipients would be treated alike.those who had not paid for covered services during the retroactivity period would receive coverage because the program would pay the provider claim once submitted.however,those recipients who had paid for the services would not receive coverage unless their provider voluntarily reimbursed them.rather than seeking payment from the medicaid program and reimbursing the recipient,many providers may be expected to prefer to retain the payment received from their patient.not only will this be simpler for the provider,but since the medicaid program often pays less than the full price charged the patient,frequently there will be a financial disincentive for the provider to request the payment from the program rather than retaining the payment received from the patient.blanchard,supra,at because medicaid rates are usually much lower than the rates providers charge private patients,medicaid providers in louisiana have a disincentive to provide voluntary refunds to patients determined to be after the services or supplies were furnished cohen by cohen quern,supra.at because the private pay rate for medical providers is higher than the medicaid rate,providers generally do not volunteer to make such refunds.
every case brought to our attention in which the court was presented with an application for relief by a medicaid recipient who had not received voluntary reimbursement for covered services obtained during the retroactivity period has provided relief.in some cases,the court has ordered the state agency to make reimbursement directly to the recipient,rejecting the agency argument that the direct payment violates the vendor payment principle discussed more fully below.krieger krauskopf,supra,at w e perceive of no legally valid basis for denying the petitioner direct reimbursement in the instant matter kurnik of health rehab,supra,so d at lustig blum,supra,at.other cases have indicated that a state also may satisfy the comparability requirement by making reimbursement by the provider obligatory rather than voluntary.blanchard,supra,at the department shall establish a mechanism to provide coverage for bills for medical care,supplies and services during the retroactive coverage period the defendant can remedy its violation by choosing to either require providers to refund payments received for services provided during the retroactive eligibility period and then to submit their claims to medicaid,or to reimburse recipients directly for these expenses cohen quern,supra.at the department must compel those providers to refund the amounts paid and accept payment by the state as a condition of further participation.
the department contends that california satisfies the comparability requirement by virtue of welfare and institutions code section.this section was enacted to remedy a similar problem to the one faced by schwarzmer and conlan.the legislation was introduced in response to a request from a man whose mother was living in a nursing facility.when her private funds were nearly exhausted,she applied for assistance.she was approved three months later,retroactive to the date of her application,but the nursing home administrator refused to bill for in expenses incurred by the family between application and date of approval.the nursing home administrator informed the family that the home had a firm policy against retroactive billing because of the bureaucratic red tape involved.assem.com.on health,analysis of assem.bill sess.the analysis of the bill reveals the following discussion existing law does not require a provider to bill for services rendered to a beneficiary.since eligibility may be established retroactively for up to three months from the date of the application,there are instances where the beneficiary has already made payment to the provider for services for which he has subsequently become eligible.the provider however has the option of retaining the payments already made or billing for the previously provided eligible services.ab would require a provider to submit a claim for reimbursement for services rendered to a applicant who subsequently becomes eligible for benefits com.on health and welfare,staff analysis of assem.bill sess.as amended june.
welfare and institutions code section obligates the provider to return payments to recipients once the provider has obtained reimbursement for those payments from the department.this section provides in part that a a beneficiary or any person on behalf of the beneficiary who has paid for health care services otherwise covered by the program received by the beneficiary shall be entitled to a return from the provider of any part of the payment which meets all of the following was rendered during any period prior to the receipt of his or her card,for which the card authorizes payment under section or.was reimbursed to the provider by the program,following all audits and appeals to which the provider is entitled.is not payable by a third party under contractual or other legal entitlement.was not used to satisfy his or her paid or obligated liability for health care services or to establish eligibility e the provider shall return any and all payments made by the beneficiary upon receipt of payment.italics added.
the department contends,as the aljs and superior court held,that under welfare and institutions code section,recovery from the provider is the exclusive means by which a recipient may obtain reimbursement.while we see nothing in the language or history of the statute that suggests the legislature intended to make this the exclusive remedy,it is unquestionably true that no provision in the welfare and institutions code or the governing regulations establishes a procedure for the recipient to obtain reimbursement directly from the department.thus,the question that must be addressed is whether section is sufficient to satisfy the comparability requirement.the question must be answered pragmatically.the issue is not whether the statute creates an abstract right on the part of the recipient to obtain reimbursement from the provider,but whether a process has been established that offers reasonable assurance that the right will be respected,and that needy recipients entitled to reimbursement will receive the amounts to which they are entitled in a timely manner.if the latter is not the case,those recipients who have paid for covered services during the retroactivity period will continue to receive less in benefits than those who did not advance payment,in violation of the comparability requirement.blanchard,supra,at.
although welfare and institutions code section provides that the beneficiary is entitled to a return from the provider of amounts paid for covered services during the retroactivity period,and the provider shall return payments made by the beneficiary upon receipt of the payment,neither the statute nor the regulations provide any means by which to implement or enforce the beneficiary rights.the department contends that compliance with section is assured by its authority under section to discipline providers who do not comply with their obligations and by the department authority under its regulations to recover overpayments to providers but these provisions plainly do not address the problem 
the department concedes it does not monitor provider reimbursement.while a beneficiary who fails to obtain reimbursement from the provider presumably may complain to the department,the statute and the regulations fail to specify how the complaint process may be initiated by a recipient.if a complaint is filed,there are no regulations governing how such complaints are to be handled.even if a beneficiary succeeded in filing a complaint and dhs took action against the provider,this process would not result in a refund to the recipient.under welfare and institutions code section,disciplinary proceedings may result in disqualification of the provider from the program,but this would not provide reimbursement to the beneficiary and in fact could be detrimental to the recipient who would lose the services of the provider.moreover,it is not at all clear that the regulation governing recovery of overpayments applies to overpayments by a recipient rather than by dhs or,indeed,that the retention of the amount paid by the recipient can even be considered an overpayment if the provider has not also been paid by.assuming that the regulation applies,it provides only for recovery of the money by dhs,but contains no mechanism for getting the recovered money to the recipient.to the contrary,the department has taken the position in this case that it is prohibited from refunding money directly to recipients.therefore,even if dhs were to undertake recovery of moneys paid by recipients under the existing regulation,it still would not accomplish the ultimate goal of making the recipients whole for their expenses.
there is yet another fundamental flaw in the current provisions.under welfare and institutions code section,the provider is obligated to reimburse the beneficiary only after it has been paid for the services by the department.the statute does not explicitly obligate the provider to request such payment from dhs,but assuming that such an obligation is implicit,to what lengths is the provider obligated to go to obtain the payment if the department denies or fails to act upon the request,the beneficiary will obtain reimbursement only if the provider appeals,which section certainly does not obligate the provider to do.therefore,the beneficiary ability to obtain reimbursement remains dependent on voluntary action by the provider,contrary to its own best interests,and section fails to correct the very deficiency recognized in blanchard,supra,and the numerous other cases cited above.
the experiences of schwarzmer and conlan illustrate the problem.the administrative record contains several letters over a period of more than a year from schwarzmer provider attempting to obtain reimbursement for payments made to the provider during the retroactivity period.to date,it has been over eight years since schwarzmer eligibility was established and as far as appears,the provider still has not been reimbursed in full by dhs and schwarzmer has not been reimbursed by the provider.there is no basis for disciplining the provider,since he is not obligated to repay schwarzmer until he is paid by dhs,and he has taken reasonable a good deal more than may be expected of many obtain payment from the department.the provider is under no obligation to appeal further,and schwarzmer will not receive the reimbursement to which he is entitled unless and until such efforts are made.
while conlan provider has not been so forthcoming,his situation also demonstrates the inadequacy of the available remedies.conlan requested reimbursement from his provider,which flatly refused to pursue reimbursement on his behalf.although the provider response may contravene welfare and institutions code section,in the department view conlan only recourse is to report the misconduct of his own provider to the department,recognizing that even if discipline should be imposed it will not necessarily obtain for him the reimbursement to which he is entitled.
petitioners contend that the federal corrective payment regulation,code of federal regulations section,compels the department to promptly reimburse them for the covered services for which they paid during the retroactivity period.dhs,on the other hand,contends that the federal vendor payment requirements a d,prohibit it from making reimbursement directly to the recipient rather than to the vendor.both contentions are mistaken,but these provisions do illuminate the proper resolution of the present controversy.
individuals whose claims for medical assistance are denied or not acted upon with reasonable promptness are entitled to a fair hearing to challenge the denial a greenstein,supra.at,and the corrective action regulation requires the agency to promptly make corrective payments,retroactive to the date an incorrect action was taken if it is ultimately determined that the agency incorrectly denied coverage.the corrective payments may be made directly to the medicaid recipient.greenstein,supra,at.nonetheless,as the department correctly argues,section does not apply here since the department did not incorrectly deny eligibility to any of the petitioners and their request for relief does not arise out of corrective action resulting from a fair hearing.
under the vendor payment principle,payment for medicaid services generally may be made only to the provider.a d and.the purpose of the vendor payment principle is to ensure that providers will be reimbursed for services they furnish recipients,thereby eliminating disincentives in providing such services based on the fear of nonpayment.greenstein,supra.at.but,contrary to the position of the department,the vendor payment principle is not inviolable.one exception that has been made to its application is with respect to corrective action payments.although the federal regulation does not explicitly authorize making corrective payments directly to the recipient,payments that are due under its provisions can be made in this manner.i t is reasonable to construe the corrective action regulation as an exception to the vendor payment principle.while the vendor payment principle serves to promote provider participation in medicaid,corrective payments made directly to recipients in no way hinders this objective.when medicaid needs to make corrective payments,the provider has already been paid it is only the recipient who requires reimbursement.akin to the rationale justifying the vendor payment principle,if corrective payments were not made directly to the recipient,there would be no guarantee that he or she would actually be reimbursed for their payments.therefore,not only is the corrective action regulation an exception to the vendor payment principle but direct payment in the corrective payment context is wholly consistent with the objectives of the vendor payment principle.greenstein,supra.at.
while the corrective action regulation is not directly applicable in the present case,the reasoning in greenstein is.the petitioners entitlement to reimbursement does not result from an erroneous denial of eligibility,but the important similarity is that the provider has already been paid for its services,so that there is no need to apply the vendor payment principle.and the court in greenstein held that if reimbursement were not made directly to the recipient,there would be no guarantee that he or she would actually be reimbursed for their payments.greenstein,at.indeed,by insisting that the vendor pursue reimbursement claims in which it has no financial interest,the department approach may tend to discourage vendor participation in the medicaid program,precisely the opposite result that the vendor payment principle is designed to achieve.since the recipient is the only party with an interest in pursuing the reimbursement claim,insisting that the claim be pressed by the provider,whose interests are normally antagonistic to the claim,without also giving the recipient a means of recourse,is both irrational and counterproductive.thus,in krieger krauskopf,supra,the court rejected the new york state commissioner of social services argument that reimbursement for expenses incurred during the retroactivity period was available only from the provider and not directly from the department.relying on the comparability principle,the court concluded that the recipients must be directly reimbursed.to hold otherwise would lead to the creation of two classes of medicaid recipients,one of which would receive fewer benefits solely because the members of the class paid their medical bills promptly,and the other which would receive greater benefits by way of reimbursement to the providers of medical services because the members of the class did not pay their medical bills promptly.id.at.thus,the failure of the department to provide a method by which recipients may be promptly reimbursed for covered medical expenses for which they paid during the retroactivity period violates federal law.
under state and federal law,recipients have the right to a fair hearing if they are dissatisfied with the actions of the county or state agency.a welf,ccr.each petitioner was in fact granted a hearing at which he was permitted to challenge the actions of dhs.although the alj in each instance concluded that there was no jurisdiction to grant the requested relief,each considered and decided the petitioner claim before it,thereby exercising jurisdiction and providing petitioners with the requested hearing.coan state of california cal d,subject matter jurisdiction has been defined as the power to hear or determine the case see also abelleira district court of appeal cal d.
the aljs were correct that the department has failed to establish a process to ensure that recipients such as schwarzmer and conlan receive the reimbursement to which they are entitled.it was therefore their duty to direct the department to comply with the mandates of the governing law in the cases before them,just as it may be their duty on occasion to declare that regulations adopted by the department are invalid.the alj must proceed in the manner required by law.code civ.o n principle,an invalid regulation should be vulnerable to attack at the administrative level whenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement,interpret,make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute,no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless consistent and not in conflict with the statute and reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.woods superior court cal d,woods,quoting.in woods,the petitioners argued that the regulations of the county department of social welfare violated state and federal law.the petitioners were granted a hearing,at which their request to invalidate the regulations was denied.they sought review of the agency decision under code of civil procedure section.the respondent argued that the petition properly should have been brought under section,but the supreme court disagreed,viewing the case as one where the court was reviewing the agency decision refusing to invalidate the regulation.the practical effect of prohibiting an administrator from nullifying an invalid regulation of his own making would be to require the invocation of a judicial remedy in all such cases permitting administrators an opportunity to construe challenged regulations in a manner to avoid their invalidation is preferable to requiring a court challenge.moreover,in those cases in which the validity of such a regulation must be judicially resolved,the task of a reviewing court is simplified by a narrowing and clarification of the issues in an administrative hearing.woods,supra,at.
the aljs also were correct in recognizing that it is not their province to establish or dictate the rules and regulations of the department.but it is their responsibility to ensure that the department by inaction does not fail to provide recipients the benefits to which they are legally entitled.indeed,fair hearings are available not only when a recipient is dissatisfied with agency action,but when an application is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.welf.presented with fair hearing requests from the petitioners,the aljs should have determined the amount of covered services purchased by each petitioner during the retroactivity period for which the department had not paid,if any.assuming that some amount was due from the department,the aljs might properly have deferred to the department choice of the method by which payment would be transmitted to the directly or through the provid
