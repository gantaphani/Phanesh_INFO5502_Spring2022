adam natali appeals from a decision of the court of appeals for veterans claims the veterans court.the court affirmed a decision of the board of veterans appeals denying natali claim that a veterans administration rating decision contained clear and unmistakable error cue.because natali has not shown that any error in the process leading to the rating decision would have altered the result in this case,we affirm the decision of the veterans court.
natali served on active duty in the united states army from november until november.upon his enrollment,natali was given a physical examination that included an assessment of his vision.the report from the physical examination noted that natali had vision in both eyes,corrected to in his left eye and in his right eye.the report did not include any indication of further eye problems.
sometime in,natali began experiencing additional vision problems.in september,he was hospitalized for headaches,blurring of vision,and progressive bilateral loss of vision.a report from an ophthalmologic examination shortly thereafter noted that natali had experienced residual headaches following a fall,that he had quit school at age because he could not read well,and that his head had begun hurting again after a automobile accident that occurred during his period of service.the report noted that natali vision had gradually declined following the automobile accident and that he had quit driving nine months before the examination because he could not see at night.natali was diagnosed with astigmatism mixed,bilateral with diplopia double vision.a veterans administration rating board in november granted natali a disability rating of percent pursuant to veterans regulation a,part i,paragraph a,for defective vision,bilateral vision on induction,zero percent,and stated that his vision was a ggravated by service in the ww ii.
in december,natali was reexamined in connection with his discharge from service.the examination report indicated a diagnosis of amblyopia,bilateral,due to astigmatism,myopic,bilateral,severe.in february,the rating board began reexamining the question whether natali eye condition was service connected.a rating board memorandum indicated that the rating board action was deferred pending receipt of additional clinical records hereinafter requested because t he evidence in file is insufficient to show whether or not veteran eye condition was aggravated by the accident which occurred november,a may rating board memorandum noted that t he veteran alleges an injury to his head in due to a fall,also that his head was injured in an in and that his vision has gradually become less since the latter accident,but that t he clinical records covering hospitalization from november,until january,on account of injuries sustained in the in november have been carefully checked and that n o head injury other than a laceration of the scalp is noted in the records.the rating board memorandum concluded that a check of the entire record fails to disclose any disease or injury during service to which an aggravation can be attributed,and that t he board is inclined to the view that the increased impairment of vision noted at the time of the veteran discharge from service is due solely to natural progress and was not aggravated by military service.
in an august letter,the rating board informed natali that his claim had been further reviewed based upon report of examination conducted of you at this facility on december,and a review of all the records in your case and that it has now been determined that your defective vision is due to structural defects of the eye.the letter explained that those defects were of congenital or developmental origin,that natali was not shown to have suffered from any disease or injury during service which may be considered as having aggravated that condition,and that t he increase in loss of vision in service is considered to be the result of natural progress and not the result of military service.a contemporaneous rating board memorandum proposed severing service connection for natali disability based on the december examination.
in a decision dated october,the rating board severed service connection for natali eye problems.the rating board based its ruling on a conclusion that the november decision contained cue.the rating board determined that natali had amblyopia expanopsia,bilateral,due to high error refraction and astigmatism,mixed,bilateral and that his condition is due to a defect in the form and structure of the eye,held to be of a congenital or developmental origin and there is no evidence of any superimposed disability during service which could have caused or aggravated the congenital condition.the rating board noted that its conclusion was based in part on the december discharge examination.
since,natali has undergone several medical examinations in an effort to show that the rating determination of october was incorrect.he has offered evidence of examinations in february,december,and september to show that he did not have amblyopia.
in october,natali filed a claim with a regional office of the department of veterans affairs in which he argued that the rating board decision contained clear and unmistakable error.the regional office denied natali claim on the ground that the rating decision was shown to have been proper based on the evidence of record available at that time and the rules in effect at that time.
natali appealed the regional office decision to the board of veterans appeals,which upheld the regional office determination that the severance decision did not contain cue.the board found that the november medical evidence showed that natali suffered from amblyopia expanopsia,bilateral,due to a high error of refraction,that the condition had existed all of natali life,and that it was not aggravated during his military service.the board also found that the december medical examination showed that natali suffered from sever e astigmatism,myopic,with bilateral amblyopia due to this condition.the board noted that the rating board had before it evidence that natali had injured his head in that the head injury had contributed to his automobile accident in and that no clinical records from november to january noted any head injury other than a laceration of the scalp.the board concluded that based on that evidence,the rating board found that natali eye condition was attributable to a congenital or developmental defect and that the increased impairment he experienced was due to the natural progression of that disorder,rather than aggravation during military service.
the board then determined that although natali had submitted extensive medical evidence to support his conclusion that the rating determination of october was incorrect,the evidence obtained after the decision could not be used to show that the decision contained cue.in concluding that the rating board did not commit cue,the board explained that t he december discharge evaluation performed by the service medical board clearly indicates that natali condition existed prior to service and was not aggravated in service.
natali appealed the board decision to the veterans court.he argued that it was clear and unmistakable error for the rating board to consider evidence that was not before the rating board in determining that the rating decision contained cue.natali also argued that the rating board committed cue by not applying the presumption that his eye condition did not exist when he enrolled in the army and not applying the presumption that any condition he may have had when he entered the military was aggravated by service.
the veterans court affirmed the board decision.natali principi.june.the court declined to find cue based on the fact that the rating board had considered the december evaluation.the court explained that a lthough revisions based on cue clearly were limited to evidence that had been before the rating board at the time of the previous decision,and severance decisions clearly were not so limited.accordingly,the court concluded that even if the rating board should not have considered the december evaluation as
