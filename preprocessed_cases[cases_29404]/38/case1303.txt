this appeal involves the severance of a veteran benefits based on a finding of fraud.specifically,a department of veterans affairs va regional office ro severed veteran keith roberts benefits for stress disorder ptsd after an investigation revealed that roberts provided fraudulent statements in connection with his claim.those fraudulent statements related to the sole stressor the ro identified when awarding benefits in.as it relates to this appeal,the board of veterans appeals board found that the severance was proper,and the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court,sitting en banc,affirmed.see roberts shineski.en banc.
because roberts,represented by counsel,challenges only discrete aspects of the veterans court decision,the issues on appeal are narrow.the first is whether the va and the board erred by severing roberts benefits in accordance with the va regulations rather than pursuant to the procedures set forth in the program fraud civil remedies act of pfcra,et.the second is whether the va was required to review roberts medical records for alternate stressors before severing his benefits,when the only stressor cited in his ratings decision,and the underlying ptsd examination,was found to be fraudulent.because the veterans court correctly decided that the board did not err in its decision on either issue,we affirm 
background 
roberts served on active duty in the united states navy from march to december,spending the majority of his service stationed at a naval air facility in naples,italy.during a march psychiatric examination at a va medical center,roberts reported that he witnessed the death of a friend,gary holland,in an accident at an airplane hangar while they were stationed together in naples.the accident occurred on february.according to the medical report,roberts indicated that part of a plane fell on and crushed holland,and that roberts was arrested for damaging the plane while trying to extricate his friend.joint appendix ja.the examiner noted that nothing appears in the service records about this incident.id.
roberts also reported during the same examination that,in a separate incident on december,he was arrested,placed in a straight jacket and restraints by shore patrol.id.roberts clinical records corroborate that incident,indicating that,after having a few drinks,roberts became annoyed when shore patrol asked him questions and for identification,fled and fell into a ditch,and then became combative and assaultive when taken to the dispensary.ja.the examiner diagnosed roberts as having dysthymia with irritability and mixed personality disorder with antisocial and borderline features.
roberts award of disability benefits 
in august,roberts submitted a claim for disability compensation for an acute personality disorder,which he amended in february to include service connection for ptsd.in support of his claim,he submitted a letter to the ro in which he detailed the events of the death of his very good friend gary holland in.ja.in the letter,roberts reported that holland was working on a plane when holland coat became entangled on a safety pin on the plane,releasing the safety pin and causing a piece of the plane to fall on and crush holland.roberts went on to write the following 
i proceeded to sound the alarm,ran over to the plane to assess the situation at which time i found gary still conscious and coherent.i informed him i would get him out and then proceeded to run next door to the ground support unit,informed a chief petty officer of the situation and ordered him to bring a cherry picker to the front of the hanger sic to lift the plane.
as i was returning to the hanger sic i confronted my class superior and informed him to place a ladder at the rear hatch of the plane and load men into the tail section to relieve the front.i then proceeded to the front of the plane and instructed the ground support engineering chief to puncture the radome of the plane to lift it up.a t this time a lieutenant commander who informed me he was the safety officer ordered me to stop and when i refused,he had me placed on arrest by a marine guard.the lieutenant commander then proceeded to have air bags placed under the plane to lift it this took approx minutes,my method would have taken only a few minutes.the lieutenant commander stated that it was more important to save the plane than it was to save the man.when the plane had risen enough,i broke away from the guard and i and another shipmate proceeded under the plane and extradited sic gary to an awaiting corpsman who gave gary a shot of adren a lin e in the heart and revived him.he was then transported by chopper to the nato hospital where he passed away the next day brain dead.
i have always believed gary would have lived had i not be en thwarted in my rescue attempts.
ja.in march,roberts underwent a va ptsd examination and again reported the death of gary holland as a traumatic stressor.the examiner diagnosed roberts with,among other things,chronic ptsd.
a few months later,in may,the ro awarded roberts a disability rating for ptsd,effective august.the rating decision cited only one stressor to support its determination that roberts ptsd was directly related to military service roberts presence at and role in the accident that caused gary holland death.ja.roberts disagreed with the disability rating,and,in may,the va awarded him a disability rating for ptsd with dysthymia and depression,effective august.the rating decision noted that t he veteran reported that he thinks about the traumatic event of his friend death three to four times each month at the minimum and when he is reminded of the event he can think of the events weekly or more.ja.roberts also stated that he is preoccupied with the trauma for six to seven days at a time,and he reported increased problems with anger control and that he has nightmares of the death of his friend.id.in,roberts requested reconsideration of his effective date.ultimately,the ro changed his effective date to july,a date with which roberts again disagreed 
b.the oig investigation 
in january,roberts complained by telephone to the va office of the inspector general oig that the va had mishandled his claim.thereafter,in july,the oig investigated roberts claim and issued a lengthy report,which found that roberts statements about his presence at and involvement in the accident that caused gary holland death were not supported by the record.specifically,the oig found that the navy judge advocate general jag corp report of the accident did not list roberts name anywhere,and that roberts was not mentioned in any of the nineteen witness statements about the accident.several of the witnesses the oig interviewed stated that roberts worked in a different shop and was not present at the accident.holland roommate reported that neither he nor holland were friendly with roberts.the oig also interviewed roberts in connection with its investigation,and reported that roberts maintained his version of the events and began to yell and curse when confronted with evidence that contradicted his statements.ja.the oig provided the investigation report to the ro,the va secretary office,and the united states attorney office for the eastern district of wisconsin.
severance of benefits 
on august,the ro sent roberts a notification proposing to sever his benefits on the basis of fraud.the letter outlined the findings contained in the oig report and informed roberts that the ro found roberts statements regarding gary holland death to be fraudulent.in response,roberts submitted a statement requesting that the va refrain from severing his benefits until the proposed severance can be appealed to the board of veterans appeals.on november,the ro issued a decision severing roberts benefits on the basis of fraud.
roberts appealed the ro decision to the board,which affirmed the decision to sever benefits pursuant to a inquiry.first,it found fraud on the basis of the oig investigation,such that roberts benefits were subject to severance even though they were in effect for more than years.see benefits in effect for more than years will not be severed except upon a showing that the original grant was based on fraud.next,under d,the board found that the government established that there was cue in the original ro decision granting benefits.the board also rejected roberts argument that the va should have considered his december shore patrol incident as a possible stressor before severing benefits.it found that no additional stressors were in fact presented to the va in connection with the veteran initial claim of entitlement to service connection for ptsd.ja.it also noted that the may rating decision cited only the death of gary holland as a stressor,as did the march examination report on which the rating decision was based.id.
on april,the veterans court issued an en banc decision with two separate opinions concurring in part and dissenting in part.see roberts shinseki.en banc.the majority affirmed the severance of benefits based on fraud but found that the cue analysis of d does not apply to severance proceedings alleging fraud id.at.in the absence of any specific regulation governing severance based on fraud,the court found that general due process safeguards of.set out the applicable procedures.as it pertains to this appeal,the veterans court was unanimous in rejecting roberts argument that the va was required to refer allegations of fraud to an administrative law judge alj pursuant to the pfcra.id.at.the court found that,under of the implementing regulation,no allegations of liability may be referred to an alj if the false claims or false statements resulted in a monetary gain of more than.id.citing a and c.because roberts received over in va benefits,the veterans court found no error in not referring this case to an alj under the pfcra.id.the veterans court also upheld the board determination that the va was not required to consider evidence of alternate stressors before severing roberts benefits,noting that roberts failed to provide evidence of additional stressors within the day period to do so.roberts.at.the court also noted that roberts could pursue a separate claim based on any additional stressors,but that,in this case,the board did not adjudicate a claim for service connection for ptsd based on stressors other than the stressor found to be fraudulent,the shore patrol incident and was not required to do so as part of the severance proceeding.id.at,emphasis in original.
criminal prosecution 
contemporaneous with the vas proceedings to sever roberts benefits,roberts was indicted on five counts of wire fraud,based on allegations that he did knowingly devise and participate in a scheme to defraud the va of compensation benefits,and that,a s a result,roberts wrongfully obtained from the va in excess of.united states roberts,case,superseding indictment,ecf.a jury convicted roberts on all five counts,and the district court sentenced roberts to months imprisonment and ordered restitution in the amount of.id.at ecf.the seventh circuit affirmed,rejecting,among others,roberts argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the veterans court possesses exclusive jurisdiction to review board decisions.united states roberts,cir.
standard of review 
our review of veterans court decisions is limited by statute.under a,we may review the validity of a decision of the veterans court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof other than a determination as to a factual matter that was relied on by the court in making the decision.unless the appeal presents a constitutional issue,we may not review a a challenge to a factual determination,or b a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.d.we review legal determinations by the veterans court under a de novo standard.see arzio,fed.cir.
the veterans court decision that the pfcra does not require the va to refer this matter to an alj is a decision involving a statutory interpretation and,thus,is within our jurisdiction to review.in addition,the question of whether the va,in the context of a severance proceeding,must consider evidence of alternate stressors before severing benefits that were awarded on the basis of a single,fraudulent stressor,is a challenge to a rule of law that is also within our jurisdiction to review 
discussion 
a.the pfcra 
the pfcra was enacted in to allow administrative agencies to pursue remedies for false or fraudulent claims for benefits or payments.see vermont agency of natural res.united states ex ret.stevens,orfanos dep t of health human.the statute subjects violators to a civil penalty of per claim and to an assessment,in lieu of damages,of up to twice the amount of such claim.a a.according to the vas implementing regulations,allegations of liability under the pfcra are referred to the va oig,who conducts an investigation and reports to the va general counsel.if the general counsel believes there is adequate evidence of liability,the general counsel can only issue a complaint under this regulatory scheme after providing written notice to the attorney general of its intentions and after receiving a statement of approval from the attorney general.id.at.after the general counsel issues a complaint and receives an answer,the matter is referred to an alj for a hearing.
the pfcra is a sister scheme to the false claims act fca and is designed to operate in tandem with the fca.stevens,at.the legislative history of the pfcra indicates that it was intended to address cases of fraud against the govern ment because,in such cases,the cost of litigation gener ally exceeds the amount recovered,thus making it economically impractical for the justice department to go to court.see,at,reprinted in.consistent with that purpose,the pfcra does not apply to allegations of liability where the fraudulent claims at issue are for more than.c a.the legislative history refers to this figure as a jurisdictional cap,at.
roberts fundamental argument on appeal is that the pfcra is controlling law,such that o nce an allegation of fraud has been made the pfcra must be followed.appellant.he contends that va employees may not conduct fraud adjudications,because such adjudications are in nature,are unsuitable for ex parte adjudication,and are inconsistent with the vas claims process id.roberts contends that,if the va referred this matter to an alj pursuant to the pfcra,roberts would have had proper notice,a neutral forum,and due process as provided by the fifth and sixth amendments of the constitution.reply.in effect,roberts argues that the va only course of action to sever his benefits because of fraud was through the pfcra,and because the va did not follow that course,it improperly severed roberts benefits and violated his constitutional rights.
there are several reasons why roberts position is without merit.most significantly,the pfcra is not an exclusive remedy.the remedies it provides are in addition to any other remedy that may be prescribed by law.a.even if the va were required to act pursuant to the pfcra,that would have no effect on the va ability to sever roberts benefits.
the veterans court also correctly concluded that the jurisdictional cap in the pfcra precluded the va from pursuing a complaint under that statute.roberts.at.the pfcra does not apply when more than is requested or demanded in violation of in a fraudulent claim or a group of related fraudulent claims.c a.as indicated above,the legislative history expressly refers to this restriction as a jurisdictional cap.h,at.here,the record clearly reflects that roberts fraudulent claims exceeded the jurisdictional threshold of the pfcra.indeed,roberts appears to concede as much.reply.that the jurisdictional threshold was exceeded is confirmed by the results of roberts criminal proceeding,in which roberts was ordered to pay over in restitution.thus,putting aside whether the pfcra was the required procedure,it clearly was not available given the amount of penalties and assessments at issue.
roberts contends that the amount is not jurisdictional,citing orfanos department of health human services.in that case,however,the petitioner fraudulently obtained only in violation of the statute,far below the jurisdictional cap.id.at.althou
