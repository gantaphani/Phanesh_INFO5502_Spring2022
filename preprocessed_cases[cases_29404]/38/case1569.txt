louis hall appeals the decision of the merit systems protection board mspb or board,denying law enforcement officer service credit for his duties as a canine enforcement officer.hall dep t of the treasury,no,wl.because the board factual determinations are supported by substantial evidence and its legal conclusions are not arbitrary,capricious,or an abuse of discretion,and are otherwise in accordance with law,we affirm the board denial of service credit for the period at issue in this appeal.however,because the department of the treasury treasury waived its right to request limitation of the time period for which the board may review hall entitlement to service credit,we hold that the board erred in restricting the time period at issue in hall appeal.thus,we reverse that portion of the decision and remand for a determination of whether hall previous duties qualify for the service credit he requests.
background 
petitioner,louis hall,is a canine enforcement officer ceo with the united states customs service.he has been employed as a ceo since,except for a period between may and july.hall filed requests for law enforcement officer leo service credit on december,december,december,and on december.on june,treasury denied each of his requests for leo service credit.leo service credit would have permitted hall to retire with an increased annuity after becoming fifty years of age and completing twenty years of service as a leo.c.hall appealed treasury denial to the mspb.
prior to hall hearing on october,the administrative judge limited the period of retroactive service for which hall could seek leo service credit to one year prior to each of his requests for leo service credit.thus,the period for review of hall duties was limited to december,through december.this ruling was based on e,which provides that credit for past leo service will not be granted for a period greater than one year prior to the date of the employee request for such credit.in an initial decision dated november,the administrative judge held that hall had not established that he is entitled to receive leo service credit for his ceo duties from december,through december.hall appealed the administrative judge determination regarding leo service credit,and her decision to limit the period for review of his duties.on september,the full board denied hall request for review,thereby adopting the administrative judge initial decision as its final decision.hall timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction pursuant to a.
discussion 
standard of review 
this court must affirm an mspb decision unless it is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law obtained without procedures required by law,rule,or regulation having been followed or unsupported by substantial evidence.c hayes dep t of the navy.the burden of establishing reversible error in the board decision rests upon hall.harris dep t of veterans affairs.
there are two main issues present in this appeal.the first issue is whether the board conclusion that hall had not shown that he is entitled to receive leo service credit is arbitrary,capricious,an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law.hannon dep t of justice.the second issue is whether the board erred in limiting the period for review of hall duties to december,through december.
the relevant statute for leo service credit states that a n employee who is separated from the service after becoming years of age and completing years of service as a law enforcement officer is entitled to an annuity.c emphasis added.law enforcement officer is defined as an employee,the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation,apprehension,or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the united states.law enforcement officer is further defined by regulation to exclude employees whose duties involve maintaining order,protecting life and property,guarding against or inspecting for violations of law,or investigating persons other than persons who are suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the united states.the primary duties of a position are those that a re paramount in influence or weight that is,constitute the basic reasons for the existence of the position o ccupy a substantial portion of the individual working time over a typical work cycle and a re assigned on a regular and recurring basis.
in determining whether hall duties as a ceo were primarily the investigation,apprehension,or detention of criminal suspects,the board considered his position description.the ceo position description states in relevant part 
t he incumbent of this position serves as an enforcement officer with responsibility to enforce laws governing the importation of merchandise interdict smuggled merchandise or contraband detect violations of customs laws and those of other federal agencies,dea,immigration,agriculture and arrest,if warranted,persons involved in the violations.the major portion of the incumbent time is spent working directly with dog in one of three work situations vehicle search which includes vessels,trains,aircraft,trucks and autos cargo and baggage processing or mail processing trains and utilizes dogs and special detection equipment used in interdiction of drugs and other prohibited substances.
emphasis added.
regarding the board determination that hall failed to show that he is entitled to receive leo service credit,hall argues that the board erred in failing to use its own interpretation,as set forth in prior board decisions,of the statutory definition of an leo in evaluating hall duties.hall argues that the board instead placed erroneous weight on the bingaman considerations using them as a substitute for the statutory definition.see bingaman dep t of the treasury.
hall asserts that the board has appropriately formulated a definition of the terms investigation and apprehension,based on the text of the statute and the legislative history hall cites hobbs office of personnel management,and ferrier office of personnel management,as defining the term investigate.in hobbs,the board noted that webster ninth new collegiate dictionary defines investigate as to observe or study by close examination and systematic inquiry or to make a systematic examination esp.to conduct an official inquiry.at.
in ferrier,the board stated that investigation in section refers to criminal investigation factors that distinguish criminal investigation from investigation include unusual physical hazards for the investigator arising from frequent contacts with criminals and suspected criminals,working for long periods without a break,status hours a day,and carrying weapons an investigation is an observation or study by close examination and systematic inquiry.at internal citations omitted emphasis added.
as to the bingaman considerations,hall asserts that they should not have been used by the board to usurp the plain language of the statute as interpreted in hobbs and ferrier.hall,like many other leo service credit applicants with similar appeals presently pending before this court,reads the statutory language to require him to simply prove that his duties are primarily the investigation,apprehension,or detention of suspected or convicted criminals.hall,in effect,argues that being required to present proof regarding the considerations set forth in bingaman,when such factors are not set forth in the statute or even the legislative history,is unfair and improper.
we do not consider hall argument to be persuasive.the bingaman considerations are not a substitute for and do not supplant or usurp the language of the statute.serves as the ultimate measure of leo credit activity.in capturing the essence of what congress intended in enacting,the bingaman considerations serve simply as a set of tools to assist the board in gauging whether an employee assigned activities properly fall within the scope of the law enforcement duties recognized by and contained within the statutory ambit of the act.bingaman,at.thus,the bingaman considerations reflect and do not replace the language of the statute itself.application of the bingaman considerations by the board to the facts of a particular case suggests not a disregard of the statute but a proper and thorough consideration of facts relevant to a determination of statutory coverage.
this court thoroughly considered the statutory language and legislative history in bingaman.id.at setting forth the genesis and relevance of the bingaman factors.based on that thorough review,this court held that the statutory term law enforcement officer should be strictly construed,and that the legislative history of the statute indicates that it was enacted to ensure that the covered leo positions should be composed,insofar as possible,of young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in the federal service.bingaman,at quoting,at,reprinted in.
from these two considerations,this court in bingaman determined that the statutory term law enforcement officer should be limited to those law enforcement personnel who are most immediately involved in the process of criminal investigation and arrest.id.at see also hannon,at.to determine whether a particular employee is most immediately involved in the process of criminal investigation and arrest,the court reiterated the board formulation of the following factors has frequent direct contact with criminal suspects is authorized to carry a firearm interrogates witnesses and suspects,giving miranda warnings when appropriate works for long periods without a break is twenty four hours a day and is required to maintain a level of physical fitness.bingaman,at.
these factors were not set forth as a substitute for the statute,but rather as a framework for the factual inquiry needed to ascertain coverage under the statutory scheme.the bingaman factors are thus considerations that bear on the question of whether an employee qualifies for leo retirement credit.although no single factor is essential or dispositive,we stated in bingaman that these considerations capture the essence of what congress intended in enacting.bingaman,at.in other words,the bingaman considerations are relevant to determining whether an employee is a law enforcement officer because they are relevant to determining whether an employee duties are primarily criminal investigation,apprehension,or detention.see hannon,at.it bears repeating that no single factor is essential or dispositive.bingaman,at.in addition,the list of considerations set forth in bingaman is by no means an exhaustive or exclusive list of the considerations that bear on whether an employee qualifies for leo service credit under the statute.id.
application of the bingaman considerations 
regarding the first bingaman consideration,frequent direct contact with criminal suspects,hall testified that he had frequent direct contact with criminal suspects because the people working at the seaport have criminal records,and there is organized crime and other criminal activity there.however,hall testified that he has no direct knowledge of organized crime at the seaport.in addition,hall did not allege that the organized crime and other criminal activity at the seaport is something that he investigates.even if hall had frequent direct contact with individuals who may have criminal records,this is not the frequent direct contact with criminal suspects referred to in the bingaman considerations.the statute,as reflected in the bingaman considerations,requires investigation of criminals or individuals suspected of having committed a criminal act.in hall case,whatever direct contact he may have had with criminal suspects was incidental to his primary duties of employing his active response detector dog to detect narcotics.
regarding the second and third bingaman considerations,authorization to carry a firearm and interrogation of criminal suspects,the board found that hall is authorized to carry a firearm while performing his ceo duties and while driving to and from work.however,in the time period considered by the board,hall had not given any miranda warnings and had only questioned one individual that he spotted in a restricted area without proper identification.
regarding the fourth and fifth bingaman considerations,working for long periods without a break and being,hall testified that he frequently works overtime and has been called out at am,am,and am to work overtime.hall is called in for overtime because he is on an overtime list,but testified that he does not know whether he can take himself off the list.hall supervisor testified that ceos are not required to stay in a readiness mode.hall supervisor also testified that hall is not in a paid status for hours a day and that hall must technically be in such a paid status to be on call.however,hall supervisor admitted that he can call someone in for overtime at any time.
the board found that while hall is allowed to plan days off in advance,his scheduled day off may be cancelled if no one else is available to work.hall testified that on several occasions his scheduled day off has been cancelled.the board considered all of this testimony and further noted that because hall detector dog is limited to working sixteen hours per day,hall does not work more than sixteen hours per day.the board also found that even if hall works long hours,he does not do so without taking breaks.
regarding the sixth bingaman consideration,being required to maintain a level of physical fitness,hall argues that although he is not formally required to maintain a specified level of physical fitness as a condition of employment,his position informally requires him to remain physically fit because it involves strenuous activity.hall had to pass an initial physical before qualifying as a ceo.hall points out that the ceo position description states that incumbents must be able to work under all types of conditions and will encounter physical demands such as running over rough surfaces,climbing heights,driving for extended periods of time,and heavy lifting,pushing,stooping,crouching,crawling,and reaching.the position description also states that a ceo may be required to defend himself against attack by hostile suspects,and warns that the work environment includes high risks and possible dangerous situations.
hall further points out that his primary investigative tool,his detector dog,weighs approximately ninety pounds.hall alleges that he must lift the dog repeatedly to investigate warehouses,aircraft,vessels,and other cargo containers.he at times must hoist his dog using a rope tied to a bag that cradles the dog.hall also alleges that he must lift and move freight,climb to reach stacked cargo containers,crawl through various cargo containers,and hoist himself into bellies of aircraft.the board considered the fitness requirements of hall position along with the other bingaman considerations in making an overall determination of whether hall is the type of law enforcement person who is most immediately involved in the process of criminal investigation and arrest,and whether his position includes vigorous demands that are far more taxing physically than most in the federal service.
upon reviewing the board analysis of the bingaman considerations,we discern no abuse of discretion in this portion of the board decision.
physical demands and hazard 
hall next argues that the board failed to properly consider the physically demanding nature of his duties.in its decision,the board acknowledged hall testimony that his position involved strenuous activity.just because the board did not give a detailed list of the strenuous activities included in hall duties does not lead us to conclude that the board failed to properly consider the physically demanding nature of hall duties.
hall also argues that the board failed to properly consider the hazardous nature of his duties.in hannon,this court noted that the board has consistently recognized that hazard is a significant element of law enforcement work,at citing ferrier,at peek,at and sauser,at,and that nothing in the legislative history of the relevant statutory provisions suggests that congress intended to prohibit
