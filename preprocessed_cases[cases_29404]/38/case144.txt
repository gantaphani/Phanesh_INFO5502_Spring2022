in july,the state of vermont filed a lawsuit against manufacturers of tobacco products,seeking reimbursement of medicaid expenditures made by the state for health conditions.vermont had filed a separate lawsuit asserting other claims in may,and in november,vermont settled all of its litigation against the tobacco manufacturers pursuant to a master settlement agreement.the claims of over other states and governmental entities that were pursuing a variety of causes of action against tobacco manufacturers were also settled pursuant to that agreement.the claims settled by vermont under the terms of the master settlement agreement are much broader in scope than the claims asserted by the state in its lawsuits.the amount of money to be paid to vermont pursuant to the master settlement agreement will far exceed medicaid expenditures by the state for health conditions.
plaintiff lawrence tyler is a citizen of the state of vermont who suffers from a health condition and has received medical assistance benefits for that condition through vermont medicaid program.tyler brought this action for a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief on behalf of all similarly situated persons,seeking to obtain the portion of the payments to vermont under the master settlement agreement in excess of that necessary to reimburse the state for its medicaid expenditures for health conditions.
tyler claims that the federal and vermont laws governing the state participation in the medicaid program require that vermont disburse the payments it receives under the master settlement agreement in accordance with the provisions of b.each of the claims for relief set forth in his complaint is premised on this contention.the defendants moved to dismiss tyler complaint.the united states district court for the district of vermont garvan murtha,chief judge granted the motion to dismiss,finding that the plaintiff claim was barred by the eleventh amendment as well as by d b ii,and finding that the complaint should also be dismissed for a number of other reasons.we conclude that the plaintiff claim is barred by d b ii,and we affirm the judgment of the district court on that basis and do not decide the question of whether the plaintiff complaint is barred by the eleventh amendment.
