background 
holmstrom applied for ssi benefits in november,claiming disability chiefly due to lower back pain and depression.the commissioner denied holmstrom application and his request for reconsideration.holmstrom then received a hearing before an alj who,on august,issued a decision denying ssi benefits.holmstrom requested review by the appeals council of the social security administration and submitted additional evidence.the appeals council made that evidence part of the record,but denied holmstrom request for review.holmstrom then sought review by the district court under g.the district court judgment affirmed the alj decision,and holmstrom appealed to this court.
the evidence before the alj included holmstrom medical records from veterans administration va facilities in california and nebraska these records show a long history of lower back pain beginning with his fall from a ladder in.the records from his years in california contain,ct scans and mris performed between and that show narrowed disc spaces,spur formation,degenerative disc disease,and disc bulges or herniations in the lower lumbar and upper sacral region of holmstrom spine.from show a complete loss of the disc space between two vertebrae in his lower back.throughout his time in california,holmstrom took prescribed medications for his back,including daily doses of muscle relaxants,milligrams of ibuprofen,and painkillers containing codeine for breakthrough pain.in attempts to reduce his back pain,holmstrom underwent trigger point injections,physical therapy,hypnosis,and use of a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator unit.the medical records indicate that,on occasion,holmstrom received temporary and partial pain relief from these treatments.in,doctors diagnosed holmstrom with major depression and treated him with individual and group therapy and a prescribed antidepressant medication.by the end of that year,holmstrom psychiatrist recorded that the depression was in remission.in april,holmstrom reduced his intake of the antidepressant medication on his own because of side effects at his next visit,the doctor he saw acceded to this.
after holmstrom applied for ssi benefits,the california department of social services requested consultative examinations.in march,an orthopedist examined holmstrom and found him normal in all respects save for decreased range of motion in his lumbar spine.an rfc assessment in october incorporated this information and concluded that holmstrom had virtually no physical limitations.the doctor who performed an april consultative psychiatric exam concluded that holmstrom could function adequately in work situations.
the medical records from the va medical center in omaha,nebraska,indicate that holmstrom began to see doctors there in december.he began seeing carmen britt,who became his treating physician for his back,in february.britt continued holmstrom medication regime of muscle relaxants,ibuprofen,and codeine pain killers.in june,britt completed an rfc assessment form on which she indicated that holmstrom could lift and carry up to ten pounds occasionally,and bend or reach up occasionally,but should not squat,crawl,kneel,twist,or climb.in answer to several other questions regarding holmstrom limitations,britt wrote on the form ask the patient.the record indicates that britt had seen holmstrom on three occasions before she completed the rfc assessment.
in december,holmstrom first saw william egan at the omaha va medical center for treatment of his depression.egan restarted full dosages of holmstrom antidepressant medication.because holmstrom was once again troubled by side effects of the drug,egan soon changed the prescription to a different antidepressant.he subsequently doubled,then tripled,the dosage of this new medication.egan referred holmstrom to david kopacz for a determination of whether holmstrom had stress disorder ptsd stemming from his combat service in vietnam.kopacz diagnosed holmstrom with ptsd and admitted him to the va ptsd clinic.in may,egan filled out a mental rfc questionnaire.on this form,he concluded that holmstrom psychiatric status severely affected his abilities,carrying out short and simple instructions,maintaining regular attendance and punctuality,and sustaining an ordinary routine without special supervision.egan wrote that he considered holmstrom disabled.the record indicates that holmstrom had been seen by egan on four occasions before egan completed the rfc assessment.
the alj held a hearing in may and a supplemental hearing two months later.holmstrom testified that he had not worked since and that he could not lift more than ten pounds or bend forward or backward because of the pain caused by these actions.he could sit no more than thirty minutes,nor stand more than fifteen minutes,before changing position.if alternating between standing and sitting did not alleviate his pain,he tried lying down,which usually gave him some relief he stated that he needed to lie down several times each day for up to an hour at a time.if lying down did not alleviate the pain,holmstrom took his codeine painkillers his prescription allotted him painkillers per month.he noted that the condition had consistently deteriorated over the previous several years things he could do two years before,he could no longer do at the time of the hearing.
virginia holmstrom,the claimant,with whom he had lived much of the previous six years,also testified.she stated that holmstrom could not sit for more than thirty minutes at a time.he changed positions frequently to alleviate his back pain.he laid down for more than thirty minutes about three times per day because of his back pain.holmstrom also stated that she thought the claimant had last worked in or as a repairman 
after the alj issued her decision,the appeals council accepted into the record additional medical evidence covering a period up to and including november.this additional evidence included records from office visits to kopacz.on august,holmstrom reported that his pain decreased only when he laid down flat,and kopacz noted that holmstrom was physically uncomfortable and changed positions frequently in attempts to relieve his pain.kopacz also noted that holmstrom was obviously severely impaired due to chronic pain as well as symptoms of ptsd and depression.in september,kopacz increased holmstrom antidepressant medication dosage again,to four times the originally prescribed amount.in a subsequent visit,kopacz lowered the dosage to its original level but added another medication intended to treat both depression and pain.the added evidence also contained an october mri showing that the lower lumbar and upper sacral region of holmstrom back contained advanced degenerative disc and facet disease,a possible disc herniation or bony outgrowth,and neural foramen stenosis.
ii.discussion 
we review to determine whether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the findings of the alj.beckley apfel,cir.substantial evidence is less than a preponderance,but enough that a reasonable mind might accept it as adequate to support a decision.id.we consider evidence that fairly detracts from,as well as that which supports,the alj decision.id.
the alj applied the standard procedure for determining whether holmstrom is disa
