background 
morris served on active duty in the united states army from july,to october.board decision at.his entrance examination revealed no psychiatric abnormality.subsequently,in mid september of,he underwent an examination in connection with his separation from the service.that examination also revealed no psychiatric abnormality.at the time,morris did,however,complain of experiencing nervous trouble and other symptoms.id.morris clinical record cover sheet dated october,sets forth the following diagnosis passive aggressive reaction,chronic,moderate,unchanged,manifested by periods of anxiety and inability to express anger.stress minimal.predisposition moderate,unstable family.disability moderate.
on january,morris filed with the department of veterans affairs va a claim for disability compensation for a psychiatric disorder.in support of his claim,he stated that,while in basic training,he had suffered mental and physical abuse from his platoon sergeant,which had caused him to experience a nervous breakdown.in a may,rating decision,the va regional office ro denied the claim.noting that the file did not reflect any record of treatment for a nervous condition during service,the rating specialists concluded that morris condition was in a chronic stage and had existed prior to service.the ro thus determined that there was no indication that morris condition was incurred in or aggravated during service.
on january,morris sought to reopen his claim for a psychiatric disorder by providing lay statements and a statement from a therapist.after the ro concluded that the additional evidence did not constitute new and material evidence sufficient to warrant reopening of the claim,morris appealed to the board.
in its february,decision,the board determined that,contrary to what the ro had found,morris had come forward with new and material evidence in support of his claim.board decision at.however,after reviewing the evidence,the board concluded that the evidence did not show that morris psychiatric symptoms were due to other than a personality disorder.id.under c,the board noted,a personality disorder is not a disease within the meaning of applicable legislation providing for compensation benefits.id.at.based upon the va regulation,the board therefore denied morris claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder.id.at 
on february,the va considered medical evidence from the university of south florida psychology department.morris had submitted this evidence on may,while his appeal before the board was pending.following a further denial of his claim,morris presented additional medical evidence to the.this evidence indicated that morris had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and included an opinion from a va physician that the schizophrenia had its onset during service.on june,the board again denied morris claim of service connection for a psychiatric disorder,concluding that the evidence still was not sufficient to show that the previous diagnosis of a personality disorder was in error.in re morris,slip op.at.june.morris then appealed to the veterans court.
in the wake of a remand from the veterans court in march of,the board,in may of,received the opinion of a psychiatrist who was an examiner for the board.based upon that opinion,the december opinion of an independent medical examiner,as well as additional evidence before it,the board reopened morris claim on february,and concluded that the preponderance of the old and new evidence,considered together,supports the claim for service connection for schizophrenia.in re morris,slip op.at.at the same time,however,the board determined that its february decision was well supported by the evidence then of record and in accordance with all applicable legal criteria and that the decision was thus final,slip op.at.subsequently,in april of,the ro awarded service connection for schizophrenia effective from may,and assigned a percent rating from that date.the ro assigned may,as the effective date because that was when the va received certain additional evidence from morris.thereafter,in,the board denied morris claim that the ro decision contained cue and that the award of service connection therefore should be made retroactive to the date of his claim for benefits.in re morris.
in september of,morris filed a motion with the board in which he argued that the board decision was tainted by cue because the board failed to correctly apply a,and.according to morris,the board improperly relied upon the existence in his service medical records of a psychiatric condition personality disorder as a basis for denying disability compensation.instead,he urged,the board should have relied upon the presumption of service connection under a and the presumption of sound condition under to award him compensation under for a psychiatric disorder.board decision at.
in its september,decision,the board denied morris cue claim.the board began by noting the claim that morris had presented in.the board pointed out that,at that time,morris contended that,during active duty,he developed,and was treated for,an acquired psychiatric disability that he was in sound condition when he entered the service that he was harassed by a drill sergeant,which resulted in his development of a nervous disorder and that,following separation from the service,his psychiatric problems continued.board decision at.continuing,the board noted that the board had determined that the initial service medical records on file showed that any psychiatric symptoms present during service were acute and transitory and attributed to a personality disorder.id.the board also had determined,it was noted,that a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder was not indicated during service or on an examination for separation from active duty.id.in addition,the board pointed out,the board had determined that,although more recently developed medical records referred to an investigation of a maltreatment incident,those records did not demonstrate the presence of an acquired psychiatric disorder during service but,instead,psychiatric symptoms associated with a personality disorder,which for short periods resulted in symptoms such as anxiety and depression.id.finally,the board set forth the board ultimate conclusions that a chronic acquired psychiatric disorder was not incurred or aggravated in service that a personality disorder is a congenital or developmental defect and not a disease within the meaning of the applicable regulation,c and that evidence received subsequent to the may rating decision,which was not appealed,did not present a new factual basis warranting the grant of service connection for a psychiatric disorder.id.at.
turning to morris contentions,the board first rejected the argument that,under a a veteran is entitled to a statutory presumption of service connection for an alleged disability.the board reasoned that a pertains to line of duty and misconduct considerations,neither of which was on appeal or before the board in board decision at.section a,the board stated,does not serve to establish a presumption that any claimed disease or injury in service is entitled to service connection,because a claimant makes a claim for service connection.id.
the board viewed morris main argument to be that the board had failed to afford him the presumption of sound condition under,which,he claimed,would have entitled him to compensation under for a psychiatric disorder addressing this argument,the board stated that t he veteran was afforded the presumption of soundness with respect to the issue of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder in the february board decision.board decision at.after making this statement,the board observed that the board had noted that morris entrance psychiatric examination was normal and that morris symptoms were associated with a personality disorder and were not due to a chronic acquired psychiatric disability.id.the board stated that the denial of service connection was not made on the basis that the veteran had a preexisting defect,infirmity,or disorder which was not aggravated during service.rather,the denial of service connection for an acquired psychiatric disability was made on the basis that an acquired psychiatric disability was not present during service and was not incurred in service.id.at.putting the matter another way,the board reasoned that the denial of service connection for a chronic acquired psychiatric disability was based on a determination that the veteran did not have this disability during service and any symptoms did not establish that a chronic acquired psychiatric disability originated during service.the denial was not on the basis that an acquired psychiatric disability preexisted service and was not aggravate therein.id.finally,the board remarked that,although morris was arguing that the board had failed to afford him presumption of soundness,what he really was complaining about was the board weighing of the evidence and its finding that,during his period in service,he had suffered from a personality disorder,which by regulation is not compensable.id.at.see c.based upon its analysis,the board denied morris motion for revision of the board decision on the basis of cue.board decision at.
morris appealed the board denial of his motion to the veterans court.before the veterans court,he pressed the same arguments that he had advanced before the board.he again argued that the board had failed to apply correctly a,and.the veterans court rejected morris arguments.noting that morris had offered no evidence that the board incorrectly considered his condition a personality disorder,the court stated that it previously had held that does not apply to personality disorders in view of the language of c.morris shinseki,wl at,citing winn brown,a personality disorder is not the type of disease or injury to which the presumption of soundness can apply.the court therefore affirmed the board september,decision that found no cue in its decision.this appeal followed.
discussion 
our jurisdiction to review decisions of the veterans court is limited by statute.a see forshey principi,en banc,superseded on other grounds by veterans benefits act of,a,stat.we have jurisdiction to review a decision of the veterans court with respect to the validity of a decision of the veterans court on a rule of law or of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof other than a determination as to a factual matter that was relied on by the veterans court in making the decision.a.our authority extends to deciding all relevant questions of law,and we can set aside a regulation or an interpretation of a regulation relied upon by the veterans court when we find it to be arbitrary,capricious,and an abuse of discretion,or otherwise not in accordance with law contrary to constitutional right,power,privilege,or immunity in excess of statutory jurisdiction,authority,or limitations or in violation of a statutory right or without observance of procedure required by law.jones west,see d.our authority,however,does not extend to the ability to review factual determinations or the application of a law or regulation to a particular set of facts unless a constitutional issue is presented.d.as set forth below,the sole issue in this case is whether the veterans court,in affirming the board decision,erred in its interpretation of the pertinent regulation,c.we therefore agree with the parties that we have jurisdiction over this appeal.
in order to revise a final va decision on account of cue,the following must be demonstrated 
either the correct facts,as they were known at the time,were not before the adjudicator or the statutory or regulatory provisions extant at the time were incorrectly applied,
the error must be undebatable and the sort which,had it not been made,would have manifestly changed the outcome at the time it was made,and 
a determination that there was cue must be based on the record and the law that existed at the time of the prior adjudication in question.
willsey peake,citing russell principi.
morris hinges his cue claim on the argument that,in the board decision,the board incorrectly applied c and that the board decision and the decision of the veterans court now on appeal continued the error.his argument essentially is as follows it is true that under c a disability attributable to a personality disorder is not compensable.reply br.at.however,under,a veteran claiming disability compensation under is entitled to a presumption that he was in sound condition when he entered service thus,even when the record contains an diagnosis of a personality disorder,in order to have that diagnosis defeat a claim for compensation under,the va must rebut the presumption of sound condition under.according to morris,if,as here,no disability was noted,the va must in accordance with the presumption of sound condition show by clear and unmistakable evidence that the condition noted during service was a disability.claimant br.at.that this requirement exists,morris contends,is supported by the language of c,id.at,and the interpretation of c set forth in two va general counsel opinions,id.at.thus,morris argues,the board erred when it interpreted c to mean that the diagnosis of a personality disorder in and of itself was enough to defeat morris claim of a psychiatric disorder.rather,the va should have been required to demonstrate affirmatively that the personality disorder existed prior to service.in short,we understand morris to be saying the following i recognize that a personality disorder is not a compensable disability.i also recognize that,in my case,the record shows an inservice diagnosis of a personality disorder.however,before that diagnosis could serve to disqualify me from compensation,the va should have been required to overcome presumption of soundness by demonstrating that i had a personality disorder when i entered the service.
the government responds that the veterans court did not err in affirming the board decision.the government starts from the premise that,in order to be entitled to compensation under,a veteran must demonstrate that he or she presently suffers from a disability,that there was incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury,and that there is a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service.resp t br.at.next,relying upon our decision in terry principi,the government contends that,if a disability can not be attributed to an injury or disease incurred or aggravated in the line of duty,the disability is not compensable.in that regard,the government points out that c states that a personality disorder is not a disease or injury within the meaning of.resp t br.at citing terry,at.accordingly,the government reasons,pursuant to terry,any disability attributable to personality disorders is not compensable.id.in other words,because a personality disorder is not a disease or injury,the condition can not form the basis for an award of disability compensation.id.at.the government thus takes the position that the veterans court correctly held that the board did not err in not applying the presumption of soundness to morris claim.the reason is that because morris personality disorder was not a compensable injury or disease,it could not be service connected.therefore,presumption of soundness did not apply in his case.id.at.at the same time,the government argues that neither of the two va general counsel opinions upon which morris relies supports his case.id.at.finally,the government makes the alternative argument that,even if the veterans court erred in its conclusion that c renders presumption of soundness inapplicable in this case,cue did not occur because the purported error was not outcome determinative.id.at.
