edward hamlin seeks review of a denial of disability insurance benefits under title ii of the social security act.hamlin filed for benefits in.an administrative law judge alj denied his claim,and both the appeals council and the district court affirmed the alj decision.hamlin appeals,raising the same issues he posed before the district court.essentially he contends the alj rejection of his disability claim was not based on substantial evidence.specifically,hamlin asserts the alj erred in finding he had a residual function capacity rfc for a wide range of medium work by failing to properly consider the opinions of his treating doctors and in not treating as credible his assertions of disabling pain.we reverse and remand to the commissioner of the social security administration for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion 
hamlin contends he is disabled based on severe and constant pain,primarily in his cervical spine and shoulders,and an inability to effectively use his arms.he claims his disability stems from a motor vehicle accident,has gradually worsened with time,and was exacerbated by a accident.hamlin,who is years old,worked as a truck driver and forklift driver until.he did not attempt working again until,when he worked as an egg gatherer for about two years.he was last insured for disability benefits on december.
hamlin filed his current application for disability insurance benefits in march,alleging a disability onset date of january,in his disability report,hamlin complained of cervical spine fractures,pain in his neck and arms,loss of the use of his arms,and numbness in his arms.he further alleged nerves and stated he could not think or understand clearly,vol.iii at.hamlin job listings reflect that he worked from to as an egg gatherer in a chicken house.according to his statement,this job consisted of gathering eggs for about thirty minutes,followed by a minute break because of arm pain.initially he worked about two hours each morning and each afternoon.his wife worked with him,and she tended to most of the other chores.hamlin stated that toward the end of he could only work about ten minutes before stopping to rest and by the end of that year,he could no longer work at all.
after benefits were denied,hamlin appealed and was afforded a hearing before alj stephen calvarese in april.hamlin was assisted by a representative.the alj held the relevant period for hamlin disability application was january,alleged onset date through december,last insured date.the alj followed the required sequential evaluation process for disability claims,see williams bowen,cir,and first determined that hamlin was not gainfully employed.at step two,the alj determined that no evidence existed showing hamlin disorder resulted in more than slight restrictions of daily living activities and that the disorder was therefore not severe.he nonetheless concluded that hamlin cervical spine compression fractures did severely compromise certain activities,thus satisfying the severity requirement.at step three,the alj found no impairment or combination of impairments that satisfied any of the secretary listing of impairments.based on the medical record,including consideration of hamlin allegations of disabling pain,his medications,and testimony at the hearing,the alj then concluded at step four that hamlin had the rfc for a wide range of light work,but that he could not perform his past relevant work moving to the final step in the evaluation,and based on hypothetical questions posed to a vocational expert ve,the alj determined that there were light and sedentary jobs,both unskilled and semiskilled but primarily involving constant use of hands and arms that hamlin was still able to perform.accordingly,the alj held hamlin was not disabled.the appeals council denied hamlin request for review.
hamlin then filed his complaint in district court,alleging the alj failed to accord proper weight to his treating physicians opinions,failed to properly evaluate his rfc,and failed to develop the record with respect to both his mental condition and his past relevant work as an egg gatherer.based on the parties disagreement over whether hamlin had amended his onset date during the administrative process,the district court determined in march that there was good cause pursuant to g to remand the matter to the secretary for the purpose of establishing the alleged onset date of p laintiff application for disability,vol.i at.the appeals council remanded the matter,again to alj calvarese,who conducted a third hearing in hamlin case in october.
the alj issued his last decision in february,granting hamlin motion to amend his alleged onset date to december.the alj found no basis for reopening the earlier,unappealed adjudications hence the relevant period of hamlin current application dated from november,the day after the adjudication on the prior application to december,the last disability insured date.he then determined there was no evidence hamlin had engaged in substantial gainful activity since november,he next found that although there was no indication of any severe mental disorders,hamlin did have severe impairments based on the cervical spine compression fractures that compromised his ability to lift and carry and to perform more than occasional stooping.however,these impairments did not satisfy a listing.
under step four,the alj concluded hamlin could perform a wide range of medium work compatible with the demands of his past relevant work in reaching this conclusion,the alj declined to give weight to the medical opinions of hamlin treating physicians,brixey and underhill.the alj also did not give weight to hamlin own statements regarding his disabling pain.upon determining hamlin could perform his prior work in view of his rfc for a wide range of medium work,the alj concluded hamlin was not disabled for the relevant time period.
despite his determination that hamlin was not disabled under step four,the alj noted that had hamlin established that he could not perform his past relevant work,vol.iii at,moving to step five would be appropriate.proceeding under that step,the alj posed a series of hypothetical questions to the ve.the alj first had the ve assume hamlin could lift fifty pounds occasionally and pounds frequently the requirements for an rfc of medium work,could walk or stand six hours a day,had unlimited use of his arms and legs,and could stoop occasionally.with only those restrictions in place,the ve testified hamlin could return to gathering eggs and identified a number of other jobs sedentary,light,and medium in the regional and national economies hamlin could perform.with greater restrictions somewhat similar to an rfc for sedentary work including infrequent lifting of up to five pounds,continuous sitting,frequent standing and walking,but no use of arms for repetitive movements and no use of arms or hands for grasping and handling,the ve stated that the only representative example of a job hamlin could perform would be that of a surveillance monitor.based on the alj third hypothetical question,which tracked the requirements for an rfc for light work and included decreases in ranges of motion in the back and neck,the ve concluded that the position of a ticket seller was available.finally,in responding to the alj fourth hypothetical question,the ve stated no jobs would be available if all of hamlin testimony was credible.the reasons the ve cited for hamlin being unable to hold a job included the problems with his right side,his arms and hands going numb,pain in his back and neck impacting concentration,and hamlin need to lie down daily.
ultimately the alj concluded apparently in line with his first hypothetical question,that hamlin rfc for a wide range of medium work was compatible with both the demands of his past relevant light work as an egg gatherer and with a significant number of other jobs considering plaintiff age,education and previous work experience.the alj therefore determined hamlin was ineligible for disability insurance benefits.the appeals council declined to assume jurisdiction over hamlin case,making the alj february decision the final decision of the commissioner.doyal barnhart,cir.the district court denied relief.we exercise jurisdiction pursuant to and g.
we review the agency decision to determine whether the factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and whether the correct legal standards were applied.doyal,at citation omitted.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.id.quotations and citation omitted.however,a decision is not based on substantial evidence if it is overwhelmed by other evidence in the record or if there is a mere scintilla of evidence supporting it.bernal bowen,cir.the agency failure to apply correct legal standards,or show us it has done so,is also grounds for reversal.winfrey chater,cir.finally,because our review is based on the record taken as a whole,we will meticulously examine the record in order to determine if the evidence supporting the agency decision is substantial,taking into account whatever in the record fairly detracts from its weight.washington shalala,cir quotation omitted.however,w e may neither reweigh the evidence nor substitute our discretion for that of the commissioner.kelley chater,cir.
with these principles in mind,we turn to the substance of hamlin appeal in which he argues the alj determination of his rfc was not based on substantial evidence.in particular,hamlin contends the alj failed to properly consider the opinions of his treating physicians and his allegations of disabling pain.
hamlin first claims the alj failed to give appropriate consideration to the opinions of his treating physicians,brixey and underhill.an alj must evaluate every medical opinion in the record,see d,although the weight given each opinion will vary according to the relationship between the disability claimant and the medical professional.the alj is required to give controlling weight to the opinion of a treating physician as long as the opinion is supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record.id.d.when an alj rejects a treating physician opinion,he must articulate specific,legitimate reasons for his decision.drapeau massanari,cir quotation omitted.an alj must also consider a series of specific factors in determining what weight to give any medical opinion.see goatcher united states dep t of health human,cir 
additionally,w hen a treating physician opinion is inconsistent with other medical evidence,the alj task is to examine the other physicians reports to see if they outweigh the treating physician report,not the other way around.id.quotation omitted.the treating physician opinion is given particular weight because of his unique perspective to the medical evidence that can not be obtained from the objective medical findings alone or from reports of individual examinations,such as consultative examinations or brief hospitalizations.doyal,at quotation omitted.if an alj intends to rely on a nontreating physician or examiner opinion,he must explain the weight he is giving to it.f ii.he must also give good reasons in his written decision for the weight he gave to the treating physician opinion.doyal,at see also soc.sec.rul,wl,at requiring decision to contain reasons that are sufficiently specific to make clear to any subsequent reviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the treating source medical opinion and the reasons for that weight.finally,even if a doctor medical observations regarding a claimant allegations of disability date from earlier,previously adjudicated periods,the doctor observations are nevertheless relevant to the claimant medical history and should be considered by the alj.see groves apfel,cir evidence submitted in earlier application for benefits is relevant to subsequent disability application when determining whether claimant is disabled by a progressive condition frustaglia sec y of health human,cir per curiam a n alj is entitled to consider evidence from a prior denial for the limited purpose of reviewing the preliminary facts or cumulative medical history necessary to determine whether the claimant was disabled at the time of his second application.reviewing the record in light of these authorities,we conclude the alj failed to adequately consider the opinions of brixey and underhill.
brixey first examined hamlin in january,at which time hamlin had severe pain in the area of his hips,region and entire cervical spine region,with a marked limitation of the entire range of motion of the cervical spine in all positions,vol.ii at.other cervical spine restrictions were noted,along with pain to palpation of the cervical spine regions of,and bilaterally.id.at.in reviewing taken at a veteran administration va hospital,brixey noted that the showed a compression fracture of several cervical vertebras sic with a moderately severe amount of deformity of this region with the subsequent radicular type pain as noted earlier in the report.id.brixey also found hamlin very obviously has a severe amount of damage to the cervical spine which apparently has been complicated by development of arthritis changes in the injured areas along with the other areas of involvement in both dorsal and lumbar areas.id.based on the examination and,brixey stated that hamlin was totally and completely disabled and will never be able to return to his usual occupation of truck driving.id.brixey treatment notes for appear to reflect primarily refills for medications,but also include notations of pain complaints.id.at.
brixey updated his report in february,after having seen hamlin periodically over five years.brixey reported that hamlin problems are gradually becoming worse with a greater restriction in the range of motion and a greater severity of the pain,particularly of the cervical and areas.id.at.he further noted radicular type pain into the left arm from the neck region.id.brixey anticipated hamlin would continue to gradually deteriorate,with more and more limitation of his mobility.id.he also stated that hamlin prognosis was somewhat guarded for treatment.id.brixey described hamlin range of motion of the dorsal spine,in particular the area and the entire cervical area,as having a marked limitation.id.he further listed hamlin medications as voltaren a nonsteroidal,xanax for nervousness,and tylox,as needed for severe pain.id.in october,brixey confirmed his findings based on the results of an mri performed in the same month.see id.at.
the record further reflects two statements of disability completed by in and one in hamlin as totally disabled due to his cervical compression,development of arthritic changes,muscle spasms and marked limitation in his range of motion.id.at.the prognoses noted a gradual worsening of hamlin condition.brixey also found hamlin to have s evere limitation of functional capacity,and to be incapable of minimal sedentary activity.id.at.
finally,in,brixey completed an rfc evaluation of hamlin for the period from through,noting that hamlin could lift six to ten pounds infrequently,carry eleven to twenty pounds infrequently,infrequently use his arms for reaching,pushing or pulling up to ninety degrees,and infrequently use his hands for grasping,handling,fingering,or feeling,vol.iii at.in the narrative accompanying the rfc evaluation,brixey listed the medical findings supporting his assessment as marked limitation of range of motion of cervical spine,hamlin inability to lift his arms above shoulder height,and pain in his middorsal area with any repeated movements.brixey offered his opinion that there is no way this patient can do any prolonged work for gainful employment.id.at.
in reviewing this evidence,the alj referenced only brixey november opinion that hamlin had been disabled since.the alj gave the opinion no weight and rejected it as brief,totally conclusory,and inconsistent with the overall case record.id.at.however,the alj failed to provide any sufficiently specific reasons as to why he was rejecting brixey opinion.nor,in stating that the doctor opinion was inconsistent with the overall case record,did the alj specifically highlight those portions of the record with which brixey opinion was allegedly inconsistent.at most,the alj referred to a consultative report issued by a taylor in,in which the doctor explained the limited degrees of and rotation he found in hamlin neck.id.at however,that report did not include an rfc analysis,and taylor had expressed an opinion in based on hamlin medical records,that he had little or no capacity to be gainfully employed.id.at.the alj did not mention the portion of taylor report in which the doctor noted his conclusion that hamlin had cervical disc disease resulting in a decreased range of motion and associated pain.id.at.
nor did the alj explain why he did not consider brixey rfc assessment specifically covering the period between and,which was accompanied by an explanation of hamlin limited range of motion,inability to lift his arms above shoulder height,and pain associated with repeated movements.in addition to discussing evidence supporting his decision,an alj must discuss the uncontroverted evidence he chooses not to rely upon,as well as significantly probative evidence he rejects.clifton chater,cir.the alj failed to do so here.
the record demonstrates that brixey assessments of hamlin are fully supported by objective medical evidence.in short,the alj improperly rejected brixey opinions because of the alj own credibility judgments,speculation or lay opinion.mcgoffin barnhart,cir quoting morales apfel,cir emphasis in mcgoffin.
the alj also rejected the medical reports of underhill,another treating physician of hamlin.underhill first saw hamlin in march in the context of determining hamlin eligibility for continued veteran disability support.in his evaluation,underhill reviewed from and a electromyogram emg performed by park in an april report,underhill noted that because of the progressive nature of hamlin disease,he should have been medically discharged from the military after his motor vehicle accident,vol.ii at.because hamlin was forced to continue military training that was contradictory to his injury,underhill reported to the va that hamlin was entitled to disability.id.at.
in an august addendum to this report,underhill noted that hamlin va medical records which included a may report,confirmed hamlin injuries were present when he entered military service.this report revealed vertebral deformities in and a fracture of the posterior spinous process of and small fragments of bone in the soft tissues.id.at.he further stated hamlin continued to have evidence of clinical radiculopathy in the right arm and chronic cervical degenerative arthritis with pain and stiffness.id.
underhill also completed a form disability statement in october,listing hamlin disabilities as compression fractures at,right radiculopathy and a fracture of the spinous process at.id.at.in november underhill expressed his opinion,based on his physical examination of hamlin and review of his medical records,including,emg and mri scan of the cervical spine,that it was reasonable to conclude that hamlin is unable to engage in any substantial gainful employment because of his disability.id.at.underhill further stated that hamlin disability existed prior to and probably prior to the.id.
in,underhill completed an rfc evaluation for hamlin covering the time period,vol.iii at.he rated hamlin lifting and carrying ability as infrequent for weight up to five pounds and never for weight more than that.id.at.he rated hamlin as unable to use his arms for repetitive reaching or pushing and pulling and unable to use his hands for repetitive movements such as grasping or handling.in an accompanying narrative,underhill based this assessment on hamlin cervical compression fractures,along with development of severe degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine with right radiculopathy since march.id.at.he further noted that hamlin had marked restriction of motion in his cervical spine with weakness of his arms and pain in the neck and arms daily.id.in underhill opinion,hamlin was permanently disabled and unemployable.id.at.
despite underhill extensive evaluations over the years,the alj concluded,again without properly supporting his determination,that underhill reports were brief,conclusory,and inconsistent with treatment records prior to hamlin last insured date.id.at.this conclusion is itself inconsistent with the fact that underhill submitted an rfc evaluation and based his opinion on objective medical evidence demonstrating hamlin severe compression fractures and severe degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine,with radiculopathy.the alj apparently attached significance to underhill rfc notation that hamlin impairments did not prevent him from being able to sit to hours,walk to hours,stand to hours,or sit and to hours.id.at.the alj may not pick and choose which aspects of an uncontradicted medical opinion to believe,relying on only those parts favorable to a finding of nondisability.see switzer heckler,cir.
the alj also erred in failing to adequately consider hamlin disability rating by the va which,although not binding on the commissioner,is entitled to weight and must be considered.baca dep t of health human,cir quotation omitted.both brixey and underhill found support in the va records for their evaluations of hamlin condition.
in light of the above,we conclude the alj erred by rejecting the medical opinions of hamlin treating physicians without engaging in the proper legal analysis when he made his determination that hamlin had an rfc for a wide range of medium work.the alj failed to articulate specific,legitimate reasons for his decision,drapeau,at,and equally failed to sufficiently highlight how the treating physician evaluations were inconsistent with the other medical evidence presented in the record based on our review of the record,we conclude the doctor opinions were supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and were not inconsistent with other substantial evidence in the record.d.
hamlin next contends the alj failed to properly consider his allegations of disabling pain in determining his rfc.we agree.t he claimant must first prove by objective medical evidence the existence of a impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the alleged disabling pain.thompson sullivan,cir internal citations omitted.next,the claimant must show there is a loose nexus between the proven impairment and the claimant subjective allegations of pain and if so,whether,considering all the evidence,both objective and subjective,claimant pain is in fact disabling.musgrave sullivan,cir.while the absence of an objective medical basis for the degree of severity of pain may affect the weight to be given to the claimant subjective allegations of pain,a lack of objective corroboration of the pain severity can not justify disregarding those allegations.luna bowen,cir.in the course of determining the credibility of a claimant statements regarding pain,an alj should consider 
t he individual daily activities.t he location,duration,frequency,and intensity of the individual pain or other symptoms.f actors that precipitate and aggravate the symptoms.t he type,dosage,effectiveness,and side effects of any medication the individual takes or has taken to alleviate pain or other symptoms.t reatment,other than medication,the individual receives or has received for relief of pain or other symptoms.a ny measures other than treatment the individual uses or has used to relieve pain or other symptoms,lying flat on his or her back,standing for to minutes every hour,or sleeping on a board and.a ny other factors concerning the individual functional limitations and restrictions due to pain or other symptoms.
soc.sec.rul,wl at.see also huston bowen,cir listing other factors including frequency of medical contacts,subjective measures of credibility that are particularly within the judgment of the alj,the motivation of and relationship between the claimant and other witnesses,and the consistency or compatibility of nonmedical testimony with objective medical evidence.in summary,an alj f indings as to credibility should be closely and affirmatively linked to substantial evidence and not just a conclusion in the guise of findings.id.at.here,we are not convinced the alj rejection of hamlin allegations of disabling pain was supported by substantial evidence.
in assessing hamlin allegations of pain,the alj considered a variety of factors including hamlin significantly reduced activities of daily living,alleged inconsistencies in hamlin testimony at the hearing regarding his pain,affidavits from individuals who attested to hamlin pain allegations,the role medication may have played in managing his pain,and the fact that hamlin did not require an assistive device for his neck,vol.iii at.in so doing,the alj found that hamlin pain testimony was credible only to the extent consistent with a residual functional capacity for a wide range of medium work activity.id.at.not only do we determine this credibility finding is unsupported by substantial evidence,we also conclude it is contrary to other evidence presented in hamlin record.see bernal,at a decision is not based on substantial evidence if it is overwhelmed by other evidence in the record or if there is a mere scintilla of evidence supporting it.
the alj examined hamlin significantly reduced activities of daily living,noting he performed no house or yard work and drove infrequently,vol.iii at.nonetheless,the alj determined that hamlin television watching constituted an activity requiring significant attention and concentration inconsistent with severe and intractable pain.id.there is no medical support whatsoever for this opinion.nor may an alj rely on minimal daily activities as substantial evidence that a claimant does not suffer disabling pain.thompson,at.
the alj also noted what he labeled as inconsistencies in hamlin testimony at the hearing regarding whether he had taken his medication the morning of the hearing and whether he slept three hours a night or four,vol.iii at.likewise,the alj considered doubtful hamlin assertion that he seldom went to church because he hurts too bad to sit but he was capable of sitting through the hour and minute hearing.id.these discrepancies are minor at best and can not serve to support a lack of credibility finding.the alj did not cite to any medical professionals for the proposition that hamlin was exaggerating his symptoms.moreover,the alj failed to note that at the second hearing in,hamlin expressed discomfort caused by sitting during the hearing,id.at,and at one point stood up to stretch,id.at,and later to walk around,id.at.
at the second hearing,hamlin testified to experiencing constant pain in his shoulder blades and pain when lifting even a cup of coffee,vol.iii at.he further testified to limitations on his activities from and,specifically,the worsening of his condition in to the point he could not grasp an egg without dropping it.id.at.he testified he tried doing leg exercises as recommended by his doctor but was unable to do so because of the pain.id.at.in,he began experiencing numbness in his arms,and receiving injections for involuntary muscle spasms,id.at.by then he also needed to modify his recliner by removing the padding and inserting boards so that he could sit without pain.id.at.the alj made no reference to this testimony despite the fact that hamlin statements went directly to some of the factors an alj should consider in making a credibility determination.see,huston,at soc.sec.rul,wl at.
finally,the alj noted that hamlin did not require an assistive device for his neck,vol.iii at.there is no evidence that any physician recommended such a device or suggested that one would have provided any pain relief.an alj is not free to substitute his own medical opinion for that of a disability claimant treating doctors.see miller chater,cir.
as noted earlier in this opinion,hamlin medical records are replete with his reports of pain and of prescriptions and refills for medication.in addition to the previously listed medications voltaren,tylox,xanax,hamlin was also prescribed tylenol with codeine for pain and cyclobenzaprine for relief of muscle spasms,vol.iii at hamlin reported to a local emergency room facility in october for relief from severe pain,vol.ii at.while medication and therapy may have been effective in alleviating some of hamlin symptoms,see,vol.iii at,this does not necessarily undermine the credibility of his pain allegations.regardless of his medications,hamlin testified to constant pain in his shoulders and arms,which increased whenever he used his arms.id.at.
in conclusion,the alj determination that hamlin allegations of disabling pain were of limited credibility is not supported by substantial evidence.hamlin medical records support his allegations of pain and his need for prescriptions to reduce such pain.in contrast,the alj findings regarding hamlin television watching,inconsistencies from the hearing,and non use of a neck brace,lack substantial evidentiary support and therefore are insufficient to undermine his pain allegations.
finally,and in light of the errors considered above,we address hamlin contention that the alj was incorrect to find hamlin had an rfc for a wide range of medium work.in the course of rejecting the medical opinions of hamlin treating physicians as well as hamlin assertions regarding disabling pain,the alj gave great weight to the remoteness of hamlin cervical fractures,his ability to perform work activities as recent as through,and the lack of a significant traumatic event or evidence of significant progression of his degenerative disc disease recent to his relevant period of november,through december.id.at.likewise,the alj concluded there were no diagnostic tests showing hamlin was prevented from prolonged standing or walking or occasionally lifting up to fifty pounds,a requirement for medium work.id.at.
the emphasis the alj placed on the remoteness of hamlin initial injury is irrelevant because he suffered another injury in shortly before he was no longer able to drive his truck and has sought and received continuous treatment for his fractured vertebrae since then.the fact that hamlin managed to gather eggs in a flat intermittently for a few hours a day,with frequent rests and while taking pain medication,simply does not support an rfc for performing a wide range of medium work.and if a condition is already severe,as in this case,a lack of further significant progression is also not evidence of an ability to do medium work.
nor is the rfc finding for medium work supported by the lack of diagnostic tests showing hamlin was prevented from prolonged standing or walking or occasionally lifting up to fifty pounds.in concluding hamlin could occasionally lift fifty pounds,the alj ignored park emg findings indicating right arm radiculopathy,as well as other doctors findings of hamlin diminished reflex and bilateral grip,and bilateral arm muscle weakness and grasp strength we do acknowledge these reports did not directly speak to whether hamlin was prevented from occasionally lifting up to fifty pounds.but they certainly intimate hamlin would be limited in his lifting capacity.moreover,even if there were no diagnostic tests showing hamlin was unable to lift up to fifty pounds,t he absence of such evidence is not evidence.thompson,at.this is particularly true in view of the fact that no treating or examining physician has ever stated that hamlin was capable of lifting so much weight.to the contrary,as we have pointed out,brixey noted in a rfc report for hamlin covering the years to that hamlin could only infrequently lift and carry between six and ten pounds.likewise,in,underhill completed an rfc report for hamlin for the period wherein he noted hamlin could only infrequently carry or lift up to five pounds,while similarly indicating hamlin was wholly unable to lift or carry any increased weight.
the only information from which the alj could have determined hamlin was able occasionally to lift up to fifty pounds might possibly be gleaned from a agency disability determination which listed a physician assessment of hamlin rfc.there,the reviewing physician checked a box indicating hamlin could occasionally lift up to fifty pounds.id.at.the alj did not indicate that he reac
