richard kiszka appeals from a decision of the merit systems protection board,docket no,denying kiszka application for a retirement annuity under the civil service retirement system csrs.we affirm.
kiszka served in the united states army from august through january.he then served as a civilian technician in the massachusetts army national guard mang from august through november.in november,kiszka separated from mang to enter national guard duty in the active agr.kiszka does not dispute that he was terminated from mang and that he neither requested nor was given a leave of absence.shortly after enrolling in agr,kiszka withdrew the contributions he had paid into csrs during his tenure with mang.
kiszka served in agr from november to may,at which time he was as a civilian technician in mang.mang characterized his appointment as a reemployment pursuant to the veterans reemployment rights act vrra,chapter.after his appointment,kiszka did not make a redeposit of the csrs contributions he had previously withdrawn.kiszka continued to work in mang until when he reached age.at that time,he retired after being involuntarily separated from the national guard upon reaching the mandatory retirement age and time in rank.see.
shortly before his retirement,kiszka filed an application for csrs benefits.he claimed that he had a total of more than years of federal service four months in the army,almost years in agr,and almost years in mang.opm made interim annuity payments to kiszka for two years,but eventually denied his application in february.opm then demanded that kiszka repay the in interim annuity payments that it had made while his application was under consideration.
opm denied kiszka application for retirement for several reasons.pertinent to this appeal,opm first determined that kiszka service in agr was not creditable toward his retirement.according to,creditable military service does not include service in the national guard except when ordered to active duty in the service of the united states or national guard duty if such service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and is followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter of title.opm determined that kiszka return to service with mang was not a reemployment because he was not on a leave of absence from mang when he served in agr but instead was separated.thus,according to opm,kiszka time in agr did not interrupt creditable civilian service.opm further determined that,even though mang characterized kiszka return as a reemployment,a n erroneous action by an agency can not create a right to benefits to which an individual would otherwise not be entitled.opm also ruled that by obtaining a refund of the contributions he made to csrs while he was employed by mang,kiszka negated his eligibility for retirement benefits based on the time covered by the refund.opm concluded that the statute governing civil service refunds a bars credit for periods of service covered by a refund unless an employee returns to federal employment and renews eligibility to receive civil service benefits based on a subsequent separation.
on kiszka request for reconsideration,opm affirmed its initial decision.opm reiterated that kiszka was not entitled to be treated as having been reemployed by mang because he was separated from mang rather than being on a leave of absence.
kiszka appealed opm decision to the merit systems protection board.the administrative judge who was assigned to the case reversed opm decision.the administrative judge ruled that there was no evidence that kiszka intended to make a permanent career of his active duty service in the national guard or in any manner made an affirmative waiver of his reemployment rights under the vrra.moreover,even though kiszka did not take a leave of absence from his civilian position,the administrative judge ruled that once a person meets the criteria for reemployment following military service,as kiszka has here,the agency must consider him to have been on furlough or leave of absence during the period of military duty.in a footnote,the administrative judge added that kiszka is entitled to credit for his previous civilian service even though he did not redeposit his earlier retirement contributions when he was reemployed.in such a case,the administrative judge stated,his annuity would be actuarially reduced based upon his age and the redeposit due at the time of his retirement.
opm appealed the administrative judge decision to the full board,which reversed.the board ruled that kiszka was not entitled to reemployment with mang after his service in agr because when he left mang he did not request a leave of absence.the board concluded that the plain language of d expressly conditioned the employee right to be returned to civilian employment,under title,on his having requested leave from his employer.the board addressed kiszka argument that such a request would have been futile based on national guard policy and concluded that even if one or more government officials misinformed the appellant about the procedures to follow when leaving his civilian employment to begin his agr service,any such misinformation would provide no basis for finding that the appellant is entitled to be treated as though he had requested and obtained leave,since the government can not be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law even if the claimant was denied monetary benefits because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a government official.the board noted that opm did not challenge the administrative judge decision that,if kiszka is otherwise entitled to annuity,he is entitled to receive credit for his service during the time for which he received a refund of his contributions.nevertheless,the board concluded that u nder d and a,such an action generally terminates an employee right to any future retirement annuity based on the service covered by those contributions.the board noted that it was not addressing opm argument that kiszka forfeited his reemployment rights by abandoning his civilian career in favor of a career in the military.
kiszka petitions this court for review of the full board decision.
kiszka argues that he was entitled to reemployment with mang after his service in agr,even though he did not request or receive a leave of absence from mang prior to enrolling in agr.the pertinent statute,d,provides 
d an employee who 
is separated from the service involuntarily,except by removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency 
after completing years of service or after becoming years of age and completing years of service is entitled to an annuity 
kiszka argues that,because he was involuntarily separated from mang and he was over years old when he was separated,he is entitled to an annuity if he completed years of service.kiszka asserts that if his years in agr and almost years in mang are all credited,he has completed more than years of federal service.opm responds that kiszka time in agr should not be counted toward the requirement of years of service,because it was not followed by reemployment in mang.
under c,military service may be creditable toward a csrs annuity.under,however,the definition of military service does not include service in the national guard except when ordered to active duty in the service of the united states or national guard duty if such service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and is followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter of title.if kiszka agr service interrupted creditable civilian service and was followed by reemployment in accordance with chapter of title,then his agr service would fall within the definition of military service and would be creditable toward his annuity.
because kiszka sought reemployment in may,his reemployment rights are governed by the vietnam era veterans readjustment assistance act of,pub,stat.codified as amended at vrra.section d of the vrra governed kiszka reemployment rights 
d any employee not covered by subsection c of this section who holds a position described in clause a or b of section a shall upon request be granted a leave of
