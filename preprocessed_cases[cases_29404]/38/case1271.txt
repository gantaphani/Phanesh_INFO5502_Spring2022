this case involves a claim for disability compensation filed by julius walker on april,for bilateral hearing loss.the board of veterans appeals board denied the claim on may.pending appeal to the united states court of appeals for veterans claims veterans court,the claimant died,and his son,james walker walker,was substituted as a potential accrued benefits beneficiary.the veterans court affirmed the board denial of the claim for bilateral hearing loss,and walker timely appealed to this court.we have jurisdiction under and for the reasons set forth below,we affirm.
walker served in the united states army air force from march of to november of.his military occupational specialty was a airplane pilot,and during service he was a flight instructor.the muskogee,oklahoma regional office ro denied the claim,and walker appealed to the board.the appeal included sworn statements from his son and wife that his hearing loss began in service and continued throughout his life.in support of his appeal,walker was eventually examined by a department of veterans affairs audiologist on september.the audiologist was instructed to conduct an examination,and asked i f hearing loss is diagnosed is it at least as likely as not due to his military service as a pilot.please provide medical rational e for opinion provided.
because walker service medical records were not available due to a fire in the facility housing the records,the examiner had only information obtained from walker and his grandson,who related walker difficulty in hearing and his history of bilateral hearing loss.the examiner noted that noise exposure in service is conceded,and diagnosed walker as suffering from bilateral hearing loss that would qualify walker for compensation if he could establish service connection for the diagnosed condition.the examiner however concluded that the veteran hearing loss is less likely as not caused primarily by military service as a pilot.the examiner reasoned that walker served years ago,and that p resbycusis hearing loss secondary to the veteran advanced age can not be excluded as the primary etiology for the veteran hearing loss.the examiner also noted that walker was exposed to recreational noise by hunting game times a year throughout his life without use of any hearing protection.based on this examination report,the ro denied walker claim.
walker appealed to the board.the board had the benefit of statements from walker wife and son to the effect that his hearing was normal upon entry into service,he suffered significant hearing loss in his time as a flight instructor,and his hearing slowly deteriorated in the years following his service.before addressing the evidence in the case,the board opinion set out the legal criteria to be applied.in order to obtain disability compensation under,and a,walker had to satisfy a test the existence of a present disability incurrence or aggravation of a disease or injury and a causal relationship between the present disability and the disease or injury incurred or aggravated during service the nexus requirement.this test has been approved by this court,see holton shinseki,quoting shedden principi,and is applied by the veterans court,see arms west.the board also noted that if the condition noted during service is not shown to be chronic,then generally a showing of continuity of symptomatology after service is required for service connection.b.
applying the test to the facts before it,the board concluded that the trained audiologist opinion was entitled to more weight than the information walker and his grandson,and his wife and son had supplied.age and recreational noise were seen as the more likely cause of walker diagnosed bilateral hearing loss.the board thus concluded that walker failed under the test to establish service connection for his bilateral hearing loss.the board opinion did not indicate whether it also found walker claim insufficient under b.walker timely appealed to the veterans court,and as noted above,upon walker death,his son stepped into his shoes for purposes of pursuit of his claim for compensation for bilateral hearing loss.
on appeal,walker argued that the audiologist examination was inadequate,for failure to consider and assess the continuous symptomatology shown by the lay statements of the wife and son,which were not before the examiner.walker also argued that the board had not properly treated the lay evidence of continuity of symptomatology,and sought a remand to the board for consideration of that evidence.the veterans court affirmed the board decision,also viewing the case through the prism of the familiar test for service connection.the veterans court concluded that the board had adequately weighed the lay statements by family members against the factors cited by the medical examiner,and agreed with the medical examiner and the board that walker diagnosed hearing loss was more likely than not due to aging and recreational noise exposure,not to noise exposure during service.the veterans court decision did not refer to the possibility that walker could benefit from the provisions of b by way of continuity of symptomatology.walker request for a remand was denied on the ground that remand is unnecessary where it would result in additional burdens on the government with no benefit flowing to the veteran.walker timely appealed the final decision of the veterans court.the secretary of veterans affairs secretary opposes.
we have jurisdiction under,which authorizes this court to interpret regulations issued by the secretary.as will be explained below,this appeal requires us to interpret.b.
service connection is a term of art that is used in two ways,depending on the context in which the term is expressed.the term applies to the ultimate entitlement to disability compensation,after a veteran has satisfied the test or the test for entitlement to disability compensation for chronic diseases as set forth in b.the term is also sometimes used to refer to the second element of the test,namely that a disease or injury was incurred or aggravated while in service.the secretary has promulgated regulations on principles relating to service connection in,and in a,stating general principles of service connection,the term is used in both senses.service connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts,shown by evidence,establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the armed forces,or if preexisting such service,was aggravated therein emphasis added.subsection a also refers to each disabling condition for which a veteran seeks a service connection and states that d eterminations as to service connection will be based on review of the entire evidence of record.satisfaction of the test thus achieves service connection,in both senses,under a.as noted above,the ro,the board,and the veterans court measured walker claim for compensation under the test.we need not dwell further on a,however,because walker on appeal has waived any claim to entitlement under subsection a.
walker briefs on appeal,and his oral argument,reduce the appeal to a single question whether walker is entitled to a remand for consideration of service connection for his diagnosed hearing loss under b.the answer to this question requires interpretation of the term chronic disease as it appears in b.under walker interpretation of the term,he is entitled to the remand he requests.under the secretary interpretation,the veterans court correctly denied the remand request.we thus turn to subsection b of.
subsection b reads as follows 
b chronicity and continuity.with chronic disease shown as such in service or within the presumptive period under,so as to permit a finding of service connection,subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date,however remote,are service connected,unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.this does not mean that any manifestation of joint pain,any abnormality of heart action or heart sounds,any urinary findings of casts,or any cough,in service will permit service connection of arthritis,disease of the heart,nephritis,or pulmonary disease,first shown as a clearcut clinical entity,at some later date.for the showing of chronic disease in service there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity,and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time,as distinguished from merely isolated findings or a diagnosis including the word chronic.when the disease identity is established leprosy,tuberculosis,multiple sclerosis,there is no requirement of evidentiary showing of continuity.continuity of symptomatology is required only where the condition noted during service or in the presumptive period is not,in fact,shown to be chronic or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned.when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported,then a showing of continuity after discharge is required to support the claim.
unlike subsection a,which is not limited to any specific condition,subsection b restricts itself to chronic diseases.parsing through the language of the regulation,two situations are revealed.first,there is an explicit rule for when a chronic disease is shown in service or within the presumptive period under.
the regulation equates shown in service with a reliable diagnosis of the chronic disease while in service.mere use of the word chronic does not suffice.for a showing in service,there is required a combination of manifestations sufficient to identify the disease entity,and sufficient observation to establish chronicity at the time.the regulation is clear that any manifestation of a chronic disease,such as joint pain,will not permit service connection for the chronic disease associated with the manifestation,in that instance,arthritis.to be shown in service,the disease identity must be established and the diagnosis not be subject to legitimate question.
when a veteran satisfies the requirements for a chronic disease shown in service or within the presumptive period under,then all subsequent manifestations of the same chronic disease at any later date,however remote,are service connected,unless clearly attributable to intercurrent causes.thus if a veteran can prove a chronic disease shown in service,and there are no intercurrent causes,the manifestation of the chronic disease present at the time the veteran seeks benefits establishes service connection for the chronic disease.by treating all subsequent manifestations as service connected,the veteran is relieved of the requirement to show a causal relationship between the condition in service and the condition for which disability compensation is sought.in short,there is no nexus requirement for compensation for a chronic disease which was shown in service,so long as there is an absence of intercurrent causes to explain manifestations of the chronic disease.
subsection b provides a second route by which a veteran can establish service connection for a chronic disease.if evidence of a chronic condition is noted during service or during the presumptive period,but the chronic condition is not shown to be chronic,or where the diagnosis of chronicity may be legitimately questioned,when the fact of chronicity in service is not adequately supported,then a showing of continuity of symptomatology after discharge is required to support a claim for disability compensation for the chronic disease.proven continuity of symptomatology establishes the link,or nexus,between the current disease and serves as the evidentiary tool to confirm the existence of the chronic disease while in service or a presumptive period during which existence in service is presumed 
walker contends that the veterans court failed to apply the correct law to his case when it denied him a remand to assess the evidence of continuity of symptomatology of his bilateral hearing loss.although there is no evidence of record of a diagnosis of bilateral hearing loss during service,walker argues that bilateral hearing loss was noted in service by his wife and son and he has presented evidence of continuity of symptomatology following discharge to link his currently diagnosed bilateral hearing loss with the hearing loss condition noted in service.walker asserts that the term chronic disease in b should be interpreted to apply to any disease that ordinarily would be considered chronic in the medical arts.walker cites dorland ilustrated med.dictionary ed a chronic disease is a disease persisting over a long period of time.further,walker cites the definition in the secretary manual for developing claims for service connection for chronic or tropical diseases,part iv,subpart ii,chapter,section h a chronic disease is a disease of prolonged duration,producing incapacitating symptoms of varying degree that may undergo remission,and that is seldom entirely cured with all residuals of damage being completely eradicated.based on these definitions of chronic disease,walker maintains that his father hearing loss qualifies for assessment as a chronic disease under b.
the secretary does not disagree with the ordinary definitions of chronic disease offered by walker.the secretary first points to,where congress specified that t he term chronic disease includes specifically named chronic diseases and such other chronic diseases as the secretary may add to this list.further,the secretary points to a,which sets forth a specific list of chronic diseases that includes those identified in the statute.the secretary emphasizes that bilateral hearing loss is not on the statutory list of chronic diseases,nor is it included in the list of chronic diseases set firth in a.the secretary thus concludes that every chronic disease is persistent or,but not every persistent or disease is a chronic disease for purposes of b.
instead,the secretary interprets b to have selected out of the complete range of potential chronic diseases,specific ones that qualify for assessment under b.the only chronic diseases that qualify for assessment under b,according to the secretary,are those listed in a.because bilateral hearing loss is undeniably not listed in a,the secretary maintains that walker can not have access to b.the secretary interpretative analysis considers b in the context of a and a,in the light of the interlinkage of those regulations.
section a deals with presumptive service connection.as noted above,a veteran is not denied service connection in either of the two senses simply because there is no evidence of record of any kind of a chronic disease while in service.where a veteran can show manifestation of a chronic disease to a degree of percent or more within stated time periods,a presumes that the veteran incurred the disease in service,thus establishing service connection in the narrower sense.to achieve service connection in the broader,ultimate,sense,the veteran carries the presumption of service incurrence of a chronic disease back to b.if the chronic disease was shown well diagnosed beyond question in the presumptive period,b eliminates the nexus requirement on the basis of the current manifestation of the chronic disease,unless intercurrent causes undermine the automatic connection between the in service showing and the present condition.the secretary correctly notes that a veteran seeking ultimate service connection under b on account of a presumptive service connection can only do so for the chronic diseases that are named in a,because a states n o condition other than one listed in a will be considered chronic.
the same linkage exists between a and a in the situation where the veteran can not establish a chronic disease shown in the presumptive period for purposes of b but can point to a chronic condition that was noted in the presumptive period but the notation was insufficient to support a diagnosis beyond legitimate question.in that instance,the veteran can benefit from continuity of symptomatology to establish service connection in the ultimate sense,but only if his chronic disease is one listed in a.
the secretary recognizes that there is no explicit cross reference to a stated in b.walker relies on the lack of such an express linkage to support his view that b applies to any disease that wo
