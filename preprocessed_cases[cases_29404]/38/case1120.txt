in consolidated appeals and,grisel arias,marco burgos,suzanne burgos,pedro sarduy,idania arias,dalia landrove,and michael iheagwara appeal their convictions for conspiracy and other crimes relating to a scheme to defraud the medicare program.with the exception of dalia landrove,each also appeals the sentence imposed by the district court 
background 
the scheme to defraud medicare involved the collusion of doctors and physicians assistants,pharmacists,recruited patients,and durable medical equipment dme companies the alleged head of the scheme,jose arias who was charged in the initial indictment,and subsequently pled guilty to the conspiracy count and cooperated with the government incorporated several of the dme companies and owned two clinics,first option diagnostic center and first option medical center.the scheme operated as follows.the dme companies paid recruiters to locate persons to serve as patients.these recruited patients were paid to visit arias clinics,where doctors or physician assistants falsely certified diagnoses.the principal diagnosis in the scheme was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd,a disease whose symptoms include shortness of breath,coughs,and decreased exercise capability.once the false diagnosis was made,a certificate of medical necessity cmn was signed by a doctor stating that the medicare beneficiary required certain medical equipment and respiratory medication.the cmn acted as a prescription for the required medicine and equipment.the cmns were then sent to the dme companies,which billed medicare for the unnecessary medical equipment and respiratory medications,particularly certain aerosol medications supplied by the pharmacies.as part of the scheme,the pharmacies supplied compounded respiratory aerosol medications to the dme companies.compounding is a pharmacy procedure in which a pharmacist makes medication by mixing several raw materials at the pharmacy.compounded medications are rarely prescribed by doctors and,according to expert testimony,should only be provided to a patient when specifically prescribed.however,the pharmacies involved in the scheme almost always provided compounded aerosol medications,even though,aerosol medications were available 
the dme companies participating in the scheme ostensibly procured the medication from the pharmacies on behalf of the patients,often obtaining the patient medications in mass quantity,bringing stacks of prescriptions to the pharmacies once a month sometimes the dme companies delivered the respiratory medications to patients in other instances,the dme company never delivered the medication to the patient.additionally,the pharmacies at times delivered only half the patients medication to the dme companies.in some instances,the pharmacies provided only labels and invoices to the dme companies,rather than any actual medication.
defendants grisel arias,idania arias,and dalia landrove operated dme companies involved in the scheme.idania arias also owned and operated billing company,through which all medicare claims from the dme companies were processed.pedro sarduy was a doctor at first option medical center,where he allegedly falsely diagnosed the patients with copd.marco and suzanne burgos,who were married during the time of the conspiracy,operated south beach pharmacy and la moderna pharmacy,two of the pharmacies supplying the aerosol medications to the fraudulent dme companies.michael iheagwara was a of la moderna before leaving to create maz pharmacy.iheagwara and suzanne burgos were both pharmacists.
ii.discussion 
as noted earlier,jose arias,the alleged head of the scheme,pled guilty and cooperated with the government,although he did not testify at trial.after a joint trial before a jury,the appellants were convicted we consider all of the arguments of each appellant in turn,but engage in an extended discussion regarding only michael iheagwara and pedro sarduy 
grisel arias 
grisel arias argues that her conviction should be reversed because the evidence was not sufficient to support her conviction her confrontation clause rights were violated when the court refused to permit her to a government witness who pled guilty to an unrelated drug charge subsequent to testifying in this case the government withheld exculpatory evidence in violation of brady maryland,d the district court erred in denying her requested continuance when a superseding indictment was issued one month before trial and the court erroneously refused to give a requested jury instruction pertaining to the evidence that she had acted in good faith and not with fraudulent intent.she also argues that her sentence should be vacated because in calculating her guideline sentence,the district court incorrectly calculated the loss attributable to her.
we have carefully considered the record and find no merit to any of these contentions.first,the evidence was clearly sufficient to support her conviction.without cataloguing each piece of evidence against grisel arias,we note that the government submitted documents establishing that grisel arias was the original president and incorporator of two dme companies involved in the fraud scheme,bird road medical services and,subsequently,new advanced medical equipment corporation on the evidence presented,the jury could have concluded that these companies were not conducting any legitimate transactions.grisel authorized medicare provider application forms for both these dme companies.although she alleged that some signatures were forged,the jury was entitled to determine that the documents were authentic.additionally,carlos amador,a la moderna pharmacy technician who pled guilty to the conspiracy,testified that grisel would come to the la moderna facility a t least once a month during the year he worked there,and that she picked up prescriptions of aerosol medications from him at the pharmacy 
second,the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the recall of amador or the introduction of documents relating to the drug charge against him.the sole purpose in seeking further testimony from amador was impeachment,the questioning would have been cumulative of that already permitted during cross examination,and amador had represented that he would simply invoke his fifth amendment privilege if recalled third,grisel arias did not have a valid brady claim,because when viewed in context,the purported contradictions between jose arias sentencing testimony and the prosecution pretrial letter describing his statements are not material.fourth,in this complex case,the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying grisel a continuance after the second superseding indictment included additional details concerning the dme new advanced medical equipment corporation the government had previously disclosed new advanced materials during discovery,and the superseding indictment did not add new charges or alter the theory of prosecution.fifth,the district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing grisel request for a good faith instruction,as there is no foundation in the evidence for such an instruction finally,the district court did not err in calculating the amount of loss attributable to a jointly undertaken criminal activity,each defendant is responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.a b.
idania arias 
idania arias argues that the district court erred by refusing to admit evidence to support her defense that she was completely subservient to her husband,jose arias,and therefore unable to formulate the mens rea for the crime and by refusing to dismiss the money laundering charge against her,where there existed a fatal variance between the crime charged in the indictment and the proof at trial.regarding her sentence,she argues that the district court should have ordered a psychiatric evaluation after her counsel represented that she was unable to meaningfully assist in preparing for sentencing.
the district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding idania expert witness.in order to be admissible,the expert evidence must establish that idania was not able to form the mens rea for the crime however,idania expert witness provided evidence of justification,not lack of mens rea.nor did the district court abuse its discretion by excluding idania other evidence regarding subservience,based on its determination that the evidence was not relevant the court did not err in refusing to dismiss the money laundering charge against idania.the facts proved at trial did not deviate materially from the language of the indictment,and bank records provided by the government in discovery sufficiently notified idania that facts relating to medicos marketing transactions would be included in the money laundering case.finally,after hearing testimony from idania treating psychiatrist at fdc miami,the district court had adequate information to evaluate idania mental condition,and did not abuse its discretion in denying further psychiatric evaluation before sentencing.
dalia landrove 
dalia landrove argues that the district court erred by failing to remove a juror for cause or to inquire more thoroughly into that juror ability to be fair and impartial,and by allowing the prosecution to characterize her tax returns as fraudulent with no evidentiary basis.we find that the district court inquiry into this juror misconduct was well within the court discretion,and that the prosecution use of landrove tax returns can not be deemed a harmful error.
suzanne burgos 
suzanne burgos argues that the evidence was not sufficient to support her conviction that the district court erred by admitting certain extrinsic evidence and by treating an inspector audit as intrinsic rather than extrinsic evidence and that the district court should not have instructed the jury on deliberate ignorance.burgos also argues that in determining her guideline range for sentencing,the district court incorrectly calculated the loss attributable to her.
after careful review of the record,we find that the evidence was sufficient to support the jury conclusion that suzanne burgos knowingly participated in the conspiracy.documentary evidence established that suzanne was a corporate officer of both la moderna pharmacy and south beach pharmacy,and several witnesses testified that suzanne was involved in hiring personnel for those pharmacies,including personnel whose work involved filling the fraudulent aerosol prescriptions.mary ghabrial,who worked as a managing pharmacist at la moderna and was not charged with any wrongdoing,testified that suzanne burgos was manager of the pharmacists at these pharmacies and always made it a point to know what was going on in each pharmacy she called at the end of the day to get the sales and how many prescriptions in her daily reports to suzanne,ghabrial was required to report aerosol sales separately.
ghabrial further testified that although she was hired to supervise only the prescription area at la moderna,which did not include the aerosol compounding section,she became aware that significant quantities of aerosol medication were nonetheless being dispensed with la moderna labels,often with ghabrial initials as dispensing pharmacist,without her supervision.ghabrial testified that she informed suzanne burgos about this.additionally,according to ghabrial testimony,areta ruiz,a pharmacy technician,was dispensing aerosol medication from peripheral dme,a dme company located next door to and affiliated with la moderna,with no apparent pharmacist supervision,as is required by law.on cross examination,ghabrial testified that ruiz reported to either marco or suzanne burgos.additionally,ghabrial testified that janeide reguiero,a pharmacy technician at south beach pharmacy,told ghabrial that suzanne burgos knew that reguiero was filling aerosol prescription vials with incorrect volumes of medication.in light of the evidence establishing the substantial fraudulent aerosol business ongoing at both la moderna and south beach pharmacies the jury was entitled to infer that suzanne burgos,a licensed pharmacist whom evidence established was active in managing both the personnel and activities of both pharmacies,was a knowing participant in the fraudulent conspiracy 
similarly,the district court did not err by instructing the jury on deliberate ignorance,as there was evidence to support an inference that suzanne burgos,through her role at south beach and la moderna pharmacies,was aware of facts that should have put her on notice of the fraudulent activity,but deliberately insulated herself from positive knowledge.the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting extrinsic evidence or by allowing agent cesar arias to testify about his audit of la moderna and south beach pharmacies,as the audit represented intrinsic evidence that the pharmacies had purported to sell more product during the time period of the conspiracy than the volume of supplies they purchased would have allowed.
as to suzanne burgos sentence,the district court did not err in calculating the amount of loss attributable to suzanne a jointly undertaken criminal activity,each defendant is responsible for all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity.a b.
micheal iheagwara 
michael iheagwara,a licensed pharmacist,incorporated two pharmacies that were allegedly involved in the fraud scheme,la moderna and,later,maz pharmacy.he argues that his conviction for conspiracy must be vacated because the district court erred in finding that rule of the federal rules of evidence did not apply to criminal proceedings and thus erroneously admitted evidence arising from a state administrative complaint against him.the administrative complaint at issue was brought by the florida department of health against maz pharmacy.in his representative capacity as an owner of maz pharmaceuticals,iheagwara signed a statement in response to the complaint wherein he agreed to i admit as true the allegations made in the administrative complaint and ii permit the department of health to enter a fine and final order in order to avoid more formal administrative proceedings and the potential penalties arising therefrom.the district court overruled iheagwara objection to the admission of the statement,holding that rule did not bar its admission because rule does not apply to criminal proceedings.
rule provides that e vidence of furnishing a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim which was disputed as to either validity or amount,is not admissible to prove liability for or invalidity of the claim or its amount.our sister circuits are divided on the question of whether rule applies to criminal cases the second,sixth,and seventh circuits have held that the rule applies only in civil cases,while the fifth and tenth circuits have held it applicable in both civil and criminal cases.compare,manko united states,cir holding rule inapplicable in criminal cases,united states logan,cir same,and united states prewitt,cir same,with united states hays,cir holding that rule prevents the introduction of settlement agreements in a criminal proceeding and united states bailey,cir same.while we note the division of eminent authorities on this issue,we are persuaded that rule applies to both criminal and civil proceedings.
first,the plain language of rule b renders each of the federal rules of rule applicable to criminal cases and proceedings.b these rules apply generally to civil actions and proceedings,including admiralty and maritime cases,and to criminal cases and proceedings see also,united states meadows,cir w e assume the applicability of rule to govern the admission of related civil settlement negotiations in a criminal trial.furthermore,where the drafters of the rules intended to prevent the application of a particular rule to criminal cases,they provided so expressly.see bailey,at citing.b as indicating that the drafters of the rules knew how to expressly exclude criminal proceedings from the rules application when they wanted to.where the drafters of rule did not expressly preclude application of rule to criminal cases,we are reluctant to construe that decision as inadvertent.while some courts have read the rule use of the terms claim and validity to imply that rule was meant to apply only to civil cases,see,prewitt,at,we find the structure of the rules and the express command of rule b more compelling.
second,the last sentence of rule specifically states that the rule does not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose,such as proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.indeed,the advisory committee notes explain that evidence of an effort to buy off the prosecution or a prosecuting witness in a criminal case provides one example of evidence that is generally subject to rule,but that is rendered admissible by the rule last sentence,advisory committee note proposed rules emphasis added.if the drafters of rule intended the rule to apply solely in civil cases,there would be no occasion to carve out an exception for certain circumstances in criminal cases,much less to add an advisory note directly concerning the rule effect in criminal cases.see united states skeddle,see also state gano,hawaii,holding that parallel state rule of evidence applied to criminal cases,because constru ing the rule as applying only in civil proceedings would render the final sentence of the rule unnecessary.
third,applying rule to criminal cases furthers the policy interests that undergird the rule.the advisory committee notes clarify that there are two justifications for the exclusions that rule requires i the evidence is irrelevant,as the compromise at issue may have been motivated by a desire for peace rather than any concession as to the merits of the party position and ii the exclusion promotes settlement of disputes,advisory committee note proposed rules.it is that a defendant in a civil suit is far less likely to offer to settle a claim if evidence of that offer can later be introduced to prove criminal liability for the same conduct.limiting rule to civil proceedings thus undermines the public policy in favor of compromise that the rule aims to further.moreover,while the second circuit has found that the interest in accurate determinations in criminal trials outweighs the interest in promoting civil settlements,this rationale overlooks a basic premise underlying rule evidence of compromise is not necessarily probative of liability.indeed,the advisory committee notes indicate that evidence of a settlement offer is often irrelevant to liability for the charged conduct,because the settlement offer may be motivated by a desire for peace rather than from any concession of weakness of position,advisory committee note proposed rules.in this light,permitting the admission of civil settlement offers in subsequent criminal prosecutions actually compromises the accuracy of the jury determination.as the fifth circuit explained,i t does not tax the imagination to envision the juror who retires to deliberate with the notion that,if the defendants had done nothing wrong,they would not have paid the money back.united states hays,cir see also,bailey,at discussing the dramatic effect that evidence of an admission of liability could have upon a criminal defendant gano,at t he potential impact of evidence regarding a civil settlement agreement is even more profound in criminal proceedings than it is in civil proceedings.
for these reasons,we join the fifth and tenth circuits in holding that rule applies to both civil and criminal proceedings.it follows that the evidence and testimony at issue was inadmissible under rule,and that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the evidence see koon united states,d a district court by definition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.
however,a error is harmless if,viewing the proceedings in their entirety,a court determines that the error did not affect the verdict,or had but very slight effect.see united states magluta,cir internal marks omitted see also kotteakos united states.here,as we detail below,the government presented overwhelming evidence of iheagwara knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy.therefore,we find that the admission of iheagwara statement was merely cumulative and did not affect the verdict.
the government presented evidence that iheagwara incorporated both la moderna pharmacy a for pharmacy,which he with marco burgos,and maz pharmacy.pharmacy technician odalys regil,who pled guilty and cooperated with the prosecution,testified that iheagwara hired her to work at la moderna and trained her to compound the aerosol medication,and also described la moderna standard procedures for compounding the aerosol medication under iheagwara direction.according to regil,she and iheagwara did not accurately weigh the chemicals mixed in the compounds haphazardly dispensed the medication into individual dosage vials,often ignoring the amount specified on the prescription did not clean the machine used to dispense medication into individual vials,so that it developed a green fungus in the dispensing hoses allowed a night crew to label the medication,unsupervised by a pharmacist and would print dates on medication labels that did not match the actual date dispensed as they should.the jury could reasonably conclude that these egregious violations indicate iheagwara knowledge that he was manufacturing and dispensing medication only to create a facade of legitimacy for the fraud scheme,and not to actually serve sick patients.
additionally,regil testified that while she worked at la moderna,she and iheagwara sold half portions of medicine to jose arias,and that the two also sold unaffixed labels to jose arias on the side,receiving a cash payment which they shared.later,regil and iheagwara left la moderna,at which point they opened a dme company to continue the scheme,and iheagwara established maz pharmacy.mercedes jerez,who worked at sunshine medical dme and also pled guilty in the case,testified that maz pharmacy would sell sunshine labels unaffixed to medication,as well as labels backdated by several months.
special agent tony illas testified that the compounding area at maz pharmacy was sloppy,sticky,and filthy.illas also told the jury that maz pharmacy labels were seized pursuant to a search of billing and that the printed sheets contained prescription labels for patients from different months on the same sheet.these anomalous sheets provided evidence that the labels were not printed in conjunction with actual dispensations of medication to patients,but rather were generated simply to create an appearance of legitimacy in the records.maz pharmacy labels seized during a search of first option medical center similarly included different months on the same printed sheet.
additionally,investigator louis collado testified that when they visited maz pharmacy,he found pre and aerosol medication prepared for dispensal the pharmaceutical orders contained only half the contents indicated on the labels.the testimony of agent cesar arias corroborates collado testimony.finally,while we have specifically described only the evidence implicating iheagwara individually,we note that the government presented overwhelming evidence that a fraud conspiracy existed,generally.because the substantial evidence incriminating iheagwara assures us that the erroneous admission of the statement was harmless,we affirm iheagwara conviction and sentence 
pedro sarduy 
pedro sarduy,a medical doctor who worked at the first option medical center,was convicted of conspiracy based on the government allegations that he participated in the fraud scheme by certifying false diagnoses of copd.sarduy argues that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury on his defense of withdrawal from the conspiracy,because there was sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that he withdrew from the conspiracy more than five years before the government charged him.if the jury accepted his withdrawal defense,the statute of limitations would preclude conviction.thus,he claims the district court erred by refusing to correctly instruct the jury on this defense,and that his conviction must be reversed.
a criminal defendant has the right to a jury instruction on his theory of d
