an administrative law judge alj denied howard application for social security disability benefits,finding that howard was not disabled because she could perform a significant number of jobs in the economy despite her impairments.the appeals council denied howard request for review,leaving the alj decision as the final decision of the social security commissioner commissioner.
howard sought review of the commissioner final decision in district court pursuant to g,resulting in the district court affirming the commissioner decision.howard appeals.we have jurisdiction pursuant to and g.
howard argues that the district court erred when it upheld the commissioner finding that she was not disabled and could perform a significant number of jobs in the economy.in the alternative,howard brings a motion to remand under sentence six of g.we deny the motion but reverse and remand on the merits.
we apply the same standard of review as the district court and will uphold the commissioner decision if it is supported by substantial evidence.willbanks sec y of health and human,cir.substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.richardson perales,d.
howard social security disability determination is made in accordance with a five step sequential analysis.first,howard must demonstrate that she is not currently engaged in substantial gainful employment at the time of the disability application.b.second,howard must show that she suffers from a severe impairment.c.third,if howard is not engaged in substantial gainful employment and has a severe impairment which is expected to last for at least twelve months,which meets or equals a listed impairment,she will be considered disabled without regard to age,education,and work experience.d.fourth,if the commissioner can not make a determination of disability based on medical evaluations and current work activity and howard has a severe impairment,the commissioner will then review howard residual functional capacity rfc and relevant past work to determine if she can do past work if so,she is not disabled.e.the alj determined that the first four parts did not entitle howard to disability benefits,so this case turns on the fifth if howard impairment prevents her from doing past work,the commissioner will consider her rfc,age,education and past work experience to determine if she can perform other work.if she can not perform other work,the commissioner will find her disabled.f.the commissioner has the burden of proof only on the fifth step,proving that there is work available in the economy that the claimant can perform.her comm r of soc,cir.
to meet the burden of showing that howard could perform work that is available in the national economy,the commissioner must make a finding supported by substantial evidence that howard has the vocational qualifications to perform specific jobs.varley sec y of health human,cir.this kind of s ubstantial evidence may be produced through reliance on the testimony of a vocational expert ve in response to a hypothetical question,but only if the question accurately portrays howard individual physical and mental impairments.id.citations omitted.
taking into account howard rfc,age,education,past work experience,and the testimony of the vocational expert ve,the alj determined that howard was able to perform other work and was,therefore,not disabled.howard argues that substantial evidence does not support this determination.
howard first argues that substantial evidence does not support the alj conclusion that she could perform other work because the alj formulation of the rfc and the hypothetical question posed to the ve do not accurately portray her individual physical and mental impairments.
the alj posed two hypothetical questions to the ve.in the first,he asked whether there were any jobs in the region for a person with the limitations testified to by howard.the ve answered that there were not.the alj then discounted howard pain testimony and relied upon four exhibits in the record to formulate a second hypothetical question.the alj asked the ve whether a person with such characteristics would be able to perform the full ranges of light,medium,and heavy unskilled work.the ve responded that a majority of the jobs in all exertional levels could still be performed by such a person and proceeded to identify several specific jobs and the number of openings for those jobs in the region.the alj determination of howard rfc is,in substance,the same as this second hypothetical question.
howard rfc is to be an assessment of her remaining capacity for work once her limitations have been taken into account.it is an assessment of what howard can and can not do,not what she does and does not suffer from.the hypothetical question posed to a ve for purposes of determining whether howard can perform other work,on the other hand,should be a more complete assessment of her physical and mental state and should include an accurate portray al of her individual physical and mental impairment s.varley,at myers weinberger,cir per curiam.thus,while the rfc should focus on howard abilities or,in other words,what howard can and can not do,the hypothetical question should focus on howard overall state including howard mental and physical maladies.
taking into account the purpose of the rfc,we first address whether the alj description of howard rfc accurately reflects howard abilities.if it does,then the alj conclusion,inasmuch as it relies upon the rfc,is supported by substantial evidence.howard contends that the rfc is not supported by substantial evidence because it does not accurately recount her physical and emotional problems.this argument misstates the purpose of the rfc.while we acknowledge that howard maladies should inform an assessment of her abilities,this does not mean that the rfc must enumerate them.
the alj relied upon four exhibits when he formulated howard rfc.exhibit is a march,medical report from one of her physicians,levin.the rfc,with one exception,accurately reflects levin conclusions about howard abilities.the one exception is that the rfc states that howard is able to squat and climb stairs while the report upon which the alj relied for this part of the rfc states that it is harder for howard to squat and climb when her low back pain is significant.while it would have been more accurate to include this finding in the rfc,this oversight,if it can be called that,is not so significant as to justify a finding that this part of the rfc is not supported by substantial evidence.
exhibit is a medical report prepared by levin and submitted to the michigan department of social services on february.the portion of the rfc taken from exhibit does not accurately reflect either the contents of the exhibit or howard abilities.in exhibit,levin opines that,because of her hypertension and panic attacks,howard should never be exposed to the following working conditions u nprotected h eights,m oving m achinery,n oise and v ibration,e xtreme t emperatures,d ust,f umes and g ases.the alj relies on this exhibit to support his conclusion that howard has no vocationally significant problem due to high blood pressure,when the exhibit states exactly the opposite.
in his decision,the alj states that he is not bound by levin grossly restrictive conclusions in this exhibit because there are no clinical or laboratory findings in the record to substantiate them.this is not the case.the medical report in exhibit asks the doctor to make findings based on his clinical evaluation other test results.thus,it would appear that levin believed that his opinion was so based,at least in part.this assumption is substantiated by levin treatment notes in exhibit.these notes document levin findings from eighteen visits by howard between march,and july,and they include laboratory test results and numerous prescription authorizations.
provided that they are based on sufficient medical data,t he medical opinions and diagnoses of treating physicians are generally accorded substantial deference,and if the opinions are uncontradicted,complete deference.harris heckler,cir.levin
