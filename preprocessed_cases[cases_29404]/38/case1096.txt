one day jorge leal,a urological clinician and surgeon,was waiting for the operating room at cape canaveral hospital in cocoa beach,florida to become available.it was,as the doctor would later describe it,a very long day.and not a good one for him.instead,it appears that,like alexander in the classic children story,leal was having a terrible,horrible,no good,very bad day.and at around,he was told that his use of the operating room was going to be delayed for minutes as it turned out.apparently,that was the final straw for him.
what leal did after he was told that he would have to wait to use the operating room led the hospital to suspend his clinical privileges for a period of sixty days and to file a report explaining why.to summarize,in colloquial terms,that report description of leal conduct he pitched a fit.more specifically,the hospital reported that leal became so enraged that he broke a telephone,he shattered the glass on a copy machine,he shoved a metal cart into the doors of the operating suite so hard that it damaged one of them,he threw jelly beans down the hallway in the surgical suite,he flung a medical chart to the ground when a nurse asked him for written authorization to proceed with surgery,and he verbally abused a nurse manager by raising his voice,using profanity,and calling her a liar.according to the report,leal violent and unprofessional actions on that occasion caused various members of the nursing and technical staff to announce that they were fearful of working with him in the future.
the hospital filed its report of the adverse action taken against leal with the secretary of the department of health human services,as it felt compelled to do under the health care quality improvement act,et.the secretary included the report in the national practitioner data bank,which was set up under the act to collect and release certain information relating to the professional competence and conduct of physicians,dentists and other health care practitioners.
leal was unhappy enough about the suspension,and he certainly did not want a report of it in the national practitioner data bank where other hospitals would have access to it.see a.he sought the secretary review of the report,arguing that it was not factually accurate,and he asked that the report be removed from the data bank because the hospital action against him was not of the type that should be reported.the secretary rejected leal assertion that the report was not factually accurate.relying on documents submitted by leal as part of his request for secretarial review,the secretary concluded that the report accurately described the hospital action and reasons for action as stated in the hospital decision documents.the secretary also refused leal demand to remove the report,explaining that t here is no basis on which to conclude that the report should not have been filed in the data bank.he did allow leal to file a response,a copy of which would be given to anyone who obtained the report itself from the data bank.not happy with that outcome,leal filed an action under the administrative procedure act seeking a court order requiring the secretary to remove the report from the data bank.the district court entered a judgment denying relief,and this is leal appeal.

in the health care quality improvement act,congress directed the secretary of the department of health human services to promulgate regulations establishing procedures in the case of disputed accuracy of the information in the national practitioner data bank.under those regulations,a physician who disputes the accuracy of a report can seek secretarial review,see c,which is limited to having the report reviewed for accuracy of factual information and to ensure that the information was required to be reported.dep t of health human,national practitioner data bank guidebook,guidebook see also christensen harris,explaining that interpretations contained in enforcement guidelines get skidmore deference.
under the regulations,when a physician seeks secretarial review of a report the secretary review s the written information submitted by both parties.c see also guidebook,at explaining that a physician challenging a report factual accuracy must s ubmit documentation substantiating that the reporting entity information is inaccurate.and that happened in this case.to show that the report was not factually accurate,leal submitted his own affidavits in which he gave his version of the events that led the hospital to suspend his clinical privileges.according to those affidavits,he accidentally broke a telephone when he tripped on its long cord he closed the lid of a copy machine with some force and the glass cracked he moved a metal cart that was blocking the doors of the operating suite he ate jelly beans,some of which may have fallen on the floor when he tried to throw away flavors that he did not like and when he was handed a medical chart by a nurse some of the chart loose papers fell to the floor.in other words,this urological surgeon,who earns his living wielding a scalpel on some of the most delicate parts of the body,does not have a bad is just clumsy.leal did admit in his affidavits,however,that he had on that occasion spoken sternly to a nurse who incorrectly told him that his patient was not cleared for surgery.leal also submitted to the secretary letters from the hospital administrators to him formally stating that in the best interests of patient care his clinical privileges were suspended due to his violent,threatening and physically destructive and damaging behavior.based on that documentation,the secretary determined that the hospital report was factually accurate in the relevant sense.
leal challenges the secretary finding.it is his position that a report is factually accurate only if the administrative record includes statements from eyewitnesses that substantiate the information in a hospital report about a doctor misconduct.without that requirement,he contends that a hospital could unfairly blacklist a physician by filing a report in the data bank based on conduct that never occurred.because the hospital did not submit statements from eyewitnesses to back up what it said about him,leal argues that it was arbitrary and capricious for the secretary to find that the report was accurate.
leal position misunderstands the purpose of the data bank and the scope of the secretary review.congress enacted the health care quality improvement act,which led to the creation of the data bank,after finding that there was a national need to restrict the ability of incompetent physicians to move from state to state without disclosure or discovery of the physician previous damaging or incompetent performance.the data bank prevents a physician who applies to become a member of a hospital medical staff or for clinical privileges from being able to hide disciplinary actions that have been taken against him.see id.a requiring a hospital to request information from the data bank about a physician when the physician applies to be on the medical staff or for clinical privileges.information in the data bank is intended only to alert health care entities that there may be a problem with a particular practitioner professional competence or conduct because the practitioner has been the subject of a disciplinary action.guidebook,at see also id.at explaining that the principal pur
